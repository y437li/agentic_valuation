All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2014 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Cognizant's first quarter revenue came in right where we guided at $2.42 billion, a sequential increase of 2.8% and an increase of 19.9% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin at 20.8% was higher than our target range for the quarter. So, this morning, I will provide an overview of our performance, the demand environment and the long-term outlook before turning the call over to Gordon and Karen to provide further details on the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. We remained confident in the overall demand environment and in our revenue guidance of at least $10.3 billion, which translates to growth of at least 16.5% for the year and we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS outlook for the full year 2014. Our Q1 performance reflected the strength of our portfolio across industries, services and geographies. Our investments in Europe and SMAC yielded good results and counted some softness in parts of the North American market, which Gordon will address in his comment in a few minute. Based on our client discussions and our sales pipeline, we expect to have a strong year. We have ramped up hiring across many of our service lines and we continue to invest in growth. I am optimistic because the fundamentals of the business remains strong, an increasing number of CEOs around the world are asking questions about how new technologies can be leveraged to build competitive advantage. Technology is clearly a CEO level agenda item today. You know we have spoken to you before about being in the midst of once in a decade shift in the technology landscape, driven by things like social, mobile, analytics, cloud and other digital technologies. That technologies are redefining industries and their prevalence is throwing up vast amount of rich data and information around people, devices and organizations. At Cognizant we call this digital information the Code Halo, extracting information from Code Halos and using that for driving strategy and new business models has become the basis for competitive advantage in many industries. We have recently published detail findings of -- from our research and our client engagements on Code Halo and this has served as an additional catalyst for our digital business offerings. But even as companies build new models for a digital economy, we have to stay focused on their core business by driving greater efficiency and building scale in their existing operations. It\u2019s typically the core business that provides the resources to invest in new systems, processes and business models that will create market differentiation and fuel growth. The two simultaneous trends are what we call the dual-mandate will continue to drive market demand for the rest of 2014 and into nest year. Let me explain this in some more detail. First, what clients are looking to run better by becoming more efficient, we continue to see demand for our core application, IT infrastructure and outsourcing services. CIOs and other business leaders are demanding better performance and cost effectiveness. They often need talent, smooth and processes to further optimize areas of their operations that are mature and standardized. The second part of the dual-mandate is where clients are looking to run different by re-imagining and redesigning part or all of their business models. This is fueling demand for Cognizant business consulting and many of our Horizon 3 offerings related SMAC. As client move legacy IT systems and applications to the cloud, we expect to see more demand for these services. Demand will also come from new applications, services and products to build around the SMAC stack. The investments that we have made across are three horizons of services has put us in a strong position to address each of these different set of demand drivers. We have invested to build consulting services, industry-specific business knowledge and scalable model for technology and service operations, which combined with our culture of customer focus and entrepreneurial spirit have made us a strong partner for our clients. And with that, I will now hand it over to Gordon to share more about our performance and to Karen to provide financial details. I will be back for the Q&A. Gordon? Gordon Coburn : Thank you and good morning. We had a solid start to 2014. During the quarter, we accelerated our recruitment with 7,200 net hires. The strongest hiring we\u2019ve experienced in any quarter during the last two and a half years. This strong hiring is a testament to our continued confidence in the demand environment and our ability to continue to post industry-leading revenue growth. We are also pleased with our annualized attrition during the quarter, including BPO and trainees continued to trend down to 14.1 annualized. As mentioned in our prior earnings calls, we put in place a series of employee engagement programs that are paying off nicely. We achieved our Q1 growth and prior guidance despite facing some headwinds in North America. There is no single cause for these headwinds. Rather it was a confluence of several factors, none of which are particularly impactful or concerning on their own. There were major structural changes that took affect for many of our healthcare related clients at the beginning of the year. This contributed to a slow start in spending for the sector as they adjusted to changes, occurring both in the commercial market and through the Affordable Care Act. As an example, true consumption of healthcare services was down in January and February as people adjusted to the evolving healthcare reimbursement structure. In addition, a few of our clients experienced leadership transitions. When companies go to such transitions, they typically conduct a review of their strategic priorities and associated spending, which can delay some programs or cause a shift in balance of outsourcing and development work. And finally, there were some general economic and weather-related disruptions in the U.S. as we started the year that had some minor impact. Despite of this sluggishness in North America, we are generally pleased with the growth across most of our industry segments and the solid growth in Europe and rest of world. We remain well positioned to harness opportunities in this dynamic market environment. Our confidence stems with strength across all three of our growth horizons, driven by our investments and differentiated value proposition. Within Horizon 1, we saw good traction particularly in consulting and technology services due to the ramp up of deals we won in the latter part of 2013. Specifically, we saw good traction in testing, enterprise application services, a complex development projects. Across Horizon 1, in addition to helping clients run better, we are clearly enabling clients to run different or to re-imagine and redesign their businesses to deal with the broad secular technology driven shifts across their industries. As an example of a recent Horizon 1 win, Cognizant entered into a multi-year agreement with a leading biotech company to support its information systems organization and meet and needs of its expanded product lines and geographic footprint. We will provide a application maintenances to support services across the entire life scientist value chain from research and development and manufacturing in supply chain to commercial operations and other enterprise solutions. Within Horizon 2, we continue to see good traction across business consulting, business process services and IT infrastructure services. Cognizant Business Consulting or CBC saw strong quarter. We are increasingly incorporating consulting advisory work as a key driver for larger transformational deals. For example, recently CBC brought thought leadership and served as the lead business architect for a benefit adjudication monetization project at a large healthcare payer. Cognizant Solution will provide core adjudication functionality to support the client\u2019s next-generation products. This is an example of how we are building stronger and more strategic partnerships with our clients. Our BPS practice continues to show healthy growth driven by cross-selling or vertically align business process solutions into our existing customer base as well as winning new logos. Ongoing investments in financial services at healthcare have recently resulted in a number of strategic wins, including work in claims and end-to-end back office processing and new business underwriting in property, casualty insurance. Mortgage services in banking at pharmacovigilance services in life sciences. IT infrastructure services also had a good quarter with wins across multiple industries including insurance, banking, healthcare and retail. Our ITIS value proposition of simplifying, optimizing and automating our client\u2019s IT infrastructure is compelling and is allowing us to capture client demand for integrated deals such as applications plus infrastructure and a shift towards new enterprise IT models aligned with the SMAC stack. The three subsegments within Horizon 3. New technology architecture is driven by SMAC. New delivery and markets such as -- new industry and markets such as public sector and new delivery models that drive non-linearity continue to gain traction. Awareness and investment in SMAC has clearly gone mainstream across most of the industries we serve and is an investment priority for many of our clients. Our ability to offer clients an integrated value proposition by combining the capabilities across the three horizons of our business is emerging as a critical differentiator for Cognizant in the marketplace. From an industry perspective, our Bank and Financial Services segment grew by 2.7% sequentially and 19.7% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in banking. The key drivers of growth in this industry span regulatory compliance, real-time risk monitoring, stress testing, and fraud and trade surveillance. In addition, as indicated in prior quarters, our Financial Services clients are embracing SMAC driven solutions for strategic differentiation and growth. Healthcare, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical and medical device clients was relatively flat sequentially, but up 20.8% year-over-year. While our payer clients are looking for ways to get cost under control, as we have discussed in the past, a number of our key pharmaceutical clients are going through challenges related to the patent cliff and their drug pipelines. Despite these business challenges, we are seeing these clients becoming more active around multi-channel marketing and utility-based cloud solutions, supporting everything from clinical trials to commercial operations. This is partially offsetting some of the short-term sluggishness that I mentioned earlier due to the uncertainty in the healthcare market. We continue to further strengthen our leadership position in the healthcare space. During the quarter, IDC positioned Cognizant as a leader in life sciences solutions for IT and BPO services and for strategic consulting. These services span the entire life sciences value chain including research and development, manufacturing and supply chain, and sales and marketing. Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 4.4% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year. Retail showed a nice sequential improvement following the soft holiday season. Manufacturing and Logistics benefited from client demand to enhance supply chain management. Our other segment, which includes communications, information, media and entertainment, and high tech also recovered 6.3% growth sequentially and 18% growth year-over-year primarily driven by technology and telecommunications. Finally, we continue to broaden our portfolio with tuck-in acquisitions. We just completed a small acquisition of a digital video solutions company, itaas, which will help extend and complement our existing capabilities serving the communications, media, and high technology industries. The expanded capabilities will also support other industries such as banking, retail, and healthcare which are rolling out advanced customer and business platforms centered on video. From a geographic standpoint, North America had a slow start to the year growing 1% sequentially and 16.1% year-over-year. Europe overall grew 9.6% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. The U.K. saw a strong 12.8% sequential growth and 28.2% growth year-over-year, hitting the $1 billion run rate for the first time. The strength in U.K. revenue came from multiple clients across several industries, including financial services and high technology. Continental Europe saw 5.2% sequential growth and 46% growth year-over-year, partially attributed to our 2013 acquisitions. We are encouraged by the structural trends we\u2019ve seen over the year as clients are increasingly engaging us in larger multiyear programs spanning service lines. The rest of the world showed good sequential growth of 6.4% sequentially and 28.4% year-over-year. Before I hand the call over to Karen to comment on our financial performance and guidance, let me conclude by saying that I believe Cognizant is well positioned to benefit from client\u2019s need to simultaneously run better and run different. This is a direct result of the strategy we have followed since our initial IPO of investing for the long-term and evolving our capabilities and service offerings in anticipation of change in client demands. Now let me turn the call over to Karen to provide details on our numbers. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Gordon and good morning everyone. First quarter revenue of $2.42 billion represented growth of 2.8% sequentially and 19.9% over last year. Non-GAAP operating margins, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 20.8%, above our target range of 19% to 20%, while our GAAP operating margin was 19% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year in part due to improvements and utilization executed over the past years, which bodes well for our ability to continue hiring and building capacity throughout 2014. In the quarter, we generated $0.62 of non-GAAP EPS. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 51% and 49% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Outsourcing, consulting and technology services was up 5.5% sequentially and 23.7% year-over-year. Outsourcing services was essentially flat sequentially and up 16.1% from Q1 a year ago. As we have said, clients are facing a dual mandate as how to run better and simultaneously run different. This was particularly true in Q1, where we observed certain customers optimizing their run better spend to further invest in their run different initiatives. Additionally, during Q1, we continued to see expansion of application development work in our public sector services business. During the first quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts. As expected, pricing was essentially favorable during the quarter. We closed the quarter with 1,223 active clients, and added seven strategic customers bringing our total number of strategic clients to 150. Adjusting for the two-for-one stock split that was completed in March, our fully diluted share count for the quarter was 612.9 million shares, an increase of approximately 2 million shares from Q4. In Q1, we repurchased 600,000 shares for total cost of $29.3 million. We expect to accelerate the opportunistic repurchase of shares throughout the year. Today, we have repurchased approximately 32 million split adjusted shares for a total cost of just over $1 billion under the current share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the first quarter with approximately $3.86 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $118 million from the quarter ending December 31st and up by approximately $1.1 billion from a year ago. During the first quarter, operating activities generated approximately $157 million of cash. We utilized approximately $7 million of cash in financing activities and capital expenditures were approximately $43 million during the quarter. Receivables were $1.97 billion and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 73 days, essentially flat from last quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $267 million, up from $226 million at the end of Q4. We build approximately 64% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April. Let me now provide some color on our business and operational metrics for the quarter. Our key delivery in operating metrics are improving due to our efforts to drive best-in-class execution. Our focus on optimizing operations continues to free up resources for longer term investment in the business. Despite the ramp up in hiring during the quarter, utilization improved slightly on a sequential basis. This was primarily due to the fact of the on-boarding of new hires was skewed towards the back half of the quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 76%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 83%, and on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 178,600 employees globally, of which approximately 167,300 were service delivery staff, 44% of our new hires were direct collage hires, while 56% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 2014 and for the full year. Based on current conditions and client indication, we expect to continue delivering industries leading revenue growth of at least 16.5% for the full year and generate revenue of at least $10.3 billion in 2014. In addition, we are increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03. For the second quarter of 2014, we except to deliver revenue of between $2.5 billion and $2.53 billion, we are providing a range for our second quarter outlook to better align expectations for the anticipated quarterly pattern of revenue growth in 2014, reflecting our strong pipeline of deals across our three growth horizons particularly for the second half of the year. During Q2 and for the full year 2014, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.62. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.5%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to at least $2.50 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.5%. Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ed Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Ed Caso - Wells Fargo : Hi. Good morning. There has been a series of acquisition announcements in the pharmaceutical industries, has that or do you expect that could have an impact on your outlook and I think pharma is about 10% of total revenue, is that right? Thanks Gordon Coburn : Hey, Ed. That is Gordon. Historically, acquisition has been fine for us because we tend to -- because we work for most pharmaceutical companies. We tend to be on both sides of the transaction. We pick up the integration work. We tend to displaces others. So we\u2019ve got, obviously, we did very well as all the acquisitions happened in banking industry, acquisitions have happened to date in the pharmaceutical industry have been positive for us. So based on what we are seeing, we are not particularly concern about acquisitions at this point, that may actually be an opportunity but longer term. Ed Caso - Wells Fargo : Thank you Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies: Thanks, guys. Just two-part question. First off, just on the second quarter guidance, you are calling for sequential growth of about 4% maybe not much better than that, kind of limited acceleration versus the Q1 sequential growth? So if you can just comment on the reasons for that? And then just relating question, do you feel that the probability you are delivering upside to the full year revenue outlook is any less than it would have been a quarter ago when you first issued the full year outlook? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. This is Karen. I will take the first part of that question and Gordon will answer the second part. In terms of the Q2 guidance, as you said, the middle of the range will be about 4% growth. That\u2019s primarily driven by the fact that we saw such strong discretionary spending or consulting and technology services growth in Q1. Typically we wouldn\u2019t have seen that pattern until later towards the end of Q1 going into Q2. But this year in fact we saw some early discretionary spending which obviously then didn\u2019t lead to as big an increase as we move into Q2. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the shift in the seasonal pattern from that perspective and right now just talked about, we see a very strong pipeline as we move into the back half of the year and some recovery in the outsourcing growth. Gordon Coburn : And let me hit there. This is Gordon. Let me hit the second part of your question. Q1 clearly started little softer than we want it. Obviously, we still hit our guidance. We still feel very comfortable with our full year guidance. But, the math, the simple math is, it does takeaway some of the upside opportunity for the year given we started a little bit slower. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan : Okay. Thanks. Good morning. I was glad to hear that pricing is stable. But I\u2019m curious, a lot of your peers, I guess, pricing in the quarter thinking about IBM and Accenture and others. What\u2019s the delta there? What do you seeing on pricing globally amongst your peers? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: I think you have to be careful with the pricing question. Customers want to lower their cost of ownership. They are far less concern about what is the rate card. So if we through operational excellence, through productivity, through automation, can provide the services for less without impacting our rate card, customers are very happy. So, as a result, we are seeing relatively stable pricing. Clearly, we are reducing cost of ownership and what\u2019s happening is and you saw that our numbers even Q1, people are taking the savings coming from the outsourcing work. But and the lower cost of ownership there and taking those dollars and spending on running -- what we refer to as the running different the innovation topline growth. So the key is to make sure that, for us, make sure we have capabilities to deliver on where customers are shifting their spend and that\u2019s a meaningful -- it won\u2019t be a steady shift every quarter, obviously. But it\u2019s a meaningful shift that\u2019s happening. So you be sure to separate rate card from cost of ownership. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Steven Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Peter Christiansen - UBS: Hi. This is Peter Christiansen filling for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about any pattern changes that you are seeing in the decision-making process outside of healthcare and also talk about how -- you talked about how discretionary spending is a bit early this year. Is that going to affect the normal spending cycle on the discretionary side? Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Peter, it\u2019s Franc. Look, I think, we have covered the changes that we saw in the quarter. There was some slowdown as we said in healthcare as our client adjusted to the structural changes in that industry. We had some seasonal stuff related to the economy, the weather in the Northeast, nothing that I would be overly concern about for in a structural way. And then, I think, the one that Gordon alluded to a minute ago is, probably, the most important is that, we are seeing this balancing that we talked about as client redeploy dollars from what we think of as the run better initiatives to the run different initiatives, right. So kind of optimizing on core operations and using those savings to invest in these digital technologies and new capabilities that we have been talking for sometime. That shift is happening. We saw that happened in the first quarter, which is why we saw what we call consulting and technology services grow faster than outsourcing in the quarter. It\u2019s also not a typical Q1 pattern for us and typical Q1 we tend to see outsourcing grow a little faster than consulting and technology services. So I think that\u2019s probably the most interesting change, or, now we saw it in one quarter, I am not sure that, one quarter makes a long-term trend, but that\u2019s something to keep an eye on there as we go forward. Peter Christiansen - UBS: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank : Yeah. Hi, guys. Just kind of a two-part question here. I guess, first on headcount growth, good to see that accelerated a little over, I think, it was 4.2%, sequentially? Year-over-year, I think the number is still had about 10%. So just trying to make sure I understand the delta sequential headcount and year-over-year, and is that continuing to ramp up to match closer to the year-over-year revenue guidance of 16.5%. And then, secondly, just on the EPS raise of a few pennies, I think, it was about $0.03, what cause that raising guidance? Thanks. Gordon Coburn : Let me touch first on headcount. The reason that year-over-year number looks odd is last year we took our utilization up quite significantly, so we were able to deliver revenue with slow headcount growth. Obviously, you saw us accelerate our headcount growth in Q1. We don\u2019t provide future looking headcount guidance, but you certainly would not see a bigger delta between revenue growth and headcount growth that you did last year, because last year was the year where we materially increased our utilization. There is still some tweaking we will do and it will be variable quarter-to-quarter. But we are more in a stabilized range of utilization now. Karen, you want to touch base on EPS? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. Bryan, it is Karen. Regarding the EPS guidance, the raise by $0.03 is really due to the over performance in Q1. So you remember our original full year guidance on a non-GAAP basis with $2.51, we exceeded our Q1 guidance by $0.03 and so we\u2019ve added that to the full year. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. David Ridley-Lane - Bank of America : Sure. This is David Ridley-Lane in for Sara. Could we get an update on Cognizant\u2019s expansion into data centers? A little over year ago, you announced $25 million investment build I think about for data centers. How many do you have up and running today, how is the client\u2019s perception been and most importantly, do you feel that owning the data centers is a competitive advantage in winning cloud services work? Thank you. Francisco D'Souza: So, infrastructure services, I\u2019ll refer to as ITIS, is a very important strategic area for us and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are making really good progress. A component of infrastructure services is to have some data center capacity for clients where they want that capacity along with other services within infrastructure management. So we\u2019ve brought four data centers on line. They are up and running. Clients are utilizing them as part of broader ITIS deal. So the strategy is generally working. We will continue to tweak a little bit. Obviously the market is shifting quickly in some of those areas. The investment I think we emphasized for people before is not massive. I think it was $25 million, $30 million. That investment is essentially all done at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company : Hey, thanks. Another two-part question. Going back to your Q2 guidance, it\u2019s definitely softer than usual in terms of the sequential uptick you usually see from March to June. I think some color on there will be helpful in terms of what\u2019s embedded in that? Is that further weakness in North America healthcare, discretionary or all of the above and then the U.K. had a huge sequential uptick in growth, can you comment on that? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin : Sure. So, Moshe, I mean, I think as we\u2019ve talked about consulting and technology services which is typically the driver of growth going from Q1 to Q2, actually kicked in a little earlier than we expected. So we saw strong sequential growth there in Q1 and so to some extent that limits the ramp up as we move into Q2 and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the change there. And then as we talked about, we do think there is a little bit of shift in the way outsourcing is performing this year where it had a slow Q1 relatively speaking, 1% sequential growth. But we expect to see increasing growth there, as we move into the back half of the year. So that was really the only change there. Francisco D'Souza: And Europe, at a macro level, Europe is embracing our model a lot more. The catalysts in the economic crisis in Continental Europe served as a catalyst for people to think very differently about how they acquire and utilize technology and business process services. In the U.K., our brand has become very strong. Obviously, I don\u2019t think we are going to have this sort of sequential growth in Europe every quarter going forward. But clearly we are feeling good about our position in Europe, our customers in Europe and I think Europe, particularly Continental Europe is ready to embrace a global delivery model. Gordon Coburn : And, Moshe, you will get -- three of us answering your question here. Let me just jump in as well. I think one of things about this quarter is it just speaks of the strength of the portfolio, right. We\u2019ve got a really good portfolio of -- that we\u2019ve been investing and we have been talking to you over many years about the investments we were making across the industries, geographies and services. And I think you saw that play out this quarter. Yeah, we had some softness in some parts of North America. It was offset very nicely by things like discretionary spending in SMAC, social mobile analytics and cloud. It was offset nicely by the performance in Europe, both in the continent and the U.K. As we mentioned in the prepared comments, the U.K. hit a $1 billion run rate in the quarter which is terrific and we have several other businesses including the SMAC business, Continental Europe and really all of the H2 services, BPO, IT infrastructure services and consulting. All of those are, in general, growing faster than company average and are well on their way to becoming billion dollar businesses in the coming year. So we feel good about the portfolio that we built. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer: Good morning. I wanted to go back to the headcount ramp in the quarter. And if I heard Karen right, it sounded like it happened right at the tail end of the quarter and it seemed to be skewed toward the laterals as well. Is that -- was that sort of a suggestion of sort of a pick up in demand that maybe takes a little bit of a while to sort of build on and convert, or is there any way to sort of read into that? Francisco D'Souza: So let me start first of all with the laterals versus ELTs. Not heavily skewed towards, that\u2019s actually kind of a normal mix. So I wouldn\u2019t view that as in anyway unusual, the mix that\u2019s exactly what we want. In terms of the timing, when people join, what I wouldn\u2019t read a whole lot into that either that part of that is when the college students want to come in and so forth. I think the key to read here is one, last year we took utilization up quite a bit and now it\u2019s -- we are kind of at the right level where we want to be, so you will see it more stabilize. We are able to attract or recruit just absolutely great talent. Our brand is probably the strongest it\u2019s ever been, not just in India but in North America and Europe as well. So we are getting the people and they are staying, so the attrition has come down nicely. So we are feeling very good in terms of our resource and capability. In fact, we added 7200 people, obviously means we think there are growth opportunities for us. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joe Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead with your question. Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott : Hi. Can you quantify the headwinds in 1Q? I know you talked about them, are they fully behind us? And can you give us update on the SMAC stack as a percentage of revenue and expectations for this year? Francisco D'Souza: Sure. So I am not sure I would say the headwinds are fully behind us. When you think about what\u2019s happened, clearly the weather is behind us, but once again I don\u2019t want to point to the weather as a material. There still people are worried about the economy, no question about that. Healthcare, there is still uncertainty, but I think the uncertainty has settled down a little bit from where it was in Q1 and the leadership changes for the ones that happened, those are largely behind us. I am sorry, Joe, what\u2019s the second part of your question? Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott : I just want to get an update on the SMAC stack as a percentage of revenue and your expectations for this year? I want to see if that changed at all. Francisco D'Souza: Sure. So as you know, we did about $500 million of SMAC revenue last year. We\u2019ve not given -- we don\u2019t give guidance on what it will be for this year, but certainly SMAC is a growing area. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead with your question. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : I want to ask about how do you get there for calendar year \u201914, given guidance for the June quarter and for the March quarter, and it calls for some -- September to be, called it 5.5% to 5.7% and maybe December to be 2.5% to 2.7% sequential growth. It seems like a little bit -- calling for a little bit of a revenue acceleration compared to what you\u2019ve just delivered and guided to for June. Is the assumption that the U.S. which had very weak sequential growth that that comes back to more normal sequential patterns? I was wondering if you could speak specifically to the U.S. and what you\u2019re assuming there. And then also if you could just provide any dimensions around what Horizon 2, what you anticipate particularly in the consulting and BPO areas on how you see it filling or providing the guidance for the balance of 2014? Thank you. Francisco D'Souza: Sure. So at a macroeconomic level, it assumes no improvements, basically things stay the same. A lot of the seasonality is based on stuff we won last year and stuff we recently won that takes a little while to check it, so it\u2019s more the parent tends to be a little bit more client specific, but it is not based on miraculously GDP growth will increase. We are assuming status quo from a macroeconomic environment. And the second part of your question? Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Well, just to come back, you are assuming that North America specifically returns to more for Cognizant more normal growth patterns as you look at the second half of the year, so those headwinds are gone you think in North America specifically for Cognizant? Francisco D'Souza: Yes. So specifically for Cognizant, we would expect the sequential growth to be better in the second half of year than first and some of that\u2019s related to specific stuff that we won and will be ramping up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ask your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Thank you. So I guess two part question also. On the run better side, when you talk of flattish outsourcing and you just mentioned some of the leadership issues transitions are behind you. Can you talk about vendor consolidation, how much of an impact that is? And typically you guys do tend to have either 2Q or 3Q or both and obviously in this 3Q should be a good ramp. Is that based on the wins that you had that you can start ramping, so if you could talk about the ramps as well? And then separately on the run different side, is that more inherent quarter-over-quarter volatility in this part of the business? Francisco D'Souza: So, Ashwin, it\u2019s Franc. I\u2019ll try to address several of the points you made. And if I omit some, come back. Look, in terms of the broad sort of vendor landscape, vendor consolidation and so on, clearly we\u2019re seeing a little bit of that going on. We\u2019ve talked about this for a while. In general, we tend to be the beneficiaries in those situations. And the reason for that, Ashwin, is that, as you may know, historically, we\u2019ve had a very explicit and deliberate strategy with our clients, focusing on small number of clients, small number of industries and serving our clients very deeply. And so we tend to have strong positions with our clients. We tend to be, in general, after -- obviously after client has reached some level of maturity, we tend to be one of the larger providers in a client\u2019s ecosystem. And so when there is a vendor consolidation exercise that takes place, we tend to generally benefit from a consolidation exercise. So overall, I think that when vendor consolidation is taking place, there is a little bit of a benefit to that. In terms of looking at the pattern of outsourcing for this year, as Gordon said, a lot of our outlook is based on stuff that we\u2019ve won and we expect to ramp. I think that you\u2019re starting to see, you\u2019re seeing -- we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ve seen this for about the last year or so is that outsourcing deals are also becoming a little bit larger, as clients tend to bundle things together. We\u2019re starting to see the bundled applications and infrastructure deals happening out there. Those take a little bit of time to win. The sales cycles are a little bit longer, but obviously revenues are also larger and so it has that dynamic. As opposed to say five years ago when our outsourcing contracts were more sort of penetrate and expand kind of contracts where we win a small deal with the client and then expand from there. And then on your third point, yeah, I think, you will see that on the digital work or more generally the discretionary work in the consulting and technology services area, that has always been and will continue to be somewhat more volatile quarter-to-quarter because it is more discretionary, it is more subject to client annual budgeting process, annual budgeting cycle. And I think that volatility might be a little bit more pronounced this year and next year because you have this period when clients are really adjusting to these new digital technologies. And you\u2019ll see starts and stop in spending related to that, perhaps a little bit more than you would have seen, say five years ago when technology was a little bit more stable. Gordon, do you want to add anything? Gordon Coburn : I think you covered the key things. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Darrin Peller - Barclays: Thanks, guys. You mentioned that you saw structural changes around the healthcare as there\u2019s a pause from both companies and consumers adjusting to the change, the legislative changes and obviously there\u2019s also patent cliffs remaining. However, Obamacare does seem to be still in the early stages of rolling out across states. And I guess as the market is accustomed to these changes, should we expect to see this still become a more meaningful tailwind maybe in the second half of the year, given that the insurance payers still need to get connected to the news feed coming on? And I guess just a follow on that point, I mean if -- before you\u2019re saying about the management changes as one of the headwinds in the US also was completed and healthcare were to come back. I mean, is that just upside to what you\u2019re incorporating year in your outlook now? Gordon Coburn : Let me start with the management changes and Franc can touch on healthcare. On the management changes, those are pretty much flushing out the system at this point, so we understand where those are and that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019ve got into the timing. So that\u2019s built into the guidance because their comments level on that\u2019s quite high. Franc, do you to mention on healthcare? Francisco D'Souza: Look, I think you\u2019re potentially right. I think as you long-term, healthcare is going through -- healthcare is going through a period of structural change. And I am referring -- we\u2019ve talked about the structural change going on in life sciences for many quarters now. I am referring more to, sort, of the payer provider ecosystem now. If you look at that space, there is clearly the Affordable Care Act. There are other changes going on as well. If you look at the commercial market for example in the United States, we are seeing more and more employers moving to high deductible plans and so on, which is changing consumption patterns for healthcare in the United States. In the first quarter, if you look at consumption -- true consumption metrics for healthcare services in January and February, they were down. True healthcare consumption in the United States came down in many places in the first month of the first quarter. So you are seeing the sort of structural adjustment at. My guess is that what will happen is it will take sometime for us to reach somewhat of a new normal in healthcare, and through that there will be opportunities for us at Cognizant to capitalize on opportunities. But I don\u2019t want to be too bullish on this because the reality is I don\u2019t know how long this industry takes to adjust, and that\u2019s hard to predict at this point. So we are watching it very carefully. As you know, we are extraordinarily well-positioned in the healthcare. We feel like we\u2019ve got the leading franchise out there serving healthcare, payers providers and the global pharma companies and the medical device companies. So we feel like we\u2019ve got a very, very strong play in healthcare. Our position is strong. Competitiveness is great. Our teams are out there everyday talking to our clients. And so as these opportunities arise, I feel very good about how we are positioned to capitalize on them. But as industries go through these periods of change, it\u2019s hard to get a good fix on exactly how things play out quarter-by-quarter. So we watch it very carefully and obviously keep updating you as our views change. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley : Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s Brian Essex for Katy. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if maybe you could dig into Europe a little bit, 52% growth on a trailing 12-months basis year-over-year. How much of that is organic and what is your outlook in terms of how you think about the sector, where you are investing for headcounts, is there any concentration with vertical or product line that would give us some kind of read into the sustainability of growth, although that\u2019s pretty impressive growth, both in Continental Europe as well as the U.K.? Gordon Coburn : Sure. Let me take the second part of the question. We are trying to see if we have handy the first part and if not, we\u2019ll get back to you with it offline. We feel good about Europe quite simply. Part of it is our execution and part of it is the market. In terms of our execution, we\u2019ve really build out our teams in the continent, both through some acquisitions that we\u2019ve done as well as organically. We now have the model that works in terms of the combination of local presence and multi-national capability so. And the type of services that we are providing, the combination of run better, run different are resonating. So that happened at the same time that the market is becoming more open to global delivery, to outsourcing in general. So the combination of those two factors, together make us feel good. When you look at it by industry, obviously the one big difference from North America is you don\u2019t have the same spend levels in the payer sectors due to nationalized healthcare over there. But certainly our financial services, insurance, pharma, retail, manufacturing, telecom, we are feeling quite good about it. Obviously, continent is going off a small base which makes the percentage growth numbers a little bit easier to tackle. But even when you look at in terms of dollar growth and as an increase in percentage of revenue, clearly we think there is continued opportunities both in U.K. but more importantly in the continent and the Nordics. So we will keep investing there. The strategy is working out. Part of what we are doing is we are expanding our investment strategy. We are increasing our investment in markets in Asia. We\u2019re starting our investments now in the markets down in Latin America, so similar to what we did in Europe. We\u2019re now going to other parts of the world and the good news is as we do that, we now better understand the model between local and foreign nationals and how they act locally while at the same time having global delivery. So, I think we\u2019ve got the model down pretty well and we\u2019ll continue to roll that out. Karen McLoughlin : And this is Karen. Regarding the organic growth in Europe so and the continent for the quarter grew about 46% year-over-year on a reported basis and about 30% growth was organic growth. About 15 points was due to the C1 and the Equinox acquisitions that we closed last year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC. Please go ahead with your question. Dan Perlin - RBC: Thanks. I wanted to just go back to this comment earlier about the rate card versus cost of ownership. But I also wanted to add mix a bit into that discussion and as you\u2019ve talked a lot about these investments going into run better and run different from your clients budgeting side but reconciling that with the margin profile of 19% to 20% in the back half of the year. So, is the message here that it really is a function of incremental investments as you were somewhat highlighting in Europe, or is there a mix issue as well that we need to be mindful of as you go into these other markets and technologies? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: So there is a mix issue but the mix takes you both ways. So as we are shifting more to run different, people are less price sensitive and billing rates tend to be a little bit better. But at the same time, I\u2019m growing my BPO business, where just the nature is more heavily offshore and obviously rates in general are lower for that because the costs are lower. So when you mix it all together and you look at the average blended rate across the company, you have a couple of things taking in opposite directions, which is the way it should work. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. David Togut - Evercore: Thank you. Financial services put up pretty solid 20% year-over-year growth in the quarter but that\u2019s below the trend we\u2019ve seen actually over the last two to three years, which has been materially higher. Can you flush out some of the underlying drivers, the financial services growth in the quarter and in particular did anything change significantly versus what we\u2019ve seen over the last six to 12 months? Francisco D'Souza: The main change during the -- last year insurance was a bit stronger than banking, we actually -- in parts of last year. This in Q1 banking -- core banking did quite well and for some of the reasons I articulated in terms of spend that they have to do on compliance, on regulatory, on risk management, while at the same time, they are investing to run things different and interact different with the customers. So you will see some back and forth. Obviously, the financial services segment is our biggest segment. So the law of large numbers says, it should, it should not grow materially faster than the overall company and I certainly would not have that expectation. So it will be a little different quarter-to-quarter. But core banking in Q1 did nicely. I think, Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Yeah. Thank you. That question is coming from line of Mayank Tandon of Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question. Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company: Thank you. Good morning. Franc, you talked about some of the large multiyear type outsourcing contracts where you are competing. I just wanted to get a sense, are you seeing different players then you have seen in the past on some of these opportunities and also would it require you to change your capital intensity, but if you want to be competitive on some of these large infrastructure type engagements? Francisco D'Souza: Yeah. Mayank, let me answer the last part of your question first then I will come back to the beginning. So, clearly not, we are not playing and in fact candidly the market generally moving away from the traditional large scale capital intensive, what I think of is more traditional hardware and asset-heavy infrastructure deals. So, I think, that somewhat the model of the past at this point. We are playing in, what I think of is bundled outsourcing deals, where you are seeing clients bundling together, applications and infrastructure management quite common to see that bundle happen. But we are also starting to see BPO and apps and infrastructure or some combination of all three of those being bundled together and so that\u2019s really the bundling I am talking about. When we look at those bundles, I think, we\u2019ve proven out time and time again at this point that there are true synergies that you can drive, that we can drive on behalf of our clients, when we combine those things together. When you are combining BPO and IT, for example, you do get technology and operations synergies, when you combine infrastructure management and application you do get technology synergies that you can leverage a so those are the kinds of transactions that I\u2019m talking about when I refer to these bundle deals. Having said that, we continue to work on the traditional single tower deals as well and that\u2019s a very healthy part of the business. So we are competing across all of those. I think in terms of competitive set, I don\u2019t think its changed, we compete against, the usual suspects here in the space, including the folks that who traditionally have been the -- done the bigger -- what you might think of as bigger outsourcing deals and of course, also the global services player. So that competitive set hasn\u2019t changed meaningfully. I think that was really all we had time for. So let me just close by thanking you all for joining us today and for your questions. We are looking forward to a good 2014 and we look forward to seeing you next quarter to discuss our results. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2014 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Frank. Francisco D'souza: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll start the call today with the highlights of our second quarter results and our revised outlook for the rest of the year. I'll also take some time to put our results in the context of the broader industry trends that we're seeing, using as examples some significant transformational deals that have recently been awarded to us. I'll then pass the call on to Gordon to discuss our detailed operating results, and Karen will provide further details on our financial metrics and guidance. For the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $2.52 billion, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin, at 21%, was higher than our target range for the quarter and positions us well to absorb wage increases and promotions that take effect during the second half of the year. And in support of our continued confidence in the business, this morning, we announced an expansion of our existing share repurchase program to $2 billion. Karen will give you more details on this expansion shortly. We delivered solid performance in the second quarter. But due to weaknesses in certain clients and longer-than-expected sale cycles for certain large integrated deals, we're adopting a more conservative stance for the remainder of the year and revising our revenue guidance to at least 14% for 2014 while maintaining our prior full year non-GAAP EPS of at least $2.54. More specifically, there are 2 main reasons for this revised guidance. First, as we've discussed with you in the past, we are seeing a trend in the market towards larger integrated deals. While these deals represent a strong source of revenue for Cognizant, certain deals took longer than expected to close, leading to delays in revenue ramp-up. And second, we continue to experience weakness in certain clients in North America and the U.K. that recently underwent leadership changes, a situation that we described to you last quarter. While we believe that our client relationships remain sound, we will not generate as much revenue in 2014 from some of these clients as we had previously expected. While I'm disappointed that our full year revenue growth will be below our prior expectations, we remain optimistic about the evolving market opportunity ahead of us. I'd like to spend a few moments putting our results and outlook in the context of what we're seeing in the market, using some specific large important client situations as illustrations. We've spoken to you in past quarters about our clients' dual mandate to run better and run different. On one side of the dual mandate, our clients are under constant pressure to become more efficient in their current operations or to run better, and they continue to look to us to provide ever-greater levels of productivity in their core operations and legacy technology environments by combining multiple service areas, applying advanced automation and implementing best-in-class operations and Lean Six Sigma methodologies. Gordon will speak to you shortly about the details of 3 large deals of this nature that together represent approximately $3.5 billion in total contract value. The largest of these deals is with Health Net, a top 10 managed care organization in the U.S. We've signed a letter of intent with Health Net and expect to finalize the contract before the end of Q3. The Health Net deal alone represents around $2.7 billion in total contract value and is the single largest PCB deal in the history of Cognizant. This engagement builds on our long-standing relationship with Health Net for close to 10 years. Judging by our pipeline, we are seeing increased opportunity in these types of engagements and anticipate this to be a long-term trend. Winning and delivering these deals requires a broad range of integrated capabilities, in which we have been investing over many years : a strong consulting front end, solid client raising skills, deep domain knowledge and at-scale capabilities in technology and operations. And behind deals like these lies a deep sense of trust that our clients place in us, trust that comes from multiyear client relationships and deep levels of engagement within our clients' organizations. On the other side of the dual mandate, our clients continue to drive -- the drive to adopt new digital technologies to gain competitive advantage or to run different. Where, in run better, we are seeing larger integrated services deals, our run different engagements tend to be sharply-focused, value-focused initiatives that often include the use of new SMAC or digital technologies to reshape aspects of our clients' businesses or industries. Quite often, these tend to be IP-driven, nonlinear, outcome-based engagements. For example, we were recently chosen by TransCelerate BioPharma Inc., an industry body with membership representation from 19 major pharmaceutical companies, to develop a first-of-its-kind, subscription-based platform that will transform the way pharmaceutical companies collaborate on clinical trials. TransCelerate's mission is to bring the global pharmaceutical R&D community together so as to accelerate and simplify the process of drug development. This shared investigator platform, built as an industry utility, will enable the pharmaceutical industry to bring standardization and consistency to clinical trials. In keeping with our past practice, we continue to invest in building our capabilities in new technologies and service areas as well as in new markets and geographies to meet our clients' evolving needs. Our initiatives in digital and SMAC technologies continue to show great traction and drive deeper engagement with our clients. Let me close by saying that while we know that you are disappointed in our revised revenue outlook for the year, I can assure you that all of us at Cognizant are even more disappointed. But let me be clear, we believe that the market opportunity remains strong and that Cognizant is well positioned to capture a disproportionate share of the growth in the market over the coming years. A new report by ISG, a sourcing advisory group, indicates that demand in the market is at record-high levels. This is also reflected in our strong order pipeline. As part of our recent quarterly management meeting, our global leadership team assembled to take stock and review areas of the focus in view of our revised guidance for the year. Post these discussions, it's clear to us that we have the right strategy, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business. Our portfolio of services across the 3 horizons has never been stronger, and we continue to hire in large numbers. This quarter, we had a net addition of approximately 8,800 people to our company, our highest since the third quarter of 2011. The run better, run different dual mandate for our clients is more real than ever, and we will continue to push harder in the coming quarters to continue to be our clients' partner of choice. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Gordon to share more about our performance and to Karen to provide financial details. I'll be back for the Q&A. Gordon? Gordon J. Coburn: Thank you, Francisco. We're pleased to be able to speak with you today about 3 significant transformational deals, including an engagement with the largest total contract value, or TCV, in Cognizant history. But before I get into the details of these relationships, I want to first discuss our view on current market demand and our strategy to deliver long-term industry-leading performance. While our near-term 2014 revenue outlook of at least 14% growth is below our original expectations, we believe that these near-term, client-specific impacts we are experiencing are not a reflection of market environment or our approach to the broadening market. We remain confident in our strategy and long-term prospects. Our commitment to industry-leading growth is something we take very seriously, and we believe that our 3 Horizon model is the right strategy to position us for industry-leading growth over the longer term. Given that overall market demand remains healthy and geographies beyond our traditional markets are underpenetrated and showing real signs of adopting our delivery model, it is more important than ever to continue investing to strengthen -- to further strengthen and differentiate our capabilities across our 3 growth horizons. Within Horizon 1, we're seeing a shift towards transformational deals, and we are strengthening our capabilities and client-value proposition for these opportunities. Within Horizon 2, which includes Business Process Services or BPS, consulting and IT Infrastructure Services, we believe that the market is still young, and we continue to invest in scale to compete and win deals based on our industry knowledge and ability to structure integrated solutions for clients. And finally, we're pleased with the revenue and mindshare traction we are gaining in our newer Horizon 3 businesses and services, where we have competitive offerings and differentiation with a strong opportunity to penetrate our top accounts. For years now, we've been talking about the increasing importance of transformational deals that provide scale and leadership, and we have historically won a number of these deals, particularly in financial services and health care. With these deals, clients look to make large-scale changes to the way they operate significant parts of their businesses or IT organizations. The goal is to dramatically improve their performance in multiple areas of their business. Increasingly, these deals involve solutions integrating multiple service offerings. Let me now speak about 3 examples of these types of deals. Combined, these 3 deals are expected to generate approximately $3.5 billion in TCV for us. We anticipate these deals will ramp over the duration of the contracts, with the expected incremental revenue in 2015 of at least $200 million. This morning, we are announcing the signing of a letter of intent for a multibillion engagement with Health Net, which provides and administers health benefits to approximately 5,800,000 members across the country. At a total contract value of $2.7 billion over 7 years, this engagement is significant from both a revenue and strategic perspective. Subject to contract finalization and applicable regulatory approval, Cognizant will provide end-to-end business services, including processing membership and claims as well as providing transformational IT and the underlying infrastructure services. Included within this deal is access to certain intellectual property related to the platform used to run the operation of a health care payer organization. We believe that this will allow us to play an even larger role in the health care industry ecosystem going forward. The business model resulting from this deal is expected to be a benchmark for the industry, enabling Health Net to improve its quality of service, reduce G&A spending and increase its agility in launching new products and participating in new markets. Additionally, we recently won a multiyear transformational deal with a financial services company. This is a good example of how our long-term relationship with a client positioned us to win a large integrated deal covering all lines of business. Our track record in delivery gave the client confidence in our capabilities to leverage some synergies between IT and BPS and to be responsible for efficiently running their core processes, from the origination of new business to back-office support to maintaining critical systems. Providing a comprehensive solution will help not only to improve and streamline their core processes but enhance insight into their business. Finally, we were selected by Vorwerk, a large European consumer goods manufacturing and direct sales company, to simplify, standardize and centralize the company's IT infrastructure. The transformed IT infrastructure environment will enable this client to achieve higher levels of business agility and service quality while sharpening its focus on its core competencies and driving down cost. Furthermore, this is a good example of how we are beginning to leverage the relationships of last year's C1 acquisition to further grow our business in Europe. These larger transformational opportunities are a testament to our ability to integrate multiple services, including our core IT services, as well as our Horizon 2 services at BPS consulting and IT infrastructure and often our SMAC capabilities. Let me now turn to a detailed discussion of our Horizon 2 service lines. Our BPS practice had a solid quarter, gaining traction through several strategic wins as well as through the growth of existing project work and expanding into new divisions at existing clients. Capital markets and mortgage services demand in banking remained strong, as does underwriting in property and casualty insurance and claims processing and membership enrollment and revenue cycle management in health care. Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continued its pace of above-company average growth. As we've discussed in previous quarters, CBC is often a key factor in our ability to win and deliver results in these larger transformational deals. By incorporating consulting and advisory work upfront, we provide our clients with comprehensive and integrated solutions, thus helping them to transform their organizations. For example, CBC recently served as a retail client's digital platform partner in developing their roadmap to drive their digital transformation by launching offerings such as in-store ordering, multichannel fulfillment and mobile point-of-sale. CBC takes a business-led approach in formulating solutions and plays a key role in the implementation of these solutions. IT Infrastructure Services had another strong quarter. We're well positioned in this growth market, as we are increasingly competing for comprehensive deals requiring the integration of end-to-end IT infrastructure management and application management. The engagement we mentioned earlier with Vorwerk is a good example of this type of win. From an industry perspective, our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 3.4% sequentially and 16.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in insurance, where there is a growing focus on end-to-end managed services. More broadly within BFS, underlying demand drivers from regulatory compliance, real risk time monitoring and fraud and trade surveillance support longer-term growth. Additionally, our financial services clients are looking to us to build and integrate SMAC solutions. Growth in health care, which consists primarily of our payor, pharmaceutical and medical device clients, accelerated in the quarter, up 4.8% sequentially and 19.2% year-over-year. Within the pharmaceutical sector, several of our key pharmaceutical clients continue to work through the challenges associated with their drug pipelines and with the patent cliff, though we are beginning to see a steady pickup in demand. After a significant step-up in investments in 2013, many of our payor clients are taking a more cautious approach to incremental spending this year, especially associated with their activities with public and private health insurance exchanges. However, we're confident in the longer-term opportunities, given the significant disruption in the health care market that will continue to evolve over the coming years. The engagement with health care -- with Health Net will further enhance our ability to provide clients with both IT services and Cognizant-owned intellectual property platform-led solutions as they face these challenges. Our retail manufacturing segment was relatively flat sequentially and up 11.4% year-over-year. In retail, continued pressure on discretionary spending among major clients has driven much of the softness in the quarter. Although revenue in manufacturing and logistics was soft in the quarter, we are seeing clients focus on both solutions that can drive operational efficiencies as well as embracing SMAC solutions in areas such as internet-enabled devices, with built-in intelligence to improve supply chain visibility and logistics operations and promote driver engagement through enhanced throughput. Our other segment, which includes communications, information, media and entertainment and high tech, showed continued recovery, with 10.4% sequential growth and 20.8% growth year-over-year, primarily driven by increased traction with both communications and high technology companies, where we have seen a pickup in discretionary spending. From a geographic standpoint, North America improved from a slow start at the beginning of the year, growing 5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Following a strong first quarter, revenue from Europe declined about 1% sequentially but grew 20.4% year-over-year. The slowdown was driven by the U.K., where we saw a 4.1% sequential decline in Q2. As Frank mentioned, the U.K. weakness came primarily from retail and financial clients which have experienced leadership changes. Continental Europe saw 4% sequential growth and 30.5% growth year-over-year, partially attributed to our 2013 acquisitions. We expect solid growth in the continent, and we anticipate that the structural shift towards larger multiyear outsourcing programs will continue to drive opportunities over the coming years. The rest of world continued to show good growth, up 5.5% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. We added several new logos in the APAC region recently and remain encouraged by the growth prospects in that region. Now let me turn the call over to Karen to provide details on our numbers. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $2.52 billion represented growth of 3.9% sequentially and 16.5% over Q2 2013. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 21%, above our target range of 19% to 20%, while our GAAP operating margin was 19.4% for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.66 exceeded our previous guidance by $0.04. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 52% and 48% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 6.2% sequentially and 20.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services increased 1.5% sequentially and 11.9% from Q2 a year ago. During the second quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We closed the quarter with 1,242 active clients and added 7 strategic customers, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 257. As we discussed on the first quarter earnings call, we have accelerated the rate of share repurchase. In Q2, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for a total cost of $101 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 34.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.13 billion under the previous share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion. Today, we are pleased to announce that the board has authorized a $500 million increase in share repurchase authorization, bringing the total repurchase authorization to $2 billion, of which $872 million is still unutilized. Our fully diluted share count for the quarter was 612.2 million shares, a decrease of approximately 730,000 shares from the first quarter. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the second quarter with approximately $4.13 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $264 million from the quarter ending March 31 and up by approximately $1.23 billion from the year-ago period. During the second quarter, operating activities generated approximately $408 million of cash, financing activities were approximately a $93 million use of cash and capital expenditures were approximately $39 million for the quarter. Receivables were $1.8 billion, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 76.7 days, up by approximately 1.5 days from the year-ago period. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $298 million, up from $267 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 57% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics for the quarter. As Francisco mentioned earlier, we ramped up hiring during the quarter, with approximately 8,800 net new hires, our highest net addition since Q3 2011, reflecting our long-term growth expectations for the company. Annualized attrition of 16.9% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down by almost 200 basis points from the year-ago period. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 187,400 employees globally, of which approximately 175,500 were service delivery staff. 34% of our new hires were direct college hires, while 64% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. Utilization declined slightly on a sequential basis as we onboarded the 8,800 net new hires. Offshore utilization was approximately 74%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 82%, and on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 2014 and for the full year. As Francisco mentioned, while we are not where we expected to be in terms of revenue for the second half of the year, the overall services market remains strong, with tremendous opportunity for growth worldwide and across our regions and practice areas. However, given the weakness at certain clients and longer-than-anticipated sales cycles for certain large integrated deals, we are revising our full year revenue growth expectation to at least 14% growth, down from our previous expectations of at least 16.5% for the full year. For the third quarter of 2014, we expect to deliver revenue of between $2.55 billion and $2.58 billion. During Q3 and for the second half of 2014, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20% as we absorb the raises and promotions in the second half of the year. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.63. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 612 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. Our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance is unchanged. We expect to deliver at least $2.54 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Clearly, you cut your revenue outlook, looks like by, I guess, $220 million. I'm curious how much of that $220 million is due to the weakness in the client spend that you called out versus the longer sales cycles. And as a follow-up, do you expect that lower client spend to come back? Or has it been lost in, say, vendor consolidation or what have you? Gordon J. Coburn: Tien-tsin, it's Gordon. The majority of it is the client-specific issues. The smaller piece of it is the longer sales cycle on the transformational deals, and it's a combination. Some of it is clients aren't spending quite as much as we expected on some projects we were anticipating, and some of it is delays in decisions, where clients -- at clients that had changes in leadership. So -- but certainly, it's more related towards client-specific issues at a handful of clients. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Do you expect it to come back at some point, Gordon? And how broad-based was it? Are we talking about a handful of clients or something smaller? Francisco D'souza: Tien-tsin, it's Frank. Look, I think -- we're talking about a small handful of clients, some of our larger clients. And in terms of the spend coming back, look, I think our relationships at across-the-board remain very, very healthy. But given where we are in the year, the dynamics of our business are such that if you don't start projects and ramp up in the early part of the first half of the year, then it's hard to make it up on the back end. But as we go into next year, look, I think we are positioned well with our client base, depending on where budgets come out and so on and so forth, those dynamics. I think we're well positioned to capture our fair share or an unfair share of what our clients are going to be spending and these same clients in the longer term. Operator : We'll move on to the next question, which is coming from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Could you talk a little bit about the competitive framework here? It sounds like you're -- you and some of your competitors are starting to chase larger and larger transactions. And I'm wondering how much a greater role the advisors now play in it as opposed to your old model of penetrate and radiate. Sort of what's the framework here? And also, talk within the concept -- I know you said pricing was stable, but what's happening with total cost of ownership and what that implies for revenue growth? Francisco D'souza: Yes, let me -- Ed, it's Frank. Let me talk about the first part, and I'll turn it over to Gordon for the second piece of your question. For several quarters now, we've been talking to you about this trend towards larger, more integrated services deals. And that's really driven at the fundamental level by the fact that increase -- there's an increasing body now of evidence and a track record at Cognizant at combining multiple service areas together, the traditional application development and application maintenance, IT infrastructure and BPO, allows us to combine those service areas together and create a way -- apply techniques like Lean Six Sigma, advanced automation and so on to drive even greater levels of productivity and efficiency. So as our clients face this dual mandate, which is very, very real, of how do I run my operations better in order to fund the investments that I need in order to run different, this trend towards larger integrated deals is something that we're seeing more and more of. I think in that context, the role of the advisors certainly is more pronounced than it had been in our traditional model. But I would also say that the traditional model is still very much the large piece of the business, where it's sort of a more land and expand kind of a model, where we win a client, tend to do some initial project and then expand from there. So that's still the big piece of our revenue growth. I just want to make that clear because we've spent a lot of time in our prepared comments in talking about these transformational deals, which is an important trend, but it's still a smaller part of the overall revenue mix. Gordon J. Coburn: And it's Gordon. Your question about are people focused on price or rate card versus total cost of ownership, clearly, in most cases, it's total cost of ownership, particularly where intermediaries are involved. Because when you focus on total cost of ownership, you can have a win-win situation, which is the basis for long-term success. So the focus is on efficiency. It's on effectiveness. As Francisco mentioned, it's on automation. It's on process improvement. And as long as we can deliver a lower cost of ownership to the client, that's what they care about, rather than what the rate card is. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : So does that imply sort of lower revenue growth for you, given this TCO pressure? You're basically less revenue per person. Gordon J. Coburn: It's not less revenue per person because, if it's lower cost of ownership and I'm pulling the efficiency automation process improvement levers, I can do the work with less people. So yes, it can result to providing the same service with less people and, therefore, less revenue. But remember, that's on the run better side. And what clients are doing is they're freeing up those dollars and then investing them on the run different side. So as long as we can provide services on both sides of the house, that model works well for us. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just wanted to ask, the weakness in outsourcing, that's 2 quarters in a row. Just trying to figure out if something structurally is going on. I don't know if SaaS is having an impact; cloud, obviously, are the 2 themes that we see out there. Did that have any impact on the outsourcing business? And then just second question, just on wage hike expected, what percentage wage hike are you expecting in the third? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. Bryan, it's Karen. I'll take the first part. I think Gordon's going to take the wage part of your question. So as you mentioned, the outsourcing growth has been a little bit slower in the first half of this year sequentially. In Q1, we talked about where we had seen a couple of clients who are actually redirecting revenue dollars from run better to run different, and that was the beginning of a bit of a shift that we had seen there. I think a little bit of that trend continued in Q2, where clients, as Gordon was just talking about, right, they're looking to optimize their spend, redirect investment dollars towards the run different and more transformational side of their business. But as we look out over the long -- the near term and the long term, there's actually a tremendous amount of growth for the outsourcing segment of our business. So keep in mind, outsourcing includes not just the application and maintenance side of the business but also the BPO and infrastructure services, which are continuing to grow faster than company average and certainly will for the foreseeable future. But also, if you think about the 3 transactions that we talked about this morning, that Gordon talked about with the Health Net transaction, the Vorwerk transaction and the financial services client, the vast majority of that revenue actually will be part of what we call the outsourcing segment because it includes application maintenance, infrastructure and BPO. So I think you will continue to see growth out of that segment moving forward. Gordon J. Coburn: And on your question about wage inflation. First of all, our increases and promotions, a vast majority are effective July 1. We're going to be in line with the other leading players, so that translates into roughly 10% wage inflation offshore and on-site wage inflation in the lower single digits. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Look, I mean, your guidance obviously implies slower trends into the second half of the year. And when we still see some strength now in the financials and health care vertical, and you obviously call out some larger transformational deals like Health Net or others that you've won, I think it'd be helpful for the market if you can just provide a little more detail regarding the pipeline that you actually have now beyond just those 3 large deals, with respect to maybe geography verticals. And maybe give us a little confidence on whether or not the run rate of growth should be able to improve from what you're seeing in the second half, which is really roughly in the 10%, 11% range. Gordon J. Coburn: Sure. So first of all, the larger transformational deals, the revenue largely kicks in next year, not in the second half of this year because, obviously, we have to get regulatory approvals in addition to all that. So that's -- helps drive next year. We are seeing -- we are pleased with the pipeline. You look at Horizon 2 as an example. We can now compete in larger deals. Because it was one of these things, you had to have scale to compete in larger deals. We now have the scale. So when I look at the pipeline, I don't just look at number of deals, but I look at the size of the deals, and the size is clearly materially larger. When I look at our traditional Horizon 1 businesses, clearly, Europe is a lot better than it had been. And that's a combination of the market's more open to it and, quite honestly, our execution has gotten better as we've done some acquisitions and as we've won some marquee names. We're picking up some traction in the Middle East. In the near -- in the short term, certainly, BFS and health care, we expect to be a bit soft. A little too early to know what that'll be for next year in sort of the core, less so the pipeline, but just take growth of the core existing customers. But I want to be -- and we tried to stress this on the earlier part of the call. This is not -- our adjustment in guidance is not due to the market. It's due to specific clients. And fortunately, sometimes, you are fortunate with what your specific clients are doing. And sometimes, you're unfortunate. This time -- many times, we've been fortunate in the past. This time, we've been unfortunate. But it is isolated to a relatively -- the majority of the impact is isolated to a relatively small number of clients. The overall market demand, we're actually feeling quite good about, as -- and I think you've seen that evidence from many of our competitors. Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division : All right. I mean, so given that -- those points, I mean, should we expect that the sort of pickup, the 2015 growth rates should look better? Only because if it's just a specific few clients, the core underlying organic story is still just pretty much unchanged. And it looks like you're adding some larger transformational business as well. And then lastly, these clients potentially could come back at some point. Francisco D'souza: Look, I think -- it's Frank. I think the fundamentals of our industry remain very, very strong, right? Our thesis has been that we operate in a very large market that's highly fragmented, and it gives the opportunity for us to gain incremental share. And that -- those fundamentals still hold. And so I think we're very confident that, with our strategy of reinvesting in the business, there are still a lot of long-term growth opportunities. And in the long run, I think we can continue to drive industry-leading growth. It's too early for me to comment on 2015 specifically. As you know, we go through the cycle at -- towards the end of the year and in the early part of the subsequent year as clients go through the budgeting process and so on and so forth. But when I step back and just look at the overall situation, we're going through this big transition in the market in technology that's creating this dual mandate for our clients. We're still in a fragmented market. We are underpenetrated in key geographies around the world. I think those fundamentals remain strong and allow us to, if we continue to invest, to maintain industry-leading growth. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : It sounded like we saw some delays in project ramps in the back half of the year. What gives us confidence that, that doesn't continue on some of these new projects? And will you be taking over any assets on the new projects? Gordon J. Coburn: So Joe, I'm assuming you're talking more about the larger transformational deals. It took a little longer just to get all our ducks in a row, and then you run into some year-end timing of when you start doing the work. So some of that did get pushed out from what we initially expected. On the -- we will be picking up some intellectual property as part of one of these deals, which we think we can leverage with other clients. So there will be some asset pickups as part of this in terms of intellectual property. And we're taking on some people who we think are going to be wonderful contributors on a long-term basis. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay. So maybe you could just give us some idea of like how the longer-term transformational deals differ from the traditional businesses that you normally do. And give us some idea of how that translates into revenues as we start to see larger pieces of this in your pipeline. Gordon J. Coburn: I'm not sure it -- they differ materially from a revenue standpoint. As they start ramping up, we recognize revenue depending on the deal, if it's time and material or if it's fixed price. So I'm not sure the dynamics are any different, other than when do you start the ramp-up. The margin profiles, those will differ from client to client. Some are normal margin profiles from day 1. Others, you have an investment phase. But obviously, we can handle the -- we have the room for that within our existing margin ranges. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Regarding the client-specific issues, how much of those are due to leadership change versus customers not spending as much as you expected? And when you see leadership changes, what's your history there? Will the new leaders come in and decide to do something different? Or does it just turn out to be a delay of business? Gordon J. Coburn: The answer is it's a combination. There are some cases where you have a new leader come in and they want to reevaluate overall IT priorities. Other times, they want to reevaluate their sourcing strategy. But normally, it's they just want to understand what they're spending money on. In other cases, it's situations where a client is just going to spend less money. And that's going to impact us as well. Or that their priorities of sourcing have changed. So it's -- when I look across the handful of clients where we've been impacted, it's no single answer, but it's -- it tends to be some combination of all those. Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : On the integrated deals, is it that the market is buying in a different way, or more that Cognizant is now able to provide a broader set of capabilities, and so you're seeing these larger deals and, therefore, some delays? Francisco D'souza: I think it's probably -- it's -- the market is, I think, buying in a different way. Steve, I think that there is a growing recognition in the marketplace. And it's a position that we hold as well, that by combining service lines together, we can drive greater levels of efficiency and effectiveness for clients. And as you know, clients across the industries that we serve, we've been talking about this for some time, are under continued pressure to drive ever-greater levels of productivity, efficiency, effectiveness. That's what we call the run better part of the dual mandate. And so creating these large integrated deals is just a natural outcome of that. In parallel with that, since we recognized this trend several years ago, we've been building out the core individual service lines that are required to service these large integrated deals. And largely, those are the traditional Cognizant application development and application maintenance service line, the IT Infrastructure service line and the BPS service line, and all of that wrapped with a consulting layer that Cognizant Business Consulting provides. So we feel like we're well positioned. Our capabilities, the ones that we've invested in over the last few years, really enable us to play in these large integrated deals. Operator : We'll move on to the next question, which is coming from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : This is a follow-up regarding the large deals. You indicated that you're going to take some assets. Will there be a margin impact from those deals? Anything unusual there? I think that's going to be helpful if you provide some color on that. And then, obviously, you've expanded your share buyback program. On the flip side of it, what's the logic for not introducing a symbolic dividend payment sometime this year? Gordon J. Coburn: Sure. Let me take the first question of, on the larger deals, is there a margin impact. Each -- with these large deals, both the 3 that we talked about here and others, the margin -- the characteristics are a little bit different on each one. Some, it's sort of normal margins or steady margins from day 1. Others, there are an investment period. But let me be clear, the ones where there are investment period, we can handle those within our existing margin profile because they are also larger deals that are coming out of the investment period. So as long as you kind of have these things staggered, you're fine. So we're comfortable with that. But the margin -- the timing of the margin will differ from deal to deal. On capital structure, as we've been saying for a while, we think the right answer for us is to focus on share repurchases. And if you look historically, we've been a -- we've looked at relative valuation of Cognizant to the market in terms of deciding how aggressive to be. And even in Q2, we picked up the pace of acquisition -- of share repurchases from Q1. Obviously, we're signaling that we can -- we expect to continue to do share repurchases with the expansion of the program. We do not have any plans near term to focus on a dividend. Because a dividend, once you start doing it, obviously, you want to continue doing it. And this is still a very dynamic market. We think we're going to end up being a clear leader in the market, and we want to make sure we have the flexibility to do that as acquisitions may come up or other things may come up. So we don't want to box ourselves in, and that's why we think share repurchases are the right way to go, because it gives us more flexibility. And obviously, even before today, share repurchases were accretive to earnings. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Just a couple real quick. But maybe just coming back to the client-specific issues, just to be clear, are these just kind of delays in decision-making? Or has there sort of been a reallocation or a cut in either the technology or offshore budgets of the clients for this year? Just trying to -- wanted to understand that a little better. Francisco D'souza: I think it's a little bit of both, frankly, Glenn. What's happened is, as Gordon said, sometimes, we're seeing clients reassessing priorities, shifting dollars from, say, run better to run different kinds of initiatives. And other times, it's just been just straight delays, frankly, where projects get pushed out. And as I said earlier, when that happens, just given the calendarization and the timing of things during the year, it becomes difficult to, essentially, to catch up in the year. Gordon J. Coburn: Also, we do see a client here and there where they have a real budget gap that they have to close, which goes against overall industry trends. But it does impact that particular client, and we've seen that as well. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : And Gordon, maybe you could help us. I mean, you obviously -- it's a pretty big cut for the back half, a little over $200 million in revenue. The degree of conservatism you're thinking about into the back half, to just sort of like, well, if you're going to cut, cut hard? But I just want to understand how you're thinking of the back half. Gordon J. Coburn: I think our thinking about it is similar to what you just described. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Charles Brennan with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Charles Brennan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : It's actually coming back to the idea of 2015, if we can. I know you don't want to give some specific guidance, but the guidance for the back half of 2014 is for slowing momentum. It's something like 12% growth in the third quarter falling to something like 8% in the fourth quarter. That gives us a fairly weak exit run rate. Are you confident that Q4 is the low point of the growth cycle? And then as we look at 2015, you're obviously going to be facing some tough comps in the first half. Is it going to be one of those hockey-stick years, where we're relying on the second half to deliver the growth? Gordon J. Coburn: So let me caveat my comments with we've not gone through the budget cycle with clients, and we clearly don't want to get ahead of ourselves and talk about 2015. But we -- the issues we face this year are not market demand issues, and you're seeing that from our competitors. They are client-specific to us. When we look at those that are client-specific to us, we think a lot of the -- many of those challenges wash out of the system by the end of this year. So I don't think we have the headwinds from those specific clients as we go into next year, or at least in aggregate. But obviously, we want to go through the planning cycle with the other 900 and -- or other 1,000 clients before we have a full view on 2013. Certainly, we're pleased that we have some stuff under our belt now with these transformational deals that we've won. And certainly, we've been winning other stuff, just doesn't rise to the size that were talked about on the call. Charles Brennan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And just why doesn't lower spend in the second half annualize in the first half of next year? Are you assuming that spend comes back? Or are you assuming that business wins overcompensate for it? Gordon J. Coburn: In the term -- use the term business wins, not just new logos but growth of existing accounts. Essentially, we have an anchor of a handful of accounts that are offsetting really quite healthy growth at the vast majority of our accounts. And we -- and that anchor doesn't continue to decline as we go into next year, is our belief. But once again, we haven't done the planning yet on what the other 1,000 clients will do. That will be part of the budget process. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I just want to dig in a little bit to the mix of revenue attributable to renewals. How is that this year relative to last year? And what are those conversations like with your customers? And I understand that some of your peers have been very competitive, particularly on the outsourcing front, and just want to get a sense of when it comes for -- it comes time for renewal, you indicated pricing is stable. But how are you able to maintain that stable pricing in that environment? Francisco D'souza: Yes, I think -- this is Frank. Let me -- Brian, let me just step back and say, first of all, that I think there are different kinds of renewal circumstances and situations. And I think, as I said earlier, the vast majority of our business continues to be what I think of as the traditional model in which we've operated, where we tend to have preferred vendor status with a client and we win projects incrementally as the clients identify new work. Now sometimes, that's renewal work. For example, we might be doing an engagement -- a maintenance engagement that comes up, and then the client renews it. That tends to be one renewal cycle. And generally speaking, those fall under the overall sort of master agreement that we have with the client. Those master services agreements will sometimes come up for renewal once every several years. And the competitive dynamics there have largely remained unchanged, I think, over several years. There's nothing remarkable about that. So that's what I consider to be the normal cycle of our business. On top of that, we're seeing this trend towards larger deals. And I think we are benefiting from this trend towards larger deals. There, what's happening is that the client is either taking a traditional, what I would consider to be a more legacy kind of contract, usually that's in infrastructure, and moving it to a global services model and then combining that with applications and/or with BPO to create these integrated deals. In those cases, the competitive dynamics are such that we're able to drive a lot of additional value by combining those together. We have a very, very strong process historically of understanding what the levers are that we can pull in each of those circumstances and translate that into, as Gordon said earlier, lower total cost of ownership for the client. In those cases, the competitive dynamics are such that the advisors play a little bit of a stronger role. And oftentimes, as is the case in some of the big transactions that we announced today, the scope of those larger deals includes some current scope that Cognizant is already executing. So in a sense, it becomes a renewal, but a much larger renewal because you take the existing scope of work that we might already be executing for the client, you add a lot more around it to create a much larger deal. So that's sort of a second kind of renewal circumstance. So I don't know if that gives you some color around how these renewals are playing out. But overall, we feel good about our competitive position and our ability to win in those circumstances. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And just want to touch real quick on attrition. Unless we misheard it, it looked like it spiked in the quarter, and I think some of your peers are having similar issues. Maybe if you can comment on what's being done to address attrition and how that might impact the, I guess, seasonal increase in promotional and salary increase spend that you're seeing going into the back half of the year. Gordon J. Coburn: Sure. So going from Q1 to Q2, we always see an increase in attrition -- or almost always. The reason why is we pay out our bonuses in March. So people who are waiting for their bonuses who are planning to leave would leave, plus you have people going back for higher education. So we're down about 2 points from second quarter of last year. Still running a little bit higher than we want but certainly in better shape than we -- much better shape than we were last year. That's one reason, obviously, why we gave salary increments at the higher end of the industry, because we wanted to send a strong message to our people about the -- at Cognizant, they can have terrific careers and great growth paths. So we'll continue to watch it. But the key things we're doing is a lot of efforts around employee engagement that we started when we saw a spike last year, and that has helped things. We've given healthy increments, which we think will help things. So continue to keep an eye on it, but the trend is actually -- seasonally adjusted trend is actually going in the direction that we want. Not fully there, but certainly, we've made good progress. Operator : Our final question is coming from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I appreciate some of the comments around what appears to be conservatism for the back half. But obviously, it's the second straight quarter where it seems like we've been caught off guard a bit by clients' spending plans. So I'm just wondering if this is causing you to rethink, on a kind of more structural basis, any of your internal budgeting and forecasting processes as well as how you might translate the output of those processes to the formal guidance that you give to the Street. Francisco D'souza: Jason, I think, look, we've -- we're taking a long, hard look at all of our internal processes to understand if we need to adjust how we think about our own forecasting and then, as you said, translating that into the guidance that we provide. I think the reality is that we're going through a somewhat of a transition in the marketplace, as I've said several times over the last quarters, where you have these big technology shifts going on. And that's leading to some -- I think it's leading to 2 things, right? One is great opportunity for us. I feel really optimistic about how we're positioned and the opportunities that are available to us in the marketplace. It also leads to a more dynamic market, a much more dynamic demand environment with shifting client priorities. And that makes it a little difficult to get clear longer-term fixes on exactly where we are in terms of revenue and so on and so forth. We'll continue to do everything we possibly can to strengthen our internal processes and to give you and the rest of our investors a clear -- as clear a picture as we can. That's been our historical approach. At this point, I don't see sort of fundamental internal operational issues that would require us to retool the way we forecast or anything like that fundamentally. But we continue to look at that just all the time and look at how we, ourselves, can run better and run different, just as we explain that to our clients. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And just a very quick follow-up on that. The 2 points of growth -- or at least 2 points, I guess, of growth that you're expecting, you -- renew deals to add to next year's growth rate. I mean, would you characterize the degree of conservatism around those 2 points of growth the same way you would the degree of conservatism for the back half of 2014? Or is it still just a little bit early to really know what those -- what the ramp on those deals is going to look like? Because it seems like that could end up being a very significant swing factor in determining whether or not next year's growth rate could potentially accelerate a little bit versus this year's growth rate. Gordon J. Coburn: Yes. I think the ramp is fairly clear, based on the assumption of timing of when it starts next year, and we've been a little bit conservative on the timing just to play it safe. Obviously, as we've said in our press release, the Health Net deal is subject to contract finalization and applicable regulatory approvals, which -- so we've got to get through that process. But we've been a bit conservative in terms of when the ramp actually starts. Francisco D'souza: All right. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us today and for your questions. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2014 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll start with the highlights of our third quarter results and outlook for the rest of the year. And also take some time to share with you some of the broader industry trends that we\u2019re seeing. Gordon will then discuss our detailed operating results and Karen will provide further details on our financial metrics and guidance before we open up the line for Q&A. Our results this quarter was solid and slightly ahead of the guidance we provided to you at the end of last quarter. For the third quarter, we delivered revenue of $2.58 billion. As expected our non-GAAP operating margin was within our guided range of 19% to 20%. We now expect full year 2014 revenues to be between $10.13 billion and $10.16 billion, reflecting our performance this quarter and our improved outlook for the reminder of the year. This provided guidance excludes any impact of the pending TriZetto acquisition. As you are aware, last quarter we reported some weakness in certain clients and longer than expected sales cycles for certain large integrated deals. We see the impact of those two factors abating and expect them to no longer be a concern as we go into next year. We\u2019re confident in our strategy and as we start planning for 2015 we find that our run better, run different value proposition is firmly in step with the needs of the market. This was first evident in industries such as healthcare and financial services. We can now see it playing out across all of the industries that we serve, as it\u2019s apparent in the number of end-to-end integrated deals in our pipeline today, as well as in the demand for solutions based on new digital technologies. Let me explain this a little bit more. Many quarters back we saw signs of significant technology shift and a corresponding business model change driven by the ongoing volatility in major economies on one hand and the advent of new digital technologies on the other. We said that the only way for businesses to adapt would be to simultaneously execute on efficiency and scale with existing systems, while driving business innovation through newer technologies. We refer to this as the dual mandate. And one way to understand it better is through the lens of what\u2019s happening in the healthcare industry. Although I\u2019m going to speak specifically about healthcare here, we see the effects of the dual mandate playing out across multiple industries and geographies. Healthcare, especially in the U.S. is seeing significant disruption on account of regulatory reforms, aging populations, new technologies, greater need for transparency and increasing price competition. As a result healthcare clients are increasingly demanding end-to-end solutions that help them drive efficient operations, while investing for future growth to deal with the challenges facing the healthcare industry today. We believe our acquisition of TriZetto and our transformative deal with Health Net, the two biggest transactions in our history bring us significantly closer to being able to create and provide this type of end-to-end solution in the healthcare industry. With TriZetto platforms serving half of the U.S. population and a quarter of the providers in the United States, coupled with the operating expertise and technology of Health Net, there\u2019s really an opportunity here for us to reinvent healthcare in very fundamental ways. With an underlying software platform running on infrastructure provided by Cognizant, delivered over the cloud, combined with the services required to run the business process, we will be able to offer a fully-integrated service to our clients and charge them on a per transaction or per user basis. On one side of the dual mandate solutions like these allow us to work with healthcare peers and providers to optimize existing G&A spend, while improving the quality of their service. And on the other side of the dual mandate we\u2019re actively working with healthcare clients on digital technology based innovation, creating for them increased agility in launching new products and participating in new markets to drive new sources of revenue. The great example of how by enabling clients to be more efficient in their use of capital resources we are creating new opportunities for innovation in products and services for the healthcare industry. We have spoken at length about Health Net and TriZetto in previous calls, and Gordon and Karen will provide updates for each of them in a few minutes. Before I close, I would like to spend a few minutes talking to you about the demand environment as reinforced by our client conversations from our recently concluded Cognizant Community Event. As you know, we have invested over the past three years to build our digital capabilities, and as previously indicated have seen significant traction of our social, mobile, analytics, and cloud offerings with clients. Across industries, we are seeing business reinvention, driven by the rapid consumerization of technology. This is bringing the physical and the digital worlds close together, and as a result, almost every physical process is being instrumented and digitized. Against this backdrop, we see four emerging needs and corresponding opportunities for Cognizant across the industries. Let me catch upon them briefly. First, we are seeing an integration of SKUs combining new skills like data science, design, instrumentation, and embedded sensors, with traditional skills like consulting and technology. These SKUs then work closely with client teams to produce rapid, short cycles of innovation. Second, distilling and applying meaning from the digital data surrounding every person, process, organization, and device, or what we call a Code Halo, is leading to an urgent demand for interdisciplinary skills around data science, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. Third, digital technologies are becoming prevalent throughout our clients businesses, which is resulting in opportunities to expand beyond the CIOs office to departments such as marketing. And finally, we see a need for deep, scalable expertise and foundation of technologies of social, mobile, analytics and cloud, which when combined with appropriate security models will be critical for enabling clients to realize their digital ambitions. In order to quickly realize value from digital technologies, we are working across our business units and bringing together strategy and industry knowledge, design, process thinking, and technology and data science. In the coming quarters, we will talk in more detail about our go-to-market model for our digital business, but we are making investments in all of the areas, I just spoke about. This quarter we acquired Cadient, a full-service digital marketing agency that caters to the nuances of the life sciences industry. Gordon will share more details on that in a few minutes. I'm very excited about the new areas of growth and ways of working, which I believe fits very well with our entrepreneurial culture. With that, I will now hand it to \u2013hand the call over to Gordon to share more about our performance, and to Karen to provide financial details. I will be back for the Q&A. Gordon? Gordon Coburn : Thank you, Francisco. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first provide some additional color on the current demand environment, update you on the large transformational deal with Health Net, and the status of planning for integration with TriZetto, as well as briefly discuss our recent acquisition of Cadient. Similar to what we indicated three months ago, the overall demand environment remains strong. This is reflected in our strong order pipeline and our record number of new hires during Q3. We are pleased to have achieved these results slightly ahead of our Q3 revenue guidance and our confident in our increased guidance for the full year. As expected, the client specific weakness and delays in project ramps that we spoke about last quarter, will continue to impact results through the remainder of this year, but as Frank said, this should abate as we finish the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we spoke about our transformative engagement with Health Net, which is the largest contract value in our history. As recently announced by Health Net, the contract has been signed. Health Net has begun the process of securing regulatory approval and we anticipate that we will begin to ramp up this engagement once regulatory approvals are completed in the first-half of next year. Moving onto TriZetto. We are preparing to close the $2.7 billion acquisition of TriZetto. Karen will comment on the financing of this acquisition in a few minutes. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, but I can share with you that detailed integration plans are well underway within our healthcare practice, as well as at the corporate level. Importantly, the response to the pending TriZetto acquisition from clients in both healthcare and our other industry verticals has been positive and is generating excitement around what this can mean for their businesses. Finally, our recent announcement of the acquisition of Cadient further expands the scope of digital marketing capabilities we can bring to our clients. Cadient is a full-service digital marketing firm serving the life sciences industry. As Frank mentioned, we see an increasing opportunity to expand beyond the CIOs office. And Cadient further strengthens our ability to participate in the brand marketing budgets of life sciences clients. Additionally, we fully expect to leverage the IP that comes with Cadient and pursue industry segments beyond life sciences. From an industry perspective, our banking and financial services segment grew 2.2% sequentially and 13.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in insurance, where there is growing interest in end-to-end managed services. On the banking side, underlying demand drives from regulatory compliance, real-time risk monitoring, and fraud and trade surveillance support longer-term growth. Additionally, our financial services clients are looking to us to build and integrate SMAC solutions. Projects to include implemented solutions to enhance the customer experience in areas such as mobile banking and card application processes, or analytics, where we provide end-to-end solutions in areas such as mortgage model implementation, monitoring and validation, or digital and multichannel analysis. Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payor, pharmaceutical, and medical device clients, grew 1.5% sequentially, and 9.2% year-over-year. Within the pharmaceutical sector for a second quarter in a row, we experienced above the average sequential \u2013 above the average company's sequential growth, as clients look to us to help optimize their IT applications and operations. In addition, we are pleased with the net new business we are winning from our existing clients, as well as several new clients. We believe that we are well positioned in the coming year in multiple areas of importance, including M&A integration on some key deals we closed for our clients \u2013 that we\u2019ll close for our clients in the coming months and new product launches with the capabilities we acquired through the Cadient acquisition will be applicable. To help the demand from our pharmaceutical clients and help to offset the continued softness in our payor sector, something that we highlighted in the first-half of this year. The payor industry has taken a more cautious approach through investment this year, and specially off to a significant level of investment and tying in with public health insurance exchanges during 2013. However, our confidence in the longer-term opportunities in the healthcare market is demonstrated by the acquisition of TriZetto and the engagement with Health Net Our regional and manufacturing segment improved sequentially up 3.6% compared to the second quarter and up 8.6% over Q3 of 2013. On the manufacturing and logistics side, we saw good growth from both increased spend at existing clients, as well as the addition of new logos. Clients in these industries continue to focus on solutions to drive operational efficiency by modernizing their existing systems, sampling their supply chains, and embracing SMAC solutions such as Internet-enabled devices to improve supply chain visibility and logistics operations. Our retail practice also saw a good growth in Q3 after a slow start in the first-half of this year. Our other segment, which include high-tech, communications, and information, media, and entertainment clients showed solid growth in the quarter, up 3.8% sequentially and 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by further penetration with our existing clients. Let me now turn to a detailed discussion of our Horizon 2 service lines, where we continue to be pleased with the market pressure we are realizing. Our BPS practice saw continued traction during the quarter, largely on the ramp up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance, and healthcare. Demand for our vertically aligned business processes such as membership enrolment and revenue cycle management in healthcare, and claims processing and mortgage services in insurance and financial services remains strong. We believe having an industry focus BPS practice is critically important in driving future utility like delivery models based on what we refer to as BPaaS or business process as a service. Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continued its pace of above-company average growth. CBC is the key differentiator for us as we compete, win, and execute transformational engagements across various industry segments. Clients expect us to bring industry specific thought leadership to them and we do so through CBC. Just one example, working with one of our pharmaceutical clients, CBC led a consulted approach to a large post-merger transformation \u2013 the transformation deal from sourcing and financial modeling to change management expertise and ensuring minimal disruption to clients business operations. Today\u2019s hyper connected world requires both sides of the dual mandate; efficiency and innovation to be brought to market in accelerated manner. And CBC's strategic focus aligns perfectly with this expectation. We believe CBC's role will continue to grow in importance, as our clients look to our consultants to drive process \u2013 business process innovation to transform the organizations and lead the adoption of digital solutions. IT infrastructure services had another strong quarter. We\u2019re seeing solid demand from clients looking to simplify, optimize, and automate their infrastructure through newer delivery models or integrated solutions requiring both IT infrastructure management and application management. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 2.7% sequentially and 11.1% year-over-year. Revenue from Europe grew 1.3% sequentially and 13.9% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, Europe grew 2.7% sequentially. Following some client specific weakness in the second quarter, the UK grew 4.1% sequentially, or 4.8% in constant currency terms. Continental Europe declined 2.6% sequentially and it was roughly flat in constant currency terms. We expect solid growth in the continent over the coming years. As we anticipate that the structural shift towards larger multiyear outsourcing programs drives expanded opportunities. The rest of the world continued to show good growth of 4.4% sequentially and 18.2% year-over-year. Now, let me turn the call over to Karen to provide more details on our numbers. Karen McLoughlin :  Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $2.58 billion represented growth of 2.5% sequentially, and 11.9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.5%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.66 exceeded our previous guidance by $0.03. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 53.5% and 46.5% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 5.1% sequentially, and 18% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were flat sequentially and grew 5.7% from Q3 a year ago. During the second quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We closed the quarter with 1,255 active clients and added seven strategic customers, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 264. Today, we have repurchased approximately 34.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.13 billion under the share repurchase authorization of $2 billion, and have approximately $870 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count remains flat at 612.1 million shares in the quarter. Due to our knowledge of the TriZetto announcement, we were restricted from repurchasing shares during the third quarter. Receivables were $2.1 billion, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 76.5 days, essentially flat with last quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $338 million, up from $298 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 57% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables and the ramp up of certain new long-term fixed-bid contracts. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the third quarter with approximately $4.6 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $489 million from the quarter ending June 30, and up by approximately $1.3 billion from the year-ago period. During the third quarter, operating activities generated approximately $583 million of cash. Financing activities were approximately $8.4 million use of cash, and capital expenditures were approximately $55.6 million during the quarter. As mentioned previously, we are preparing to close the acquisition of TriZetto. The funding for this acquisition will come from approximately $1.7 billion of cash on hand, and $1 billion debt facility. This debt is expected to be in the form of syndicated term loan. Additionally, we anticipate securing $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics for the quarter. During the quarter, we added approximately 12,300 net new hires, and ended the quarter with nearly 200,000 employees globally, approximately 187,500 of which were service delivery staff. 43% of our new hires were direct college hires, while 57% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. Annualized attrition of 15.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down by 350 basis points from the year-ago period, and over 100 basis points from Q2 of this year. Attrition levels are something we continue to monitor very closely, and we\u2019re pleased by the sequential and year-over-year decline in this metric. Utilization declined on a sequential basis as we on-boarded the net new hires. Offshore utilization was approximately 72%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates during our training program, was approximately 80% and on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for the rest of the year. This guidance excludes any impact from the acquisition of TriZetto. We now expect our full-year revenues to be in the range of $10.13 billion to $10.16 billion. We\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re able to increase guidance by, at least, $50 million, despite having to absorb a currency headwind of approximately $40 million since our previous guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect to deliver revenue of between $2.61 billion and $2.64 billion, including approximately $4 million of revenue from the Cadient acquisition. During the fourth quarter, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Also for the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of, at least, $0.63, our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 612 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.5%. We now expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of, at least, $2.57 for the full year. This guidance anticipates the full-year share count of approximately 612.3 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.3%. Now, we\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG :  Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask about the two things of weakness that you guys have kind of said, called out as improving. One, I think, last year the weakness was longer sales cycles, sounds like that close, just want to get some color on what\u2019s happened in the pipeline? And then two, client weakness, it sounds like you\u2019re not seeing or not worrying about that as we head into 2015, so just one extra color on those two things? Thanks. Gordon Coburn :  Hey, Bryan, it\u2019s Gordon. So on longer sales cycles, those comments were related to on these very large deals, they are just more complex and they take longer, it\u2019s really tougher to project. And we talked about three deals last quarter and those took a little longer to sign. In terms of our normal deals, sales cycles have been normal all year. So I don\u2019t see any change in our sales cycle from earlier in the year. But let me be clear, that our sales cycle earlier in the year on, normal deals is absolutely fine and complex deals, it takes longer, and I would expect the future complex deals, those will be \u2013 those will continue to take long and that\u2019s baked into our planning. In terms of client weakness, when we took our guidance down at the end of the second quarter, we pointed to \u2013 it was a handful of clients that was impacting that not overall demand environment. I think that continues to be the right statement. The overall demand environment is healthy. Those four clients \u2013 four or five clients did impact us. The impact of that fully washes through the system by the end of Q4. Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG :  Okay. Just a quick follow-up on outsourcing still flat sequentially, I think on growth. What's the outlook in the outsourcing business and congrats on the quarter. Francisco D'Souza Sure, so the outsourcing business is alive and well. When I think about some of the large deals that we\u2019ve won, such as Health Net and such as the deal we won with a large high-end financial services segment, those will be heavily weighted towards outsourcing, so there is a little bit of a low there, but when I look at the pipeline of deals that I won that start to ramp up next year certainly I would expect growth in outsourcing as well. Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Hi, good morning. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 more about Europe, particularly the variance in the sequential growth in United Kingdom versus the continent? Thank you. Francisco D'Souza: Hey, it\u2019s Frank. I think when we spoke \u2013 last quarter when you looked at the UK, we had a sequentially down quarter. Part of that was because some of these specific client situations to which we referred last quarter were in the UK, as that as Gordon pointed out, as that starts to flush through the system the underlying growth of the UK, which we think is still \u2013 which is still help these coming, it\u2019s showing in the numbers now. I think the continent will continue to be \u2013 it\u2019s a great opportunity right now. We are underpenetrated in the continent, both at Cognizant level, but as an industry, global sourcing, I think there\u2019s still a lot of opportunity in the continent, but historically the continent has been a more \u2013 market has been more focused on discretionary spending. And so as we see the shift from discretionary spending to our outsourcing in the continent you\u2019ll find that that it will be somewhat lumpy and I think you saw that this quarter, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything fundamentally to read into that beyond the normal what I think of as continental European lumpiness. Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Can you talk a little bit about the success of the India-centric firms in continental Europe and getting them to embrace doing their outsourcing work in India as opposed to doing it maybe more regionally? Are you seeing a shift there and is that a factor in both your current numbers and your outlook. Francisco D'Souza: I would say, we\u2019ve said for years now that the model in continental Europe will require us to have very strong local presence, combined with a very solid near-shore delivery center and then, of course, with the global delivery model. You need all three pieces. You need a very strong local presence in country. You need a regional delivery network and you need a global delivery \u2013 a set of global delivery locations to serve continental Europe and all three of those pieces need to be in place. Now we feel very good about our presence in continental Europe because of that, as you know, we\u2019ve invested very heavily both organically and inorganically to build out the local presence, going back to the acquisition that we did several years ago in Benelux of Infopulse, more recently Equinox in France and C1 in Germany. And then, of course, we\u2019ve also built the regional delivery network with regional centers in several locations, including our most recent regional delivery center in Spain. We also have in the South of France and in Eastern Europe, and so on, that will continue to build out the regional delivery centers in Europe, and then, of course, the global delivery mechanism. So we feel very strong about our presence there and we think that you need all three of those pieces to succeed in continental Europe. Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. Mayank Tandon \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to focus on the SMAC side, what percent of Horizon 3 are SMAC today, Gordon or Frank? And then as you look at the business are you winning that from new customers or is most of the growth coming from clients where you already have very long term relationships with? And then finally on that, competitively are you seeing more niche players competing for the SMAC work or is it till the large SIs that you typically compete with for outsourcing type projects? Gordon Coburn : Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Gordon. So a couple of things, we\u2019re seeing very healthy demand for SMAC and Digital within Horizon 3 and certainly that becomes the biggest component of Horizon 3, just given that\u2019s what customers are buying today. And we have just tremendous capabilities to deliver in the SMAC and Digital area. Who we\u2019re doing the work for? Certainly, it\u2019s weighted towards projects at existing customers, because we have the relationships those can kick in faster, but we are also successful at using it as a foot in the door with new clients, because clients are looking for innovative ideas in Digital and SMAC. And we have some really good thought leadership. I\u2019m sure many of you\u2019ve read Code Halo book that we had published. People read that and they say come on in and talk to us at the C-Suite level. Who do we see competing? It\u2019s more weighted towards the fully integrated SI, but certainly there are bunch of niche players out there, so we compete with both, but when you look at the where the lion\u2019s share of the revenue is going, it\u2019s going to the larger SIs including us. Mayank Tandon \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, I have a couple of questions about TriZetto. Gordon, you mentioned that the integration plans are well underway. Can you talk a little bit about what the plan is for continuing the innovation on the underlying TriZetto product in continuing to improve and modernize that product? Gordon Coburn : Sure, Lisa. We\u2019re just thrilled about the technology and the capabilities, the subject matter expertise, the relationships we\u2019re getting as part of the TriZetto acquisition. We are planning \u2013 we want to make sure we continue to have best-in-class products and so certainly we\u2019re going to invest in the TriZetto platform and equally importantly remember, we also now have a really world class platform that we \u2013 as part of the Health Net acquisition and we\u2019re going to invest heavily in that. So we\u2019ll have a range of platforms that as we invest in them, we believe will be best-in-class depending on what the specific needs are of the clients. So we\u2019re taking something that\u2019s good and we plan to make it even better. Lisa Ellis \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Perfect. And then I think when you first announced TriZetto, it looked like sort of from the charts on the revenue synergies that the majority of the synergies expected in 2015 were likely to be systems integration work related, which I guess interpret to mean Cognizant selling your services into a lot of TriZetto\u2019s base. Can you just talk about a bit of like tactically what\u2019s the plan is there to kind of drive quick revenue synergies in 2015? Gordon Coburn : Sure, so obviously we\u2019re only in the planning phase, right now. We haven\u2019t begun any of the execution and we wouldn\u2019t until the transaction closes, but certainly there\u2019s synergy opportunities where clients are interested in broader range of services that Cognizant has the capability to offer at scale, where TriZetto on its own would not have had at scale. So clearly that opportunity exists and those are near term. Longer term obviously, the big opportunity in our mind is the \u2013 having a fully integrated offering, similar to what we\u2019re doing to Health Net where we do that with the TriZetto platform, but obviously that\u2019s a much longer sale cycle. So I think you\u2019re right in thinking about the synergy on the IT services near term and longer term is the full stock opportunity. Lisa Ellis \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, I think you talked about on maybe the last call $200 million of incremental revenue. I was wondering is that still a relevant number for 2015. And how should we look about that \u2013 at that given the visibility on Health Net and the acquisition has probably improved as well? Francisco D'Souza: I think that the $200 million number is the right number, that\u2019s certainly \u2013 that\u2019s certainly what that we\u2019re focused on. That reflects the timing of when we think that Health Net deal will close. So yes, I think our prior thoughts on that are still applicable. Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. And then just sort of a two-part question if I could, in some of the contracts that you had some issues with this year, has \u2013 what can we expect for those to \u2013 from a comeback perspective in 2015, do you think you\u2019ll get half of that business back and some of it. And then the second part of that is, did seasonality change at all, now that you\u2019re doing a little bit more. It sounds like transaction based work on the healthcare side? Francisco D'Souza: So let me start with seasonality. Certainly, in the platform business or the TriZetto business there is more seasonality than in our traditional business weighted towards the fourth quarter. But given the overall size of the company, I don\u2019t know if it significantly moves the needle on overall company revenue, but for that, that piece of the business certainly there's more seasonality. Sorry could you repeat the first part of the question? Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yes, I was just wondering some of the business got pushed delayed, or maybe even you lost it heading into the back half of this year cause you to change your guidance. I was just wondering, what can we expect, is that going to be fully recovered in 2015, or will we get half of it back? I\u2019m just trying to gauge sort of, how that works out into next year\u2019s numbers? Francisco D'Souza: Sure. So I would not think about it as pent-up demand, where they just defer the project and therefore they\u2019re going to give us that plus normal business. So I think that the revenue that we got hit with this year, that is \u2013 that revenue is lost now. Will some of these accounts start to grow, and I think the answer is yes, some of them will \u2013 but certainly not all of them. But remember, put it in perspective, we are talking about a single handful of accounts. Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Right, great. Francisco D'Souza: So we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are and with those accounts is playing out, just as we expected. Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Hi, thank you. I had two, also, the first is, perhaps for you Karen. Could you talk a little bit about the puts and takes in operating margins for this quarter relative to last year? Your non-GAAP operating margins were down about 90 basis points. And as part of that discussion for both, the September and December quarter, the variance between GAAP and non-GAAP has widened a bit, both from acquisition-related charges, as well as stock-based comp. Is that going to be a relatively static spread, as we look at the December quarter? And then I have a follow-up please. Karen McLoughlin :  Sure, Keith. So on the operating margin versus last year, two big things, one is obviously raises kicked in Q3 as we had expected them to. And then the second thing is utilization. So utilization with the 12,000 hires that we did in Q3 is up or is down rather quite considerably over two points from last year. So it\u2019s really that combination of utilization and then raises and promotions, which took margins down into the 19.5% range, frankly as we had expected we said the margins would come down from where they had been running in Q2 and generally right in line with what we expected. Then in terms of the GAAP to non-GAAP spread, that will fluctuation. So obviously once we close the TriZetto acquisition, acquisition and amortization will increase quite significantly. We'll obviously have better color on that when we actually close the deal and can provide guidance on those numbers. But what you did see in Q3 was some of the acquisition-related expenses due diligence and so forth, and that will obviously spill over into Q4 as well moving forward. So, certainly over time, we would expect that debt to grow, which is one of the reasons, frankly, why we\u2019ve been moving towards this non-GAAP definition and non-GAAP guidance moving forward. Gordon Coburn : And let me just add to that. We clearly think the way to think about the businesses on a non-GAAP basis, particularly as the spread widens due to the purchase accounting on TriZetto. Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Related to that, Gordon, is my second question. When you think about closing TriZetto and Health Net, could you just confirm how we should be thinking about that as we look at calendar year 2015? I know you don\u2019t want to give us specifics, but philosophically, is there any reason why you would maintain in that 19% to 20% range, as you approach FY'15, including even the beginning of the year as you are trying to integrate these assets? Gordon Coburn : Certainly, on a non-GAAP basis, I think, it is a very good assumption that we would stand on 19% to 20% non-GAAP operating margin range, including the impact of both Health Net and TriZetto. Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners :  Thank you. Karen, could you provide a little bit more detail on wage and pricing trends you referenced the wage increase in Q3, and then earlier in the call you talked about stable pricing. Can you just flash that out a little bit more? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. So let me start with pricing and then I think ask Gordon to cover up on the wages. So in terms of pricing, generally, it\u2019s been stable, obviously you will have mix shift that happens so BPO is stronger than consulting, for example. But I think, we\u2019ve seen a very consistent trend over the last several quarters of stable pricing clients and much more focus now on the total cost of outsourcing and looking for partners that can provide real value and provide both the \u2013 as we talked about the run better and run different side of the equation. So help them drive down their cost of doing business, but also help them drive innovation, and that balance is what frankly allows you to maintain stable pricing as long as you\u2019re providing appropriate value. But I'll let, Gordon, talk about the wage increases. Gordon Coburn : So wages landed right in line with what we indicated last quarter, which was a bit above 2013, and I was expected and we talked about that last quarter. So offshore wages were right around the 10% mark, on-site wages were low-single digits, but about a point higher than it was last year. So a little bit up from last year, but no surprises compared to what we thought three months ago. David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners : Thanks. And just could you quantify the revenue from Cadient? Karen McLoughlin : It\u2019s about $4 million in Q4, there was none in Q3. That deal closed in October. David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with question. Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the discussion about four to five large clients that pulled back. Are some now indicating that the ramp growth backup in early 2015, and not pent-up demand, but just the normal course? Gordon Coburn : Both four of those clients and all our clients in general, obviously we\u2019re smack in the middle of the budget process this year. So it\u2019s a little too early to know what each client\u2019s going to do, some \u2013 I would expect some of those to have growth next year, that\u2019s probably not all depending on where they are. So it will be mixed bag and that\u2019s \u2013 and that, and we\u2019re very comfortable with that. Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. And then separately back on utilization, you\u2019ve done a nice job of improving utilization over the last 12 months. I know it\u2019s impacted by turning around new hires, but as you look out to next year do you see that as an area where we could get continued margin leverage? Gordon Coburn : I don\u2019t think there will be a meaningful leverage off of utilization, clearly, we have opportunities in our pyramid. And so we\u2019ll certainly look at that lever a bit. Three is a little of room offshore, on-site we are at our target utilization. But as, I think, Karen mentioned, we certainly have ramped up our hiring of college students. We\u2019re just getting the top, we\u2019ll get such high quality college students right now because of the brand that we\u2019re enjoying both and that\u2019s college hiring in the U.S., in India, as well as Europe, across the globe. So I would think more about pyramid as the level for 2015 less so about utilization. Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. So I know it's obviously preliminary to give any specific numbers for next year, but conceptually given the fact that demand condition seem to be fairly healthy, and you have Health Net as well as a couple other deals ramping up next year. Is there any conceptual reason why organic growth can't be in a similar range next year as it is this year? Gordon Coburn : Look I \u2013 what I'll say, we feel good about the demand environment, right now. We \u2013 the dual mandate that we talked about, it\u2019s truly playing out across the industries we serve. We see a large number of, what we think of it multi-tower integrated deals in the pipeline. I look at that as a proxy for one side of the dual mandate or the efficiency effect in the side of the dual mandate. And then as we\u2019ve said many times, we feel very good about how we're positioned for the demand for new digital technologies. So, fundamentals of the demand are strong. Having said, if you step back and you look at macro environment right at the big market, highly fragmented, lots of geographic growth opportunity for Cognizant, when we think about our presence in the Continental Europe and Asia, those are small, but \u2013 small market for us, large market opportunities. So I think the fundamentals are strong, demand remains strong, and we\u2019ve got a great client base. We were impacted this year by the small handful of very specific client situations. Those we believe abate by the end of the year, so going into next year, we feel good about the environment, early conversations with clients don\u2019t give us cause for concern at this point. Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies LLC : And my next question about the demand environment, I mean, in terms of the integrated deals, which obviously are larger in terms of the (inaudible) presumably longer in terms of their sales cycle. Is that something that we should think about being semi-permanent, at least, part of your pipeline? In other words could there be more lumpiness going forward? Gordon Coburn : I think it\u2019s fair to say, you will see more of these in the pipeline. But just keep it in perspective, this is still a small number or a small number of the overall \u2013 our pipeline of the overall opportunity that we have. The vast majority of our business still comes from the old land and expand that we've always talked to you about. So, yes, would I expect to see some more Health Net life deals, certainly we talked about that in the context of the synergy opportunities we see from TriZetto, for example. So I think those will be in the pipeline and the sales cycles there will be longer, but I think that the core base business will continue to be as we have historically been sort of the land and expand kind of work. Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Essex \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to touch a little bit on your balance sheet philosophy. As you introduced into the balance sheet and you closed on few acquisitions, what is the longer-term philosophy is maintaining on the balance sheet and, perhaps, also the mix of cash offshore, and what kind of flexibility you anticipate to maintain going forward? Francisco D'Souza: So, Brian, you touched on the key issue there. A good chunk of our cash is offshore, certainly we can use it for non-US acquisitions, but it is quite expensive to bring home. When we look at our cash flow characteristics for the company, as excluding future large acquisitions, and as we said, we are not planning to do any future large acquisitions until TriZetto is well integrated. The \u2013 our cash flow characteristics in the U.S. do enable us to do some \u2013 continue to do some share repurchases in the U.S., obviously we couldn\u2019t do that in Q3, because we were blocked out. Longer-term, the key is, we want to make sure, we have the flexibility to take advantage of the quickly changing market, yes, we still have a lot of work to do in various geographies. So we have not laid out a specific mix of how much the share repurchase versus dividends, versus acquisitions. We want to make sure that we continue to take as a \u2013 act as a leader in the market and stay ahead of our clients in terms of where they want to \u2013 what type of services they want. But certainly, we do have both the authorization for additional share repurchases and we'll have the cash flow to resume doing some of those going forward. Brian Essex \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then just to kind of touch a real quick on TriZetto, it looks relatively vertical specific, particularly with regard to the packaged software side of the business, and how do you think about translating that technology over to adjacent verticals or different verticals and leveraging them across other industry groups? Francisco D'Souza: Yes, it\u2019s Frank, Brian. Look, I think, as you pointed out, the vast majority of TriZetto is very focused, very specific to the healthcare vertical. So I don\u2019t see opportunities to take their technology to other verticals once we close the transaction. There are couple of exceptions to that. One is that TriZetto have some very interesting advanced automation, software robotic kind of technology that we've acquired in the healthcare space, which we think could be relevant across the industries. We think that advanced autonomics and robotics \u2013 software robotics are very important advanced automation technologies that will be very relevant to our business going forward, across the industries and in particular lines of business like our BPO, BPS service offerings, our IT infrastructure service offering. So there are some pockets of TriZetto technology that we think will apply to other industries. Brian Essex \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. I want to sort of touch on the 4Q guide, and the actual increase in the guide on the context of pretty meaningful FX headwinds, so it\u2019s actually a pretty strong uptick in the guide, maybe, Gordon, if you could give us a little bit color around that and the thinking being was the client specific headwinds coming out of 2Q, is that somewhat less than you had thought, any potential for year-end budget flush, but just a little bit more color around the uptick in the 4Q guide, which is kind of unusual for you? Gordon Coburn : : If I look at what's \u2013 what people are spending on, there is just tremendous interest in digital and SMAC services and people is trying to get their feet wet with that. So I would not think about it as the handful of clients flushed out sooner than we expected, those are playing out just as we expected. But across the rest of the customer base, we are seeing a little bit stronger performance than we would have originally thought. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And no budge flush issues? Gordon Coburn : We are not seeing anything, we are seeing some furloughs actually, not seeing any material budget flushes. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And then just finally on the head count hiring, which is pretty aggressive both year-over-year and Q-to-Q, is that somewhat of a catch-up from slower head count growth during the year, or how do we sort of think about that in the context of sort of heading into 2015? Gordon Coburn : So little bit of a catch, obviously we are taking the utilization up quite a bit. The skills that we need to shift a little bit, so we wanted to make sure we don\u2019t have any skills mismatch, or so we sacrificed a little bit of utilization just as we get that all aligned. We also wanted to bring all of the college students on board by the end of this year who are graduated in May. We thought that was important, so about 45% of the hiring in Q3 was the college students. So you put it altogether, it enables us to make sure that we are going to have the right skills for the change in demand and position ourselves well, so we don\u2019t have revenue leakage as we go into next year. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with the questions. Steven Milunovich \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Thank you. Regarding the SMAC revenues, are you willing to update how much they are this year? And I guess, my question is that Accenture claims that about 17% of its revenue is in the SMAC category, you appear to be quite a bit less than that, why is that? Karen McLoughlin : So in terms of \u2013 so, Steve, in terms of the overall revenue, we have not provided an updated detail, we've talked last year about it being about $500 million, but it is as Gordon mentioned previously, it is certainly growing very fast right now, and certainly faster than company average. I will let Frank actually add a little bit more color around what he sees in the marketplace. Francisco D'Souza: To your second question, I think, part of the issue is that, so much of what we do now is across the business, is what I would broadly categorize as digital or digital related that it really depict, comes down to sort of a definition of what you are defining digital to be. The \u2013 when we gave you the number, we did about a year ago, of about $500 million of SMAC, that was a relatively pure definition of technology, services related to social, mobile, analytics, and cloud. Digital has expanded well beyond that right now, and I would say it touches almost every aspect of Cognizant's business. And so from a definitional standpoint, I think that, comparing across the industry to say, how much of revenues digital becomes somewhat tricky, because it really depends on making sure that you are looking at apples-to-apples and I'm not sure there is a good way to do that at this point. Having said all of that, I feel very confident, the measure I use that I think is most relevant is, how we are doing in the marketplace and what are our win rates and how our customers telling us we are doing with respect to digital technologies, and I feel very good about that. Our win rates are solid. The work we are doing for clients is transformational and digital, and we feel good about how we are positioned going into next year from a digital standpoint. Steven Milunovich \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : That\u2019s helpful. I agree, it\u2019s not clear, it\u2019s apples-to-apples. And then I want to ask about BPO or BPaaS, I hear investors having some concern about looking back historically how many will successful BPO platforms can you point to? What's the margin going to be on this business versus your historic business? It sounds great to generate your own IP and so forth, but what comfort can you give us regarding the profitability for the BPO business going forward? Francisco D'Souza: So when we look at what we mean by BPaaS, a combination of infrastructure platform, our people doing the processing clients behind the outcome, leveraging both the global delivery model and obviously very deep IT capabilities. Certainly, we have to make assumptions about productivity gains and so forth. But as we have a lot of track record of understanding of what we can achieve in terms of productivity on these, so I actually feel quite comfortable with it. Now, obviously the timing of profitability differs on these deals. The profitability tends to ramp up as you go through the transaction, but as long as you have enough of them in the system and stagger it out I think it should be fine. And the reality is, this is the way the market is shifting. Clearly, this is what clients want to buy, so we have to make sure that we have a highly competitive offering and an offering where we make the margins that we want. And we\u2019re very focused on that. We think it\u2019s quite achievable. Steven Milunovich \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Thank you. Francisco D'Souza: Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks for squeezing me in. Gordon, is there anything different that we should look at in terms of our assumptions for Health Net next year and specifically in focusing on the regulatory approval process? And I think you\u2019ve indicated in the past, I thought that it happens. I mean, we\u2019re talking about four states, and we thought that this thing probably gets completed by the middle of next year. Do you feel that this thing actually happens earlier than that or this is still middle of next year? Gordon Coburn : I think your assumption is correct. Health Net has stated publically that they would expect to receive regulatory approvals in the first-half of next year. So I think the assumption that you\u2019re making is probably an appropriate one. Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: So the contribution to the income statements starts following through in Q3 or sometime in Q2? Gordon Coburn : It gets phased a little bit, because there\u2019s some preliminary setup work and so forth, but the significant impact happens once we have regulatory approval and we go live. Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: I\u2019m assuming starting in Q3 and then maybe getting a bit stronger in Q4 of next year. Karen McLoughlin : Moshe, so the contract actually ramps over the first two to two-and-a-half years, so it will ramp up over time in 2015 and 2016 and in 2017. Francisco D'Souza: Yes, we\u2019ll give more color on how to model it as or we\u2019ll give a little more color on seasonality when we talk about our guidance in February. Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: All right. Thank you. David Nelson : Yes, thanks, Moshe. And thanks everybody for joining us today and for your questions. We look forward to speaking with you again, next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Cognizant Technology Solution\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson : Thank you, Rob and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Francisco, please go ahead. Francisco D'Souza: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We finished 2014 on a strong note. Our fourth quarter revenues were $2.74 billion, a sequential increase of 6.2% including revenues from TriZetto. Excluding the impact of the TriZetto acquisition, we posted sequential growth of 3.1% in Q4 which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%. For the full year 2014 including TriZetto we delivered $10.26 billion of revenue which represent a growth of 16.1% over 2013. As you're aware, we revised our full year guidance, growth guidance at the time of our Q2 earnings release on account of client specific issues and delayed ramp ups in some projects. As is clear from our strong performance during Q3 and Q4 those clients and projects specific issues are now behind us and as we enter 2015, we are encouraged by the strength of the demand environment and how well positioned we are to capture the market opportunity. For the full year 2015, we expect to deliver at least $12.21 billion of revenue which represents full year growth of at least 19% after a 2% currency headwind. Adjusting for the impact of TriZetto and currency movement, this guidance reflects strong revenue growth in our underlying business and is roughly in line with our 2014 growth. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly. I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing you a perspective on the trends that we saw last year and how these are impacting the demand environment going forward and how Cognizant is positioned to address the market opportunity. Let me start with the demand environment. For many quarters, we've been talking to you about a once in a decade shift driven by digital technologies that are putting industries and businesses at cross roads. While there have been big technology shifts in the past, the current digital era is different in two very fundamental ways. First, technology has moved from automating transactions to instrumenting all aspects of our lives. Senses are being embedded everywhere which implies that physical environments are becoming more intelligent and almost everything is becoming a source of data. It's estimated that by 2020 there will be 50 billion connected devices generating 50 times the data that is being generated today. The only way to harness this ecosystem is through advance forms of automation and technology. The second difference is that the base of change is like nothing we've ever seen before. In the past, technology evolution was characterized by brief periods of very intense innovation followed by long periods of incremental improvement. Today, innovation cycles have compressed so dramatically that business leaders around the world have to think of innovation and improvement simultaneously. This challenge to achieve both efficiency and innovation is what we call the dual mandate and we believe companies must simultaneously focus on both of these. On the one hand, large parts of the world economy are yet to return to robust and sustainable growth which means we have to help our clients conserve capital by providing efficiencies and productivity while also helping them build variable cost structures so, that they are better able to match their cost with revenue and demand. On the other hand, we have to help them reinvent and reimagine their businesses and build the skills and capabilities required to make digital come alive. This is driving a significant demand for newer services in areas such as mobility, data and security. McKinsey study highlights this demand indicating a potential shortage in the U.S. of up to 190,000 data scientist by 2018. Clients need a partner who has the ability to integrate and execute end to end transformations driving both efficiency and innovation and I am confident that Cognizant is that partner for our clients in 2015 and beyond. Now let me explain in some more detail, how we are bringing all our capabilities together to help our clients on both sides of the dual mandate. The first thing we are working on is driving best in class delivery across all of our service lines. We're continually improving each and every one of our services to bring capital and operating efficiencies to our clients. We have a relentless focus on bringing in tools and techniques to measure an improved delivery across the life cycle so clients can benefit from best in class operations. And we continue to drive efficiencies by investing in our delivery network tapping new sources of talent and also driving process automation by flying advanced technologies across our lines of service. The second area in which we are focused is the end to end productivity achieved by bringing multiple services and service capabilities together. For example, we are increasingly packaging application and infrastructure services together to take advantage of the synergies for managing these layers of the stack in combination. Our engagement with Heath Net announced last year is an excellent example of an end to end solutions which includes applications and infrastructure as well as business process services. Our ability to extract end to end synergies will allow us to reduce Health Net's G&A spend and improve quality of service. Another example of the work we are doing to drive end to end productivity is our work in developing shared industry platforms. We are increasingly bringing together applications, cloud and business process services to create industry utilities benefiting multiple customers in an industry. In this process we have created new commercial models where we can charge clients on the outcome or output we deliver to them. The platform from TriZetto and Heath Net will enable us to offer these new delivery models in healthcare at scale. Third, we're best in class delivery and multi-service integration in industry platforms help us drive efficiency for our clients. On the innovation front, we made significant investment and solve great traction for digital solutions this past year. Business transformation at scale in the digital era requires approaches scales and capabilities that are different from traditional IT services. For several years, we've been working with our clients, our new solutions driven by social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies. This experience has helped us create a comprehensive integrated approach to transform our clients businesses into digital enterprises. We've been working with CEOs to strategically re-think business models with business leaders to digitize business processes and with CIOs to create the foundational technologies and security for the digital age. We have multi-disciplinary teams that bring together consultants, digital technologist designer\u2019s business process experts and data scientist to create cohesive digital solutions for clients. We're organically building on our heritage of data, industry expertise, knowledge of SMAC technologies and legacy systems complemented by digital acquisitions like iTask, Cadient and Odyssey. And finally to further enhance our offerings to clients, we continue to invest in new capabilities to make sure that we stay well ahead of the curve. We're particularly focused on the next generation of game changing technologies such as instrumentation with ultra-low cost sensors, embedded software, 3D printing advanced cyber security and many areas of artificial intelligence. These are exciting times to be in the technology industry. The pace of change and innovation is breathtaking. Over the next decade organizations around the world will raise to deploy new technologies for competitive advantage and better service. The world is becoming more technology intensive and I am excited about the opportunity that this represents for our clients and for Cognizant. In closing, let me say that 2014 was a significant year for us. We completed 20 years of strong growth expanding to over 200,000 talented associates and now have operations in more than 40 countries globally. We've created a solid platform for growth and I am confident that given our entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change we're well positioned for the next phase of our journey. I'd like to hand it over to Gordon now to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for the Q&A. Over to you, Gordon. Gordon Coburn : Thank you, Frank. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first discuss the status of the integration and revenue synergies of the TriZetto acquisitions and then provide some additional color on the current demand environment. As announced previously, we closed the $2.8 billion acquisition of TriZetto on November 20th. At this point, client account teams have been integrated and detailed plans are in place to begin to drive revenue synergies this year. We have a team of people dedicated to the integration and the various synergy tracks we outlined several months back. We have identified at a granular level, the path to achieving the $1.5 billion of synergy opportunities over the next five years and remain confident and our ability to deliver that result based on the many exciting opportunities we see. First, we anticipate picking up incremental projects integrating TriZetto platforms for pair clients. Second, we think there is an opportunity to cross-sell our BPS hosting and consulting services into the TriZetto clients where we currently don't have relationships. Finally, the longer term opportunity goes beyond that. The combination of TriZetto's platforms with our services and program management capabilities will allow us to create end-to-end platform based solutions for pair clients. At the time, the significant disruption in the healthcare industry, regulatory reform ageing populations increasing price competition to manage for transparency and new technologies. These, end-to-end solutions gain interaction. We are receiving numerous inquiries from CEOs and COOs at our clients. They are proactively reaching out to us starting conversations about combined Cognizant and TriZetto solutions. These clients are intrigued by how these comprehensive platform-based solutions can create compelling value propositions for their companies. Let me now comment on the overall demand environment and our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. We\u2019re pleased with the strong revenue performance during the fourth quarter despite unfavorable currency movement. As Francisco mentioned earlier excluding the impact of TriZetto revenue grew 3.1% over quarter three which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%. The demand environment remains strong, as reflected in our strong order pipeline and the pickup of deal activity over the past couple of quarters and reflects clients growing demand for achieving both efficiency and innovation on one platform. From an industry perspective, our banking and financial services segment grew 3.6% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in our insurance practice, where there is a growing interest in end-to-end managed services. On the banking side, underlying demand drivers remain consistent through 2014 cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance, real-time risk monitoring, and fraud and trade surveillance. We expect many of these drivers to continue in 2015 but with the increased focus on newer technologies in digital and automation. Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, and now our TriZetto business grew 17.9% sequentially, and 26% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto, the healthcare segment grew 5.6% sequentially. As we\u2019ve discussed over the course of 2014, our payer sector took a more cautious approach to investment during the year. Longer-term, the payer sector is undergoing fundamental change driven by changing regulatory environment, increasing focus on medical cost and the consumerization of healthcare. We believe this fundamental change creates longer term opportunities for which we are well positioned to capture. Within the pharmaceutical segment, we have seen another quarter of strong sequential growth driven by cost optimization and vendor consolidation as well as increased traction in BPS especially with clinical and commercial operations. Finally our acquisition of Cadient is helping drive the digital agenda with our pharmaceutical clients as Cadient has seen as leading the market in digital marketing solutions. Our regional manufacturing segment was essentially flat when compared to the third quarter and up 9% over Q4 of 2013. Q4 is typically a slow quarter for the segment given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season and a number of furloughs that occur at year end. However we are seeing improved demand particularly in areas of modernizing supply chains as well as digital and e-commerce engagements. Our other segment which includes hi-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients was up 1.2% sequentially and 23.3% year-over-year, primarily driven by further penetration with our existing clients. We have seen good traction through our iTask acquisition with our communications and media and entertainment clients as traditional cable, broadcast and telecom network environments move towards a wide range of digital video services. Let me now turn to a discussion of our Horizon II service lines where we continue to be pleased with the market traction we\u2019re realizing. Our BPS practice saw continued traction during the quarter, launching the ramp up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance and healthcare. BPS is a critical component of bringing operating efficiencies to our clients, increase the rate this is delivered through solutions leveraging technology and advanced automation. Demand for our vertically aligned business processes such as membership enrollments and revenue cycle management and healthcare and claims processing and mortgage services and insurance and financial services remain strong. Cognizant infrastructure services had another strong quarter. We\u2019re seeing solid demand from clients looking to simplify and automate their infrastructure through newer delivery models, often incorporating highly automated managed services and newer technologies such as our hybrid cloud and mobility solutions. Additionally solutions integrating infrastructure and applications management are gaining traction. Cognizant business Consulting or CBC continued its pace of above average growth as transformational engagements which requires clients to rethink and reimagine their strategy in operating models are driving strong demand. Within today\u2019s environment, clients are expecting consulting to go beyond strategy and to be included within integrated solutions incorporating design, technology and the implementation. CPC is on the front lines of our digital engagements with over 60% of deals in their 2015 pipeline having a digital component, focusing particularly on three key areas. Enhancing the customer experience, modernizing and simplifying supply chains and transforming underlying technologies for their digital environment. Our Horizon III offerings include new technologies and new delivery models as well as new markets. In new area seeing especially strong traction is our public sector practice. This strength is driven by leveraging our commercial expertise particularly in banking and healthcare and offering our full suite of services across all three horizons. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 7.7% sequentially and 17.4% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto, North America was up 3.6% over the third quarter. Revenue from Europe was up 0.6% compared to quarter three including a negative 4.4% currency impact. Revenue was up 10.7% over a year ago. Continental Europe was up just under 1% sequentially including a negative 4.7% currency impact. We expect solid growth in the continent over coming years as we increasingly benefit from the structural shift towards larger multi-year outsourcing programs. The rest of the world continue to show good growth up 4.5% sequentially and 22.3% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as Australia and the Middle East. 2014 was a strong year from a business operations perspective. In our 20th year, our reputation of being an employer of choice was further strengthened across the globe. We crossed the 200,000 employee mark. We continue to recruit and hire some of the best talent from around the world both from the lateral market and from leading universities in 17 countries. With newer skills needed to address opportunities driven by digital, we have aggressively expanded recruitment into areas such as analytics and digital solution design. Additionally, the acquisition of TriZetto, iTask, Cadient and Odyssey in 2014 have brought in world class talent in areas of product engineering, video engineering, mobility, digital marketing and other skills critical to transformations that clients are seeing. We saw a downward trend with attrition during the year, evidence of our ability to engage, train, develop, recognize and retain our associates. We were pleased that Cognizant was ranked number one for the second year in a row in the association for talent developments 2014 best awards program. Additionally, our Annual Business Effectiveness Survey of Employees showed results improving from the prior year and validation of our sustained focus on employee retention while driving high levels of customer centricity. As we enter 2015, I believe that we are well positioned to capture the evolving market opportunities. Our investments in expanded capabilities and markets combined with the strongest workforce in our history gives us confidence in delivering strong growth despite the current currency headwinds. Now let me have Karen provide more color on the financial details of our performance. Karen? Karen McLoughlin : Thank you Gordon and good morning everyone. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.74 billion included approximately $80.6 million associated with TriZetto and represented growth of 6.2% sequentially and 16.4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related expenses was 19.4% within our target range of 19% to 20%. During the quarter, we adjusted our estimate of 2014 incentive compensation downward to reflect the margin impact of accelerated hiring and other investments. This revision positively impacted our Q4 operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 exceeded our previous guidance by $0.04. For the full year 2014, revenue of $10.26 billion represented growth of 16.1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2% and non-GAAP EPS was $2.60. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 54% and 46% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 26% year-over-year while outsourcing services were up 5% sequentially and grew 7% from Q4 a year ago. During the quarter $45 million of revenue from TriZetto was included in consulting and technology services and $35 million was included in outsourcing. For the full year, consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 53% and 47% of revenue respectfully. During the fourth quarter 36% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and as expected overall pricing was stable. As part of the TriZetto acquisition, we added both payer and provider clients including more than 245,000 providers as such the customer count is no longer as relevant a metric for measuring our core performance, so we will no longer be providing that going forward. We will however continue to provide the number of strategic accounts which we have defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. We added several strategic customers in the quarter bringing our total number of strategic clients to 271. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $58 million. To-date, we have repurchased approximately 35.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion under the share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $814 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count increased slightly to 612.8 million shares for the quarter. As a result of the TriZetto acquisition we are modifying our DSO calculations. The DSO formula will continue to include total accounts receivable that will now be net of the uncollected portion of deferred revenues. Total receivables were $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivable of 70 days. Under the previous calculation, the DSO for Cognizant excluding TriZetto would have been 75 days, a decrease of approximately two days from the last quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivable balance was approximately $325 million down from $338 million at the end of Q3. We build approximately 56% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $3.8 billion of cash and short-term investments down by approximately $844 million from the quarter ending September 30th and up by approximately $27 million from the year ago period. As mentioned previously, we closed the acquisition of TriZetto during the quarter. The funding for this acquisition came from a combination of cash on hand and debt priced at LIBOR plus the 100 basis points. At the end of the quarter, our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.6 billion including approximately $650 million which was drawn on our revolver to fund intercompany payments at the end of the year. Including this debt financing activities were approximately at $1.6 billion worth of cash during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $324 million of cash, investing activities were a use of cash of $2.53 billion, this included $2.68 billion for acquisitions and capital expenditures of approximately $75 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the full year were approximately $213 million. Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics for the quarter and for the rest of the year. During the quarter, we added approximately 11,800 employees including approximately 3,770 associates from the acquisition of TriZetto and we ended the quarter with approximately 211,500 employees globally. Approximately 198,000 of our employees were service delivery staff. Excluding the TriZetto associates 33% of our new hires were direct college hires while 67% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. Annualized attrition of 14.5% during the quarter including BPO and trainees improved a 110 basis points from Q3 of this year. Attrition levels are something that we continue to monitor very closely and we are pleased by the sequential decline in those metrics. Utilization declined on a sequential basis as we on boarded our new hires. Offshore utilization is approximately 59%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates during our training program was approximately 76% and onsite utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter. As we spoke about last quarter, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rate this year. For example, as of February 3rd, the euro had depreciated roughly 18% against the U.S. dollar versus where it was a year ago. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time of which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. Based on current exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar, our guidance includes the 2% headwinds to 2015 year-over-year growth. With that in mind for the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be at least $12.21 billion, which represents growth of at least 19%. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $2.88 billion. During the first quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses stock-based compensation and acquisition related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.6%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $2.91 for the full year. This guidance anticipates the full year share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and the tax rate of approximately 26.4%. Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller : Thanks guys and nice end to the year. Just wanted to start off first with your outlook for the 2015 year. You talked about an organic growth rate that similar to 2014 levels, which were nearly roughly 14%, 15% now, I guess 15% as when you called out. I guess the first question is just touching on the dynamics of the $80 million run rate from the last quarter seemed a little higher than we would have thought from TriZetto last, from really just December and a little bit in November from TriZetto. So can you talk a little bit about, you're actually including near 15 outlook for that? And then also, given that help that\u2019s not close, is that actually included in your guidance and maybe just talk a little bit about the underlying healthcare drivers beyond TriZetto it looks like it accelerated pretty nicely in the fourth quarter? Thanks guys. Karen McLoughlin : Hey Darrin, this is Karen. I\u2019ll start with the first part about the guidance and I\u2019ll let Frank and Gordon talk a little bit more about the industry side of this. So for TriZetto keep in mind that obviously their primary revenue is software, so Q4 tends to be very, very strong for them, it is by far their strongest quarter of the year. I think when we talked about the acquisition previously we mentioned that there about $720 million run rate, which is essentially where they landed for 2014, but a lot of that revenue is back ended. So think about them as give or take about $720 million company growing mid-single-digit have been historically their growth rate and that would what you back a little bit guidance is. In terms of Health Net, I\u2019ll let Frank and Gordon talk a little bit more about the actual contract and what\u2019s happening there, but in terms of guidance as we have talked about previously, we expect that we will get regulatory clearance by about the middle of the year. And so we do have baked into our full year guidance what the increase in the Health Net revenue would be from that point forward. Darrin Peller : And just to add that we\u2019re willing to the process of regulatory approvals at this point our expectation is that things would be in line with the timing that we had expected mid this year to be able to go live? Francisco D'Souza: Yes. And I\u2019ll just add to that Darrin. Look, it\u2019s Frank. On a big picture level the, if you recall this strategic rationale behind the TriZetto acquisition was premised on the fact that the healthcare landscape is undergoing very strong significant structural shifts due to not just the reform law, but associated cost pressure is shifting responsibility between payers and providers. And we think all of these things together create great growth opportunity for us, I think you saw some of that in the fourth quarter, I was very encouraged by the level of activity and dialogue that we saw in Q4 around the combined Cognizant TriZetto proposition with interest from clients and clients talking to us about the combined opportunity. So I think, great start to the combined relationship and I expect to see increased momentum as we go into '15. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Edward Caso : Hi thanks and congrats on the quarter. I was more curious about hiring and training as whole digital phenomenon takes off here as your peers are facing the same opportunity as well. So are you hiring people with the skills, have you develop new training program so this is added burden or is this just a different kind of training. Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: Ed its Franc. I think it's a little bit of both, when you look at the digital opportunity from a skill standpoint, there are, I would say two tracks in a sense. You've got a set of foundational technologies that you need to deploy for clients and building out foundational technology skills, I would say follow the similar process to what Cognizant has historically done when it comes to building out new technology capability area. So we have great partnerships and alliances with technology providers, very deep partnerships we've got Cognizant academy that recruits trains cross trains cross skills our teams on foundational technologies. But equally importantly and in what we find in the digital world is that it's not just about technologies. To really make digital come alive, you have to bring together these cross functional multi-functional teams that include consultant\u2019s technologist\u2019s data scientist\u2019s designers and of course folks who want to stand the client in the client context. And the skills like designers and data scientists are skills that we are both building organically internally but also recruiting heavily for in the marketplace and also as you've seen from the - some of the acquisitions that we did in 2014 we're also looking at inorganic ways to grow those capabilities. And I think you'll continue to see us pushing forward on all those fronts that I just mentioned as we go into '15 and we continue to build out the digital capability at Cognizant. Gordon Coburn : And Ed one thing to add to that as Cognizant's brand awareness continues to strengthen, the quality and the breadth of the people that we're tracking is that all time high. So we're able to attract the technologists, the designers and people recognize our brand and they see that we are clearly positioned as a leader in the space. So we're really quite pleased with our recruiting capability right now, as well as we've always been terrific at training capability. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thanks. And let me add my congratulations on the year as well as good guidance guys. So I guess two questions one was the timing of TriZetto synergies. Just wanted to clarify 2015 guidance is there anything there is it reasonable to assume that the mid-single-digit growth rate can accelerate to maybe a low-double type number over the next 12 to 18 months. And then secondly on your operating margins, the last time below 20% was I think some crack in 2007. So my question is if you include TriZetto ramping Health Net, the investments you're making in digital and automation. Is this the year you finally kind of get down to the 19, 20. Gordon Coburn : Sure Ashwin its Gordon. So a couple of things, as we said in our prepared remarks we remain quite confident of achieving our $1.5 billion of revenue synergies over the next five years. As we said when we did the acquisitions that is back and loaded because the biggest piece of that comes from selling the integrated deals and obviously there is a long lead time on that. But also as we said we are actually seeing quite a bit of interest in that, so the pipeline is building. Going forward you will not see us breakout TriZetto revenue, because what's TriZetto what's Cognizant very quickly becomes blurred particularly when you think about services revenue and BPO revenue. So we are managing as part of our healthcare practice going forward obviously we want to break it out as people understood what organic growth was for 2015. Revenue synergies for 2015 as we said when we did the deal are certainly more modest than we will be in future years and it'll be heavily weighted towards services work which even prior to the acquisition we had the leading practice and obviously that\u2019s further strengthen now and we certainly feel good about the pipeline there. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Gordon Coburn : Sorry on the operating margins, our target remains 19% to 20% we have bounced above 20% a little bit each time we did that we did reaffirm that we do not want to be above 20% so certainly our expectation is we would be in the 19% to 20% range for 2015 and our guidance assumes that and I would certainly encourage people and their models to assume we're in the 19% to 20%. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Tien- tsin Huang : Great, thanks. Good morning. Good results here. Just want to ask on the top five top 10 client growth composition of those clients change excluding TriZetto and also maybe I missed just the outlook for technology versus outsourcing revenue for the year? Thank you. Karen McLoughlin : Sure, so top five for the quarter was 11.6% and top ten 20.1 Tien-tsin so, it\u2019s coming down at the percentage of revenue as you would expected too. No material changes this quarter and in terms of the customers that make that up so obviously we did have some overlap with TriZetto in terms of customers but the revenue for customer obviously is a little bit less than ours so no material change there and we did not provide specific guidance around the outlook for consulting the technology services versus outsourcing but I think as we had said previously with the ramp-up of some of the new contracts we signed this year including Health Net and then the big insurance contract and the board contracts and others that we talked about earlier in the year we would expect outsourcing revenue to recover a little bit as we go into 2015. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Hey, good morning guys. I had a question around the TriZetto roadmap, can you provide maybe that\u2019s for Gordon, a bit more color around what how you are thinking about the product roadmap for the underlying TriZetto product and how you are thinking about incorporating and owning and managing as software platform into your overall business operations? Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Lisa its fine let me address that so as we said when we did the TriZetto acquisition, the TriZetto business that we acquired has become part of the Cognizant Healthcare business but continues to operate as relatively standalone unit within the healthcare business. Now obviously we're focused on the synergy opportunities from an execution standpoint and as Gordon said those synergy opportunities in the short run are around the services business and the BPO business that we can generate together. But the core product, the TriZetto product set that capability remains a separate unit run by the management team that came to us when we did the TriZetto acquisition and they continue to execute against the product roadmap that they had laid out for their customers and now for our customers before the acquisition so we are keeping the platform very much as a standalone unit. We will continue to invest in it as we had as the plan had been in the past. If anything we feel like we might be able to accelerate some aspects of the product roadmap because of our development capability and so on and so forth but we clearly recognized that the rhythm of a software business is different from the rhythm of a services business and so we are keeping it as a standalone unit within the healthcare, the bigger healthcare business unit so that we protect that culture and we continue to make the - create the necessary focus I would say around the software product business. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Sara Gubins : Hi, thank you good morning. As you are thinking about 2015 what you are expecting client budgets to be during, there has been some discussions from competitors of US bank, IT budgets are down in 2015 because of regulatory cost I'm wondering if you're seeing that. Francisco D'Souza: Hey it\u2019s Franc. Let me jump in and then Gordon can add to it. I don't think we're seeing budgets down overall we are actually seeing sort of flat to modestly up budgets. So I think Gartner predicted or Gartner's projection from January of this year was sort of 2.4%, 2.5% increase in budgets. That sort of consistent with what we're seeing. Clearly, there is a shift going on within budgets and I think that's really the more important trend for to focus on what we are seeing is that is dual mandate that we've been speaking about for so long is really playing out in budgets where because overall budgets are call it flat to modestly up. The pressure that it creates for organizations is to really get more done with those essentially same budget dollars. And so what that means is that on one side clients continue to look for ways to drive greater degrees of efficiency and effectiveness kind of what we call the run better side of the equation. So that they can invest those dollars in deploying new digital and other capabilities that sort of the run different side of the equation. Clearly in financial services regulatory compliance initiatives are consuming a significant amount of our client's budgets. I think this is anecdotal, I would say that the most intense period of that was probably last year I think as we go into '15 when I look at in our financial services institutions. It's not to say that the regulatory compliance spend goes away but I think it's, I would say it's become more stable I don't see increasing as a percent of overall budgets and so that's started to create a degree of stability within our financial services clients where I start to see more focus and attention being turned to digital initiatives and initiatives that I considered to be ones that will drive competitiveness and top line growth for financial services. So I am actually seeing a positive shift in financial services more towards innovation and growth as regulatory compliance stabilizes and becomes a better and more understood level of spending. I don't know Gordon if there is anything you want to add to that. Gordon Coburn : No I think you've covered that well. The only thing I might add in Europe obviously the economies are little bit softer but we're seeing that actually serve as a catalyst for people to shift their spending and look at services such as Cognizant to help reduce their cost of running the business so they can still invest in innovation. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Yes thank you. Good morning team. I had a question either for Karen and Gordon on operating margins. A if you could you had two quarters of non-GAAP operating margins in the 19.5% range call it. How much the TriZetto impact December quarter operating margins and as the follow on we don't yet have the 10-Q yet for the December quarter, but at least in the September quarter industry segment level operating dollars of profit actually declined year-over-year and I was hoping you could flush out why is that will that continue. And as my follow on question Karen if you could talk about some of the puts and takes in the CY15 operating margin guidance and specifically including how much TriZetto and or FX impacting the guidance that you provided. Thank you. Karen McLoughlin : Okay, sure so let me start with TriZetto Keith. So TriZetto's operating margin is roughly in line with Cognizant. So in terms of the impact on overall margin percent it's nominal so it's really just about the revenue growth there that's obviously on a non-GAAP basis, on a GAAP basis because of all the acquisition amortization obviously that would be dilutive. But on a non-GAAP basis I think about its being roughly in line with company average margin going forward. FX has a little bit of an impact on margin, but fairly nominal it's mainly a revenue issue with the FX headwinds that we had both in Q4 and that we're forecasting as we move into 2015. In terms of the segment margin, obviously we have done a lot of hiring in the last six months, and that obviously puts pressure on margin until those folks become fully billable utilization ticked down both in Q3 and Q4. We would expect for that to stabilize in 2015 as we've talked about utilization will go up and down a little bit based on hiring and based on growth opportunities that we see in the company, but we would expect utilization to stabilize and margins to stabilize accordingly with that. And so then as we move into 2015 really nothing unusual it really is about stabilizing utilization integrating TriZetto but as we said that generally runs in line with company average and continuing to ensure that we are driving for industry leading growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Steiner [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two if I may, first on the guidance you are providing excluding the effect of TriZetto and FX for 2015. As you look in 2015 versus where you were at the same point last year how you've adjusted your guidance for the year underlying that to be either more conservative the same or potentially more optimistic than your last year and then secondly with respect to offshore cash there has been some talk about potential legislation there to allow low rate repatriation of cash if that were to go through how much you think about your cash differently? Gordon Coburn : Sure, this is Gordon. Let me start with the question on guidance and how conservative we have been. Clearly we build a meaningful risk adjustments into our guidance compared to the targets that our field organization has certainly we do not want to end up in situation similar to last year, so, we think we have built in the appropriate risk adjustments taking into account the experience that we have last year. Karen McLoughlin : Sure, and then in terms of cash repatriation obviously we are supportive of anything that the U.S. does to help multinational companies be successful and to ensure that we can make the right investments around the world. So if something happens obviously we will take the appropriate steps and actions but we'll wait and see what happens at this point. Gordon Coburn : I would remind you for the cash that we have in India even with the tax holiday or a reduced tax for repatriation in U.S. there is still a tax for taking the cash out of India. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. David Togut : Thank you. As you look across each of your three horizons of services could you quantify unit price changes year-over-year 2015 versus 2014 and then for the employees we are working in each of these horizons what are the unit changes year-over-year and wages look like against the price changes? Thanks. Gordon Coburn : Sure, so pricing is this over the past couple of quarters have been stable. I think that's a reasonable assumption going forward. You may see some divergence certainly on pricing in digital will be higher than in traditional apps maintenance but the people cost more there as well so when you netted all out I think reasonably stable price environment is the way to think about it. In terms of wage inflation we do our wage increases later in the year and certainly we'll make sure that we're competitive with what others do but I would expect given the strong supply that wage increases will be relatively modest compare to prior year but in the end we will certainly match what others do so but I would expect others to be fairly disciplined in their wage increases. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys just want to give up data in the large deal pipeline any other chunky or larger deals that you are working on that could come in throughout the year and then just like just the outlook in Europe you guys are expecting to pick up demand in Europe, Thanks. Gordon Coburn : Sure, large pipeline is healthy but you are absolutely it is chunky you don\u2019t have one every month we're certainly working on that number of large deals when that will - you never know with larger deals but the good news is we are clearly competitive in the large integrated deals that include BPS that include infrastructure that include co-IT so we have achieved critical mass and infrastructure and business process services and that's very important so we can we are quite competitive in the larger deals. In terms of Europe, pipeline is healthy obviously the economy is a bit lumpy over there what we are seeing certainly in some of the more traditional outsourcing it serves as a catalyst for people to move forward because they have to reduce their run cost. It's early to note that what the impact will be on innovation spend certainly there is lots of interest you will see what's sort of projects kick off, but overall we continue to invest heavily in Europe, because we think the window for outsourcing is very active right now. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney. Please go ahead with your question. Joseph Foresi : Hi. You had mentioned before that I think you are looking for at least $200 million in incremental revenues from large deal winds next year and in this year 2015. Is that still the case and can you wrap some numbers for us around SMAC as a percentage of revenue growth rates and margins. Thank you. Gordon Coburn : Sure so on the large deals that $200 million was related to the three large deals that we talked about on the prior earnings call. I think that is still an accurate assumptions assuming everything continues on track to way it is currently. In terms of SMAC, SMAC has been kind of folded into the broader digital initiatives which and within digital what we're seeing is across is all of our businesses all of our accounts. So it becomes very difficult to say it's in a specific amount because it touches everything. So we don't have a further update on that other than to say clearly there is healthy SMAC demand within digital and digital we're seeing currently - across all three horizons currently. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Essex, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Essex : Hi good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could dig in a little bit on TriZetto and I think when you announced the deal we talked about the potential opportunity for some kind of halo around it you think kind of Health Net as an example of the reference of those deals. I wondered can you talk a little bit about conversations that you're having with customers in the pipeline and are there any potential prospects like wins in the pipeline and understand those several type of the little bit longer, our near term might some of those deals be as far as in the pipeline. Francisco D'Souza: Its Franc let me take that. Let me start by saying that I think that and as I said in my prepared comments, one of the trends that I'm quite excited about is this notion of clients looking to us in various forms to create these large integrated deals that include apps infrastructure and business process services. And those sometimes those like in the case of Health Net those are relatively standalone and in other cases we see migrating potentially to shared industry utility type of model which I think TriZetto and Health Net will enable going forward. After the announcement of the TriZetto acquisition, I would say that we've seen an increase in conversations with clients about the potentials of those kinds of deals. I would characterize the pipeline of those deals as relatively early stage at this point, but certainly an active set of conversations going on right now with prospects around what those kinds of deals structures might look like. I would remind you that the Health Net deal, the sales cycle was probably in the order of, Health Net has been a Cognizant's client for 10 years close to 10 years and the sales cycle on this particular transactions was closed to three years. My hope is that when we look at the TriZetto opportunity that we're not looking at three year sales cycle, but I would still set the expectations that it's 18 to 20 months before we start to see those kinds of transactions these are large complicated deals that involve a lot of structuring and a lot of groundwork with clients, but I think all of the elements are there I feel very good about how we're positioned to do those deals and I think that the Health Net transaction serves us as somewhat of a beacon that others will emulate. Gordon Coburn : Operator we have time for one more call. One more question. Operator : Yes that question is coming from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Steven Milunovich : Great. Thank you very much. Just quick question Karen could you go over the discussion of incentive comp again and the impact? Karen McLoughlin : Sure so in Q4, we adjusted down our incentive comp across as you know that's obviously variable compensation and we tie that to the performance of the business and which is both based on the revenue and margin. So we did adjust that down in Q4 to offset the margin impact the strong hiring\u2019s and some of the other investments we were making in the quarter and that had a two point impact on the quarter. Francisco D'Souza: Very good. I think with that we'll wrap up the call. I want to just thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. And I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks for joining us. Operator : Thank you.

Francisco, please go ahead. Francisco D'Souza: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We had another great quarter and a solid start to 2015. Our first quarter revenues were $2.91 billion. This represented a sequentially increase of 6.2% after a negative currency impact of 1.1%. Our sequential growth was well ahead of our previous guidance and was driven by strong organic growth in our core business, coupled with solid inline performance in the TriZetto business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, at the higher end of our target range of 19% to 20%. Based on our current visibility and strong sales pipeline, we are pleased to increase our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.24 billion and non-GAAP EPS guidance to $2.93, which reflects our strong over-performance during quarter one. Our results this quarter and our guidance for the full year are clear reflection that we are well positioned to serve the needs of our clients. As I said in the past, we are in the midst of a once in a decade shift in the technology landscape, which is creating significant opportunities for services firms that have the right portfolio. Our results demonstrate that our strategy, investments and solutions are strongly aligned with the evolving market demand. Today more than ever, our clients are grappling with the dual mandate and our run better, run different value proposition is resonating well with them. On side of the dual mandate, the shift towards digital is front-end center for our clients. Our digital offerings are seeing strong traction in the market. In addition, as clients deploy digital technologies, it\u2019s creating demand for our traditional services in areas such as legacy modernization and integration. Gordon will give you examples of some of our leading edge digital work in a few moments. On the other side of the dual mandate, clients continue to drive down costs in their core operations. We see this manifested in two ways. First, clients are adopting our traditional service offerings more broadly and driving demand for integrated multi-service deals. And second, we are seeing clients exploring new frontiers of cost and operating efficiency through new as-a-service utility models. As we saw this scenario unfold over the past few years, we embedded in the company a systematic capability in the form of our three horizon model, to rapidly identify changing market demands and capitalize on them. As a result, we now have a solid comprehensive portfolio of services for the current needs of our clients, as well as a robust mechanism to ensure that we have the organizational agility to make the right investments to remain relevant to clients going forward. On the digital front, our differentiated approach that we call digital works has seen great traction and recent digital acquisitions like Cadient, Odecee and itaas have helped to round out our digital services and geographic footprint. Beyond digital, we have a number of other high growth businesses. Our investment over the past several years in business process, infrastructure and consulting services have paid off and these practices continue to be solid drivers of growth. Each of these practices has the potential to be a multi-billion dollar revenue source for the company. This quarter, I am particularly pleased with the growth of infrastructure services which crossed the $1 billion annual run rate mark. And finally, I am very excited about our portfolio of as-a-service utility offerings that we build through acquisitions like TriZetto and Sourcenet, client transactions like Health Net and our own organic efforts with clients such as TransCelerate. Let me spend the next few minutes providing more detail around the key trends that we see shaping demand. I'll then turn it over to Gordon to provide deeper insights on what we see across our business segments and to Karen for details on the financials. The first key trend shaping demand is the shift towards digital, which is a priority for our clients because it\u2019s a priority for their customers. Having worked with clients on hundreds of digital projects, it\u2019s very clear to us that winning in the digital era requires a new engagement model. Clients need a partner who can bring new capabilities in design, data science and digital technology in addition to a deep understanding of our clients business, operating model and technology landscape. Clients recognize that they often do not have in-house capabilities in all these areas and are looking to deepen relationships with partners who have invested for the digital landscape. Furthermore, what's interesting and important to note, is that the shift to a digital enterprise is in turn driving demand for our traditional services. No digital transformation is complete without integration with the enterprises legacy systems and business processes. Existing IT infrastructure, systems and applications and business processes often need to be re-tooled to accommodate the explosion of users, data, devices and sensors that offer the company digital deployments. Clients continue to look for new ways to drive down the cost of operations in their core business in order to remain competitive and to fund their digital transformation. As I mentioned, we're seeing clients broadening and deepening their use of our services often through multi-service solutions. In these situations, our broad portfolio of services is critical to provide a comprehensive solution to a client. We are also pushing beyond traditional delivery models and creating as-a-service utility, industry utilities that provide clients a low cost, high efficiency shared capability and variable cost structure. By bringing together applications, cloud and business process services to create industry utilities, we are helping clients by distributing high fixed cost across multiple customers in an industry. These are clearly exciting times in our industry and we believe that Cognizant is well positioned to be the partner clients will return to in transforming their businesses. With that I'll turn it over to Gordon, and I'll be back to take your questions. Gordon? Gordon Coburn : Good morning, Francisco. And thank you. Before we provide more detail on our industry, services and geographic segments, let me offer some color on how the shift to a digital enterprise is driving greater demand for our traditional services and is in many cases changing how we deliver these services. Clients are reconsidering how they manage their traditional investments in technology and business processes. As there are team to drive higher levels of efficiencies and fund their transition through digital enterprises. Often this is manifested in integrated multi-service line deals. As Francisco said, we are seeing a stepped up demand for new business models, such as-a-service utility for platform based models, which clients create variable cost structures, enhance efficiency and drive agility and time to market. Let me explain this a bit further with some recent examples. Integrated multi-service solutions typically include a combination of consulting, IT services, BPO services and infrastructure services to drive higher levels of efficiency, agility and innovation. We recently entered into a strategic partnership with CNO Financial Group, to transform its IT capabilities for its insurance subsidiaries, enhancing agent and customer experience. These subsidiaries include well known brands like Bankers Life, Colonial Penn and Washington National. This deal encompasses multiple IT functions, spending application maintenance, application development, testing and select IT infrastructure services. In addition to delivering annual expense savings to CNO, this partnership will innovatively help CNO Financial to better compete in the underserved middle market. Another example is how we're combining our finance and accounting automation and enterprise analytic capabilities with drug insurance, a leading insurer in the Nordics, to drive end-to-end accountability for data compliance, as well as financial reporting. Thus improving risk assessments and governance. Lastly, as Francisco mentioned, we are increasing bringing together applications, infrastructure and business processes to create industry utilities benefiting multiple customers in an industry. This approach is helping clients from setting strategy, to transforming business operations, to managing technology needs is helping us establish even greater mindshare and market leadership. Let me now move to a detailed commentary of our individual industry practices. Our banking and financial services segment grew 3.6% sequentially and 13.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in our insurance practice. Within banking, clients remain focused on cost optimization and vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cyber security. In addition, there is an increased focus on newer technologies in digital and automation, particularly in areas to improve customer experience and drive digital customer self service. An example of our work in digital is a program for Chola Investments in India. We are helping this client to digitally transform its entire vehicle finance business by reengineering business processes, digitizing workflows and developing multi-channel applications to drive real time decision making, improve customer experience and enhance operational efficiencies. And for a leading bank in the US, we are helping build the branch of the future, by providing a seamless multi-channel integration and in lobby digital applications. So it can provide customers with a compelling real time personalized experience. Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients grew 13.8% sequentially, and 42.7% year-over-year, including the impact of TriZetto. Our payer clients continue to take a cautious approach to spending. Cost optimization is still a key driver, while clients are also looking to leverage analytics to drive profitability and improve customer retention. The payer sector is undergoing fundamental changes, driven by changing regulatory environment, increasing focus on medical and the consumerization of healthcare. We believe these changes create longer term opportunities that we are well positioned to capture. The integration of TriZetto is on track and our combined offerings are clearly resonating with clients. We've moved aggressively to increase staffing. We've added 500 consultants who are \u2013 are they already deployed or trained and ready to deploy to assist in driving revenue synergies. In addition, we've added 300 people to our global delivery centers to accelerate product development in our TriZettong platforms. This action is already paying off. In the first quarter alone we were selected for synergy deals with a total contract value of $200 million. With the number of additional deals in our pipeline, we are in active discussion with a number of payers about integrated solutions, leveraging TriZetto's platforms and our service capabilities. As you can see, we're well on our way to generating the $1.5 billion of revenue synergies that we spoke about at the time of acquisition. Moving on to our pharmaceutical business, we continue to see a trend towards multi-service deals across infrastructure and IT services, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms. Additionally, we are seeing steady demand driven by vendor consolidation and cost optimization across many existing and new clients. We're quite please with the traction we are seeing from our acquisition of Cadient where we've added nine new logos since closing the acquisition late last year. Recently our Otsuka Pharmaceutical, a US pharmaceutical research and development company publicly highlighted the work Cadient delivered in helping it to develop and deploy a highly innovative approach to communicating with clinical trial investigators using iPads and large format text \u2013 touch screen technology. Additionally, we are proud that Cadient recently won a prestigious life sciences industry marketing award that is further validation of the value we're providing to clients. Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 2.7% sequentially and 7.2% year-over-year. We are seeing early signs of improved demand following a soft 2014, particularly in areas of modernizing supply chains, as well as digital and e-commerce engagements. For a large retail in South East Asia, we are implementing a digital e-commerce platform to deliver a seamless omni channel shopping experience for their customers. This will allow more efficient retail management and a better understanding of customer preferences and purchasing history. And for many other retailers around the world, we are helping them exceed customer expectations with the latest digital technologies. For example, we're partnering with a major US clothing manufacture to redesign their stores. We are helping a prominent retailer in Asia Pacific to provide a seamless multi-channel and shopping experience. And we're supporting a leading US discount retailer in using the cloud to deliver superior services at its 8000 stores. Our other segment which includes hi-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients was up 2.6% sequentially and 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by improved discretionary spending at our hi-technology clients. Partnering with Google, we are helping a major workforce solution and servicing company reengineer how they approach, search and match talent against demand, creating a new paradigm around finding the right candidate. As transactions increasingly become video enabled, we are seeing strong demand for services provided through our iTask acquisition with our communications and media and entertainment clients, as well as a growing demand among clients and other industries, such as banking and retail. Let me now turn to our Horizon II service lines. We continue to be pleased with the market traction we\u2019re realizing here. Our Business Process Services or BPS practice saw continued success during the quarter, launching on the ramp up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance and healthcare. BPS is a critical component in bringing operating efficiencies to our clients, increasingly this is delivered through solutions leveraging technology and robotic automation. Through the acquisition of TriZetto, we gained a strong robotic automation platform with artificial intelligence and machine learning capability. This platform is now part of our suite of automation platforms within our robotics process automation practice. This practice focuses on automating both technology and business processes where physical labor is replaced with digital labor. The business outcome include faster processing times with fewer errors, virtually unlimited scalability and lower cost of ownership, along with ability to make timely business decisions through a automated enabled \u2013 automation enabled analytics. Let me give you an example. We use this platform to help a major US healthcare payer in their claims processing organization. The client was initially expecting a six month project to clear claims backlogs, primarily by using additional people for processing. We're able to implement a robotic process automation solution in six weeks and clear the backlog in just one additional week. Cognizant infrastructure services had another strong quarter. Clients are looking for solutions which drive simplification and predictable operations to accelerate their IT transformation. Increasingly this is being delivered through multi-service solutions, often combining applications and infrastructure, as well as the use of newer technology such as our hybrid cloud and mobility solutions. Cognizant was recently named a top IT infrastructure transformation consulting provider by Kennedy Consulting Research and Advisory. To report highlighted our strong capabilities in IT infrastructure transformation strategy and roadmap development, advisory services across data center and storage transformation, workplace transformation, business continuity and debt disaster recovery, and IT infrastructure security. Cognizant business consulting or CBC continues to take a lead role in many of our transformation deal, helping architect the deals and drive change management in our clients businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, over 60% of CBCs pipeline has a digital component. For example, we're helping a major US hotel and casino operator to utilize big data and analytics to speed up and improve decision making across all aspects of their business. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 7.4% sequentially and 24.8% year-over-year. Our European operations recorded strong growth, when read [ph] from a local currency perspective. As you know the European currencies have declined significantly against the US dollar during the first quarter. Revenue in Europe was up two tenths of percent compared to the fourth quarter, after a 4.8% negative currency impact. Continental Europe declined 2.9% sequentially, after a 6.3% negative currency impact. We expect solid growth in the continent over the coming years as we increasingly benefit from the structural shift towards larger multi-year outsourcing programs. Finally, we saw a good traction in the rest of the world, which was up 7.6% sequentially after a 2.8% negative currency impact. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India and the Middle East. We're pleased with the strength of our performance across industries, service lines and the geographies we serve. With that, let me have Karen to provide more color on the financial details of the strong performance. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you Gordon and good morning everyone. First quarter revenue of $2.91 billion represented growth of 6.2% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, we had $30 million negative currency headwind which impacted revenue growth by 110 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related expenses was 19.8% within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.71, exceeded guidance by $0.02. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 56% and 44% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 10% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 1% sequentially and grew 8% from Q1 a year ago. During the first quarter $36% of our revenue came from fixed price contract and as expected overall pricing was stable. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter defined as clients who had the potential generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 278. During the first quarter, we repurchased 4000 shares to a total cost of approximately $25 million. To-date, we have repurchased approximately 35.6 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion under our share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $789 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count increased slightly to 613.9 million shares during the quarter. Total receivables were $2.1 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 73 days. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately 388 million, up from 325 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 51% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverable. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.35 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $425 million from the quarter ending December 31st and down by approximately $515 million from the year ago period. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including approximately $100 million outstanding on our revolver. Financing activities were approximately at $557 million use of cash during the quarter with almost all of those claim [ph] to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Operating activities generated approximately $189 million and capital expenditures were approximately $58 million during the quarter. Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics. During the quarter, we added approximately 6200 employees and we ended the quarter with approximately 217,700 employees globally. Approximately 204,000 of our employees are service delivery staff. Annualized attrition of 14% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees improved by 110 basis points year-over-year. Utilization was essentially flat on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization was approximately 70%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates during our training program was approximately 76% and onsite utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and for the rest of the year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and our non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect a strong over performance during quarter one. Therefore, we were revising our full year guidance to at least $12.24 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 19.3% over 2014. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.01 billion. During the second quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin as 19% to 20%. For Q2, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.72. Non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 613.5 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.02 to at least $2.93. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.4%. Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi, thank you. Great results. I just wanted ask, I guess your result here were quite strong relative to peers, how would you explain difference versus like we hear from our peers, any commentary would be great? Thank you. Francisco D'Souza: Hi, Tien-tsin. It\u2019s Frank. We were pleased with \u2013 on our Q1 result, so I think though it\u2019s just manifestation of what we've been saying to you for some time now, I think we're doing well because we're winning in digital. We've got great portfolio of services in the digital space. We've got this unique approach to helping clients with digital transformation, what we call digital work. It\u2019s a fully integrated companywide approach to helping clients with digital transformation. And on top of that, as the trend towards digital picks up momentum, its driving demand for our core traditional services, which is in turn fueling growth again for us. And it\u2019s very important that we are able and I think that drive demand for us that we're able to offer that to the clients, sort of this end-to-end ability to the digital transformation and then pick up the demand on the other side with the traditional legacy modernization. So I think its strong performance in digital. We feel like we've got a great position in the industry that we serve. We've been investing for a long time as you know in things like consulting and deep domain, industry expertise, so you put all of that together and feel like we're very strongly positioned in the marketplace. Tien- tsin Huang : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hi. Congratulations on the good started quarter. I guess my question was on the cadence of 2Q versus 3Q, normally these are your two very strong quarters. When do you expect the contribution from Health Net to begin and Gordon you mentioned TriZetto synergy, that\u2019s a good \u2013 that\u2019s a great start. But when do they actually started in revenues? Gordon Coburn : Sure. Hi, Ashwin. We continue to expect Health Net to be approved and go live in the mid year. So we would expect the benefits from that to start to kick in, in the third quarter of this year. So things are right on track for Health Net. Ashwin, what was the second one? Ashwin Shirvaikar : The question was on TriZetto, you mentioned TriZetto synergies when do they actually start hitting revenues? Gordon Coburn : Sure. So that wraps over time, we've been awarded by $200 million worth of deals, some of that is consulting work which kicks in fairly quickly other that is more associated with implementations that takes a bit longer. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller : Thanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter. Just wanted some general quick on your guidance, I mean, you raised by about [indiscernible] it looks like things are going little bit better than you had expected graphs on the synergy side with TriZetto? When we just talk about that for a moment, any elements conservative on the guidance and maybe in the past you've said things like discretionary might come up more through the year, we are waiting to see. So what kind of color can you give us on that, what are you still waiting to see through the year before potentially, guidance driven better raise and then in terms of synergies, I mean, are you seeing more than you thought or is it inline? Thanks a lot guys. Francisco D'Souza: Sure. I think you hit it exactly right, because the strength is coming from the discretionary side of the business in digital, it is little bit tougher to predict that. So we are clearly still being conservative in our guidance and that\u2019s why we use the terminology of that leased. So we let Q1 flow through and then we'll continue to watch, you know, at what levels of strength do we have in digital going for the rest of the year. But we'd rather be conservative than get out ahead of ourselves. Gordon Coburn : And Darrin, I think on TriZetto synergies, I would say that we've been pleased with \u2013 we always knew that there was a strong synergy case here, we told you that when we did the acquisition, I think we've been pleased with the momentum we've seen, its been a little bit faster than we expected. As Gordon mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've added 500 consultants to the business at this point already in what's a little over 90 days effectively, not all of those folks billing yet, but a large number of them are billing and we expect that the rest would be billing relatively quickly. So that\u2019s already kicked in, that showing the results right away. We also have a healthy pipeline and also deals that we've been awarded, sort of longer time synergy deals. So I think I would say that we've done a lot of 90 days that\u2019s exceeded my expectations a little bit. And so I am optimistic that the revenue synergies will start to manifest themselves in our results in a little bit faster than we had originally expected. Darrin Peller : Great. That\u2019s great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane : Just a clarification on the guidance 1Q organic constant currency revenue rose sequentially ex- TriZetto, my math was about 4% to 2Q 2015 guidance sequentially is about 3.4, then I know typically 2Q sequentially rose faster than 1Q, but it doesn\u2019t appear to be the case there, just curious on your thoughts on that. And then secondly, outsourcing when we increased 1% sequentially little surprised hitting growth faster, any help on that too? Thanks so much. Karen McLoughlin : So Bryan, this is Karen. Your calculations for 4% organic on a constant currency basis right, that\u2019s about the right number for Q4 to Q1. We did see strong growth obviously in the quarter both an organic as well as the consolidate basis, I think as Gordon just talked about given the level of digital and discretionary spending that we're seeing the portfolio, right now we've been prudently thinking our guidance for Q2 and for the rest of the year and as we said we've guided to about 3.4%. Currency rates obviously have stabilized this past week, the first \u2013 the first few weeks of April obviously they were moving quite a bit, but based on where we are now way to generally back inline with where they were when we provide guidance back in February, but we think we've been prudent in our guidance for the quarter and the full year. In regards to your question about outsourcing I think Frank you wanted to comment on that? Francisco D'Souza: Yes, look, you know, as we've said in the past, we won a bunch of outsourcing programs. We expect them to ramp up in the coming quarters. We talked to you a quarter two ago about these three large deals that will all be in the outsourcing space, including Health Net and that will start to ramp up. But I think what's important here also is to understand the underlying trend of what's going on, as we \u2013 as clients go through this big investment cycle around digital and start to focus a lot of energy and attention on implementing new digital capital in their organizations. There is a natural shift of little bit away from doing what I consider to be the more discretionary aspects of maintenance work. So you're not going to invest substantially in supporting or enhancing rather an existing application if its going to be replaced or so planted by a new digital capability. And so you're going to see a little bit of that I would suspect as we go through this which may manifest itself in a little bit more lumpiness in discretionary versus outsourcing in the coming quarters. I think its important to understand what's driving that, in the net I view it is a very positive thing because it says to me that we're winning in digital, we are helping our clients transform their businesses, science maybe investing a little bit less than that and maintaining or enhancing the existing systems and that\u2019s okay, because we're picking it up on the digital side. Bryan Keane : Okay. Great, results. Thanks for the help. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Sara Gubins : Morning, thank you. Could you talk about growth at your largest top five and top 10 customers in the quarter, maybe give us what percent they represent of revenue and what's the turn [ph] is been there? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. Sara, this Karen. Good morning. So top five for the quarter represented a 11.2% and top 10 about 19% for the quarter, so down a little bit from where they were in Q4, which we would expect obviously the business continues to move and expand. From a sequential basis, our two top five rather grew 2% for the quarter and our top 10 grew just under 1% for the quarter, on a reported basis. Sara Gubins : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good morning, guys. And Frank and Gordon, you talked a lot about the demand on the client side for more as-a-service models, can you a talk a bit about the pricing environment you are seeing there and the willingness of clients to adopt outcomes based pricing? Francisco D'Souza: Sure. So let's talk about client\u2019s willingness to adopt, I think to put into three buckets, input based pricing, output based pricing and outcome based pricing, clearly clients are comfortable on the shift from input to output based. So moving to fixed price to manage services and so forth. What's finally quite intriguing is as clients are now starting to give out outcome based pricing, we do this in large healthcare deal that we announced where the clients are going to pay per member per month, here regardless of what are the volumes involved in supporting those clients. We think that is the way the future end up, particularly these end-to-end solutions that we're talking about, where we provide everything from the applications to the infrastructure to the business process services. So its taking soft-as-a-service one step further and actually providing the transaction services around it. In the end it will be a continuum. Some people would still want on premise custom applications and we'll continue to do that in our traditional business, some clients will want SaaS model clearly TriZetto support that, some will want to full end-to-end solution, we'll have that through to Help Net platform as well as the TriZetto platform. So we're feeling quite good about how the migration is happening across this spectrums of ways to engage. Pricing on the end-to-end solutions and SaaS obviously there is scale efficiencies there, so when you start out with the new offering until you gain scale you \u2013 even if your pricing is fine, there will be pressure on margin, and that\u2019s normal, that\u2019s the exactly that should work where you're making that upfront investment. But then as you gain scale, we feel pretty good about it. So overall as Karen mentioned, pricing is stable, which is in this environment I think is good, clients are focused far or less on the rate card, much more on what is the cost of ownership. So if we can demonstrate best in class delivery, constantly lowering the cost of ownership through periodicity, through automation, clients are very happy and I think that\u2019s one of the reason on the traditional side of the business we continue to do quite well. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you can look at your healthcare and financials internal plan versus a one quarter ago, can you talk about what the movement there is been either to a positive or negative and maybe callout any sub segments that \u2013 were particularly strong or weak on the incremental basis third quarter? Francisco D'Souza: I am not sure there would be any big changes, we were obviously quite optimistic, coming into the year we provided industry leading revenue growth guidance, I think we're one of the very few who were actually increasing guidance in this environment. So its \u2013 I think we call a bit right, when we started the year on that, you know, we have stability in our healthcare, stability in financial services. We see clients looking for vendor consolidation. We're seeing them look for best in class delivery and clearly we are seeing them interested in digital. Our services capabilities, so importantly the investments we've made over a number of years in our consulting capability, in our domain expertise has become critically important and I think that\u2019s one reason why you're seeing the body language that we're providing today. Jim Schneider : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mai Tanden [ph] with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Good morning. Gordon, you gave us some color on the healthcare segment, what the drivers are, I wanted to get a sense from you in terms of what's changed thus last year, the drivers are still in place, but then you had a weak healthcare segment, maybe just give us a better sense of what's changed from last year versus this year in terms of the catalyst on the healthcare side? Gordon Coburn : I think there is several things we have to break it down by sub segment, in the pharmaceutical industry last year was very tough, because the drug pattern cliffs that clients we are facing, this year you are seeing movements in the pharmaceutical space towards vendor consolidation, towards shared service. So even though its still a tough economic environment we are seeing clients make very thoughtful and transformative decisions and we' just incredibly well positioned to assist them in that. On the payer side, obviously TriZetto was a game changer. We already had a strong practice, now we have just an incredible practice that payers across the board looked to Cognizant to solve some of their toughest problems, whether be on the cost side, or on the innovation side or controlling management costs, so I think we're incredibly well positioned to help those payer clients and have a material impact on the delivery of healthcare in America on the cost of healthcare delivery in America. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Essex : Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment on a little bit what you've seen on the I guess, where your posture is on M&A, now that you kind of got a little bit better integration now with TriZetto and we're looking into 2015. What's your posture on M&A, I see you've been able to pay down a little bit of debt, but we've seen a lot of consolidation in the industry as well. But just looking for you view going into 2015 how that might have changed or maybe you've been aggressive on that front? Francisco D'Souza: Hi. It\u2019s Frank. Look I think, I would say our posture is unchanged. We continue to look at as we historically have at small tuck in acquisitions, I expect that we \u2013 our pipeline of small tuck in acquisitions continues to be strong and healthy and we will \u2013 I expect that we'll do as we have in past years, excuse me, we find the right ones we'll do some of those this year. Our screen is the same as its always been. We're always looking for acquisitions that help us with new or geographies where we are under penetrated, deepening our industry skills or expertise or new technology areas. I'd expect with digital being such a big theme at this point we will continue to look at that very closely as a potential space for M&A across geographies and particular technology or skill areas in the digital space. And then as we said you know, I am very pleased with how the TriZetto acquisition is gone. It was our first large scale acquisition and we'll continue, we feel like we still need to integrate that, digest it to make sure that its on the solid footing before we continue \u2013 we'd consider doing something else of that side and scale a magnitude. Brian Essex : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Edward Caso : Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. You had mentioned vendor consolidation several times, can you talk a little bit more about the process like how many vendors shrinking down to how many and I assume this is a volume for price arrangement, so could you give us sort of sense on how that whole vendor consolidation works? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: Hi, Ed. It\u2019s Frank. Let me try and take a stab at it. I think usually what you'll see is clients looking at you know, typical scenario is that they would have of a larger client, they'd have four, five sizeable, scale players working for them and then a very long tail of smaller providers that are each individually relatively small, but collectively make up a significant demand of the clients spend. And so, what we typically see is clients saying, from that we'll go down to maybe three, sometimes two suppliers and importantly of the big ones, and then importantly we'll cut them, we'll cut the tail substantially and so there is a lot of emphasis across our clients on consolidating what's been called a long tail of supplier, so the smaller suppliers that have a legal system [ph] at the client. I would say and that sometimes and obviously there is an economic component to this which is clients looking at better total cost of ownership, and I think that\u2019s important because very often we get confused between the pricing versus the total cost of ownership. But clients are really are realizing that this is a total cost of ownership game, very often when we see these vendor consolidation things of conversations with clients they are accompanied with conversations about moves to managed services. And that I would say very, very common theme. So its not just a pure, we'll give you more volume and reduce price in some way they perform, the clients recognize that we need to have levers likely to move to managed services which allows to drive greater productivity across the greater volume and therefore protect our margin and improve our service quality for them. And in the last thing I would say, that its not just a question of volume and price, there are other considerations that clients look at particularly around things like security and the idea that dealing with the smaller number of players allows them to manage the security environment a little bit more tightly. So that they have less exposure from that to the end point. Edward Caso : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi, thank you. On the last call, you indicated that TriZetto closed 2014 at $729 million it was mid single digit growth rates and margins that were neutral to the business. Could you just update us on you thinking, you've added a number of consultants related to that, it sounds like gross could be actually be a little better in TriZetto and or margins little bit more of a headwind if you are adding all of those consultant? Thank you. Karen McLoughlin : So, Keith. This is Karen. So the numbers that we talked before the $720 that you referred that that\u2019s one of the core TriZetto business, right, and so TriZetto on its own, we would argue but still been a single digit grower. The growth that we're adding is really to take advantage of the synergy revenues that we talked about back in September when we announced the deal. So really pushing towards that $1.5 billion of revenue synergy over the next five years. In terms of again as a core business, core business continues to be margin neutral to us, but as we talked in Gordon's comments, we've obviously added about 500 people to really help drive those revenue synergies and another 300 people to work on development of the platform. So little bit of impact to margin there, its not material though and obviously that baked in to our utilization rates that you saw were essentially flat on a sequential basis. Keith Bachman : Okay. Great. Thanks, Karen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of [indiscernible] with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Maybe you could talk a little bit just some of the \u2013 of your competitors, just expectations you talked about. I think obviously heard everything here on the call, were you one of the price leaders that were causing one of the problems and maybe you could also just tie in, that you've done a lot in the consulting area and obviously in digital. How do you feel that you're positioned in comparison to others, do you feel you are material number of steps ahead, just some comments there will be really helpful? Gordon Coburn : Sure. I certainly would not view as a driver of price declines the market by such a imagination. We are positioned as the value that we're delivering to the clients for the price that we charge, clients look at that and say its an extraordinarily compelling proposition where we have industry leading security capabilities, industry leading consulting, industry leading domain expertise, best in class delivery when clients look at all that and the say the value of what they get from price recharge makes it a compelling proposition, I think that\u2019s \u2013 that in the end is what's driving our industry leading growth. Francisco D'Souza: And let me add, this is Frank. Let me talk a little bit about digital, as I said in my prepared comments, as we've done hundreds of digital projects at this point, its very clear to us now that truly being successful in digital is not just about applying traditional approaches and methodologies to a new paradigm it requires a whole new engagement model. And what I mean by that is that you need to really truly the digital businesses, need to bring together a new set of skills and capabilities and these are typically in areas like data science, design, and of course the digital technology skills. We've got to bring those and new capabilities together with traditional capabilities in consulting and strategy, and deep domain expertise and you got to be able to bring these talents together, people with these talents together to create very short cycle rapid bursts of innovation. So that you can respond to the changing market demands very, very quickly. That requires a new engagement model and that is what is embodied in our digital works approach and methodology that we've infused across the company. And so we feel like we are several steps ahead of key competitors on building out the methodology, on having a real approach that we've tested, road tested with many, many clients and of course building out the core fundamental capabilities in these new areas that you need to be successful in digital. Unidentified Analyst : Can you give us any type of sizing you have, so this comparison to the rest of your business? Gordon Coburn : I think here is the challenge, I know lots of people put out size of their digital practice, its very difficult at this point to separate what' digital, what's not, because so fully integrated and needs to be integrated. So the answers we can give you small number or massive number both numbers would be right depending on the definition. But what we are seeing is that digital component that is a digital component more and more of the projects and I think the value part of what finds like without us is how its integrated back into their systems across our entire service offering. So when I look at what touches digital in our business, it\u2019s a very high percentage. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Moshe Katri : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Gordon or Karen, can you give us the organic revenue growth number sequentially from the healthcare vertical and then was there any FX impact on EBIT margin, the non-GAAP EBIT margin during the quarter? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin : Yes, sure. Moshe, this is Karen. So let me talk about margins first, really no impact on margins due to all the currency movements during the first quarter is fairly neutral at the margin level, it\u2019s a more of a top line issue for us. In terms of the healthcare segment, excluding TriZetto on a reported basis we grew about 2.6% a little bit faster on a constant currency basis, the healthcare components that are payer business is primarily North America business, so that does not have any FX impact but our life sciences business does has some FX impact. So but its grown a little bit faster than the 2.6% reported. Moshe Katri : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Good morning. This is Peter in for Steve. Frank, I want to follow up on a previous question as it relates to digital skills set, as digital gains momentum with the industry, I mean there is concern that competition for digital talent could intensify and potentially be a bottleneck in scarcity for some engineers and data scientist and consultants with the know how and the experience. Do you see this level of tightness to day or beginning to emerge or is there \u2013 do you perceive a risk in the future that competition for this \u2013 for these skill set could materially intensify? Francisco D'Souza: Look, I think that it\u2019s something that\u2019s on our radar, something we're concerned about. We think that we've got a terrific engine to both recruit talent in the marketplace and to train talent and scale up in certain areas. Let me talk a little bit about both of those, I think first of all in terms of our ability to recruit around the world, as you know its always been a core competency of Cognizant's but I think the fact that our brand is extremely strong around the world in the recruitment market, the fact that the company performance has been solid over the last several years and the fact we are winning in digital, creates a great platform for us to recruit the best talent in the world. And I think we built a phenomenal set of leadership in digital in these areas in all of the new areas that I mentioned. And I am confident that that leadership tame will in turn be able to attract and scale that their respective teams. In addition to that, in the digital technology areas we think that our traditional consultants can \u2013 we can retrain and re-skill and in fact we already are particularly with those that we need where the real scale is, is on the integration between the new digital world and the traditional environment. And so in that space where a lot of the scale requirement is, we are both recruiting but we are also re training and cross training. So I feel good that we've got a roadmap going forward to be able to address the skill issue. David Nelson : Operator, go ahead\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : Do you see digital is primarily as an agile effort compared to what has been in the past more of a wonderful [ph] approach? Francisco D'Souza: Yes, I mean, clearly it\u2019s a little bit more then, I would characterize its little bit more than traditional agile development compared to waterfall, it\u2019s a whole \u2013 what I think over its agile business profits capability, right, so a business, new functionality capability. So its sort of end-to-end from being able to understand what you are customers, customers is looking for all the way through creating a digital capability that end-to-end process has to be agile in the broader sense of the word agile which is that you've got to be able to do rapid innovation. You've got to be able to very quickly bring new functionality to market, you've got to have the ability to test that in real time and make sure that its meeting the needs of the client and its not back tracked out of that to be able to change course. So all of that has to happen in very short cycle. That requires the traditional agile development it requires a new approach to processes as we use development and testing and so there is a lot of underlying pluming that needs to change. But I would say its on overall end-to-end much more agile process, yes. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. David Nelson : Operator, we have time for one final question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Foresi : Hi, thanks for sneaking me in there at the end. I was just wondering are the margins lower in the digital business and is there less visibility than traditional outsourcing and maybe you could just give us an update on where you stand on the regulatory side with Health Net. Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: Sure. So let me touch base first on the regulatory side, things are on track. We still expect to \u2013 are subject to regulatory approval, that the expectations would still go live, maybe or so far so good there obviously we don\u2019t have the final approvals yet. When you look margins for digital, it is high value work, so we think it should be helping margins. Clearly they tend to be shorter cycle projects, so like of our discretionary work, the visibility is not the same as it would on maintenance and as I said that\u2019s one of the reason why we remain conservative in our guidance for the year, just because you do have more volatility there, but we're as you can tell we're feeling quite good about our positioning in digital and more importantly the demand that we're seeing in digital today. Joseph Foresi : Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: With that, I think we could wrap up. Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today and for your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.

Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This was a tremendous quarter. In fact, in dollar terms we have the strongest sequential revenue growth in our history, exceeding both our expectations and our guidance. This comes on the heels of strong performance in Q1. We have got a great portfolio of offerings, and as a result, we're seeing robust demand for services, a trend that has continued to accelerate from the first quarter. Our Q2 revenue was $3.09 billion, up 6% or $174 million over Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.2% slightly exceeded our targeted range of 19% to 20%. Similar to Q1, we saw very robust underlying demand across the geographies and industries that we serve. Our pace of hiring throughout 2014 and during the first quarter of 2015 ensures that we were prepared to capture this demand as it emerged. This was a clear reflection of the strength of our business model that enables us to make investments in anticipation of evolving demand. I'm pleased to say that we are increasing our full year revenue guidance for the second time this year to at least $12.33 billion and our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to at least $3. Our performance in the first half of this year gives us strong confidence in this guidance despite the restructuring of our contract with Health Net. The underlying drivers of our revenue growth in Q2 remain consistent with the trends that we've seen in prior quarters. As we've said before, market dynamics are creating a dual mandate whereby clients continue to push hard for operational efficiency while driving digital transformation and innovation at scale. Our run better/run different value proposition continues to resonate well with clients, and as a result, demand for our services remains strong. Dual mandate is also driving a fundamental change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated. Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from lights on maintenance and operations projects to new digital initiatives. This shift is good for us because we're in a strong position to capture the enormous opportunities that are emerging from the transition to digital business. To grow our investments in new solutions and services, we're enabling clients to enhance efficiencies and productivity while simultaneously reimagining their businesses and building new capabilities to succeed in the digital era. To fully address the run better/run different needs of our clients, we're investing in four key areas. First, we are enabling our clients to be best-in-class when it comes to running and operating their core systems and business processes. As such, we're constantly optimizing our traditional services as well as investing in new services to enable clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. We are doing this by finding new ways to simplify and automate clients' core processes, IT applications, and IT infrastructure. Across our applications Infrastructure and Business Process Services, we are creating new delivery models such a shared services and industry utilities. To help us enhance these delivery models, we're deploying automated software engineering, artificial intelligence, and other tools for advanced automation. Our home grown automation tools like ad pod and automatica (4:58) combined with tools that we obtained from the acquisition of TriZetto placed us in a strong competitive position to deliver these new models. The second area where we're investing is in capabilities that enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As digital technologies become mainstream, organizations must continuously innovate to deploy these technologies to drive market differentiation and performance. For Cognizant, digital is more than just technology. Digital for us means the ability to connect technology, data science, devices, design, and business strategy to change a business process or a customer experience. And given the pace of technology change, our clients not only want single point digital solutions, but have a need to innovate on a continuous basis and make innovation a part of the organization's DNA, what we refer to as innovation at scale. Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale. We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works accelerated methodology which is comprised of three elements. The first is the Digital Works' idea lab where we work with clients to create an approach to imagine the digital future of a business process or a customer experience and to identify a series of specific digital opportunities or ideas based on their vision of the future. Once the ideas have been prioritized, the second step is to design and prototype specific digital solutions in our Digital Works' laboratory which is a physical space where Cognizant works directly with clients to bring together designers, strategists, and technologists to visualize, plan, and prototype the new digital initiatives. And finally, in the Digital Works foundry, we work with clients to scale up their digital initiatives by re-architecting legacy environments, connecting new solutions to existing systems, and creating supporting capabilities in areas like rapid software engineering and security, which are necessary to bring digital ideas to enterprise scale. We find that our integrated Digital Works approach combining design, strategy, technology and industry expertise, coupled with the physical space for co-innovation plays to our strengths and is distinctive in the market. Our third area of investment is in our consulting practice, which is an integral part of our value proposition. Cognizant Business Consulting continues to take a lead role in many of our transformation engagements by helping architect solutions and drive ongoing change management to ensure success in our clients' businesses. Our consultants bring tremendous expertise in industries and functional areas, and we continue to build on that strength. In addition, our consulting practice is deeply integrated with our technology capability and our Business Process Services. Across clients' business, technology and operating model transformations, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as IT, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, programming change management, and process redesign. Our fourth key area of investment is platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new efficiency frontiers and at the same time deploy digital technologies more quickly. We've spoken to you in the past about the trend we've seen towards newer as a service utility models and platform-based solutions which distribute fixed cost across multiple customers in an industry. These models not only drive efficiency but can also enable enterprises to run differently by deploying digital technologies enabling more rapid time-to-value. With that summary of our four key areas of investment, let me close by saying that our willingness to invest in and explore new commercial models make bold decisions about investing early in new technologies and our recognized strong leadership has provided us a solid foundation and a strong platform for growth. Given Cognizant's strong entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change, I'm confident that we're well-positioned for the next phase of our journey. I'll hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance, and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for Q&A. Over to you, Gordon. Gordon James Coburn - President: Thank you, Francisco. We're very pleased with our performance for the first half of 2015. As Francisco said, we have been well-positioned to take advantage of a strong underlying demand environment. The mix of services and capabilities within our portfolio enable us to benefit from the current shifts in clients' spending priorities. As noted previously, clients are focused on driving efficiency of operations and on driving down their cost of operations, in order to remain competitive and to fund their digital transformations. Let me now provide some more context on performance within our individual industry practices. Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 7.7% sequentially, and 18.1% year-over-year, driven by strength in both banking and insurance. Within banking, growth was broad-based across our clients, who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance, and cyber security. In addition, there is an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service. Within insurance, we continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform both the claims and underwriting processes, delivering both greater efficiencies and improved customer service. For example, during Q2, Cognizant helped a leading U.K. bank to conceptualize, design, and build an innovative new solution for its mortgage business. This engagement involved creating new digital channels for mortgage processing by intermediaries. The end result was a significant increase in the volume of business from brokers, and as much as a 75% reduction in the time it takes for new broker on-boarding. Our healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, grew 2.1% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase includes the impact of TriZetto. As the healthcare landscape is changing rapidly, we continue to see our payer clients take a cautious approach to spending. An increased focus on medical cost, consumerization, and a changing regulatory environment is driving consolidation, as well as an ongoing search for solutions that fundamentally change the business model and economics of healthcare management. Given our prominence in the healthcare industry and long history of helping healthcare clients during times of consolidation, we believe that we're well-positioned to partner with our clients as they navigate these transitions. An example of industry consolidation is the proposed acquisition of Health Net by Centene announced in early July. As a result of the acquisition, we do not expect that the seven-year master service agreement with Health Net covering end-to-end administrative services will be implemented. However, with our existing relationship extended through 2020, we're pleased to say that Cognizant will remain a key strategic technology and operations partner to Health Net. In addition, we negotiated the right to license from Health Net certain intellectual property. We expect to leverage that IP, along with TriZetto software and Cognizant's assets, to continue to drive our platform-based solutions. Moving on to our life sciences business, we continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals leveraging cloud technologies and platforms. Luminous, a world leader in medical devices, deployed Cognizant's proprietary platform MedVantage, a cloud-based, integrated, complaint management solution that we built on the Force.com platform. By seamlessly integrating with Luminous's existing salesforce.com infrastructure, MedVantage enables Luminous to provide its stakeholders improved service, efficiency, and reporting. The MedVantage platform is a good example of how we closely collaborate and work with cloud-based providers to enhance functionality. Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 5.4% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year. We continue to see an improving demand environment, particularly around modernizing supply chains, as well as driving digital and multichannel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing and logistics side, we're working with a major auto manufacturer to integrate Apple Watch and other wearables into their vehicles, providing better analytics and insight, and ultimately driving a better customer experience. In designing this solution, we brought together our multidisciplinary capabilities, including product engineering, embedded systems and Internet of Things, as well as analytics for enhanced customer experience. Another example is the work we're doing for one of India's leading engineering conglomerates to modernize its technology landscape and help digitally transform its businesses to deliver innovative products, provide superior customer service, and drive growth. This is a good example of how we've leveraged our global expertise to penetrate new markets and drive new areas of growth. Our other segment, which includes high-tech communications, information, media and entertainment clients, was up 11.5% sequentially and 20.3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across all areas. Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the market traction we're seeing across all three service lines : Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services, and Cognizant Business Process Services. Each of these grew faster than the company average. As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Today, in approximately 70% of consulting deals, CBC competes primarily against Tier 1 global consulting firms. In addition to standalone consulting engagements, CBC today leads many of our transformation deals, helping architect the deals, reengineer processes, and drive change management in our clients' businesses. Reflecting our growing strength in consulting, Cognizant was recently named a leader in the Forrester Wave Business Transformation Consultancies report. Cognizant is one of just five global companies to be named a leader. We were recognized for the investments made in high-quality assets for large-scale business transformations, including building up software and other reusable assets that position us to exploit the long-term trend towards asset-based consulting. Cognizant Business Process Services, or BPS, saw a continued success during the quarter, led by work in insurance, healthcare ,and financial services. Outsourcing of business processes is a crucial component of bringing operational efficiencies to our clients and increasing technology and automation and increasingly, technology and automation are an integral part of the solution. Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see robust growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations, and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, this is being delivered by combining applications and infrastructure, and enabled by newer technologies such as the hybrid cloud. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.8% sequentially and 25.7% year-over-year. Our European operations recorded strong growth. Compared to the first quarter, revenue from Europe was up 5.5% sequentially while the U.K. grew 4.4%. Continental Europe grew 7.3% sequentially. Despite recent macro headlines, our pipeline in Europe continues to be strong. Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the Rest of World, which was up 10.7% sequentially. Growth was driven primarily by strength in markets such as India and Australia. For the second quarter, we were successful in growing our revenue by a record $174 million sequentially while keeping our global head count essentially flat. During 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, we hired aggressively. We did this hiring as well as significant workforce retraining to ensure that we would be ahead of the curve in having the right skills and resources in place to meet the growing demand \u2013 client demand for digital transformation. These investments have clearly positioned us to capitalize on the surge in demand environment leading to record revenue growth for the second quarter. After the staffing investments in 2014 and Q1 of this year, totaling approximately 46,000 net additions, we have the opportunity to drive utilization back up to a more appropriate level while meeting client demand and we moved well down this path during the second quarter. This has freed up dollars to fund our annual compensation increments and key investments in our business while meeting our margin commitments we have set for our shareholders. While attrition is historically seasonally higher in the second quarter due to the timing of bonus payouts and associates leaving for higher education, second quarter annualized attrition this year at 19% was higher than normal. Although higher attrition was an industry-wide phenomenon this quarter, we are working to improve our retention levels through a number of employee engagement initiatives. Due to our industry-leading growth, we know that we provide career opportunities that most others simply cannot. As we have transitioned more towards digital services these past few years, we've been working with our employees to provide clear career paths and role expectations as well as re-skilling our people for the next generation of demand. We are implementing programs to ensure that we will have a highly motivated and engaged workforce who share in our success and understand the tremendous career opportunities that we offer. Over time, we're confident that our attrition numbers will trend down towards more historic levels. We're pleased with the strength of our performance across industries, service lines, and geographies that we serve during the second quarter. With that, let me have Karen now provide more color on the financial details of the strong performance. Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $3.09 billion represented growth of 6% sequentially and 22.6% year-over-year. While currencies were relatively stable on a sequential basis, on a year-over-year basis, we had a $75 million, or 300-basis-point negative impact to revenue growth due to currency. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related expenses, was 20.2%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb wage inflation and promotions that take effect in Q3 while still being able to continue to invest in the business. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 exceeded guidance by $0.07. The Q2 tax rate was lower than anticipated due to the favorable settlement of a discrete tax item during the quarter. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57% and 43% of revenue respectively for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 3% sequentially and grew 9% from Q2 a year ago. During Q2, we saw continuation of the trends that we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards discretionary spending, including digital and other transformational projects. During the second quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 285. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for a total cost of approximately $153 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 38 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.4 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $600 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count remained unchanged at 613.9 million shares in the quarter. Total receivables were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 71.9 days. This is down from 73 days in Q1. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $387 million, down slightly from $388 million at the end of Q1. We built approximately 50% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.57 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $217 million from the quarter ending March 31, and down by approximately $563 million from the year-ago period. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including $100 million outstanding on our revolver. Operating activities generated approximately $456 million. Financing activities were approximately $149 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were approximately $76 million during the quarter. Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics. During the quarter, we added approximately 300 net employees and we ended the quarter with approximately 218,000 employees globally. Approximately 204,000 of our employees were service delivery staff. As expected, utilization was up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points to approximately 73%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 78% and on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the robust demand environment and the strong over-performance during quarter two in spite of the anticipated loss of $100 million in incremental revenue from Health Net. We are revising our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.33 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 20.1% over 2014. This does anticipate slower growth in the second half of this year to cover additional downside risk or disruption due to potential M&A activity amongst our clients. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.14 billion. During the third quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Due to the impact of wage increases and promotions, which are effective in Q3, we would not expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be above this range for the remainder of the year. For Q3, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, and acquisition related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares, and a tax rate of approximately 26%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.07 to at least $3. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.2%. Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter. Just want to touch first on the overall upside to guidance in the quarter. Obviously, it was pretty strong. The guidance raise came despite Health Net again. So just when we look at the overall guidance, can you walk through some of the drivers and strengths specifically what actually drove the beat for the quarter? And I understand, Karen, you mentioned second half a little bit slower trend, but are there actually any deals you see happening besides Health Net that would impact that? Gordon James Coburn - President: Hi, Darrin. This is Gordon. So for the quarter, the upside was very broad-based. It wasn't one customer, it wasn't one industry. The common theme, it was more on the discretionary and innovation and digital side, so if you think about our traditional outsourcing business versus our consulting technology business, it's clearly more on the innovation side. When we look at the rest of the year, obviously, we had the headwind of \u2013 we were expecting an additional $100 million of revenue from Health Net and that was baked into our pipeline plan. Even without that, we raised guidance $20 million beyond the Q2 beat. Nothing specific that concerns us for the second half of the year, however, obviously, there's a lot of M&A activity going on right now. So we certainly want to have an abundance of caution in case we get surprised by something as the year goes on. At this point, there's nothing that we know of that will surprise us, but it's one of these things you certainly want to be cautious of in this environment. Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Could you just quickly mention what the constant currency growth rate is embedded in your guidance? And I'll turn it back in the queue, guys. Thanks again. Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer : So with \u2013 the guidance assumes that rates are essentially where they were yesterday, so no fluctuation of rates and they've moved a little bit since July, obviously, the euro and the pound, but that's not very significant for Q2. The constant currency growth was overall about 6% and on a year-over-year basis was 25.5%. Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you and let me add my congratulations for the very strong quarter. Frank, I want to take you up on the digital transformation at scale comment. And the question is this, can the mainstreaming of digital services and sort of the demand profile that comes with it, is that enough of an offset to be sort of the lower growth and possibly even shrinkage of your traditional services? So how are you thinking about that? Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Ashwin, it's a good question. I would start by \u2013 at the very 50,000 foot level and say, look, there's clearly a trend around the world across businesses and governments to become more technology intensive, not less technology intensive. So if you think about that as sort of the big proxy for demand, then I would say that, to the extent that we are enablers of helping our clients be more technology intensive, the demand environment is strong at the 50,000 foot level. When I look at the more micro level perhaps, what I would say, Ashwin, is that there are a couple of different things which I think are driving demand in digital, which I think are instructive to answer your question. The first is that, as I said before, it's less now about helping a client with a point digital solution and much more about helping clients innovate at scale and sort of adopt continuous innovation. So that sort of creates for us an opportunity, and we're doing this with some clients around building an operating model around continuous innovation. So there's a revenue stream there, if you will, that we think we can leverage on a much more continuous basis. So that's point number one I'd make. The point number two, which is I think very important is that, whenever we've seen these big technology shifts, whether it's the digital shift we're seeing now, the Internet shift that we saw about a decade ago, the client service shifts that we saw a decade before that, there is always a big imperative that clients have around integrating the new technology capability, digital in this case, with the legacy, and that means a lot of work around legacy modernization, a lot of work around new architectures, a lot of work around wrapping the legacy with the components that are necessary to support digital business. And so net-net, I do think that there's plenty of demand here, and the opportunity for us to offset the efficiencies that we're seeing in the traditional business with discretionary and new digital projects is definitely there. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. That's very helpful. Can I ask with regards to Health Net, you lose an anchor client opportunity? Can you talk about the pipeline in terms of the ability to replace that, and when can we return to a more normalized sequential growth expectation? Gordon James Coburn - President: Ashwin, it's Gordon. When we look at the healthcare business, obviously, growth was a bit slow in the second quarter. There's a lot of change going on in that industry, whether it's M&A or regulatory change, consumerization, all that. When we look at our positioning in the market, we feel very good about that. We look at who our clients are, how our clients look to us for, not just execution but advice on how to both run their business better and for innovation. We feel very good about that. And equally importantly, the change in the Health Net acquisition does not in any way impact our strategy of \u2013 our belief that the industry, or portions of it, will move to end-to-end solutions, so the type of deal that we did with Health Net, we think those deals are still out there. We're actively talking to clients about that. So certainly the Health Net change \u2013 restructuring was a little bit of a setback for us, but in no way changes our strategy, and everything we're seeing in the market, everything that's happening with the TriZetto integration, makes us feel that we are absolutely making the right decisions on our strategy, and the payer side is a little soft right now, for external reasons. But that's a cycle, and that's the reason we have a portfolio of businesses. So as one is a little softer, another is a little stronger, but long-term, we think healthcare is a terrific place to be in. We think we're better positioned than anyone else in the industry. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Congratulations. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Dean Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi. So I was hoping we could get maybe a little bit more granular on healthcare. Is there any way to quantify the cross-sell opportunities at TriZetto, and maybe even the impact in that business from recent acquisitions? Anything on the outlook going forward? Gordon James Coburn - President: Sure. So the healthcare \u2013 the TriZetto integration is right on track. We're feeling very good about it. The motivation levels within the TriZetto business are great, we've retained all the senior management, we still feel very good and confident about the $1.5 billion of synergy revenue we expect from the deal. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, we're already \u2013 that's already measured in hundreds of millions of dollars. We're now actively talking to clients about, as I mentioned, the end-to-end solutions, leveraging the TriZetto platform. So I think things are right on track there. It's also reinforcing a product culture within Cognizant, so we're getting the strategic benefits of that. So we're moving ahead exactly as planned and the receptivity we're seeing from the industry, both for the traditional TriZetto business and the extra investment we've made, both in development as well as the capabilities Cognizant brings to the table in terms of hosting and BPO, clients are saying this is great, and we're winning deals. Joseph Dean Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. And then just along that line, we've seen some healthcare acquisitions outside of just the TriZetto side of things. What's your thought of the impact on that business, the healthcare business in total for you, and any thoughts on the growth of that business going forward? Can we expect it to be above the aggregate growth rates, or anything that you can give us as we look towards next year? Gordon James Coburn - President: Sure. So, clearly, the payer side of healthcare is going through a consolidation period. We've seen this in the past in other industries, banking is probably the best example. As that happened, we did very well in the banking consolidation. As we're looking at the healthcare consolidation, some of the deals that have been announced, those are our customers, and we expect those customers to look to us both to help with the integration work and also to help them think about how do they fundamentally transform their businesses. There's going to be a lot of pressure on the cost side, which we think will serve to our favor, but I think that pressure will manifest itself and look at how do you change processes, how do you change the way you do business and because of our consulting capability, we'll be very well-positioned for that. So what we don't know, obviously, is there's some short-term freezes in decision-making. At this point, we've not seen any of that, but as I mentioned earlier, clearly we baked that into our guidance, so we have that cushion in case some of that happens. But if history is any indicator based on what consolidation in other industries, I think long-term, we'll be well-positioned particularly since these are the buyers that have been announced so far are customers with whom we have deep relationships and also with the target companies we do work. So we know those systems, we know those processes. So we'll stay close to our customers. But at this point, we think we're quite well-positioned to help them through the transition. Joseph Dean Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Let me add my congratulations. I was just curious earlier I think Francisco made a comment about helping clients with their legacy integration during this major shift to digital. One of your major competitors seems to be very active in buying front end digital agency capabilities, and I'm sort of curious as you're (38:16) playing as well in the digital agency part of the digital world or are you more focused in the middle and back office? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Ed, it's Frank. As I said, we've developed the Cognizant Digital Works methodology, which is really focused on taking a client from the very front end of ideation around digital all the way through the middle and back office of prototyping and then taking the solutions to scale through the legacy integration. So we're very much playing start to finish, if you will. And we believe that this approach that we have of integrating strategy, design, technology, altogether under the umbrella of the Cognizant Digital Works methodology is unique and differentiated. So we will continue to look to beef up our capabilities across the spectrum, but particularly in the front end design and strategy pieces, because that process is working quite well for us. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : My other question is comparing Europe, Continental Europe to the U.S., its focused on sort of run (39:38) the business work versus sort of the new digital work. Is there a different sort of feel into how the interest, demand in Continental versus the U.S.? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think you have to separate it out a little bit. If you look at the continent, I'm going to exclude the U.K. for a minute here, but if we look at the continent, I think there's still a very healthy pipeline of what we think of as run better kind of work. And that's, frankly, because the businesses in Europe, as you know, continue to face slow economic growth \u2013 macroeconomic growth environments. And so there is continued pressure there. And of course, as we've said in the past, Ed, the businesses on the continent, if I could make a generalization, haven't outsourced the run the business kinds of things as much as the counterparts in, say, the U.K. or in the U.S. So there's upside there. Having said that, I would say that many of the countries in Europe are very digital, digitally aware, digitally savvy, and if you include the U.K., the penetrations of digital technologies like mobile and so and so forth in many of these countries and some of these countries are deeper than they are in the U.S. So there is a strong demand for digital in Europe as well. So we're really seeing in the continent this dual mandate of run better and run different playing out, and the demand there, I would say, is quite evenly based. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning and congratulations again on the quarter. I was wondering from a higher level of guidance perspective if you can give us a little bit of color on expected seasonality. It looks like historically the third quarter has been a much stronger quarter, but last year, you kind of accelerated in the fourth quarter off with (41:45) some pressure in the third quarter. It looks like this year you've got a little bit softer expectations for the second half. I guess question number one, is that more discretionary in nature and more caution on recent discretionary spending trend? And I guess the second question would be do you anticipate returning to more of a stronger 3Q seasonality eventually or is this a new trend in the back half? Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Brian. It's Frank. I'll just give you sort of comments at the high level, then I'll ask Karen to give specific comments on the guidance. In general, if you look at our demand patterns, Q2 tends to be the strongest quarter. If you go back historically, and the reason for that is that our clients are by and large on a calendar budget cycle and clients tend to have their budgets finalized some time during the first quarter. So the second quarter is the quarter where you get essentially the full quarter impact of discretionary spending based on budgets that have been approved by the client. So generally speaking, Q2 tends to be the strongest quarter. Q3 is a good \u2013 historically has been \u2013 is a good quarter but not quite as strong as the second quarter and then Q4 tapers off as the year winds down. So that's been our historical demand pattern. Last year was a little different because of the impact of the acquisition of TriZetto in the third quarter and fourth quarter, as you saw, some of that. So you have to strip that out from the numbers and I think if you strip out the TriZetto acquisition, you generally get the same kind of a demand pattern. Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. So I think I would just echo what Frank said, Brian, about historical seasonality being \u2013 Q2 being the strongest, Q3 tends to slow down a little bit, then Q4 being the slowest. Last year, we had two things. So in Q3, as you remember, is when we had to adjust our guidance and we had some one-time customer hits in Q3 of last year and so Q4 was a little bit of an anomaly. And then also we had the TriZetto acquisition which kicked in the \u2013 around November 20, so that was about $80 million of growth in Q4 of last year sequentially. So this year we would expect a much more traditional pattern with Q2 being the strongest, Q3 a little bit slower, and then Q4 will be a little bit different than our historical pattern. Historically, our core business slows down quite significantly in Q4, but we will have TriZetto. Obviously, Q4 is their strongest quarter typically given the nature of their business. So it will be a little bit more balanced this year than it would have been historically for us. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then on a discretionary side, any caution around spend or thoughts on customer budgets as we go into the back half of the year? Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer : I think really other than the conversation we had around M&A earlier and just being cautious around whether there's any slowdown as customers go through some of that transition in the next few months, there's nothing other than that that we see on the horizon right now. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. So just wanted to ask about the head count growth, I know it was flat. So for us, looking at the model, it won't have an impact on 2015 head count growth as utilization increases, but just trying to figure out if the slowdown in head count growth will impact future growth rates outside of 2015 as we get beyond 2015. Thanks. Gordon James Coburn - President: Hey, Bryan. It's Gordon. The answer is no, it doesn't. Let me explain why. First of all, with utilization, and let me just talk about blended utilization combined on-site and offshore, we're still two points below where we were at the beginning of 2014. From the beginning of 2014, we dropped about five points and that was a very conscious decision. And now as we had to shift our workforce and re-skill our workforce, we've now taken it back up but we still have some more room to take it up. So even when you think about the rest of this year, you'll still see some increasing utilization. We're doing our college hiring just as we normally would. So the college kids that come on board now through the end of the year, those people will be available for billing next year, and then obviously for lateral hiring, that's really just-in-time hiring, so we turn that on and off as we need. The key is having that pipeline of the college kids, because it's a long training period. So we'll be in good shape to support next year's growth. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just quickly, I might have missed this, but just what's the pipeline look like for tuck-in acquisitions or anything out there that could be more sizable? Thanks so much. Congrats. Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me talk about it. We continue to actively look at acquisitions, and I think we've got a series of \u2013 as we always do, the pipeline of small tuck-in acquisitions continues to be strong. The screen is very much the same as it historically has been. I would say that when we look at technologies, new technologies, new solutions, the pipeline might be a little bit more weighted towards digital and looking at digital capabilities in different parts of the world, in particular, to give us footprint in those areas. We're also looking for acquisitions just in general to get us into certain parts of the world where we don't have as strong a footprint as we would like. I would probably single out or point to Asia as being one area where you'll see us potentially do some acquisitions to strengthen our position in key markets in Asia. We've already done, as you know, the acquisition of Odecee in Australia, which was both a digital acquisition and also helps us strengthen our presence in Australia. So that's the \u2013 I would say that's sort of the color that I can provide on the pipeline and of course we continue to be active and keeping our eyes open as assets become available. And as with TriZetto, we don't expect to do another large-scale acquisition until we feel that the TriZetto integration is well on track, which as Gordon said, we feel good about at the moment. But we're always looking in the market and seeing what's available out there. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you talk more broadly about how your talent and labor strategy is evolving, both as you scale the business and then also as you're meeting the shift in demand and need a more diverse set of skills? Gordon James Coburn - President: Sure, Lisa. It's Gordon. I think you hit the key thing, as we need a more diverse set of skills. We do a wide range of businesses across multiple geographies. So first, from a sourcing standpoint, we now have college recruiting across the world, and here in the U.S., we recruit at close to 20 universities, plus another 10 or 15 business schools. We've dramatically expanded our European college programs and are moving it into Asia as well. From a lateral hiring standpoint, just as our scale and brand has changed dramatically over the last five years, people view us as an incredibly dynamic and attractive place to work. So when I look at all of our statistics in terms of quality of hire, yield rates on lateral hires, that all looks good. Now, what we need to do, though, is in how we manage the people, since it's no longer one-size-fits-all. So we're very much, and we're well into it, making sure that people understand what the different roles are, what it takes to move up in the organization, so people can manage their careers. And we have a very transparent policy and program, so people from \u2013 everything from performance management to promotions, we call this Cognizant Career Architecture. So I think we're actually in quite good shape on this. This is not a place where we put our head in the sand, but we're being proactive, thinking about what's our workforce going to evolve to over time, how do we constantly re-skill people, how do we motivate millennials? Attrition was obviously up a little bit in this quarter, but when I look at the things we're doing, we're convinced we're doing the right stuff and it just takes a little time to kick in. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you. And then also, as the business shifts a bit, how is the competitive environment shifting, like who are you seeing more frequently, and who are you seeing less? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think \u2013 Lisa, it really depends \u2013 it's Frank. I think it really depends on what service line and what geographies you're talking about. As you know, our industry tends to be quite highly fragmented. And, particularly in the digital world, there are smaller boutiques that we sometimes compete with on the front end. But I'll make general broad statements. I think, given our end-to-end value proposition, the run better/run different value proposition, we think that's really driving our growth. We tend to compete most frequently with the large global end-to-end providers that have both digital capabilities and the outsourcing capabilities. We tend to compete now much less with the traditional offshore or India-based pure play, I think of as run better firms. Although certainly they're still an important factor in the marketplace and so on. But we're increasingly competing more with the global multinationals who are \u2013 who have both the run better and the run different value proposition. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Given the Health Net/Centene deal, could you help us think about the potential timeline for building the BPO as a service healthcare platform with TriZetto and some Health Net capabilities, and maybe when you might be able to bring on a new client? Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's Frank. Let me try and address that, and Gordon jump in as well. We have a good pipeline of those types of deals at the moment. Now, let me also caveat that by saying that our pipeline of deals tend to be \u2013 are smaller than the Health Net deals. The Health Net was a very, very large deal, but we have a good set of clients that we're talking to around the similar model as Health Net. And the pipeline, I think, of those deals is good. I would remind you that, in our mind, really any client that is running the TriZetto platform is a potential candidate for this kind of model. So we think that, when you look at the value proposition from a client standpoint, and you say, what's the value proposition? We think that our ability to run the software, host the software, run the business process, given our deep domain expertise in healthcare, plus the knowledge of the TriZetto platform, really is very, very compelling to clients. So I don't want to really venture a guess as to when we will be able to talk to you about another similar kind of deal, but my hope would be that, let's say, in the next four quarters, we'd be able to come and talk to you about a similar kind of deal structure, with a client similar to Health Net. But I want to be clear. I don't think we have anything of the size and scale of Health Net right now that we're discussing. Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. And then, just on the wage increases for the third quarter, does the jump in attrition change anything about your plans for wage increases? And could you talk about magnitude of them? Thanks. Gordon James Coburn - President: Sure Sara, (54:25) yeah, as we've said, for the last six months, and as we've practiced in prior years, we pegged our wage increases right in line with the industry and this year, that translates into high single digits offshore, low single digits on-site. The attrition doesn't necessarily change the magnitude of the wage increases, because people stay for \u2013 obviously, compensation is important, but it's also career development, it's the opportunities to move up on the organization to be empowered to take opportunities, the excitement and how dynamic is the organization. So it's a combination of compensation, but also a broad range of employee engagement programs and very importantly, the career architecture work that I mentioned earlier. So people understand our growth rate provides unparalleled opportunities for their long-term career growth. Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question of the day is coming from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Great results all around. Just wanted to ask also on margins. Just \u2013 I know there's a lot of chatter in the press around Cognizant managing costs clearly wasn't demand driven. So I'm curious are you taking a different approach to cost and margins? Gordon James Coburn - President: So the big thing obviously we did is we took utilization up. We slowed down hiring. I view that as that's good operational discipline. And what we want to make sure is that we have the dollars available to make the long-term investments rather than not having operational excellence. So clearly, we slowed down hiring. That's good for employees, because our bench is getting a little big. I think some employees were saying, hey, where's the learning if I'm sitting on the bench? So we've taken our bench down substantially, which I think is very good for employees. The other things such as travel, well, we need to walk the talk. We talk to our clients about being digital, being virtual. Our use of whether it's videoconferencing or other collaboration tools create great opportunities for people not to be on airplanes all the time. It's interesting. As we slowed down travel, our video usage went up 40%. That's great. We're interacting with clients on that. So part of that, it's not \u2013 yes, it's great to save the money so we can invest in the future, but it's also important that we're walking the talk on what the future work looks like. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. And then I'm just curious, just on the outlook on outsourcing versus the consulting tech piece, is this the new normal for now? I'm just curious if outsourcing can potentially accelerate given what you see in the backlog and pipeline. Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's \u2013 Tien-tsin, honestly, it's hard to make a forward projection on this one. I think outsourcing will continue to be healthy. If you look at the sort of dynamics of outsourcing, you have a few things going on. You have parts of the world, like I said earlier, like Continental Europe that are still first-time outsourcer, so that's one, I would say, on the positive side. The second positive driver is that you've got parts of outsourcing like Business Process Services and Infrastructure Services where penetration rates are still relatively low. So that's another positive driver of demand. So those are the positives. Then you look at what's offsetting that and you say, clearly clients are shifting budgets from lights on maintenance over to digital. And so that pulls demand down on the outsourcing side. But as long as you're well-positioned to pick it up on the digital side, which we feel like we're very strongly positioned, you pick up those dollars and potentially you pick up more because it's not always a dollar for dollar swap that happens there. So net-net, how does that all net out in terms of the trend line over the next few quarters? It's very hard to make a prediction but I think the message you should take away is that the outsourcing service line is still fundamentally solid. There's still a very strong value proposition there. There are segments of that space that are still underpenetrated, and that will continue to drive demand and then we'll just see how it \u2013 where it nets out in terms of the trend line over the coming quarters. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Congrats on the results. Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thanks very much. Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And with that, I want to thank everybody for joining us today and thank you for your questions and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Cognizant Technology Solutions second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Francisco, please go ahead. Francisco D'Souza: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter, continuing the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. Q3 revenue of $3.19 billion was up 3.3% over Q2, which exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $45 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.4% was within our target range of 19% to 20%. Much like the first half of this year we saw strong demand across our business this quarter. And as a result we're pleased to raise our full-year guidance for the third time this year. For revenue to at least $12.41 billion and for non-GAAP EPS to at least $3.03. Our continued momentum reflects a healthy demand environment for Cognizant services that drive innovation, growth, and efficiencies in the digital era. The strong relevance of our services portfolio to clients is reflected in our results this quarter, our guidance for the full year, and the above company average growth in our consulting and technology services. For a while now we've used these calls to talk about how we are at the cusp of a once-in-a-decade shift in technology that will drive a sustained period of technological transformation for our clients. Our clients recognize that becoming a digital enterprise is now a necessity, a matter of survival, as businesses, products, people, and devices become more connected. Therefore they are looking for innovative ways to combine their traditional business models and product sets with new and continuously evolving digital technologies. This is leading to a significant change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated. Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from keep the lights on maintenance and operation projects to new digital initiatives that create competitive advantage by enabling new levels of business performance. We've talked about IT being strategic for years. And that is perhaps more true today than it has ever been, as management teams are looking to technology solutions to propel their businesses forward. Clients traditionally thought of IT as a means to drive productivity and efficiency, or what we referred to as run better. Today the role of IT has evolved beyond that to reimagine organizations and business models for future growth, or what we call run different. This dynamic, where our clients have to simultaneously run better and run different, is what we refer to as the dual mandate. Against this backdrop of changing client needs, the approach that services companies like ours need to take is also evolving. Effectively addressing the dual mandate for clients requires partners that can combine strategy, technology, and business consulting in one integrated model. However, equally importantly serving the dual mandate requires a partner that has a deep understanding of clients' legacy environment and business processes, so that these can be leveraged and integrated into new digital backbones. Our strength in the market comes from the fact that we've built this breadth of capabilities at Cognizant. And we've integrated these together in our digital work methodology for maximum client impact. Let me give you an example of a large financial services client of ours. I'll refer back to this client example periodically here in my remarks to illustrate the key investments we're making and the results we're seeing in the market. We've been working with this client for over a decade now, supporting many of their mission-critical platforms, infrastructure, and business operations. Recently we restructured our engagement with them, where we will be taking them to a best-in-class operating model for their existing business with us. As a result of this transition to best-in-class efficiency, we were able to commit to considerable savings for them on our traditional application management business. This is the run better part of the dual mandate. They in turn committed not only those savings back to us in the form of a long-term contract, but also increased their discretionary spending with us considerably. This is the run different part of the dual mandate. The result is that we have a 10-year contract with them for an annual contract value that's almost 50% higher than their current annual spend with us. This extended partnership also presents opportunities for Cognizant and the client to develop and sell joint go-to-market solutions, leveraging our deep expertise and market presence. Last quarter we outlined our investments in four areas to fully address the needs of our clients to help drive both efficiency and transformation. Let me update you on the progress we've made since then. First, we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As I mentioned last quarter Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale. We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works Accelerator Methodology, which comprises three elements, the Idealab, where we work with clients to identify big themes and prioritize opportunity areas; the Collaboratory, a physical space where we design prototype and iterate specific solutions, so clients can visualize the impact on their end users and businesses; and the Foundry, where we take these pilot programs and switch them to enterprise scale by utilizing new technology options and integrating them with existing legacy systems. Our clients appreciate this interdisciplinary approach. And across the industries we serve we are finding great traction for our Digital Works framework. We recently engaged the financial services client I mentioned a few minutes ago in a custom workshop at the Collaboratory for their business and technology leaders. We jointly identified a set of potential opportunities and long-term strategic initiatives that digital is presenting to this customer's business. Second, consulting is a critical component of our services portfolio. Increasingly consulting has become an integral part of our comprehensive approach to helping clients drive digital transformation, as over 60% of our consulting pipeline is focused in this area. Our matrix structure deeply integrates our consulting team with our technology and business process services delivery organization. This synergy between our consulting and delivery organizations helps the teams work closely together, driving business model change, the re-engineering of business processes, and organizational change management for our clients' businesses. We continue to invest in both people and capabilities to deepen our industry strength and have over 5,500 consultants globally as of today. For the financial service client that I talked about, our consulting practice played a critical role in driving thought leadership into the 10-year deal. Our consultants worked with the client to identify existing assets that could be extended to address significant business opportunities in an adjacent industry where they currently don't have a presence. This will potentially drive substantial revenue upside for the client. Third, we are optimizing traditional services to enable our clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. Today digital technologies are driving changes in the traditional outsourcing business. The focus in core traditional IT services business, what we call our Horizon 1 services, has shifted from people and processes to people, process, and automation. These services are important, because clients rely upon them each day to run their businesses. These services are also integral to our ability to drive digital transformation and legacy integration for clients. This means we have to solve today's problems differently by applying innovation and creativity to reorganize and run core processes at an enterprise-wide scale. Sometimes it also means moving clients to radically different operating models to improve their cost and at the same time ensure a high-quality accelerated delivery. For the financial services client that I've been talking about, we will convert our existing arrangement to an end-to-end managed services engagement to streamline their various customer-facing platforms and processes. At the same time we will transform and digitally enable their core platforms, processes, and infrastructure to support digital business while managing their existing IT platform for optimal efficiency. And fourth, we are building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency, and at the same time deploy digital technologies more quickly. Last year we took a very definitive step toward strengthening our platform-based solutions portfolio by acquiring TriZetto. We're pleased with the pace of integration of TriZetto and Cognizant capabilities. The combined stack of software products and services from TriZetto and Cognizant has helped open new market segments, allowing Cognizant to bring an integrated solution to the healthcare market. We've also seen good traction with our internally developed platform solutions. One such example is a cloud-based big data analytics platform called BigDecisions that brings together our clients' traditional enterprise data and digital data, such as voice, device, sensor, social, and mobile, under a single umbrella. BigDecisions includes business applications across multiple industries, which help our clients use analytics when making key business decisions. In the case of the financial services client referenced so far, we anticipate leveraging BigDecisions to enable this client to monetize their data assets by delivering actionable insights to their clients. In closing I'd like to say that Cognizant's culture of innovation and adaptability, coupled with our commitment to continuous investment in the business, has positioned us to be the partner of choice for our clients as they navigate this tremendous period of change. With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later as always to take your questions. Gordon? Gordon James Coburn : Thank you, Francisco. We had another solid quarter and saw strong demand across the business, with particular strength in consulting and technology services, as clients continue to focus on implementing digital technologies to drive business transformation. Let me now provide additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses, and geographies. Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 2.7% sequentially and 18.6% year over year, driven primarily by strength in banking. Growth continues to be broad-based across our banking clients, who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance, and cyber security. We're seeing increased interest in managed services deals with both banking and insurance clients, as they continue to look for ways to increase efficiencies in their operations. In addition there is an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service, often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions. For example, during Q3 Cognizant was chosen to help one of Asia's largest private banks manage the future roadmap for a consolidated digital platform to sell personal loans, credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages, all of which are currently being managed on separate platforms. The consolidated platform is expected to significantly increase conversion, reduce platform costs and empower the bank with better customer insights. Another good example is the work we're doing for the National Stock Exchange in India, one of the world's largest exchanges by transaction volumes, to transform its futures and options derivatives trading platform. Given the complex nature of exchange environments, new regulations and business requirements must be quickly absorbed and integrated to eliminate failures in transaction processing. The platform that Cognizant developed and deployed for tasks such as order matching and message transfers allowed the exchange to successfully process an unprecedented 1 billion orders in a single day. Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, grew 4.7% sequentially, and including the impact of TriZetto grew 43.3% year over year. As the healthcare industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, healthcare organizations are looking for new ways to deliver customer centric care, while simultaneously looking for ways to drive operational efficiency. We recently announced that the New England Healthcare Exchange Network, NEHEN, a consortium of regional players and providers in the Northeast, selected Cognizant and TriZetto to digitally transform and manage its technology infrastructure. NEHEN consists of over 55 hospitals, eight health insurance plans, and tens of thousands of practitioners. Cognizant and TriZetto are enabling NEHEN to deploy an infrastructure that allows members to share costs and improvement administrative and clinical processes. This win highlights the synergy opportunities brought by the combination of Cognizant and TriZetto. Together we've won a number of similar deals across payers and providers combining TriZetto's products and platforms with Cognizant's capabilities in IT, BPO, and hosting. As we approach the 1-year anniversary of the TriZetto acquisition, we could not be more pleased with how the integration is progressing. TriZetto employee retention remains high. And we have a strong pipeline of opportunities leveraging the synergies between Cognizant and TriZetto. Moving on to our Life Sciences business. We had a strong quarter as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally we saw continued strong demand among our medical device clients. We see an increasing interest in deals which combine cloud technologies and platforms, including our proprietary MedVantage, a cloud-based integrated complaint management solution we built on the Force.com platform. We've had a number of our medical device clients implement MedVantage this year to improve efficiency, reporting, and overall service level for their customers. At the recent Dreamforce event Salesforce named Cognizant the recipient of the 2015 Salesforce Partner Innovation Award for Healthcare & Life Sciences for our work with Johnson & Johnson. Cognizant helped J&J Medical launch their customer digital engagement model. This digital platform focuses on driving value to J&J sales team through omni-channel and business function integration, empowering them with the information they need to better understand their customers' and patients' needs. Our retail manufacturing segment was up 4.8% sequentially and 13.7% year over year. Clients are focused on modernizing their technology environment, particularly around supply chain and omni-channel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing side in particular we're seeing strong demand around product transformation. For example we're helping a global packaging equipment manufacturer to transform the packaging equipment they're manufacturing to smart and connected products, leveraging sensors and the Internet of Things and connecting them with a big data analytics platform. This engagement involves organizational change management, business model innovation, and machine-to-machine connectivity. And will help our client reduce operating costs and deliver new value to their customers. Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications, and information media and entertainment clients was down 0.5% sequentially and up 15.2% year-over-year. We saw a pause in spend with clients in the communications sector on the back of a wave of M&A deals in that space. Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the above company average growth we're seeing across these three businesses, Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services, and Cognizant Business Process Services. As Frank mentioned earlier Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical, competitive differentiator for us. As clients undergo enterprise-wide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management, and process redesign. Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations, and accelerated delivery. Increasingly there's a strong focus on automation and IT operations driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. Cognizant Business Process Services saw continued success during the quarter led by work with our high-tech insurance and banking clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies, while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. Let me now shift to geographies. From a geographic standpoint North America grew 3.6% sequentially and 26.7% year over year. Europe was up 1.4% sequentially and 7.8% from last year after a 10.4% negative currency impact. The U.K. grew approximately 1% sequentially and 8.3% year over year and Continental Europe grew 2.2% sequentially and 7.2% over prior year. Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the Rest of the World, which was up 5.3% sequentially and 31% year over year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in our key markets in Asia, such as Singapore and Australia. I'll now provide some color on our business operations. Similar to last quarter, quarterly annualized attrition remained at 20%, which is above our desired range. We're committed to improving our retention levels through various employee engagement initiatives. Faster company growth, well-defined career paths, unique learning and reskilling opportunities, and our practice of sharing the rewards of our strong company performance with our employees continues to make Cognizant a very highly-attractive employer. Delivering strong revenue performance this year, combined with our continued success in driving higher operational efficiency, was only possible through the efforts of our incredible staff around the globe. And we believe that they should share in these accomplishments. Our performance during the quarter enabled us to increase our year-to-date bonus accrual to levels well above last year. In fact our brand, which is a reflection of our attractiveness as an employer, has never been stronger. This was validated by the success we've seen in our global campus recruiting program this year. We've extended our campus footprint, recruiting now from over 30 leading universities and business schools in the United States, as well as another 30 top schools across Europe. This campus hiring program has helped us expand our in-country and near source centers. In India this year we saw tremendous success in our campus hiring across premium engineering campuses. On campuses where students receive multiple offers from Cognizant and other tier 1 companies, on average 75% of those students chose Cognizant over others. Throughout this call we've highlighted how we're winning in digital, driving leadership in industries and markets we serve, and how we are seeing good traction for our platforms and as a service models. We're proud of our performance and are pleased that this is being recognized by leading industry analysts, sourcing advisors, and other influencers. In the past few weeks Cognizant has been recognized by these industry analysts as a leader in Internet of Things, business intelligence consulting, robotic process automation, and Insurance as a Service. With that let me turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. As Frank mentioned we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $3.19 billion exceeded our prior guidance by over $45 million and represented growth of 3.3% sequentially and 23.5% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis we had an approximately $72.4 million negative currency headwind, which impacted revenue growth by 280 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 19.4%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. As expected the non-GAAP operating margin declined from Q2, as we absorbed the impact of compensation increases beginning July 1. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 exceeded guidance by $0.01. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58% and 42% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 4.6% sequentially and 34.2% year over year. Outsourcing services were up 1.5% sequentially and grew 11.1% from Q3 a year ago. During Q3 we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters, whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards project-based work, including digital and other transformational programs. During the third quarter 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. And as expected overall pricing was stable. We added seven strategic clients' customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 292. During the quarter we had approximately 1,300 net employee additions, and we ended the quarter with approximately 219,300 employees globally. Approximately 205,000 of our employees were service-delivery staff. As expected utilization was up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points sequentially to approximately 76%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 81%, and on-site utilization was approximately 94% during the quarter, up 100 basis points from Q2. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $484 million from the quarter ending June 30 and down by approximately $568 million from the year-ago period. Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter. And we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 70.6 days. This is down from 71.9 days in Q2. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $421 million, up from $387 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 55% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables and ramp-up of certain fixed bid contracts. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $950 million at the end of the quarter. And during the quarter we repaid the $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver. Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $818 million. Financing activities during the quarter were approximately a $249 million use of cash. And capital expenditures were approximately $65 million during the quarter. During the third quarter we repurchased 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $156 million. And our fully diluted share count decreased approximately 1 million shares to 612.7 million shares for the quarter. To date we have repurchased approximately 40.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.5 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have $480 million remaining unutilized. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. As Frank mentioned we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the healthy demand environment and the over performance during quarter three. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.41 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 21% over 2014. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter of 2015 we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.23 billion, representing sequential revenue growth of at least 1.3%. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice, and fewer billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth. During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For Q4 we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.77. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, and acquisition related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares. We are raising our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 to at least $3.03. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.5%. Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. One moment please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward S. Caso: Hi. Good morning. Can you just clarify for us what the organic growth was in the quarter when you back out TriZetto and the ODC acquisition, and also both the impact on the quarter year over year and the benefit to the full year for 2015? Thank you. Karen McLoughlin : So, Ed, on a quarter-over-quarter basis TriZetto is about 7 points of growth \u2013 or year over year rather, sorry, year-over-year basis for the quarter. And what was your second question regarding full year? Edward S. Caso: Then the same question but for the full year. Karen McLoughlin : So for the full year if you remember, we had said that TriZetto was about $720 million of revenue last year, growing low single digits. Edward S. Caso: Okay. Thank you. Gordon James Coburn : Hey, Ed, just as a reminder, there was a small portion of TriZetto revenue last year as well, so be sure to adjust for that. Karen McLoughlin : Yeah. And Q4 of last year had about $80 million of TriZetto revenue. Gordon James Coburn : Next question, operator. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- tsin Huang : Great. Thank you. Good quarter here, no big surprises. I guess just the fourth quarter, I know fourth quarter is a little tricky. Karen, you mentioned a few things like the client furloughs and the billing days. Maybe can you quantify some of those factors on what makes 4Q unique? And any considerations around budget flush, et cetera? Karen McLoughlin : Yeah. So the big thing is really the billing days, Tien-tsin, so it's about \u2013 almost 3.5% fewer billing days in Q4 versus Q3, which roughly translates to about a $75 million sequential negative revenue impact. That's the biggest component. And then obviously as you mentioned some furloughs on top of that. And then the typical seasonal pullback in retail. But those are less impactful than the bill day impact. Tien- tsin Huang : Right. So it was really just the billing days. And just maybe as a quick follow up, just thinking about visibility in general. I know we're all going to be thinking about 2016 here pretty soon. Just given the bigger mix of consulting versus outsourcing, do you feel like the visibility has changed or improved or gotten tougher? Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Tien-tsin. This is Frank. I would say it's about the same. We're going through clients' budget cycles at the moment. We feel like those conversations are right about where they would typically and traditionally be at this time of the year. So we don't either quantitatively or qualitatively feel like there's any difference in that process this year. Tien- tsin Huang : Great. Thanks as always. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations on the solid results. So we've had this view for some time that the two-speed economy, which translates to your mandate has an inherent assumption that a large portion of the growth initiatives are partially paid for by savings on the cost optimization side. So while companies indicate a good growth on the digital side, you have got to temper that optimism with what needs to be done to deliver productivity gains. The question really is, what sort of pressure are you seeing on revenue growth on the traditional side? Can your Horizon 2 and 3 traction, which is great, continue to safely offset Horizon 1 pressure, if there's any? And how does it change your notion of revenue visibility and impact on margins? Gordon James Coburn : Hey, Ashwin. It's Gordon. I think you're right that clients are trying to fund spending on innovation and on digital by optimizing the cost on run the business, which a lot of that is the traditional outsourcing. And you've seen that in our numbers now for many quarters, where our technology and consulting business is growing faster than the outsourcing business. But let's be clear. We continue to do very well and take market share on the maintenance side. What customers are looking for is they're interested in how can we become more efficient, lower their cost of ownership on maintenance, so they can free up those dollars to move elsewhere. And we \u2013 Cognizant just has this incredible track record of delivering very high quality services, while continuously delivering productivity and efficiency. So I think we're probably better positioned than most others in the market in terms of lowering cost of ownership on maintenance, while delivering high quality services. And then capturing \u2013 because we can assert both sides of the dual mandate, and capturing that freed up spend over on the technology and innovation side. Ashwin Shirvaikar : And so when you lower the cost are you using new tools like RPA? And what impact does that have? Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Ashwin, it's Frank. I would say that there's a lot of conversation right now about these \u2013 what I would bucket together in sort of the category of advanced automation kinds of tools. But I would say that the bulk of the productivity that we drive in the core business is through traditional means of driving productivity and efficiency that includes process kinds of things like Lean and Six Sigma and so on, and also more traditional tools in automation. I think that the promise of artificial intelligence and machine learning and robotic process automation is certainly substantial, but it's early days in that area. And I think we are making very solid investments. I think you heard Gordon say in his prepared remarks that we've been recognized by industry analysts in areas like robotic process automation as being leaders. So we continue to drive that aggressively. But I think this is a longer-term journey to really see the impact of that \u2013 of those technologies on a broad basis across our business. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. Thank you for the comments. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could touch on a little bit in terms of capital allocation? And how you think about growing the businesses, particularly in areas of focus, such as Healthcare and Digital? And with that in mind, perhaps with competitors in mind, as we've seen quite a bit of capital markets activity ramping this year. So from the perspective of investing organically versus perhaps pursuing acquisitions, how you think about growing the business? And what you expect heading into next year? Gordon James Coburn : Hey, Brian. It's Gordon. We're going to continue with the strategy that we've been executing successfully on, which is making long-term organic investments is the key \u2013 the core of our business. We said we're a 19% to 20% margin business. We reinvest everything above that. And as a result of that we should deliver revenue growth well above industry average. And we've delivered that year-in and year out. And so that's working. We will always supplement our organic growth with acquisitions, either to strengthen a geographic presence, industry strength, or technology and service line. These largely are tuck-under acquisitions. Obviously the TriZetto acquisition was a outlier. But we continue to look at tuck-under acquisitions to supplement that. From a capital allocation standpoint as you've seen both this third quarter and second quarter, each quarter we repurchased about $150 million worth of stock to target share neutrality. We'll continue to target share neutrality. One of our challenges is the majority of our cash is overseas, so we have a little \u2013 we have some limitations here. But we're going to \u2013 the capital allocation strategy we're doing is resulting in industry-leading results, so we're going to stick with it. Brian L. Essex: Okay. And on the pipeline it seems as though at least you've been quiet year-to date on M&A front. Is that pipeline accelerating? Or might we see more activity as we head into next year and you digest the TriZetto acquisition? Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Brian. It's Frank. It's \u2013 as you know it's very hard to predict timing and volume of M&A activity. I would say the pipeline is as robust as it has ever been, maybe even a little stronger. We're looking at different kinds of deals. There's a lot of digital stuff we're looking at. We're looking at some geographic stuff in other parts of the world to give us presence in markets \u2013 geographic markets where we feel like we need a stronger presence. But I'd hate to predict, because it's just inherently difficult to predict timing of M&A. But we haven't slowed down. We continue to look at as many if not more transactions. And I would say that if you look over a long period of time, I wouldn't expect to see any material slowdown. Maybe a little bit of an acceleration in the pace of us doing things, as we become bigger and we're able to move faster on multiple fronts as we \u2013 particularly in the area of tuck-ins. Brian L. Essex: Okay. Helpful color. Thank you for the insight. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Edward Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gordon, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the bookings environment over the past couple months? And specifically address the financials vertical? I think you talked about banking being relatively strong for you. But is that you think still the case in the next couple quarters? And especially relative to what some of your peers have called out in terms of incremental weakness in financials? I was wondering if you could also maybe address any of kind of the incremental sub-verticals, where you've got more strength or more weakness relative to what you've seen the past couple quarters? Gordon James Coburn : Yeah. So the bookings across the business are solid. We're seeing solid interest in banking. And a lot of that is because we can serve the dual mandate, because we have deep expertise in banking, we feel good about that. There will always be an anomaly here and there. But when I look at the overall portfolio of our Financial Services segment, we certainly feel good. I don't know if I would point to that has greater strength than other business units, because I think \u2013 and you saw it this quarter, other than a little bit of weakness in the communication sector, solid growth. So it's very well-balanced right now. And I think we are pleased with the bookings. And particularly on the technology and innovation side, because there's really only a handful of companies that can serve that dual mandate. So there's a lot of people fighting for the maintenance side of the business. But on the development side there's only a few of us who can really deliver. And I think we're very well-positioned there, and our investments have paid off. James Edward Schneider : That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, could you maybe address your hiring plans short term over the next quarter or two? And what you plan to do specifically to kind of address the attrition rate and kind of get the head count back up to the extent you think it needs to over the next couple quarters? Gordon James Coburn : Yeah. So the slow growth in net head count is not driven by attrition. That's driven by a very conscious decision we had this year to significantly improve our operational excellence and take our utilization up, which we successfully did while maintaining customer satisfaction. So and we're largely done with that process. I think we're pretty \u2013 I mean give or take pretty much at the utilization levels that we want as we go into 2016. So we don't guide to quarter-to-quarter head count growth. Still, I think we still have a little bit of room offshore on utilization, which you might see in the Q \u2013 in Q4. But then it starts to level out over that. On attrition. Attrition being up is not just us as you know. It's the industry. But it's one where when I look at the opportunity for us, clearly we should have lower attrition, given we have unparalleled career opportunities for our employees, given the success we have on the digital side, the overall growth rate. So we're redoubling our efforts there to make sure that employees have the career growth. That we share the rewards as I have said. And I'm sending a note out to our entire company right after this call, saying that because of what they've delivered on revenue growth, what they've delivered on operational performance, we're going to share those rewards and pay out bonuses well above last year. So we'll keep working on it. I'd be concerned if we were an outlier, but we're not an outlier on the attrition. James Edward Schneider : Thank you. Operator : As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time we ask that all callers limit themselves to one question. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Sara Rebecca Gubins : Hi. Thank you. Some questions on the pricing environment. There has been some discussion of cases of competitors being aggressive. Could you talk about what you're seeing in the market? And then maybe a bigger picture pricing question, which is you're seeing an evolution of your pricing models towards more fixed-price contracts and perhaps do more transaction-based pricing over time. How do you see pricing models and maybe pricing mix evolving? Gordon James Coburn : Sure. Let me comment first on the pricing environment. And it's we've spent a lot of time looking at what's going on. We're clearly seeing a bifurcation in the market. And that's at leading competitors who can compete on both sides of the dual mandate and those who can't compete on both sides of the dual mandate. And therefore focus more on price. What we've seen, and I'm sure some of you have heard about it, there have been some isolated instances of irrational pricing in the market. But let me be clear, overall pricing remains stable. This spots of irrational pricing is consistent what we've seen historically in the market, as there have been big technology shifts. And some players are having trouble with that shift, and therefore act irrationally in their core market. We also want to be very clear. We believe this is a short-term phenomenon. The fundamentals of the industry, input costs, facilities, travel, have not shift \u2013 haven't shifted enough to warrant this change. And we're also seeing some of the competitors make considerable assumptions about productivity gains driven by new automation technologies, which we don't think are yet enterprise reality. Frank has touch base on that earlier. We think some people out there are making assumptions that we scratch our head a little bit about will they be able to achieve that? Or is it wishful thinking? Often when you see these sorts of unrealistic assumptions about productivity built into bids, what you see is players shore up their profitability by cutting corners. And historically this has resulted in unhappy clients. And we're already beginning to see that in the market. Some of \u2013 in some instances where there has been irrational pricing, that client is actually pretty unhappy now, as they're getting service from one or more of our competitors. And that competitor is cutting corners. And it also impacts the employee morale, because of how you have to squeeze the employee. So when we step back and look at it, when we look at our overall book of business, things are very stable and we feel fine about pricing. We're watching these pockets of irrationality. But we're not particularly worried about it, because what we're seeing is very quickly the customer understands you get what you pay for. And we're seeing dissatisfaction where customers have gone with someone who has bid irrationally. So we got to watch it, but at this point we don't think it's a long-term trend. We don't think it's impacting our book of business. And ultimately I think it may be good for our reputation, as clients have the dissatisfaction with some of the other competitors. Operator : Your next... Francisco D'Souza: Let me just follow up with the second part of your question. Just building on what Gordon said a minute ago, it is absolutely true that on the run better side of our business, clients are still looking for greater levels of efficiency and effectiveness. And so we're focusing clients on looking at total cost of ownership and looking at the output and the outcomes that we deliver. And driving output and outcomes to best-in-class, world-class levels. And so as a result of that you will see a continued shift in our business towards more output- and outcome-based models. And the fixed-price metric that we report to you I suspect will creep up over time as a result of that trend. We think that that's the far better, more thoughtful approach to working with clients is to focus them on the total cost of the outcome that we're providing, as opposed to the comment Gordon has made earlier about somewhat irrational pricing on the input side, which is really a zero-sum game. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane: Hi, guys. Just want to get an update on the Healthcare sector. We've seen some volatility there. Your results seem fine this quarter. But what's the outlook in Healthcare going forward? Francisco D'Souza: I think at a macro level \u2013 I'll let Karen comment. Bryan, it's Frank. I think at the macro level I think if you break it into the two large component pieces, we feel pretty good about Life Sciences going into next year. Drug pipelines are healthy again across the industry. We're seeing good traction. So we feel pretty good about the Life Sciences side of the business. When I think about the Healthcare business, as you saw we had a reasonable quarter in that \u2013 actually a strong quarter in that business. And I think the fundamentals continue to be strong. The one cautionary note I would have there is as you know there have been a number of mega mergers that have been announced but yet to be approved by the government in that sector. And so as we go into next year, as we've seen in other M&A environments, you could see a pause in spending, depending on the \u2013 I can't exactly predict when that'll be, because it'll depend on when the government approves it and so on and so forth. But that's the one thing that I'm keeping an eye on. But fundamentals are strong. The need for change in that industry continues to be very, very strong. Lots of opportunity for technology to bring competitive advantage to the industry to drive greater degrees of efficiency. So over the long run I continue to be very optimistic about Healthcare, both sides of Healthcare. And particularly so, because we've got a very strong set of assets with the TriZetto acquisition combined with the traditional Cognizant strength. So we're well positioned in the industry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa D. Ellis: Hi. Good morning, guys. I would like you to talk, if you don't mind, a little bit about the growth challenge as you go into next year, and how you are thinking about that and addressing that both \u2013 and I'm just observing that to maintain your organic growth rate, you're starting to push adding $2 billion in revenue a year. So how are you thinking about that, both on the labor side as well as on the customer acquisition side or expansion into new vertical side? How are you thinking about that? Thanks. Gordon James Coburn : Hey, Lisa. First of all, be careful with the $2 billion number. That includes TriZetto obviously. So it's \u2013 if you look at organic, yeah, it's \u2013 Karen gave some of the numbers earlier. It'd be less. So from a supply side I think we're in good shape. We've taking utilization up. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments our brand for recruiting across the globe, both in college and lateral, is the strongest it has ever been. There are always going to be pockets where supply is constrained, like on digital right now. But even there we're getting more than our fair share of people wanting to work for us. So I feel good from the supply side. From the demand side, obviously clients have to finish their planning cycles and all that. But I think we're well positioned in terms of \u2013 assuming that clients continue to shift more towards innovation. That's all the good news. The bad news is the law of large numbers. As you get bigger each year on a percentage basis the growth number becomes more challenging, even if you're growing around similar dollar amounts and so forth. So the math long term works against us. But as I've said many times, that's not a straight line. You have some years where you're up in growth rates, some years where you go down and so forth. But we feel good about supply. We feel good about our pipeline going into the year. But we do have the headwind of the law of large numbers. And as Frank mentioned there has been some M&A that may close next year. And we've just got to keep an eye on that. And we'll certainly plan for the worst, hope for the best. And historically the best has happened for us. But you always want to be cautious on that, so you know the best is going to happen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Keith F. Bachman: Hi. Thank you very much. I was hoping you could comment on the puts and takes associated with operating margins as you look at Q4 and perhaps even a bit further. And included in your response, does the desire to lower the attrition rate by it sounds like taking up the bonus levels, does that suggest that the 19.5% might be a level that you seek over the next couple quarters and as you try to combat attrition? In other words, might it be an impact over the next couple quarters? And, Karen, I just want clarification. Could you also comment on what you see FX impact, given current rates in calendar year 2016? So the analysts can adjust their models as they get prepared for what will presumably be the guidance in the January quarter. Gordon James Coburn : Sure. Let me take the first part of it a little bit. Then Karen will pick up on it. Very importantly, remember, 19% to 20% is the range. Okay? So we're right smack in our range. And the other thing to remember, for Q3, we delivered the midpoint of the range with two things happening. One, our annual salary increases kicked in July 1. So Q3 is always the most challenging quarter, because that's when your salary increases kick in. And we did a year-to-date increase in the bonus accrual. So with both those things happening, we're still at the midpoint of our range. Karen McLoughlin : Yeah. And then in terms of FX, Keith, obviously for 2016 we'll be planning based on the current rate environment, which in terms of revenue, has been fairly stable lately, right? The pound and the euro are the two biggest currencies that impact us, and they've moved a little bit but not enough to be material. The big impact to us has really been the 2014 versus 2015 growth, which we talked about, is about 280 basis points this quarter. But sequentially the last couple of quarters the pound and the euro haven't really had much of a top line impact for us. And so we wouldn't \u2013 at least right now based on rates wouldn't expect a huge FX impact going into next year. That answer your question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you. When you look at digital programs it seems like there is some discussion about whether the way companies both have to approach that, which you're obviously doing, but also implement that is changing materially, in that the programs are getting smaller with a lot more on-site help. How are you positioned for that, given obviously you've got a very attractive but big staff over in India? And would you possibly end up needing more resources on-site locally in the U.S. or Europe? Thank you. Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Lou. It's Frank. I would say that it's actually \u2013 in some senses the more things change, the more they stay the same. If you think back to other big technology shifts, when there are big changes in technology, you tend to see two things happen. First, a wave of as you correctly pointed out smaller projects that are more pilot and prototype in nature, which in the digital world also have the characteristic of requiring more than just technology skills. They require design, they require strategy, they require data science skills, and of course deep consulting and domain expertise. And those also by their nature tend to be more if you will on-site in nature. But after this initial phase of prototyping and piloting, those then have to be switched to enterprise scale. And when you get to enterprise scale, that's when you actually have to do the heavy lifting of integration with legacy, scale to hundreds of thousands or millions of users, very high transaction throughput, some significant amount of performance testing, and so on through the lifecycle. And that part of the engagement, it very much lends itself to the traditional on-site offshore delivery model. So we feel very good about the fact that we have such a strong on-site presence and capability in those new areas, like strategy, like consulting, like design, like data science. And we're able to actively and very seamlessly combine that with our offshore delivery model, so that we can take a client through all three phases of the Digital Works methodology from what we call Idealab through Collaboratory and then through Foundry to create a seamless end-to-end scale experience for clients. David Nelson : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin D. Peller: Thanks, guys. Look, the Healthcare segment was obviously strong. And just as a follow-up question on the integration of deals next year, just what would you expect we should look for in terms of impact, when you have a number of clients going through an integration like that? And I guess on a related topic, TriZetto, I mean again, you said it, a great example of that. Where are we on synergies now? And then do you have a pipeline of other types of deals like that that can make up for the \u2013 what could be potentially maybe slightly slower trends on integration in Healthcare for 2016? Francisco D'Souza: It's always difficult. And hey I wish I had a crystal ball. I don't on M&A. But if you think about historical M&A patterns, Darrin, traditionally M&A creates a substantial amount of technology and business process integration opportunity for us. And I feel like in many cases in the big mergers that have been announced, we serve both sides of the mergers. And so we are extremely well-positioned to be able to help with the technology and business process integration when those mergers come to pass. And so I think that you might see \u2013 my best assumption is that you might see a temporary pause during the phase of integration planning. But then I think it'll result in significant M&A integration work for us, once integration kicks off and is in full swing. That's my best hypothesis at this point. Again no crystal balls here. I would say that the pipeline of synergy opportunities between Cognizant and TriZetto is very strong. There are \u2013 I would say the synergies largely fall into a couple of different categories. We have great opportunities to take the TriZetto clients to \u2013 and offer them a broader range of Cognizant services around for example things like BP \u2013 the Business Process Services on top of the TriZetto platform, Cognizant Infrastructure Services to host and run the TriZetto platform. And then in the medium and longer term we also have opportunities around Health Net style deals, utility type deals where we can work with TriZetto clients to take full end-to-end responsibility like we had proposed to do with Health Net some months ago. So we feel very good about the pipeline of opportunities that we have in around the TriZetto synergies. Francisco D'Souza: And with that I think we have to bring the call to a close. So I just want to thank everybody for joining us today and thank you for your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead sir. David Nelson : Thank you operator, and good morning everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the Company's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead Francisco. Francisco D'Souza: Thank you David, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I presume you saw our announcement reaffirming our 2015 guidance a few weeks ago. We finished 2015 as we had anticipated. Fourth quarter revenue was $3.23 billion, up 1.4% over last quarter and 17.9% year-over-year. For the full-year 2015, we delivered $12.42 billion of revenue, which represented growth of 21% over 2014. We\u2019re pleased with our performance in 2015 having raised our full-year guidance three times during the year. We expect to deliver revenue within a range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion for Q1 of 2016 reflecting some softness in our banking and financial services and healthcare segments as we start the year. For the full-year, we expect to deliver revenue within a range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion. This represents full-year growth of 10% to 14% including an approximate one point negative currency impact. You will notice that we have changed the way we provide guidance. Going forward, we will provide a range for both revenue and EPS in our quarterly and full-year projections. We believe this approach provides better visibility to our investors. As we enter 2016, I would now like to spend a few moments to give you some color on the market and demand environment and also the investments we continue to make to stay ahead of the market. As you know there is no doubt that we are in the midst of a disruptive technological shift that's pushing clients to look for initiative ways to adapt their traditional business models and products. It\u2019s clear that our market opportunities are substantial. I\u2019d like to share four observations from having been on the frontlines of the digital transition for the past five years. The first observation from the frontlines of the digital transition is that from a technology standpoint most clients cannot make an immediate clean sheet of paper transition to a digital technology backbone. Clients will typically build a digital architecture on top of their legacy technology and the integration between these two layers is a very critical part of the transformation. Our intimate knowledge of our clients\u2019 legacy combined with our leading-edge digital capabilities really give us an edge here. The second observation from the frontlines of the digital transition is that a new broader set of capabilities is required to help clients to navigate the digital transition. In the digital world consulting must include both strategy consulting and design sensibilities, and end-to-end digital realization requires consulting, design, technology and industry knowledge. Our digital works model is deliberately built to combine strategy, design, technology and business consulting into one tightly integrated model. The third observation from the frontlines of the digital transition is that now more than ever knowledge of our clients industries and processes is critically important. As our clients seek to digitize all aspects of their business, they are reinventing their business models and their processes. Our deep industry knowledge and process expertise enables us to partner with them as they work through the process of transforming their businesses into digital enterprises. And the final observation from the frontlines of the digital transition is that as digital goes mainstream, clients need to partner with global scale and heft to support them. As clients look to rapidly scale they need the best talent at scale available across the globe. Our global footprint and team is a substantial asset in this regard. With these four observations I\u2019d like to now update you on the key areas of investment focus we outlined last year. Building digital capabilities, evolving our IT services, building platform solutions and further investing in consulting that continue to enhance our capabilities. The first we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. Our digital works approach is solid and showing results. Our focus now is to scale that capability quickly across the world. Let me explain with an example; we recently signed a strategic multi-million dollar engagement with Etihad Airways, United Arab Emirates flag carrier, to define a comprehensive digital transformation strategy. While Etihad Airways is renowned for a world-class experience in the air. They realized that customer experience starts long before the customer arrives at the airport and continues after they land. The Cognizant digital works team and other partners are helping Etihad to envision future customer experience possibilities whether these interactions happen via the web, mobile apps or airport kiosks. As clients like Etihad navigate the challenges involved in becoming digital enterprises, we continue to build out our portfolio of offerings to help them to navigate that shift. Second, we are evolving our IT services capabilities to enable our clients to create next-generation technology infrastructures that are characterized by high levels of operational efficiency at the backend and enhanced by new digital capabilities on the front end. To achieve this goal clients are being challenged to lower total cost of ownership of legacy environments to reinvest these savings into enabling digital transformation or what we have often called the dual mandate. In creating solutions for next-generation IT, we are focused on both sides of the dual mandate. On one side we are bringing in higher levels of automation, integrating our service lines and moving core processes to a managed services environment to improve operational effectiveness. On the other side, we are modernizing legacy systems to create the backbone to help our clients become digital enterprises. Our recent acquisition of KBACE Technologies for example will enhance our capabilities in next-generation IT. KBACE has 400 technology and consulting associates specializing in Oracle Cloud applications. Cloud and SaaS migration is a key component of the solution to the dual mandate. This acquisition will expand our digital and cloud capabilities to help more clients to deploy SaaS applications to lower costs and increase business agility. Our third focus area of investment is building platform based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency. We\u2019ve created a number of sharply focused vertical platform based solutions that we offer to clients in a Business Process as a Service or BPaaS model. These solutions enable clients to turn over entire processes or sub-processes to us to own and operate on an output or outcome-based commercial model. These solutions not only help our client to create variable cost structures, but reduce their time to value by quickly getting clients to best in class benchmark levels of performance. And by embedding analytics in these platforms we are able to bring critical insights and share best practices and industry knowledge across multiple customers. We have a head start here through our acquisition of TriZetto in 2014 as well as having developed a number of our own platforms in core areas such as clinical trials and life sciences that have shown good traction. For example, several quarters back we announced an engagement, which accelerate to develop and build a cloud-based shared investigator platform for global life sciences companies to use in clinical trials. This platform provides a unified point of access on a single platform linking all the critical personnel running clinical trials with major global pharmaceutical companies. This enable standardization, consistency and operational efficiency resulting in lower cost and faster processing of clinical trials. And our fourth investment area is driven by a recognition that we must continue to drive evermore strategic relationships with our clients. Cognizant\u2019s consulting group or CBC is a critical component of this effort. For over 10 years we have built out our consulting practice and have integrated this practice into all parts of our business. We believe that a strong consulting practice is essential to helping clients envision and implement the many transitions facing their businesses. In closing, 2015 was a very significant year for us. We strengthen our position as a leading transformation and partner for our clients. I am happy with our progress and proud of the accomplishments of our teams. I am confident that we will remain the partner of choice for our clients as they transition to the digital economy. With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and to Karen to provide more financial details. I will be back later to take your questions. Gordon? Gordon Coburn : Thank you Francisco. I would like to add some comments on the overall demand environment and provide an update on client budgets. Before moving to our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. Client budgets are complete and the outcome is very much as we expected. As Frank mentioned, we are seeing a soft start to the year end banking and financial services primarily due to macroeconomic concerns and in healthcare on the back of industry consolidation and the payer industry. More broadly clients continue to face a dual mandate within their operations and we expect many of the trends we saw driving demand within our portfolio of services in 2015 to continue over the course of 2016. With that in mind, let me now provide you with additional color on our results across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies. Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 16.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong performance in insurance. We are seeing an increased interest in managed services deals with both banking and insurance clients, as clients continue to focus on cost optimization and look for ways to increase operational efficiencies. Within banking, we saw a continuation of spending on projects around regulatory and compliance and cyber security, as well as a growing interest in re-architecting infrastructure. As mentioned above, macroeconomic concerns are weighing on our banking practice as we go into the start of this year. Before I move on to Healthcare, let me give you an example of the type of projects we are seeing in our Financial Services segment. For a leading property and casualty insurer, we undertook a multi-phased project of consolidating and transforming their technology and business processes and shifted to a managed services model. The client's legacy environment and existing processes were creating platform instability and inconsistent service levels, resulting in a poor agent and customer experience. By moving to the managed services model combining applications, business processes and other services will reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings through a variable cost structure in addition to transforming our client\u2019s service operations. Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, grew 1.4% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year driven primarily by continued strength in life sciences. Rising medical costs, consumerization of healthcare and a changing regulatory environment among other things are driving industry consolidation in the payer industry. We are seeing some slowdown in our healthcare practice due to this consolidation, particularly in the early part of this year as reflected in our Q1 guidance. That said, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the Payer segment and are quite encouraged by the large deal pipeline in this area for 2016. As the healthcare industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, healthcare organizations are simultaneously looking for new ways to deliver customer centric care while driving operational efficiencies. We are helping many through this transition. A great example of this work is the work we are doing for the Texas Children's Health Plan. They recently leveraged Cognizant Services and the TriZetto Healthcare Process Automation Service to add a new line of business and improve its claims [edit] processes processing times, costs and claims backlog. By automating both technology and business processes, the solution reduced the client\u2019s claim backlog by 65% in the first week of implementation. Moving to our Life Sciences business. We had a strong quarter as drug pipelines and product launches have improved the pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally, we saw continued strong growth among our medical device clients. Within life sciences, we continue to see a trend towards multi-service deals leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as strength in advanced data analytics. Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 0.7% sequentially and 14.3% year-over-year driven by strength in manufacturing and logistics. As is typical, Q4 is a slow quarter for retail given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season. Additionally, there were number of furloughs in the segment at year end. We continue to see clients focus on modernizing their technology environments particularly around supply chain and omni-channel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing side in particular we saw demand around product transformation as well. Our investments in digital capabilities for the manufacturing segment were recently recognized in a report by ALM Intelligence formally Kennedy Research and Advisory. We were recognized for a robust and comprehensive IoT consulting portfolio as well as our expertise in sensors and devices and our ability to design wide-ranging IoT solutions by collaborating from early phase roadmap development through testing, prototyping and deployment of solutions at scale. Our other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients was up 1.3% sequentially and 15.3% year-over-year. Within the telecom and IME industries, we are seeing demand driven by the need to upgrade and change business support systems to better support digital solutions. For example, one of our clients a global satellite networking communications provider has grown through both acquisitions and organic expansion of service offerings. In the process, they ended up with a complex legacy business support systems structure comprised of multiple order and building solutions. This complexity was hampering their ability to create bundled services and introduce new services. Cognizant was selected to design and implement an integrated business support system solution. This integrated solution will help our clients go to market with a new set of digital open solutions, showcase products and their partners more readily and lower overall cost of ownership. Now let me turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 services have reached critical mass and have significantly increased our addressable market. We\u2019re pleased with the continued above average growth that each of our Horizon 2 service lines achieved in 2015. Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerate delivery. The integration between clients\u2019 legacy technology foundation and new digital architecture is a key driver of demand for our infrastructure services. Increasingly there is a strong emphasis on automation and IT operations driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. Cognizant Infrastructure Services plays a key role in helping clients incorporate a cloud-centric architecture as one part of the strong foundation. As the lines between physical and digital assets continue to blur, it will affect the way people, business services, data, machines and devices interact with each other leading to a significant redesign of business processes. Cognizant Business Process services is at the forefront of this process redesign, infusing technology and automation a core business processes to help clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. As Frank mentioned earlier Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Our consulting practice is increasingly working with all parts of our business as clients embark on enterprise-wide transformation. From a geographic standpoint North America grew nine-tenths of a percent sequentially and 18.7% year-over-year. Europe was up 2.3% sequentially after a 1.7% negative currency impact and 9.6% from last year. The UK grew approximately 2% sequentially and 9.8% year-over-year and Continental Europe grew 2.8% sequentially and 9.5% over prior year. Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up by 6.8% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India, Singapore and the Middle East, where we are seeing good traction with clients adoption of digital technologies. For example, for the Aditya Birla Group, one of India's largest conglomerates, Cognizant serves as the e-commerce partner and helps implement their new fashion e-commerce platform to deliver a differentiate shopping experience for customers. Finally, let me provide some color on our business operations. Coming into 2015 we were focused on retraining existing employees and hiring new associates to meet the changing demand environment. As a result, our utilization rate dropped. Throughout 2015, we leveraged that training and brought utilization back up to what we believe as a sustainable level. Our Q4 annualized attrition of 19% still remained above our desired range. We are committed to improving our retention levels and have put in place various employee engagement initiatives in 2015. This remains an area of focus for us as we go into 2016. We believe that developing a culture which embraces shared success and supports continuous skills improvement is critical to recruiting and retaining the best talent driving our continued success and winning in the digital era. However, increased employee engagement must be combined with a continued focus on operational excellence. In 2015, we have put in place a structure to improve our operating discipline and we will continue to strengthen and raise the bar for operating excellence in 2016. The tremendous efforts of our employees over the course of 2015 should deliver both strong revenue performance as well as improved operational efficiencies enabled us to increase our 2015 bonus accruals to levels well above the prior year. Additionally, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our employees, business partners, government agencies and others involved in the Chennai recovery efforts that helped quickly bringing our business operations back to normal following the unprecedented flooding in Chennai in the fourth quarter. As we enter 2016, I believe that we are well-positioned to capture the evolving opportunities. Although the year is off to a slow start, we believe our investments in expanded capabilities and markets combined with operational excellence and an engaged and empowered workforce position us well to achieve our goals in 2016. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.23 billion met our guidance and represented growth of 1.4% sequentially and 17.9% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $11 million or 36 basis points, and year-over-year revenue growth by a 188 basis points or $52 million. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 19.6% within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 exceeded guidance by $0.03. For the full-year 2015 revenue of $12.42 billion represented growth of 21% year-over-year including a negative currency impact of 258 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.07. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58.2% and 41.8% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 1.5% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. Outsourcing services increased 1.3% sequentially and grew 7.6% from Q4 a year ago. During Q4, we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards project-based work including digital and other transformational program. During the fourth quarter 37% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and as expected overall pricing was stable. We added eight strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue bringing our total number of strategic clients to 300. During the quarter we had 2,400 net employee additions and we ended the quarter with approximately 221,700 employees globally. Approximately 207,600 of our employees were service delivery staff. Utilization was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 76%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 81% and onsite utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments up by approximately $900 million from the quarter ending September 30 including $350 million in proceeds from our revolver. Our cash and short-term investments net of debt were up approximately $1.5 billion from the year ago period. Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with the DSO including unbilled receivables of 70.3 days, this is down slightly from 70.6 days in Q3. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $369 million down from $421 million at the end of Q3. We build approximately 58% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter which included $350 million outstanding balance on our revolver. Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $690 million, financing activities generated approximately $307 million and capital expenditures were approximately $74 million during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 650,000 shares for a total cost of $42.1 million and our fully diluted share count decreased to 612.6 million shares for the quarter. To date, we have repurchased approximately 41.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We have $438 million remaining unutilized. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full-year. For the full-year 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion, which represents growth of 10% to 14%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time of which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the first quarter of 2016 we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. During the first quarter and for the full-year we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the first quarter we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.78 to $0.80. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, and acquisition related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full-year. This guidance anticipates the full-year share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- tsin Huang : Great. Good morning. A strong 2015. I'll ask on the first quarter, the slow start in banking and healthcare, how broad-based was that across your client base? And what gives you confidence that growth will improve beyond the first quarter? What assumptions are you baking into your guidance for banking and healthcare? Francisco D'Souza: Hey Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Frank. Let me take a crack at that and then Gordon can jump in if there is additional color. I think in \u2013 let me start with healthcare, I think the situation in healthcare we\u2019ve talked to you about it in past calls as you know the payer industry is going through a period of some consolidation at the moment and that is creating some pause with some of our larger payer clients as they differ plans to \u2013 technology plans until their merger plans are clear because systems will have to be consolidated some will have to be retired and so on and so forth so there is a period of uncertainty. Having said that, in healthcare we feel very, very good about the pipeline of deals that we have for 2016 of large deals, many of these deals are on the back of the TriZetto acquisition that we did a little over a year ago. And so in the net I feel like healthcare will have a slow start to the year, but with a very strong pipeline in the back half of the year kicking in. I think financial services a little different as you know they have been in the last couple of months a lot of macroeconomic concerns around the world. I think as a result of that financial services particularly banking more than insurance, but our banking clients are taking a cautious approach at this point, putting some projects on hold. Just I think adopting a little bit of wait and see attitude I think that will \u2013 I don't have a good view as to when that resolves itself I think we are going to watch that over the next quarter or two and see how it unfolds. And so we are not baking \u2013 we are baking some growth in financial services into our view going forward, but I think our view in financial services right now is sort of more of a wait and see approach. Gordon, is there anything you want to add to that? Gordon Coburn : I think you hit that well, but let me reinforce, healthcare is healthy. Obviously there is a short-term issue with some of the mergers going on, but we are clearly seeing traction for the end-to-end solutions of the combination of the TriZetto platform and Cognizant services and infrastructure BPO. So we feel very good about where healthcares can go as through the latter half of 2016 and going into 2017. Tien- tsin Huang : Great. Just a quick follow-up if I don\u2019t mind are just on the margin outlook for the year anything unusual you need to consider for 2016 on EPS or an operating margin? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin : Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Karen. No as usual our guidance assumes that will be right in the 19% to 20% range and usually we start the year that\u2019s generally towards the middle of that range so. Francisco D'Souza: Tien-tsin, remember we brought our utilization up significantly throughout 2015, so going into 2016 we have the benefit of that, which allows us to handle wage inflation and also make the investments that we need to long-term in the business into digital into healthcare. So we feel good on the margins side. Tien- tsin Huang : Understood. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on how you planned the guidance relative to the Healthcare segment. With additional potential M&A closing later on this year, how much did you de-rate that forecast for those customers that could potentially close mergers later in the year? And then maybe can you also address to what extent you discounted the pipeline of the new deals you mentioned in the back half of the year? Gordon Coburn : Sure Jim. It\u2019s Gordon. So in terms of the mergers, we know which mergers are planned for later in the year and the de-risking is around those all for both the buyers and the sellers of those two acquisitions or our customers. So we\u2019ve already seen slowdown in the first quarter because of that, so we've taken a conservative stance on that for the year. When I look at the pipeline of larger deals, there are several larger deals in the healthcare space that we feel quite good and that\u2019s why obviously there is a range in our guidance. You never want to count on those deals closing, but if they do certainly they can be quite beneficial to us. But that would be more towards the latter half of the year. James Schneider : Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, regarding M&A, now it's been a little over a year since you closed TriZetto. So at this point can you maybe opine a little bit on the kind of experience you've had in closing a scale acquisition like this, and comment on your appetite for doing another potential larger acquisition over the next year or two? Francisco D'Souza: It\u2019s Frank. Let me try to address that. Look I think we\u2019ve been more than pleased with the results of the TriZetto acquisition. As you said it\u2019s been a little over a year, the hypothesis was that acquiring intellectual property in the form of a platform would allow us to combine that software with our traditional IT and BPO services and create solutions and bundles of solutions for clients that neither company would independently have been able to provide in the marketplace. I think that hypothesis is proving out to be exactly on point. A number of the large deals that we mentioned a minute ago that are in the healthcare pipeline as Gordon said are combined if you will Cognizant with TriZetto capabilities together. And so we feel very good about the integration of how it\u2019s happened both from an impact in the market standpoint, but also from an internal Cognizant operational standpoint. We\u2019ve retained the TriZetto leadership team, all of the TriZetto leaders are playing an important roles within Cognizant and we feel very good about both the operational and the market impact results of the TriZetto acquisition. As we look forward, we\u2019ve continued to say that our primary acquisition focus will be to look at small tuck-in acquisitions. We announced KBACE a few weeks ago. We will continue to look for acquisitions of that nature in the areas that we\u2019ve talked to you about in the past like digital, like geographic expansion, like deepening our industry domain expertise. But as is always, as we\u2019ve said in the past, if an opportunity \u2013 a scale opportunity presents itself like TriZetto did, we won't hesitate to look at it as it makes strategic sense for the business. James Schneider : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Let me take a crack at the revenue guidance in a different fashion, looking at the full year. I guess what gets Cognizant to the high end of the range versus the low end of the range, because I know the range is kind of new for you guys? Anything in there besides variability in healthcare, which I think you've outlined? Gordon Coburn : I think certainly the variability in healthcare specifically around some of the large deals that are well into the pipeline is the biggest factor, but also we put conservatism in for the financial services. If financial services plays out better than our view that would certainly provide upside. But given the volatility in macroeconomic environment right now we thought it\u2019s prudent to be conservative. Bryan Keane : Okay. I'll turn the line over. Let me just ask quickly on headcount. If you look at the headcount growth it hasn't really been growing as much as historical past. How do we think about that going forward? Thanks so much. Gordon Coburn : Sure. Bryan, we\u2019ve now got them back up to what we believe is the sustainable utilization level. So generally headcount and revenue should be growing more in line, obviously that won\u2019t be quarter-to-quarter because of the timing of college kids coming in, but when you look at it sort of on a longer-term basis for the year they should grow roughly in line. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller : Thanks, guys. I just want to ask you again just to remind us the impact from Chennai on the quarter and if there's any carry over from that into the first quarter. And then just a little bit more clarity on what's happening in the competitive environment around pricing. I know that had come up on some of the legacy businesses that some competitors have, how you are seeing that now going forward through the year. Just from an overall competitive landscape maybe you could give us some color. Thanks, guys. Gordon Coburn : Sure. Obviously the floods in Chennai were a tragic event. We\u2019re one of the larger employers in Chennai. We are very supportive of both our employees and recovery in the city. And that recovery has gone well so far. The good news is our BCP plans worked. They worked really well. We were able to mitigate the financial impacts. There were some, but given the size of the Company overall we then view it as material. There is a little bit of timing on recruiting and we lost a week or two there, but that\u2019s all noise and realm of things. So overall, I would say the impact in Q4 was small and there is really no lingering effect on it. Let me ask Karen to comment on pricing. Karen McLoughlin : Sure. So Darrin I think as I talked about in my script, right for us pricing in the quarter was stable as we expected it to be I think we talked obviously back in Q3 about where we were seeing some competitors get very aggressive on pricing and I think we continue to believe that as a result of the bifurcation that we are starting to see in the marketplace where some competitors are doing very well and, like ourselves, have really built out their consulting and digital capabilities, which is the demand that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace right now, versus others who just haven\u2019t been able to do that. So I would expect that that will continue, but certainly we haven\u2019t seen any impact for us in the quarter. Francisco D'Souza: I would just add to that Darrin very quickly that while we do see that what increasingly what we are starting to see in the marketplaces that our clients are beginning to understand that the value of the integration between the legacy and the new digital world. And so they see the value of a player like us that can not only manage their legacy for greater efficiency and effectiveness, but then add-on top of that digital. And so that value \u2013 we are selling that value very actively and aggressively in the marketplace and because we have very strong leading-edge digital capabilities, it allows us to some extent to explain to clients why the combination of the two are so strong and offset pricing pressure that we may see just purely from what I think of a somewhat irrational pricing on the \u2013 just purely on the legacy side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Sara Gubins : Hi. Thanks. Two quick ones. In financial services, could you give us any more color on what kinds of projects are being put on hold and how easy it would be to turn those back on? And then within the margin expectation, is automation much of a factor in helping support the margins? Francisco D'Souza: It\u2019s Frank. Sara, let me \u2013 on financial services I think largely it's as you would imagine it\u2019s the discretionary more development oriented stuff that tends to kick off at the early part of the year as budget get approved. And so in general, I think that stuff that can turn on relatively quickly again, obviously what\u2019s not getting deferred is the lights-on maintenance, keep the systems running, regulatory compliance those kinds of things obviously will continue and are continuing. But there's a fair amount of discretionary stuff that kicks off early part of the year and I think that's some of that is what we are seeing being deferred a little bit. Francisco D'Souza: And Sara, on automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, think about more as its evolution rather than a revolution. So absolutely we are bringing those technologies into our practices particularly into business process services, infrastructure services, testing. Does it dramatically move the needle in one-year? No, it does not. But we think over the coming years it's going to become increasingly important, we\u2019re making significant investments to make sure that we\u2019re a leader in that area and we remain highly competitive and differentiated. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Hey, good morning, guys. Can you drill down a little bit on the attrition initiatives that you mentioned? I know attrition down ticked just slightly quarter-on-quarter, but it still remains elevated. And then just as my follow-up, any comments on the immigration reform that you're seeing now that we're fully on into the election year? Francisco D'Souza: Sure, Lisa. So attrition is running a bit higher than we would like. When we parse why, a lot of it has to do with, we did a really good job retrain our people into digital technologies last year, so we\u2019ve become a target. That said, given our growth rates are materially higher than the industry even for we believe for 2016. We should be able to provide the best career opportunities so there\u2019s a bunch of stuff we are doing. A key component of it is we refer to as the Cognizant Career Architecture that\u2019s where we are giving tremendous clarity on what are the different roles we have, what does it take to move into those different roles. So people can self manage their careers, so we remain very much a meritocracy and the best and the brightest can move up faster Cognizant than their alternatives. On compensation, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are strong believers in sharing the success with our employees. Our bonus accrual for 2015 was well above what it was for the prior year and we\u2019re a believer in empowerment. Over and over again when people join us they say, wow, it\u2019s just so invigorating, so exciting the freedom and the autonomy that I get at Cognizant. So when you combine all of those I think we\u2019ll be in good shape, obviously we have the headwind of our BPS businesses growing faster than company average and by definition BPS has a bit higher attrition, but I think it's headed back towards the levels that we want. And Gordon, you want to comment on\u2026 Gordon Coburn : Immigration\u2026 Francisco D'Souza: On immigration. Obviously in the budget bill, the fees for H1B Visas went up, yes it cost us some money, but in the realm of things it\u2019s not material for us. So we expect to be able to handle that within the current margin. We\u2019re always conscious of what\u2019s happening in immigration. Cognizant is a leader in immigration compliance. We feel very good about our structure. We have independent audits on a voluntary basis all the time. We've separated compliance from the actual immigration transactions so we feel good about that. At the same time, we are working hard to hire more and more Americans which we further expanded our college recruiting program, we further expanded our U.S. MBA recruiting, we\u2019re investing heavily in STEM education, which is obviously a longer-term solution, but clearly we have to watch immigration during the political cycle, but we certainly feel good that we're playing by both the letter and spirit of the law and we are making efforts to hire more locals. One of the things we\u2019re very excited about it is our veterans program, we\u2019ve hired several hundred veterans over the recent past and we\u2019ve actually just further strengthened the hiring of veterans as some of the leaders in the company have come out of the military, they've taken the leadership on this program so I think that's going to yield good results as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Essex : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the competitive front, particularly with regard to digital. And the question I have there is, are you seeing the same competitors in the digital or consulting and SMAC environment as you have been in the past? And how might the competition or those vendors that you're competing with change as your revenue mix migrates a little bit more further towards digital? Francisco D'Souza: I think \u2013 Brian it\u2019s a good question actually and I'll try to answer it as succinctly as possible, but it's a very dynamic space frankly. I think the best analogy to draw here is sort of the analogy that we saw during the dotcom transition. What we're seeing is that as I said in my prepared remarks that digital is not just a technology issue right it is \u2013 to really do digital well you need to combine design talent with consulting talent with technology talent with consulting and strategy talent and of course you need to bring the client's perspective into all of this. And so you need first of all a very, very diverse set of skills and capabilities. And so when we think about, when we look at competition originally I would say maybe a couple of years ago we would see a lot of smaller boutique type of firms that focused more on the design elements and what I think over the front end of digital. But I think it's now migrating because clients are looking to deploy digital at global scale and integrate with their legacy applications. And so the firms that we see competing most against are the large firms that have an integrated set of capabilities where they can bring all of those capabilities together. Is not that many firms in the world that can bring design, consulting, technology, industry knowledge, process expertise at global scale together. I would say there is a small handful of two or three firms and those are the ones that we tend to compete with most often. Brian Essex : Great. Maybe if I can sneak in one follow-up. In terms of the BFS exposure that you've had and the variability in some of the budgets, have those been in recent conversations based on maybe the last past few weeks to a month of market volatility? Or were these primarily concerns that they had going into the year that maybe conversations with them led you into a little bit more of a cautious stance as you developed your guidance? Francisco D'Souza: It\u2019s been a relatively recent phenomenon in the last month or so as volatility has been quite substantial in the market. I think we saw this sort of mid-December through really now mid-January, end of January those are that sort of the timeframe in which we\u2019ve had these conversations which led us to say we would probably should take a little bit more cautious approach until we get a clear sense of what\u2019s going to happen in financial services. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Foresi : Hi. I was wondering, the Cognizant has typically tried to grow faster than the industry \u2013 or has grown faster than industry, I should say. At the lower end of your range it seems like you are more in line, so I just wanted to get an update on your thoughts on that side. And then maybe you could just talk a little bit about why the change in methodology on the guidance side. Is the business getting harder to predict? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: Sure. So Joe, I think our expectation is that we continue to grow faster than industry. Obviously the question is where does the industry land for 2016 and certainly others in the industry I think will probably have some of the same outcomes in financial services that we do. What they give for guidance probably differs by company. So I think we feel comfortable with our strategy of delivering growth above the industry average. Joe I apologize, what was the second half of the question? Joseph Foresi : Can you give me a bracket around revenue? Is the business getting harder to predict now that you are kind of moving more into digital and different types of projects? Francisco D'Souza: I don\u2019t know if I call harder to predict, but if you think about the methodology we used to use and obviously we\u2019re somewhat unique in that. We are clear on what the downside was, but not the limit to the upside and as we get bigger, I think we all felt it was more appropriate to give investors sort of both an understanding what the boundaries were both on the downside and the upside. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Louis Miscioscia : Sure. Sort of on that same note, I realize everybody's mix is different but a lot of the other names out there are still suggesting growth quarter to quarter. Obviously you're suggesting down about 120 basis points. Maybe if you could just go into a little bit more detail why the competitors seem to be having a much better March quarter, quarter to quarter. Is it the UK calendar or is there anything else that you could can point to? And then I have just one quick follow-up? Gordon Coburn : I think it\u2019s very simple, our leadership in healthcare. Obviously it's a great position to have, but in Q1 it\u2019s hurting us. There are a bunch of acquisitions going on out there. So I think probably the big difference between us and others is our exposure and work with leading healthcare companies. The currency remember our full-year guidance there is about 100 basis points headwind on currency, but obviously that\u2019s something everyone else has as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you. I also wanted to return to M&A, if I could. It's been well reported or at least rumored by a lot of periodicals that Cognizant has been in discussion along with TCS around potentially buying Perot. While I won't ask you specifically about Perot. I would like to try to understand philosophically would Cognizant entertain buying what I would consider to be a legacy company, which I don't think has a growth portfolio, it seems more like financial engineering, rather than buying what seems to be a very nice acquisition in KBACE. So I'm trying to understand the thought process, the philosophy around the M&A. Is it more targeted towards growth, which has been the history of Cognizant, and, indeed, other leaders like Accenture over the past couple of years, or is it about, again, what I would consider to be, seems more like, a financial engineering exercise? Francisco D'Souza: It\u2019s Frank. I would say that we are at a position in the evolution of the company where we continue to look for acquisitions that will create key areas of distinction for the company. An acquisition like KBACE does that for us substantially. We\u2019ve said this in the past that when we think about distinction what are the types of things we are looking for. We are looking for acquisitions that deepen our industry capabilities so we've got great footprint in key industries; we are looking to deepen those footprints with great client relationships in those industries with great capability for those industries. We are looking to acquisitions that will broaden our geographic footprint we as you know we have a footprint right now, we have great \u2013 there are great opportunities to expand in other parts of the world by taking our core service offerings to other parts of the world. So we would look to acquisitions that expand our geographic capabilities. We would look at acquisitions that broaden or deepen our core service lines and service offerings so as we think about digital as a service offering, as we think about our Horizon 2 businesses that are going very fast right now. We would look at acquisitions that accelerate those service offerings and so we will continue to apply that screen in a fairly disciplined way to say does an acquisition big or small, does it deepen our industry capabilities, does it strengthen our lines of service or does it and/or does it help us from a geographic standpoint and that's I think the screen that we\u2019ll use when we evaluate any of these acquisitions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. I know you've used the term conservatism a few times in the conversation so far this morning. So, is it fair to assume that the magnitude of conservatism in this year's initial guidance is similar to what we saw in 2015, which was obviously a year where you were able to raise the guide each quarter? And if you do end up hypothetically at the low end of the guide at 10% revenue growth, would that likely mean that not only the U.S. economy has gone into a recession but that the large deal pipeline in healthcare has failed to convert? Gordon Coburn : Yes, I think that\u2019s accurate. We are at the bottom end of the range obviously we are conservative on particularly financial services and we certainly wouldn't count on the large healthcare deals. So I think that\u2019s a good way of thinking about it. Francisco D'Souza: Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints our final question will come from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : Okay. Great. Hey guys. So real quick, on the demand environment, you explained how the healthcare vertical has good reasons for near-term softness, but you also have a good pipeline that could help growth later in the year. Is it a similar picture right now in financial services? I mean you mentioned near-term weakness in financial services, but I didn't hear as much on the pipeline in financial services. Could this be a year where financial services does better from a quarter-to-quarter growth standpoint in the back half of the year? Francisco D'Souza: Hey Rod. It\u2019s Frank. I would say it\u2019s a little different in financial services. Clearly as you said, in healthcare we've got some solid big deals in the pipeline, we feel good about. In financial services, the relatively more recent phenomenon of a little bit of uncertainty a larger number of \u2013 what I would say smaller projects getting pushed out because of the macroeconomic uncertainty. So I think that depending on volatility and what's going on in the industry, you could see one of two scenarios, you could see continued conservatism in spending for a quarter or two in financial services or you could see that come back relatively quickly because these are projects that as I said a minute ago I think our smaller discretionary projects that could be turned on relatively more quickly. So it just a little bit difficult to say right now. I think the next month or two we will get better visibility and I think on our next call we\u2019ll be able to give you a better sense of what we are seeing in the marketplace. And with that let me just close by thanking everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your questions. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. End of Q& A Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2016 results. If not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Frank. Francisco D'Souza: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q1 revenue was $3.2 billion, down 0.9% from Q4 and within our guided range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. Revenue was up 10% from a year ago. The quarter developed exactly as we outlined when we provided guidance back in February. As we expected, we saw some softness in our Financial Services and Healthcare segments resulting in a slow start to the year. Macroeconomic concerns and market volatility weighed on the banking industry at the start of this year, resulting in some moderation in discretionary spending. We anticipate a return to positive sequential growth in our financial services practice for the balance of this year. Industry consolidation within the healthcare payer space was a key factor in the softness of our healthcare practice during Q1. Going forward this year, we also expect a return to positive sequential growth in our Healthcare segment as the pressure from industry consolidation is expected to be partially offset by anticipated project ramp-ups and a strong pipeline including the recent signing of a significant multiyear deal with EmblemHealth, one of New York's leading health insurance and wellness companies. Turning to guidance, we are reaffirming our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance within a range of $3.32 to $3.44 and tightening our full year revenue growth guidance to a range of approximately 10% to 13%. What's important to note is our Q2 revenue guidance reflecting a strong rebound in sequential growth is a range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. This represents incremental revenue within a range of $140 million to $200 million and would make Q2 a strong sequential growth quarter putting us on a solid trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries in Q2. In support of our confidence in the business and the strength of our pipeline, we stepped up hiring adding approximately 11,300 net hires this past quarter. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly. Moving on, let me provide some color on the key factors influencing client spending in the current environment. As we've seen over the last several quarters, digital transformation continues to be a strong driver of demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors while innovating to create new areas of growth. We are in a strong position to capture the opportunities that are emerging from this transition. We believe that for true enterprise-wide digital transformation, clients need an interdisciplinary framework which brings together strategy, technology, design, data science and industry knowledge. Cognizant Digital Works has been developed to provide this integrated approach in driving transformation. This quarter, we've added another dimension to our Digital Works approach by acquiring a 49% stake in ReD Associates, a human science consultancy that focuses on consumer experience and behavior and how these factors impact corporate strategy, products and services and go-to-market approaches. Together, ReD and Cognizant will provide a unique and compelling approach for businesses in helping them reframe their challenges for the digital era. Gordon will talk more about ReD later in his comments. True digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes in customer experience, operations and business models that extend throughout the organization from the front office to the middle office and right through the back office systems. At the front end where enterprises engage with a myriad of stakeholders from customers to employees and business partners, our clients are looking to build capabilities that create personalized experiences across multiple devices that are well integrated with their business and technology architectures and can be deployed rapidly at scale. In the middle office, clients are looking for operational agility and efficiency by combining people, processes and technology through platforms that have delivered as outcome-based models. These shared utility models sometimes called Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, can be enhanced with automation and analytics to bring additional value to client operations. And in the back office, clients must modernize core IT systems and implement complex engineering development methods to create the technology backbone that's able to support the agility, scale and performance needs of a digital enterprise. It's through this lens that we've identified investments in three key strategic areas to take clients through this transformation journey. Let me now talk more about each of these initiatives in detail. The first strategic initiative is building the digital capabilities to work with our clients on their front end systems. I spoke a few minutes ago about our Digital Works approach which seamlessly integrates five essential elements : strategy, technology, data science, experience design and industry expertise to develop and deliver digital solutions rapidly. We're finding great traction for this framework across the industries that we serve. For example, we're helping a leading life sciences company to improve diabetic care by implementing an Internet of Things, or IoT, infrastructure that enables remote upgrades to home-based glucose meters and insulin pumps. Doing so will improve customer satisfaction and adherence to testing regimes. This comes after we've already successfully developed an IoT monitoring framework for the same company to better maintain its thousands of surgical devices remotely. The second strategic initiative is to help clients achieve new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in their core transaction processing operations by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, model that allows clients to shift from buying service to buying an outcome. By applying a series of levers including process optimization, digitization and large-scale efficiencies, we're able to bring clients levels of effectiveness which they would have been unable to reach on their own. The third strategic initiative is to transform client's existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT. Clients cannot harness the potential from digital technologies without integrating with and upgrading their legacy systems and infrastructure. This requires a transformation of their IT backbone including a simplification of how applications are developed and delivered along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost. For instance, under our agreement with the healthcare clients I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, over the next several years, Cognizant will help retire, upgrade and modernize their legacy infrastructure, software and development processes. We will replace legacy infrastructure with cloud-based virtual infrastructure, upgrade all software capabilities with Cognizant's TriZetto Facet software and implement agile methodologies to ensure and expedite the timely development and rollout of new products. With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance, and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later to take your questions. Gordon? Gordon James Coburn : Thank you, Francisco. Heading into the rest of the year, we have good momentum across the business as indicated by our Q2 guidance which anticipates very healthy sequential revenue growth. With that in mind, let me provide you with some additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies. Our Banking and Financial Services segment was down 1.7% sequentially and up 10.7% year-over-year. As we discussed on our first quarter call, macroeconomic concerns weighed on our banking practice at the start of the year. While we've seen stabilization in the markets and expect improved performance within our banking practice over the course of the year, several of our banking clients continue to take a cautious approach. Looking past these short-term challenges, it is increasingly clear that the FinTech revolution is driving our banking clients to invest in significant changes to their business model to meaningfully pivot towards becoming digital enterprises. Moving on to our insurance practice, we continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes deliver greater efficiencies increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, there's an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions. Let me give you an example. We are working with The Guardian Life Insurance Company to implement a next-generation IT solution for modernizing its big data infrastructure with Cognizant's BigFrame, a platform solution that leverages Cognizant extensive big data and mainframe expertise. Using the BigFrame solution, Guardian will fast-track its modernization program while minimizing risk and operational impact. The new platform-based environment integrates data from multiple sources providing comprehensive data as a service to internal teams for self-service analysis, improved decision-making and faster product development. Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, declined 4% sequentially and grew 4% year-over-year. The seasonal impact of TriZetto's software business contributed to roughly half of the sequential decline as a large portion of software sales occur in the fourth quarter. As we've discussed for several quarters, the industry consolidation among several of the nation's largest payers is weighing on our healthcare practice in 2016. However, the payer sector continues to undergo fundamental changes. Over the medium and longer term, we believe these changes will create opportunities that we are well positioned to capture particularly through the combined Cognizant and TriZetto offerings. As you recall, we had said that by acquiring TriZetto, we were acquiring IP in the form of software which, when combined with our traditional IT and business process services, would allow us to create revenue synergies that neither company alone would have been able to achieve. These synergies include increased systems integration, hosting and business process opportunities around the TriZetto software, and most importantly, end-to-end platform-based solutions. The integration of TriZetto and market acceptance of our combined capabilities has exceeded even our own expectations. As a result, we continue to feel good about the acquisition and our ability to create shareholder value through strong synergy revenues. In addition to end-to-end BPaaS solutions in healthcare, we're also winning in digital. For example, Cognizant has been engaged by a division of a major healthcare player as their strategic partner in their digital business transformation. This client is experiencing rapid growth and has process systems and technology that cannot keep pace with their growth and strategic vision. We're helping them to re-imagine their customer experience, re-platform their operational backbone and redesign their operating model, ultimately resulting in an increased customer retention and operational effectiveness, improved customer insights and experience and lower cost of operations. Moving to our life sciences business where the pipeline for deals is strong despite a muted start to 2016, we continue to see demand for multiservice deals combining applications and infrastructure in our midsize pharma clients while our large pharma clients are increasingly interested in managed services arrangements to help reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings. Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 3.6% sequentially and 15.2% year-over-year, driven by strength in retail, manufacturing and logistics. One of the keys to the strength in our manufacturing and logistics practice in recent quarters has been our growing relationship with the engineering teams within our clients, leveraging our digital and IoT expertise to help them smart-enable products to improve instrumentation across their product portfolios. For example, for a global manufacturer of industrial machinery, we're helping the client who has faced a period of declining sales digitally enable existing equipment and create new digital products as a way to monetize data, improve the utilization of their equipment as well as reduce inventory in the supply chain. Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information media and entertainment clients, was up 2% sequentially and 14.7% year-over-year, driven by our technology practice. With high-tech clients, we are seeing good opportunity around platform engineering for cloud services. Working with our high-tech clients enables us to do leading-edge technology work which is often applicable to other industries. For example, we are implementing this platform development for a client who is a leading provider of cloud computing services. Cognizant is creating a fully automated platform which will target the mid-market enterprise space to provide real-time and elastic capacity for their customers network and storage needs and to price this capacity accordingly. As a result, the client was able to significantly reduce cloud services provisioning time and launch new variable pricing models matching changes in market demand. This kind of experience is increasingly relevant to our corporate clients who are thinking about re-architecting their infrastructure by deploying cloud solutions. Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 services : Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 services, which are approaching a $3 billion annual revenue run rate, have reached critical scale and have significantly increased our addressable market. They are essential to both the work we are doing around digital transformation and platform based solutions. The success and tremendous growth we've seen from these service lines over the past years demonstrates the power of the three horizon model as a way to manage growth and investment in the company. Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a key competitive differentiator for us and is underlying much of the work we're doing across our strategic initiatives. As clients undergo enterprise-wide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign. Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, there is a strong focus on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. For example, a manufacturer of medical devices, which saw an opportunity to improve performance and uptime needed to standardize and improve its global IT operations. We're developing a scalable and reliable IT infrastructure and offered an end-to-end solution, managing all the clients' hardware and applications, improving speed, predictability and customer satisfaction. Cognizant Business Process Services saw a very strong growth during the quarter, led by work with our high-tech and insurance clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. Cognizant recently commenced a multi-year agreement with Storebrand, one of the largest financial services firms in the Nordics, to transform their operations. Cognizant will combine business process with consulting and infrastructure services to enable Storebrand to reengineer business processes across the customer lifecycle, automate and modernize existing IT systems infrastructure and develop digital platforms with advanced analytic capabilities. As part of the contract, Cognizant will help Storebrand to move to a BPaaS model and deliver seamless omni-channel experience. From a geographic standpoint, North America declined 1.4% sequentially. Adjusting for the seasonality of the TriZetto business, North America was broadly flat with Q4. Europe was up 0.9% sequentially after a 2.5% negative currency impact. The U.K. declined approximately 2.3% sequentially after a 4.5% negative currency impact and Continental Europe grew 5.4% sequentially after a slight positive currency impact. Finally, the rest of the world was up 30 basis points sequentially and almost 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India, Australia and the Middle East where we're seeing good traction with clients' adoption of digital technologies. Before I turn the call over to Karen, I'd like to discuss our recently announced 49% investment in and exclusive partnership with ReD Associates. How our customer interacts with his or her own world whether it's taking medications, driving a car, shopping or going for a jog has largely been the same for decades. Yet with the digital revolution and the merging of the physical and the virtual, these basic activities are now being rethought. This has become the new competitive battleground for many of our clients of revitalizing their products and services with digital technology. ReD is a unique, highly specialized consultancy whose expertise in the human sciences is helping build businesses to address these issues. ReD specialists in sociology, anthropology, philosophy and political science work with market-leading blue-chip clients such as adidas, Ford and Novo Nordisk to create compelling experiences for their customers. The customers who now expect their workout equipment, car, shopping experience and healthcare to be every bit as personalized, engaging and insightful as their iPhone. Our minority ownership model allows us to work together exclusively while helping us preserve the unique culture and processes that have led to long-term success of ReD Associates. This partnership will enable Cognizant and ReD to create an entirely new model for making sense of human behavior, connecting those insights to strategy, applying design-thinking to creating engaging digital experiences and then applying technology to achieve global enterprise scale. These critical elements add to the front office capabilities which we described earlier and enable us to address these challenges in a unique way. With that, let me turn the call over to Karen, who will review our financial results. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenue of $3.2 billion met our guidance and represented a sequential decline of 0.9% sequentially and an increase of 10% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $15 million or approximately 50 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $34 million or 120 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 19.9% within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 was at the high end of our guidance range of $0.78 to $0.80. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.8% and 42.2% of revenue respectively for the quarter. Consulting and technology services declined 1.6% sequentially, reflecting the cautiousness of certain clients primarily in banking and healthcare to spend on project-based work, as well as the seasonality of TriZetto's software license revenue. Revenue from consulting and technology services grew 12.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue was flat sequentially and grew 6.2% from Q1 a year ago. During the first quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added eight strategic customers in the quarter defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue bringing our total number of strategic clients to 308. As Frank mentioned earlier, we ramped up hiring during the quarter with approximately 11,300 net new hires, reflecting our near-term growth expectations and strength of our pipeline. Annualized attrition of 14.6% during the quarter including BPO and trainees was down by almost 450 basis points from last quarter and up slightly from the year-ago period. Throughout 2015, we put in place various employment engagement initiatives to improve our retention levels and are pleased with the progress we've made to date. We will continue to enhance these initiatives over the course of 2016. Total head count at the end of the quarter was approximately 233,000 employees globally of which approximately 218,000 were service delivery staff. As a result of our strong hiring in the first quarter, utilization is down slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 75%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 80% and on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $500 million from the quarter ending December 31. Borrowings under our revolver decreased during the quarter by $250 million ending at $100 million. Our cash and short-term investments net of debt were up by approximately $1.2 billion from the year-ago period. Total receivables were $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 74 days. This is up from 73 days in Q1 of 2015. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $432 million, up from $369 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 53% of the Q4 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver. Turning to cash flow, operating activities generated approximately $68.8 million, financing activities were approximately $467.8 million use of cash during the quarter and capital expenditures were approximately $63.7 million during the quarter. During the first quarter, we accelerated our share repurchase activity, repurchasing 4.3 million shares for a total cost of $244.6 million and our diluted share count decreased to 611.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q1, we had repurchased approximately 45.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.8 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We had $193 million remaining unutilized. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we have tightened our revenue expectation to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $14 billion, which represents growth of approximately 10% to 13%, including an approximate 1% negative currency impact. The tightened range is primarily a result of our slower than usual performance in Q1. As Frank mentioned, we expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries as we move into Q2 and the rest of the year, and expect the ramp-up of several deals including the healthcare deal mentioned earlier. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. During the second quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.83. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 611 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if maybe you could comment a little bit about your confidence in the back half of the year and the levers that you anticipate to achieve accelerated growth, particularly with regard to the BPaaS pipeline and deals which may materialize in the back half of the year. Gordon James Coburn : Hey, Brian. It's Gordon. Thanks for the question. Let's talk about both confidence for Q2 and the back half of the year because they tie together. We have very good momentum going into Q2. Our guidance is for $140 million to $200 million of sequential growth. We expect to return to positive growth \u2013 positive sequential growth both in Healthcare and Financial Services, so sort of the headwinds that we had in Q1 on a sequential basis have subsided because it's in our run rate. When you think about the back half of the year, there are a couple wildcards and obviously that's why there's a guidance range. One is what happens with additional BPaaS deals and the timing on those, what happens with the timing of some of the big M&A and healthcare and we've \u2013 for the full year, we continue to be cautious in Financial Services. But even with that, given the pipeline both of new projects from existing customers and very, very healthy new logo wins in Q1, we feel good both about the sequential growth going into Q2 and that we continue to have healthy momentum in the back half of the year. Brian L. Essex: Great. And maybe if I could follow up on the M&A comment, so obviously two very large M&A deals that we're all tracking, and one of them looks a little bit more certain than another to happen sooner. If one of those were to get pushed, could you maybe -- any color in terms of commentary and that how are those management teams and how that spending profile may look with a delay in one of those deals? Gordon James Coburn : We haven't had any direct discussions about what happens if the deal is pushed or not pushed, but what we've seen historically and are certainly seeing now is during the time when people are waiting for \u2013 to see if a deal occurs, there are deferrals in spending because they're looking at what systems will be the ultimate system that's used and so forth and that's baked into our guidance. So our guidance assumes that these deals take a fairly long time at the low-end of our guidance. If they happen sooner, great. Brian L. Essex: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thanks. I guess, the question is, can the demand and growth of your Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 offerings which are doing quite well, sufficiently offset the anticipated and ongoing weakness in traditional Horizon 1, so that net-net you can look forward to sustainable double-digit growth? And that's not just a 2016 question; it's beyond that as well. And then, I guess, do you then need to accelerate your inorganic investments in IP and software-based companies to either boost or sustain that growth? Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Ashwin, it's Frank. I think since you asked a long-term question beyond 2016, I will answer it in that context. I would say that overall the world is becoming more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive, and that technology needs to be deployed, it needs to be integrated, it needs to be configured, it needs to be maintained and upgraded and so on and so forth. None of that activity goes away. So at a very macro level, I see very strong growth opportunities for us across all three horizons, frankly, because I don't see Horizon 1 declining; I think that as new technology gets deployed, you need to upgrade it, you need to maintain it, you need to take care of it and so on and so forth. And so Horizon 1 services will continue to, I think, have healthy growth going forward. So net-net when I look at the portfolio across all three Horizons in the long run, I think that there's plenty of market opportunity. And I'll remind you, I don't need to remind you but I'll just say that it's a very fragmented market. We have 1% to 2% market share. So there's plenty of opportunity for us to go capture additional share in the market. And to the second part of your question, I continue to expect that we will have an active M&A strategy as we have historically looking at the tuck-in acquisitions in the areas that we've always said geographic expansion, new technologies, deepening our industry expertise, and also now software and IP, I think, will factor into that. But I think our baseline is to do small tuck-ins and then from time to time if great opportunities like TriZetto present themselves that are bigger, we will obviously look at those. TriZetto has been, I think, as Gordon said in his comments, exceeded our expectations, I think, in what we've been able to achieve in a year and a half. And so we'll continue to look favorably at opportunities like that but also look at them very carefully to make sure that they meet all of the criteria for us. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Edward S. Caso: Hi. Good morning. I'm just trying to get a sense in the banking sector how much of the softness reflects to the mix of your particular clients or could it also be some market share losses given that some of your competitors reported fairly solid results in the financial services area? Thanks. Gordon James Coburn : Hey, Ed. It's Gordon. So certainly, the bigger component of it is our exposure to financial services and just who our clients happen to be. There's one example where this share shift going on but that's a relatively small portion of the softness that we saw. We tend to work with the big \u2013 for the big money center banks. We do a lot of work for the European banks and those are the ones that have been hit harder than the midsize banks. And also, because we have a fairly large European exposure on a banking practice, FX was also \u2013 had some impact there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks. Good morning. Just curious how is the pricing environment out there. Anything unusual in deals won or lost? Karen McLoughlin : Tien-tsin, this is Karen. No, I mean, pricing has been very stable. I think obviously last fall we talked about some competitive environments that we were seeing in a couple of deals. But I think, frankly, that has mitigated itself. Pricing continues to be very stable. Clients right now are frankly looking for providers who can really bring the thought leadership and the value and the very strong consulting expertise and obviously that commands appropriate pricing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane: Hi, guys. Cognizant's revenue guidance of 10% to 13% is in line to a little lower than some of the Indian IT peers for the next 12 months. And then historically, I can't recall a period that Cognizant didn't grow faster than peers and I know you guys keep margins lower because you invest for future growth. So just hoping to get your thoughts on maybe what's explaining the growth rates matching up with Indian IT peers and that you guys aren't significantly beating peers as usual and then when might you get back to historical norms. Thanks. Gordon James Coburn : Hey, Bryan, it's Gordon. It has a little to do with the math. Q1 is soft for us. We're in a sequential decline but then actually have quite healthy growth and I would expect probably growth that shows favorably to many of our competitors sequentially going forward from there. But in Q1 \u2013 I think we had a couple of unique things in Q1 particularly in healthcare because we have such a strong position there. We were impacted by that and then in BFS once again because our big exposure to the money center banks. So full year, I think your observation is right. When you look sequentially after our soft Q1, time will tell whether that observation is correct or not. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller : Thanks, guys. I just want to ask when we think about the setup as we proceed towards the second half of the year and it's 2017. I mean, some of these financial clients you talked about have seem to be re-accelerating a little bit at least and then if that were to stay confident and you couple that, I'm curious what post-merger integration looks like as compared to what you're doing with those clients before on the Healthcare side, in particular. I mean, is that something we could see potentially even up notably greater level of revenue in 2017 as these deals will close hopefully than we saw that with \u2013 currently to an acceleration? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. Darrin, this is Karen. And I think that's exactly the trend we have historically seen with mergers and acquisitions, right? There tends to be a lull before the deal closes as the clients sort of pulled back, evaluate what their plans are going to be. And then post-merger depending upon when the integration starts, there tends to be quite a bit of upside as you bring the platforms together or implement new processes and new platforms for the combined organization and that clearly in big healthcare deals like this would have quite a long runway. So as we said, depending on the timing of those deals, given the fact that we are a strong partner on all four or five of the equation in those deals, we would certainly expect to see at least our fair share of the integration work. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding the pipeline of new healthcare deals, you had talked about last quarter in the back half of the year, I think you talked about one of them but could you maybe talk about your confidence in those deals materializing or getting closer to signing several of them and maybe just talk about the overall pipeline in that space right now? Gordon James Coburn : Sure. We're really pleased, Jim, with the pipeline in healthcare, particularly in healthcare deals that leverage the synergy between the TriZetto platform and Cognizant's IT capabilities. It's always difficult to predict when these deals will close. Obviously, we closed a deal this quarter that we discussed to really focus on modernizing, transforming and automating the client's environment. As we get later in the year, obviously, the impact it has in 2016 for additional deals closing is smaller but sets us up very well for 2017. So the way I think about it is we have clearly validated the market for this combined offering. We have a healthy pipeline. When exactly they close, don't know, but we're actively working on multiple deals right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Sara Rebecca Gubins : Hi. Good morning. Within Financial Services, I was hoping to get some more details on what kind of discretionary work is being pushed back and any more color on how you're performing with regional banks? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Sara. It's Frank. I would say that \u2013 let me answer the second part of your question first. I think the work that we're doing with the regional banks continues actually to be very strong. We saw good \u2013 we have seen, I think, for the last three quarters, four quarters at least great traction with the regional banks. That continues and we feel good about that. That's part of the return to positive sequential growth in Financial Services in the coming quarters. And then I think in terms of color around what kind of discretionary work gets pushed or has been pushed in Q1, I would say it's across the board. Anything that's project oriented or discretionary, so things that \u2013 project work, new application development, some of the digital projects got pushed a little bit. Again, I don't know that this was a major push, big delays. I think this was sort of some slowdown in budget getting finalized in Q1 and then that translating into a relatively slow kickoff of new projects in some of the banks during the first quarter, which now I think we see starting to alleviate itself. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Mayank Tandon : Thank you. Good morning, Gordon and Frank. You've called out BPaaS. I just want to get a sense, is your BPaaS work healthcare specific? And if it is, what are some of the opportunities to leverage these capabilities into other verticals? Do you have to buy assets? And then just a related question is, what are the economics like on a BPaaS deal versus your traditional services? Francisco D'Souza: Hi, Mayank. It's Frank. Clearly, the majority of our activity in pipeline right now is in healthcare around the TriZetto platform, but we have BPaaS both opportunities in the pipeline and also client engagements that are in other industries, in other sectors. In many cases, those are platforms that we've developed ourselves. In some cases, these are platforms that we have acquired, smaller platforms that we've acquired in the past. And in some cases, these are offerings that we've constructed on top of third-party products, software platforms, either commercial ISV platforms or sometimes we're having conversations about taking a client's asset and essentially wrapping a BPaaS service around that and taking it to market. So there are a number of opportunities and a number of irons we have in that fire, and a lot of, I think, positive momentum there. I would say in terms of the economics, the economics on the initial BPaaS deals tend to be roughly in line with, maybe a little lower than a traditional deal but then the second, third, fourth time you do it because you've established the factory and the utility, the margins start to get very, very promising because you're essentially amortizing the fixed costs over larger volume. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question. Joseph Foresi : Hi. I was wondering, can you comment on the progress you are making in digital? I know you shied away from giving numbers around what that looks like within your business, but if you could frame it for us that would be great. And if we hit an economic skid, how discretionary do you think those digital spending dollars might be? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: The reason that we've \u2013 let me start by just reminding everybody that the reason that we don't quantify digital is that we think that the digital capabilities and offerings are really infused throughout all of our business through Horizon 1, Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 service offerings. And so really digital really is very much of the core operating fabric of all of our service offerings, all of our service lines. I think we continue to feel very good about the broad-based capability that we've built in digital. We were out ahead, I think, of many on the digital opportunity with social mobile analytics and cloud from a technology standpoint. I think we are in \u2013 for Cognizant in the third or fourth generation of our thinking around digital with our Digital Works approach and methodology where we've gone well beyond technology to include design and data science in addition to strategy and technology and industry knowledge to combine those together, which is what you really need when you are deploying digital on behalf of clients. We spoke a little bit about our investment in ReD Associates this quarter which is another dimension to the Digital Works approach. We feel very good about what the possibilities are in combining ReD, which brings a human approach to digital, from the social sciences standpoint. And so that's just another dimension to digital. So overall, I feel like we really have one of the leading digital capabilities out there. We are doing very deep impactful work with clients like the life sciences client that I spoke about in my prepared comments. So I feel good about the capability. It's hard to say what to quantify exactly, what portion of this is discretionary in the sense of \u2013 in the event of an economic slowdown. But I would say that contextually the work that we're doing is largely very fundamental to the future of our clients' businesses and their strategy. Today, there is no strategy for business without some digital component. And so the work that we're doing tends to be very much in the heart of the future of these businesses. And so I would imagine that there would be some stickiness to that in the event of economic slowdown. Hard to quantify, though. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Operator : Jason, you're on mute. Mr. Kupferberg, your line is on mute. Jason Alan Kupferberg : Sorry, sorry. Can you hear \u2013 I'm sorry, can you hear me? Gordon James Coburn : Yep. Go ahead, Jason. Jason Alan Kupferberg : Do any of the headwinds that you're experiencing this year feel like they could be anything more than temporary? I'm just curious why not take the low end of the guidance off the table here just given the momentum you've got going into Q2. Gordon James Coburn : Jason, it's Gordon. The headwinds are temporary and are in the run rate now. But it comes down to the math. Because we were down sequentially in Q1, we expect healthy sequential growth going to Q2 and beyond. But when you look at the impact that Q1 had on the full year, we have to dig ourselves out of that hole. So, yeah, we think the tightening the range the way we did is appropriate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you. I want to dig into the C in (48:08) SMAC, if we could. Some suggest that 1% of global workloads are in the cloud, mostly with AWS in 2013. Maybe here in 2016 we're up to 5%, but 2020, we could be up to 15%. And some are predicting actually 50% of all workloads maybe 10 years or 15 years out will be in the cloud. So I guess my question is, are you actually seeing this? Or we hear about a tipping point and many large companies, many of the ones that you deal with, the big financial banks are \u2013 want to move data whereas (48:38) want to move to the cloud. So are you seeing that? Are you helping with that? And how would it affect your business especially, I guess, I have about 7% of your business, I think, is in RIM, or remote infrastructure management? Francisco D'Souza: So, this is a multifaceted question. And so let me answer it in a couple of different ways. It's Frank. Let me say first of all that clearly large enterprises are looking at the cloud in multiple different ways. I would say that most of the large enterprises that we deal with are very much focused on hybrid cloud and looking at very carefully thinking about what workloads belong in the cloud and what workloads belong on-prem and how those balance off against each other. I would say that the \u2013 while the nature of workloads in the cloud requires a different maintenance profile, a workload in the cloud needs to be maintained and upgraded and monitored and modernized and all of those kinds of things, just like a workload on-premise. There's much of the care and feeding of a workload in the cloud that still needs to be taken care of. And so, I don't think it's a fair assumption to just assume that when a workload moves into the cloud, it exists in the cloud without any support or care and feeding around it. So the implication that perhaps a workload moving to the cloud completely cannibalizes revenue is not entirely, I think, accurate. at least based on the technology that's available today and what we see. I think more importantly, though -- so that's one dimension of the answer. The other dimension of the answer, I would say, is that, look, over the time horizons that you talked about, 10 years, 15 years, the amount of data and the number of devices that are going to exist in the ecosystem is going to explode. It's going to increase absolutely exponentially. And so all of that complexity is going to require, in my opinion, far more management, far more maintenance, far more deployment help. There's all of these other services that will be required to manage that degree of complexity as data and devices explode. And so I think when you look over the time horizons that you're looking at, I'll come back to the answer I gave to one of the earlier questions, which is that the world is going to become more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. It's going to become more data-intensive, not less data-intensive, and it's going to become more device-intensive and these devices are going to be much more heterogeneous than they are today. All of that complexity is going to require a lot of services to manage and maintain, and I think we're very well positioned as that transition occurs. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Glenn Greene : Thank you. Good morning. I guess going back to BFS, the weakness there and it feels to me like it's largely client-specific both domestically and Europe. So I guess I'm just wondering about the line of sight toward improved growth, if the trends at those clients specifically change and how do you have line of sight to the improvement? And I'll just a follow-up question unrelated would be a little bit of color on the dramatic improvement in the attrition trends. I know you're at a comfortable rate as it relates to employee attrition. Francisco D'Souza: Hey. It's Frank. Let me talk a little bit about Financial Services and then maybe I'll ask Gordon to comment on employee attrition. So I would say that if you think about our Financial Services portfolio, the bulk of our Financial Services portfolio are clients that we've worked with over many, many, many, many years. And if you look historically at our performance in Financial Services, I think you'll see that our Financial Services performance and portfolio has delivered very consistent results and solid growth year-over-year sequentially over many, many quarters. The reason for that is that, I think, we've got great relationships with these clients. We tend to be very embedded with these clients as they plan their annual operating budgets and their annual operating plans, their project portfolios and so on and so forth. And they worked very closely with us as they're planning that to make sure that we have the capacity and the talent available to meet their demands. So we tend to have very good visibility with these clients. We knew a slowdown in Q1. We told you about the slowdown in Financial Services when we gave you our first look into the first quarter and that was a result of the fact that we had been given that heads-up in working with a lot of these clients. And as we've gone through the first quarter, we continue that process with them, we now feel comfortable that we've got visibility that we will return Financial Services to positive sequential growth for the rest of this year. So with that, Gordon, would you want to comment on attrition? Gordon James Coburn : Sure. So, Glenn, we had a spike in attrition last year and the spike lasted longer than we would've expected and had in prior spikes. And that's frustrating for us because Cognizant has this incredible culture, unique culture, our growth rates create tremendous opportunities for career advancement for our people and the nature of the work we're doing and our leadership in digital provides for really interesting work. So we redoubled our efforts on employee engagement. We are very clear to our employees, we share the company success with them, we paid out very healthy bonuses for 2015. We've rolled out our career architecture, so people can understand what does it take to move up in the organization so they can self-manage their career. We've improved rotational experiences, we've invested \u2013 we doubled down again in investment and training for our people. So I think what's happened is as people \u2013 as our employees have experienced what we've talked about and as we focused on it again, we've seen improvements, there's a little bit of seasonality in Q1 because of bonus payouts but clearly the trend is very much headed in the right direction and it comes down to \u2013 there are very few companies in the world that can provide the kind of career growth opportunities that Cognizant can for our employees. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa D. Ellis: Hi, good morning, guys. Following on, I guess the organizational question bent, can you comment on the comp plan changes you disclosed in proxy a few days ago? What the objectives are and behavioral change you're trying to drive there? And then also, from an organizational perspective, can you comment \u2013 we hear about the Horizons, and then we hear about Digital Works, and this front office, middle office, back office. Can you just clarify a bit kind of organizationally how you're structured to drive the shift and react to the shift in the marketplace? Gordon James Coburn : Sure. Lisa, let me comment on the comp changes and then Frank can comment on your second question. I'm assuming you're referring to the PSUs, so there are two things that are going on there. One is, historically, PSUs have been 100% revenue. We've now shifted that to a combination of revenue and earnings to balance it out a bit more and in line with what other companies are doing. The second thing is for the grants that we've issued in early 2016, we're moving to a two-year measurement period instead of a one-year measurement period. So what this does, it further differentiates the measurements on the annual bonus from the measurements for the PSUs and obviously the PSUs, then there's a fairly long tail afterwards before they actually vest. But we wanted to make sure that the incentives are in line with revenue and earnings and that they're multiyear. So it's more aligning to what others in the industry are doing. That's the primary purpose of that. Francisco D'Souza: And, Lisa, let me comment a little bit about how we're organized and how we're going to market. So I'll remind you that our primary access in going to market has been, for the better part of a decade maybe longer, the industry vertical. So we take everything to market through an industry vertical lens, we view that as being an incredibly important and significant part of our differentiation to have deep domain expertise around the industries that we serve and taking all of our services into a client through the industry lens. Behind the industry groups, we have essentially what you might think of as lines of service. The lines of service are \u2013 fall into different categories. These are the traditional services, the Horizon 2 services or rather the BPO IT infrastructure services and consulting and also the new digital services and all of these services go to market through the verticals. The three Horizon model is how we manage investments across the business, so both across verticals and the horizontals, if you will, the lines of service, we apply the three Horizon models to say how do we allocate capital, how do we make investments across both the verticals and the horizontals. And actually there's a third dimension which are the geographies in which we operate. So the three Horizon model is a very clear and crisp way for us to say across the three legs of our matrix, the verticals, the lines of service and the geographies in which we operate, how do we allocate capital to the places where we're going to get the best returns, where the growth potential is the best. And so three Horizons for us is less of an internal organizational construct. We don't have a Horizon 1, a Horizon 2 and a Horizon 3 organization. What we have is an investment model that follows the three Horizons and layers on top of the three vectors that I just talked about, which are the three legs of the matrix are the real organizational vectors, the verticals, the geographies and the lines of service. So I hope that clarifies it a little bit and I think that's our last question. Francisco D'Souza: So with that, let me thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

In addition to the traditional speakers on our earnings calls, Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer, we are delighted that Raj Mehta, CEO, IT Services, will join our calls beginning with this quarter. Raj is a long time key executive at Cognizant who leads our industries, geographies and delivery operations on a global basis. Adding Raj to the call will enable us to provide you with additional color on our operations and business opportunities. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q2 revenue was $3.37 billion, up 5.2% from Q1 and 9.2% from a year-ago and was within our guided range of $3.34 billion to $3.40 billion. Against the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment and market environment and a slow start to the year, we executed well last quarter and we continue to gain market share. The quarterly sequential dollar growth was one of the strongest in our history, as we added incremental revenues of almost $170 million. This performance represented broad-based growth across service lines, geographies and industries. As we had anticipated after a slow start in Q1, our financial services and healthcare segments turned in positive sequential growth in Q2. As we enter the second half of the year, we see certain macroeconomic factors as well as some softness in clients' discretionary spending that'll affect our revenue growth primarily from financial services and healthcare clients. Additionally, we anticipate a further negative revenue impact of approximately $40 million for the second half of the year due to the weakening of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote. For these reasons, we're revising our full-year revenue growth guidance to a range of $13.47 billion to $13.60 billion, while maintaining our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance within a range of $3.32 to $3.44. Gordon, Raj and Karen will expand more on the cyclical weakness that we are facing in the short-term. As you listen to their comments, I'd like to emphasize that the medium-term to long-term fundamentals of our business are strong. We continue to see significant market opportunity; and more importantly, gain market share. Digital transformation continues to be a strong driver for demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors, while innovating to create new areas of growth and differentiation. Given this context, we continue to invest in three strategic areas based on the conviction that true digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes throughout their organizations, from the front office through the middle office and to the back office systems. These three areas will provide the framework for how we think about growing our business going forward. The first strategic initiative is to help our clients build new frontend capabilities, enabled by digital technologies that create personalized experiences for their customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Clients recognize our strong digital capabilities, having called out the trend in SMAC over five years ago. We continue to see great success in building out our digital capabilities through investing organically as well as through select acquisitions. We just announced the acquisition of Idea Couture, which will become part of Cognizant Digital Works. As you will recall, Cognizant Digital Works brings together human insight, strategy, design, technology and industry expertise to create innovative solutions at enterprise scale to help clients succeed in this new digital economy. Idea Couture is a digital innovation firm that operates at the intersection of strategy and technology and specializes in designing and prototyping products, services, and business models for growth and competitive advantage. Idea Couture serves some of the largest firms in the world including Samsung, ConAgra Foods and Pepsi. This was our sixth investment in the digital space, building on prior acquisitions of Cadient, KBACE, itaas and Odecee, in addition to our recent strategic investment in ReD Associates. Collectively, we have deployed over $200 million in capital across these digital investments. The second strategic initiative is to drive new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the core transaction processing operations of our clients, by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process as a Service or BPaaS model that allows clients to shift from buying a service to buying an outcome. We've developed a number of platform-based solutions across our industry practices, and the result of these investments is best illustrated by our significant progress in the healthcare vertical, where we've been able to successfully combine TriZetto software with Cognizant's technology and operations capabilities. Since our TriZetto acquisition, we have signed several large platform-based deals with a combined TCV, or total contract value, approaching $2 billion, including the program at EmblemHealth that we spoke about last quarter. And we're pursuing a number of additional similar opportunities in the market. The third strategic initiative is to transform clients' existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT to help them harness the potential from digital technologies. This includes a simplification of how applications are developed and delivered along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost. We're making good progress in each of these areas, and we're confident that this framework will differentiate our services and solutions in the marketplace now and in the future. In closing, I'd like to emphasize that we've been through periods of market volatility in the past. While macroeconomic factors such as what we experienced this quarter are not within our control, we're confident that we will execute well through this cycle and continue to gain market share. So with that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss the current demand environment; to Raj to discuss our business performance; and then to Karen to provide more financial details. Gordon? Gordon James Coburn : Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance. First, as we indicated on our last two earnings calls, discretionary spending in the banking sector remained soft, weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and a prolonged low interest rate environment. While we did see a return to healthy sequential growth in the second quarter, we expect banking discretionary spending during the second half of 2006 (sic) [2016] to be slower than we anticipated three months ago. Complicating the situation, of course, is the uncertainty arising from the Brexit vote in the UK. Economic growth forecasts and short-term to medium-term interest rate projections have generally been revised down since the vote. Given this new development, we see the banking sector being more cautious in spending over the near-term, and therefore, we believe it is prudent to err on the side of caution in banking and financial services revenue planning for the remainder of this year. Second, the sharp weakening of the pound sterling will have a negative impact on our second quarter revenue of approximately $40 million, assuming the currency holds at current levels. As you know, the pound sterling has seen a 12% depreciation since the Brexit vote. Third, as we indicated to you at the beginning of this year, consolidation within the U.S. healthcare industry has impacted the revenue growth of our healthcare practice. Given the status of the M&A regulatory approval process, we anticipate that project spending will continue to slow for clients involved in these consolidations for the remainder of the year. Finally, we're also seeing customer pullback on discretionary spending in other pockets of our business. For example, some clients within our information services practice are taking a more moderate approach to spending as we go into the back half of the year. While we're taking a cautious approach to our revenue expectations for the remainder of 2016, we believe that the medium-term to long-term outlook for our business remains as strong as ever. The pipeline is healthy, and we continue to make investments in skills and capabilities that will help us meet our clients' evolving need to simultaneously run-better and run-different. I'd like to take a moment to outline three trends that are driving client demand and our optimism for the medium-term and long-term outlook for our business. You'll see that these trends are the basis for the investment areas that Frank described a few moments ago. First, in the shift to digital, there's a greater sense of urgency among CXOs to build new innovative models to drive revenue growth and create differentiation in the market. I see this in almost every client meeting I attend, regardless of industry. These conversations have evolved from a discussion of SMAC, which is now table stakes, to the exploration and execution in areas such as artificial intelligence, IoT ecosystems, augmented reality, adaptive manufacturing and blockchain, just to name a few. Digital is no longer about deploying new technologies. Rather, it's an integration of insights, strategy, design, technology and industry knowledge to create new capabilities that can distinguish a client in the market. We've invested heavily over the past several years in building true leading world-class digital capabilities, an achievement which has now begun to become well-recognized in the market. Second, there's a growing realization that there's a difference between doing digital and being digital. For example, clients understand that the mobile enablement of an enterprise app, while necessary, is not sufficient to take on digital disruptors in their industry. Digital transformation requires a fundamental change not just to clients' front office capabilities, but across their entire business and technology architectures in both their mid and back offices to create nimble, efficient and innovative ways to meet customer demands. Given the existing infrastructure investments of our enterprise clients, we believe that the winning model for many is a hybrid model, combining aspects of their heritage or legacy infrastructure with new digital technologies. This belief is core to our strategy going forward. Our intimate knowledge of core business and legacy infrastructure and business processes across our clients' mid and back offices, combined with our leading-edge digital capabilities, as required in the front office, give us a highly differentiated offering and value proposition in the market today. Finally, the drive for getting continued efficiencies from existing IT infrastructure to be able to fund innovation projects remains absolutely essential to almost every client. This in turn leads to a demand for more automation, simplified application development methods, process efficiencies, platform-based solutions and industry utilities. Our strong vertical presence and investments in building sharply focused industry-specific platforms allow clients to obtain these efficiencies by shifting from buying a service to buying an outcome. These trends will continue to open opportunities for us over the coming years. With that, let me now turn the call over to Raj to provide additional details on our business performance. Rajeev Mehta : Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to be here today and look forward to interacting more with the investment community going forward. Let me now provide some additional color on our performance across industries and geographies. Our banking and financial services segment was up 5.1% sequentially and 8.1% year-over-year. As expected, banking and financial services returned to positive sequential growth in Q2. Due to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low interest rate environment, we expect spending within banking to be sluggish during the second half of 2016 and revenue for our BFS segment to be up slightly sequentially for Q3 and Q4. Within our insurance practice, demand remains solid, particularly for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes and deliver greater efficiencies, increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, we've seen an increasing demand for solutions which help clients rationalize and transform their infrastructure landscape. Our healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients grew 4.9% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our healthcare payer practice. However, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment, as the industry embarks on a fundamental change in the business model. This is driven by the Affordable Care Act, and changing regulatory environment, consumerization of healthcare, and an increased focus on medical cost. In this rapidly changing environment, it is critical that payers have solutions in place that can both drive efficiencies and adapt to ongoing regulatory and technological changes. We're able to offer clients such solutions through our combined TriZetto software with Cognizant services. Last quarter, we spoke about a large healthcare deal that we launched with EmblemHealth, leveraging the TriZetto platform. This program continues to ramp up as expected. Moving on to our life science business, we saw strong demand in the quarter driven by a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as advanced data analytics. As drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, we expect this to drive demand in our life sciences practice. Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 4.4% sequentially and 14.2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in manufacturing and logistics. We're seeing growing demand for solutions, which leverage our ability to integrate multiple service lines as front-end digital technologies such as IoT are being scaled and integrated across the organization. We are building deeper partnerships with many of our manufacturing clients by proposing innovative solutions, which harness the power of data from connected products to help them optimize their product portfolios, addressing key business problems and driving sources of revenue growth. For example, our client one of the world's largest auto manufacturers is rolling out the deployment of telematics across all new cars by next year. As you know telematics tracks a variety of items relative to driving, including maintenance, driver safety and road emergencies. While the client is looking to enhance its relationship with its customers, they're also concerned with the risk associated with the rollout of this new digital technology at an enterprise scale. Cognizant will combine its design, technology and business process expertise to create a scalable solution that manages both customer satisfaction and helps to run the transaction processing and telematics operations efficiently. Additionally, we will leverage predictive analytics to anticipate issues and create valuable insight to support future product development. Our other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients was up 8.1% sequentially and 11.2% year-over-year, driven by both telecom and technology clients, as we continue to expand our range of services. Let me now quickly turn to our Horizon 2 services lines. Cognizant business consulting, infrastructure services and business process services. Our Horizon 2 strategy has worked with all three service lines having reached a critical mass at a combined $3 billion run rate and continuing to grow faster than the company average. These services are an integral part of the digital platform and next-generation IT solutions we are building out for our clients. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.1% sequentially and 8.3% year-over-year. Europe was up 4.1% sequentially and 8.9% over last year after a 2.9% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp-up of work with recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The UK grew 4% sequentially and 4.4% year-over-year and Continental Europe grew 4.4% sequentially and 15.5% over the prior-year. Finally, we saw continued traction in the rest of the world, which was up 10.8% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in the key markets such as Singapore, India and Australia. With that, I'll turn over the call to Karen. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $3.37 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of almost $170 million, or 5.2% sequentially. Revenue increased by 9.2% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of $25 million or 80 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 20.3%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb our compensation increases which will take effect during the third quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 was also above our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.82 due to a slightly lower tax rate and stronger operating margins. During the quarter, we executed a one-time remittance of cash from India to the U.S. and to other international markets. This will provide additional financial flexibility in funding our strategic investments to drive long-term growth for Cognizant. Let me provide you some additional color on this transaction. In May, our India subsidiary received approval to repurchase stock worth $2.8 billion from certain of its shareholders, which are non-Indian Cognizant entities. This repurchase resulted in a one-time remittance of $1 billion to the U.S. net of taxes, with the other $1.6 billion to other non-India overseas locations. This buyback also resulted in a one-time tax impact of $190 million in the second quarter with approximately $24 million incremental tax impact expected in each of the third and fourth quarters this year. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.31 per share impact on our Q2 GAAP EPS, but was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the non-recurring nature of this transaction. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.5% and 42.5% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 4.6% sequentially and 9.3% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 6.2% sequentially and 9.1% from Q2 a year-ago. During the second quarter, 37.6% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 315. We added 11,300 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 17.1% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 200 basis points from the year-ago period. Total head count at the end of the quarter was 244,300 employees globally, of which 229,400 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 79%, and on-site utilization was 91% during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by $30 million from the quarter ending March 31. In addition to a payment of $134 million for withholding taxes related to the aforementioned share repurchase of our India subsidiary, we also paid down the $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver during the quarter. Our cash and short-term investments, net of debt were up by $1.1 billion from the year-ago period. Moving on to receivables, which were $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74 days. This is flat with last quarter and up from 72 days in Q2 of 2015. Our unbilled receivables balance was $451 million, up from $432 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 55% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $909 million at the end of the quarter. There were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $360 million, financing activities raised $143 million use of cash during the quarter and capital expenditures were $75 million during the quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased just over 840,000 shares for a total cost of $50 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had repurchased 46.3 million shares for a total cost of $1.9 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. Our board of directors has approved an increase of the company's stock repurchase program by $1 billion, from $2 billion to $3 billion, and an extension of the program until December 31, 2018. This reflects our confidence in our business and our commitment to driving shareholder value. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full-year. In the weeks since Brexit, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rates and particularly the British pound, which has declined 12% versus the U.S. dollar since June 23 and 14% year-over-year. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not consider potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year. For the full-year 2016, we have revised our revenue expectations to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.60 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.47 billion. During the third quarter and for the full-year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.82 to $0.85. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a one-time incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 30.5%, including an approximate $24 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance. For the full-year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44. This guidance anticipates the full-year share count of approximately 610.2 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 36%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance. Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question only. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- tsin Huang : Thank you. The prepared remarks were helpful, but just wanted to ask about the outlook. I guess not surprised with the lower revenue outlook but it's the second cut here this year. What I wanted to ask, is the business just getting harder to predict for maybe secular reasons, or is the macro just getting really tough on some of your larger clients? Just trying to understand the secular versus the cyclical side of things. Gordon James Coburn : Tien-tsin, it's Gordon. It's a bit both. Certainly the macroeconomic environment has gotten tougher to predict, both \u2013 certainly the UK vote and not necessarily the direct impact but the indirect impact of a more sustained lower interest rate environment, was certainly a surprise to us and it would have been tough to predict, and it was a surprise to our banking and insurance clients, and you're seeing the impact on that. So that sort of thing is tough to predict. Obviously some of the uncertainty around the U.S. elections creates some uncertainty. In terms of structural things for us, the business, when you think about digital and so forth tends to be more \u2013 a little bit more project-oriented. But those are swings we go back and forth on. So, I wouldn't argue that there's any long-term structural change in the ability to predict the business. Short-term, there is a bit. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. Yeah \u2013 no, certainly, a lot of surprises going on. Just as a quick follow-up, just the repatriation of cash, is the priority there to buy back stock, or are there some larger acquisitions maybe you want to do in the U.S. or Europe? Karen McLoughlin : So, Tien-tsin, this is Karen. So, I mean I think as we've talked about, we do want to ramp up the volume of M&A, not necessarily large-scale deals, but certainly more transactions. And you've seen that with Idea Couture and our investment in ReD and so forth this year. So certainly, we will look to deploy that cash effectively, looking to use it to invest in growth for the business. Francisco D'Souza: And on share repurchases, as we said historically, our target is to maintain share neutrality. But we are also opportunistic depending on valuation of the stock. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks for the update. David Nelson : Operator? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane: Hi, guys. Karen, I know recently at some conferences, you stated that Cognizant is likely only to grow organically a max $1.5 billion in any given year. So, I guess that limits your top line growth rate as Cognizant gets larger. So trying to figure out what else you guys can do to grow EPS. Is it time to expand operating margins? Because essentially, I mean \u2013 we're only going to grow EPS at about 10% at top line so looking to grow that level, and then as we get larger, it's only going to get smaller. So, what are we going to offset that to be able to grow EPS? Is it margins or buybacks or what else can we do? Karen McLoughlin : So, Bryan, I think what we've been saying is, if you look historically, right, we've been averaging roughly $1.5 billion over the last several years. And that's true, if you look at all large services organizations, right. There aren't many organizations that have grown organically, consistently, more than $1.5 billion a year. Now that's not to say that there won't be years where you can and that's not to say that organizations can't do that. We've sort of been referring to what we've done historically. And particularly as people try to think about long-term growth rates and percentage growth, which obviously comes down over time due to the law of large numbers. I think, certainly we will look to continue to drive growth both organically and inorganically. As we've said, we clearly look to increase the volume of M&A transactions that we're doing. We continue to believe there's significant opportunity in the market for us to grow and continue to take market share. And certainly, at this point, we believe that the 19% to 20% non-GAAP operating margin that we've historically provided will continue to be an appropriate range for us. It gives us the flexibility to continue to grow the business, while maintaining a strong financial performance. Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Bryan, it's Frank. I'll just add to that and say that, I don't think there's anything inherent or magical about a $1.5 billion number, particularly given the structure and dynamics of our industry. If you think about our industry, it's highly fragmented. Nobody has a dominant market share. The ability to take share from each other, and not to mention the fact that technology overall in the economy is playing a much larger role, I think the growth opportunities are significant. So, I think you should look at the $1.5 billion as in the historical context, but I wouldn't necessarily use that as a rate limiter for our growth going forward. Bryan C. Keane: Okay. Frank, and just as a follow-up, you mentioned that you guys are taking share, but if I look at your growth rates for 2016, they do appear lower than peers. So, just want to make sure what you mean by that comment. Is that a going-forward comment, or is that something else you guys are looking at that says you guys are taking share? Thanks so much. Francisco D'Souza: I think it's important when you look at the taking share comment, to look at a couple things. First of all, over a long period of time, I think we have been taking share and if you look at the long-term trajectory as we continue to invest in the business, we create disproportionately larger growth opportunities for ourselves, which allows us to take share. I think looking at percentage growth rates is only one part of the equation, because that doesn't adjust for size of organization. I think a very interesting number to look at in that context is incremental dollars added. If you look for example, this quarter, we added close to $170 million of incremental revenue in the quarter. And so if you, in a sense, think about that as being a proxy for market share gain, I think it tells the story that supports our thesis, that we can continue to grow and take market share ahead of competition by investing in the business. David Nelson : Operator? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hey, Frank, Gordon, Karen, and welcome to the call, Raj. I want to talk about healthcare and the EmblemHealth deal that you announced, do you need additional regulatory approval to continue to ramp that? And I recall you had mentioned another similar deal in your pipeline. So, can you provide insight into that, as well as other deals that you may be looking at, in terms of forward growth trajectory? Gordon James Coburn : Ashwin, it's Gordon. Happy to answer both those questions. In terms of regulatory approvals, Emblem's really best positioned to discuss regulatory requirements for their business; but from our perspective, for the work we're doing for them, we've obtained all the necessary approvals to move ahead with our work. When we look more broadly at healthcare and end-to-end solutions, we're seeing a lot of interest in the market. And the reason why is, health plans are under tremendous pressure right now to keep rate reductions as low as possible. And we can really help them with that, with regulatory compliance, with not having to make investments on their own. So, we're seeing increasing interest as we roll out our healthcare platform-based solutions. We talked about the two big deals this year, one of them obviously we just discussed. The other one continues to move along. I think in terms of when it will close, that's probably towards the very end of the year. But since we talked last three months ago and I look at the pipeline of activities, that continues to increase very nicely, obviously that will be revenue for next year. But as we just recently sat down and did a review of our healthcare strategy and we concluded \u2013 we really have identified a market with the need in it, based on the changing dynamics in the industry and based on the unique capabilities that Cognizant has with a combination of the leading healthcare administration platform and just incredible domain expertise and technical expertise, so we feel really good about healthcare over the medium-term to long-term. Obviously, there are specific payers in the M&A process that are a headwind in the short-term. Ashwin Shirvaikar : And with regards to financial services, how much of your commentary has to do with specific dialog that you're having with your clients, that says that demand will be down versus your peers that demand could be down? And then is pricing a part of this discussion, as well? Rajeev Mehta : Yeah. Hi, Ashwin. This is Raj here. Look, financial services was, obviously, we had a good quarter in Q2, but we've guided for a slower growth in Q3 and Q4. And part of that is, as we discussed right, some of the low interest rate environment of Brexit, so we do have many of our larger clients looking at in terms of how do we continue to drive efficiency and optimization? So, I think it's actually a great opportunity for us, because it allows us to look at a greater percentage of the portfolio for our financial services accounts. It takes time to put all of these pieces together, but we think long-term that's a good opportunity for us to continue to drive synergies. But, more importantly, in the financial services sector, we're seeing great traction right now in digital, especially around customer experience and the data analytics behind that. In addition to that, many of our clients now are looking at the private cloud and we're helping many of these large financial services customers in that effort. So, longer-term, we're seeing good traction there. Francisco D'Souza: And Ashwin, I would just say that, to your question about speculation versus certainty, you have to remember that our model is, our people are on the ground with our clients in financial services and in all the other sectors every day, we have people on the ground, at the client sites day-in and day-out. And so, the feedback we tend to get, tends to be relatively real-time and it tends to be relatively or rather it tends to be based on real conversations and real feedback we're getting from clients as opposed to hypothesis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller : Thanks, guys. Given just the relatively high exposure to the financials and healthcare verticals, where it looks like most of the macro deceleration is coming from, and I guess sector-specific. When considering just an overview of your overall assets, is there anything that Frank or Gordon, you can say you point to strategically that may be able to help reduce volatility associated with year-over-year revenue in any given quarter? Francisco D'Souza: I think, Darrin, what I would say is, it's a great question. I would say that we continue to \u2013 I would say, if you look at the medium-term, the playbook is to really build out the three broad areas that I spoke about. Digital is a macro theme that I think has a lot of wind under its wings, I think we'll continue to invest organically and inorganically. The platforms business that I spoke about, we think there's a tremendous potential to take the success we've seen in healthcare to all of our other industries \u2013 all of the other industry groups that we serve. I would say that, the TriZetto experience has been ahead of anything that we would have imagined it to be. We've ramped up TriZetto faster than we anticipated when we did the acquisition and I think that gives us a sense of confidence that the model works, that we can execute against the model. So, there's opportunities to take that to other industries. And then, of course, the third area is so-called neXgen IT, where \u2013 as Raj said, we continue to feel like there's opportunities for us as our clients face tough macro environments for us to continue to optimize and bring new ways and innovative ways for them to be more efficient in how they run IT. So, that's where I think our focus is in the medium-term. If you look out over the very long run, clearly our objective is to continue to build out in the non-healthcare and financial services parts of the economy. So, if you look at our manufacturing and logistics business, that's been doing well. We'll continue to invest there both inorganically and organically, and I would say, over the very long run this business needs to have a reasonable representation of our revenue coming from the sources of global GDP. And so, we have to continue to shift the business model, but obviously that's not something that happens overnight. That's a five-year to 10-year journey. Gordon James Coburn : And Darrin, it's Gordon. Let me just add one more thought on that around platforms. As we ramp up our platform business, both within healthcare and into other industries, remember most of that, we're going to be bringing to market as a service, and this is core transactional work. So that over time will become a nice recurring revenue stream as it builds up. So, that's clearly part of our strategy as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex: Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could follow on to Tien-tsin's question regarding the repatriation of cash and prioritization of usage. Could you comment a little bit on M&A pipeline, and what that might look like? Certainly, we've seen the deals in the quarter and they seem to manage the limited cash in the U.S. And maybe as a follow-on to that, how much cash does this repatriation put into the U.S. as a percentage of total? Gordon James Coburn : Let me have Karen comment on how much cash in the U.S. And then, let's spend a few minutes talking about M&A pipeline and strategy. Karen McLoughlin : Yeah. So, Brian, the repatriation resulted in $1 billion net of tax coming back to the U.S. And as you remember, we at the end of Q1 had $300 million, $400 million in the U.S. that was available for operating needs. Gordon James Coburn : And from an acquisition perspective, our strategy remains consistent. We look at acquisitions for industry expertise, we look at acquisitions for geographic footprints and we look at acquisitions for service line and technology capability. We have a healthy pipeline of opportunities in the digital space. These will tend to be smaller tuck-under acquisitions. We also have a nice pipeline of opportunities in the consulting space across industries as well as strength in our geographic footprint, particularly in Europe. So, what I think you'll see is, you'll see a pickup in the pace of acquisitions; but I want to be clear, these continue to be small tuck-in acquisitions. We're getting really good at integrating these and capturing the value from acquisitions. We really have that down to a science now. So, we've expanded the team in these areas, but the core Cognizant growth will continue to be organic. But when we look at where acquisitions can supplement our capabilities to make us stronger in the market, we'll clearly do that. And the final thing just to comment on is platform acquisitions. There \u2013 we'll look at those absolutely. We did the TriZetto acquisition almost two years ago. And platforms \u2013 certainly you have to make sure if you're going to do a platform acquisition you get enough that you have a base to build off of. So, those probably won't be as consistent or steady, but we'll certainly look at opportunities because we know in particular areas we want to be a leader in platforms. Now some of that will be, we build it ourselves; some of it is, we'll partner with customers and take their systems and commercialize them and some like TriZetto will be, we'll go out and buy a leader in the market. So, you'll see all that happen, but certainly in the tuck-unders, you'll see a pickup in the pace. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa D. Ellis: Hi. Good morning, guys. The choppiness in the top line growth rate inevitably brings back in the more secular concerns around compression in IT services. So can you just describe, as you're having these strategic discussions with clients around the transformation they're trying to drive in their business, what are the implications for their overall IT budgets? Like up, down? And then also the component of budgets that they're expecting to be spending on services, like third-party services? Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Lisa. It's Frank. Let me try to take a crack at that. Look, I think we've seen no evidence that IT budgets overall are coming down. If anything, I would characterize IT budgets as flat to moderately up over time. There may \u2013 in some clients, as we've said in our prepared comments, there might be sort of short-term pressure, discretionary spending gets put off because of something going on in the macro. But as a big picture, I don't see any evidence that says that budgets are down. I would characterize them as flat to up. I think if you look inside of that and unpack it a little bit, there is a shift going on. We are seeing the clients looking to be more efficient, drive better total cost of ownership on what I consider to be the run-the-business kind of activities, so that they can redeploy them into the change-the-business or digital or cloud kinds of activities. I think that that shift benefits IT services firms, frankly. When you look at the landscape on digital, the technology landscape in digital is very fragmented. There are no clear leaders in digital right now in the technology landscape from an underlying stack standpoint, and so that requires almost every digital deployment to be \u2013 requires it to have very heavy integration kinds of work. And so, when you look at the digital landscape, there's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done both from an upfront strategy, design, human sciences standpoint to envision the future with the client; but then equally importantly on the downstream, build, integrate, test, deploy. All of that creates tremendous opportunities for services firms. So, I think that net-net, there's a shift going on. Budgets aren't shrinking meaningfully. There's a shift going on inside of budgets, and I think firms that have capabilities on both sides, the what we've been calling run-the-business and change-the-business or run-better, run-different sides of the business really stand to benefit from that migration. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Keith Frances Bachman : Hi. I would like to direct this question to Gordon, if I could. Gordon, and the question really surrounds run rate. This year, pursuant to guidance, you're guiding revenues to increase $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, just rough numbers. Current Street estimates for 2017 are increasing by almost $1.7 billion. And given the issues that you've identified surrounding healthcare, and unclear when those deals may or may not clear, and investment banking, I was wondering if you'd like to give any anecdotal or at least directional comment related to a $1.7 billion bogey. And the context is, it's occurred in the last few years where we've crossed over new year and sell-side estimates have proved to be too high. So, I just wanted to hear any \u2013 given the current issues that you see surrounding the business, would you like to give any directional comment, at least related to 2017, and current Street estimates? Gordon James Coburn : Keith, thanks for the question. It's just too early to know 2017. What are the things that'll influence revenue next year? Certainly, what happens with healthcare M&A, that's one piece. What happens with the interest rate environment for our financial services clients will be very important, because financial services clients know they have to spend a lot on innovation, but are under tremendous cost pressure right now; and that's both in insurance and banking. The pace of which we actually close these new end-to-end services deals will be important, and all those can be big drivers or big variables in revenue growth for next year. It's just too early to know. I think the election will have some impact, general macroeconomic trends and then some regulatory stuff. But as we've all mentioned, when we look at the medium-term and long-term prospects for the business, we remain very bullish. The strategy of looking to front, middle and back office and really building up our capabilities to serve clients across all three of those dimensions, I think is going to position us very well. But what will both overall macro spending look like and a couple specific customers' things look like for us for next year, just too early to know. Obviously, as we get more color, we'll share it with the investment community. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on your overall head count plans. You added a little over 11,000 this quarter, and it was a relatively strong head count add last quarter as well. Can you maybe talk about what you expect that to do for the remainder of the year? And just broadly speaking, what it reflects in terms of your pipeline of longer-term business? Thank you. Francisco D'Souza: Sure. So, utilization came down a little bit in the first quarter. That was intentional, we added, I forget, 10,000, 11,000 people in Q1 as well, even though revenue was down, because we wanted to position ourselves to make sure as client demand shifts a little bit, we have the capabilities as we finish up retraining our workforce. Certainly head count additions will slow in the back half of the year from the front half. We don't give specific head count guidance, but our goal would be to keep utilization in the ballpark that it currently is. And certainly that gives us enough bench capacity for potential ramp-ups and certainly for positioning ourselves for next year. You get a little bit of seasonality quarter-to-quarter, just because of the timing of bringing college kids in and so forth. But the way I think about it is, we're managing utilization to be fairly constant with where it currently is. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Bergin: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to kind of expand on the other vertical pullback that you cited within information services. Is that broad-based or more limited to a handful of clients? Thanks. Rajeev Mehta : Yeah. Hi, Bryan. This is Raj. So, it's limited to a handful of clients. Basically, some of those clients reevaluating in terms of some of the discretionary spend that they have. We feel still very optimistic about those clients, because we're having broader conversations in terms of, how do we look at the broader platform and to continue to drive some of the cost optimization that they need. But overall, the industry for us is still quite bullish for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Amit Singh : Hi, guys. This is Amit Singh for Jason. Just on the cash repatriation, considering the historic low interest rates that are going on right now, why repatriate cash and pay taxes on it, versus just raising debt over here? And also just related to that, sort of the timing of the repatriation. If you look at your full-year guidance, I don't think you're modeling a lot of share buyback, considering too what you were expecting last quarter, so a lot of M&A, should we expect that to happen over the next couple of quarters, using most of the cash that you repatriated? Karen McLoughlin : So, Amit, this is Karen. The repatriation was a one-time opportunity. There was an opportunity that closed as of June 1, so we had a time limit as to when we were able to do that and we wanted to obviously take advantage of that opportunity to repatriate cash in a relatively tax-effective way. From India, as you know, it's typically very expensive to do that and we don't get many opportunities, so we certainly want to take advantage of that. And I think as we've mentioned, the guidance assumes that we maintain essentially share neutrality which has been our stated position recently. Obviously, if there are opportunistic opportunities to buy back shares, we will take advantage of that. But clearly, we look to use that cash net additional flexibility to drive investment in the business, both organic and inorganic. Francisco D'Souza: And it's also important to remember, the question has been focused on cash brought back to the U.S. Additional cash was also brought back to non-India locations, which is more advantageous for us, both in terms of efficiently doing non-U.S. acquisitions and if there's ever any sort of repatriation holiday in the future. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen... David Nelson : And, operator, this will \u2013 operator, this will be the last question. Operator : Due to time constraints, our final question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Foresi : Hi. I was wondering, could you talk about in this particular quarter, the breakdown of the revision of guidance between some of those concerns that are out in the market, which include obviously healthcare, the banking sector and discretionary spending. Because it seems like the FX was maybe a minor part, and then I've got just one follow-up. Gordon James Coburn : Sure. As we said, the FX impact of the revision guidance was $40 million of the change. When you look at the other pieces, it overlaps a bit, right. Certainly, the single biggest impact was our financial services segment. Whether it's the Brexit vote or the general macroeconomic environment, it's tough to parse that and the low interest rate environment, but certainly our forecast changed the most in that sector. And after that, the next one would be healthcare with some of the regulatory approval issues that are going on right now for M&A. And then the little things are out there. The other thing we wanted to make sure is that when we adjust the guidance, we learned a little bit last quarter, you don't want to keep adjusting, so we want to make sure we adjusted it enough that we're well positioned for any additional surprises that may happen because of uncertainty around the elections, Brexit and so forth, so we want to be conservative when we cut, so we cut just once, or at least just this one additional time. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then just as you look at kind of heading into 2017 and beyond, I guess the question for investors are, how much of this is a short-term 2016 phenomenon versus what we've seen over the last couple of years with the changes in the way that you've given guidance, and now, of course, today's cut. So, maybe you could just talk about your outlook briefly heading into next year, and help us understand how this is a short-term thing versus a long-term? Francisco D'Souza: Hey, Joe. It's Frank. Maybe I'll try to take that. And I'll answer it \u2013 obviously, as Gordon said earlier to one of the earlier questions, it's premature for us to comment specifically on 2017; but what I will say is that, we continue to remain very optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and of our business. From an industry standpoint, as I said many times, the key I think factor to look at is that the world is becoming more technology-intensive not less technology-intensive. Across the industries we serve and also industries where we are less present, more energy and attention is being focused on technology than ever before. Technology has become not just a way of driving efficiency and operational effectiveness for businesses, but it's become a core to most clients' ability to differentiate, to grow revenue and to survive in the marketplace. So, given that backdrop, we feel that there's a tremendous opportunity for IT services, in general, and for Cognizant, in particular. Given the tremendous investments that we've been making. We feel that the investments that we've made in digital on the frontend, process and platforms in the middle office, and our next-generation IT services in the backend, really position us well. And I'll just finish by saying that we feel that the portfolio of businesses that we have, whether you look at the industry portfolio or the exposure we have in different geographies of the world, represent some of the most progressive and advanced users of digital technologies. And so, we feel that the fundamentals remain strong as we look to the medium-term. Francisco D'Souza: So on that note, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. Thank you very much for your questions. And as always, we all look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2016 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q filed this morning. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth across all of our industries. This was encouraging given the weakness in the pound sterling and the softness we've seen this year in our Financial Services segment stemming from macroeconomic concerns and in our Healthcare payers segment due to industry consolidation. Turning to guidance, we're trimming the high end of our full-year revenue expectation and now expect our revenue to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion. This guidance include the absorption of an incremental $18 million negative impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. We're tightening our full-your non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $3.38 to $3.41. I'll talk more about the business in a moment and why we're well positioned going into 2017. I'd like to take a moment to update you on the internal investigation we announced at the end of September. The investigation is focused on payments relating to permits for certain company-owned facilities in India and whether such payments were made improperly and a possible violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws. First, I think it's important to note that we do not anticipate any impact on our ability to continue to provide the quality services our clients expect from us. Second, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q we filed this morning, we've identified approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments to-date. We've evaluated the effect of such payments and concluded that they are not material and do not require a restatement of our historical financial statements. Karen will provide additional details on this in a few minutes. Third, and also disclosed this morning, we discovered in the course of the investigation that certain members of senior management may have been aware of or participated in the matters under investigation. Any such conduct would be inconsistent with our core values. Based on the results of the investigation to-date, those who may have been involved are no longer with the company or in the senior management position. Finally, I would like to reaffirm our strong commitment to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We voluntarily disclose the matters under investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in September, and we've been fully cooperating with both agencies. Based on the results of the investigation to-date, we have already started and will continue to enhance our internal controls and compliance programs. Let me now turn to the rest of the business. Today and moving forward, what remains most essential to Cognizant's success is our unwavering focus on our clients. Their changing needs are the inspiration for our strategy, and we are actively executing that strategy. As we look ahead, we believe our market opportunity has never been greater. That's because with more technology in every product built and behind every customer experience and more data generated at every turn, our clients' businesses are and will continue to become increasingly technology-intensive. Our opportunity then is to work with these clients to help them win by making the fundamental technology-enabled changes throughout their organizations that are required for them to compete in this new technology and data-intensive world. We have spoken to you in past calls about our three strategic initiatives designed to enable this kind of work across our clients' businesses from front to back. We recently took an important step in executing this strategy by aligning and branding all our capabilities into three practice areas, Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations, and Cognizant digital systems and technology. Our Cognizant digital business practice works with clients to reshape their products and business models and the resulting impact on how organizations interact with their customers, employees, and partners. Our approach combines data science, design thinking, and deep industry and process knowledge with solid technology capabilities to unite the physical and virtual aspects of a company's offering seamlessly across every channel. Together, we identify insights, develop business strategies, and design prototype and scale meaningful experiences. Our Cognizant digital operations practice helps clients reengineer, digitize, manage, and operate their most essential business processes, lowering operating costs, improving user experience, and delivering better outcomes and top line growth. Across the practice, we are creating automated data-driven platforms and industry utilities. We help clients run better by applying traditional optimization levers, and we help them run differently by creating competitive advantage through process excellence which often leads to more effective operating models and corresponding top line revenue growth. And our Cognizant digital systems and technology practice works with clients to simplify, modernize, and secure IT infrastructure and applications, unlocking the power trapped in their technology environments. We help client create and evolve systems that meet their needs in the modern enterprise by delivering industry-leading standards of performance, cost, and flexibility. Now, the names of these practice areas reflect our belief that digital technology must be embedded as an integral part of all our offerings. All three practice areas work in close partnership with our vertical and geographic businesses and with Cognizant Business Consulting to ensure tight alignment and market relevance. Let me underscore how central this is to what differentiates Cognizant. When we say digital, we're not talking just about building user interfaces or implementing digital marketing, but about creating industry-specific solutions woven deeply into the workings of an organization to create new levels of value enterprise-wide. In summary, our clients are finding it unique and differentiating that Cognizant can consult with them to build digital businesses, operations, and systems. For example, we're helping insurance companies go beyond managing claims to preventing losses with the power of predictive analytics. We're working with healthcare companies to bring payers, providers, and patients together on an integrated platform that reduces waste and improves health outcomes. And we're helping manufacturers evolve from using stand-alone goods to orchestrating entire ecosystems of smart connected products. But as much as we're focused on the opportunities of today, looking ahead of evolving clients' needs is one of Cognizant's core strength. We continue to develop innovative products and services, part of what you've heard us refer to as our Horizon 3 capabilities, through an internal investment program that powers long-term growth opportunities for Cognizant and our clients. First, the Cognizant Global Technology office identifies the emerging technologies with the potential to create real business value. Then, Cognizant Accelerator scales the most promising technologies, productizing services, solutions, and business models and speeding them to market. Together, these teams have spearheaded our entry into SMAC and IoT for example. And today, they are working to realize the potential of developing technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and to incubate new IT-based offerings. As we planned for 2017 and beyond, in addition to continuing to scale our comprehensive services portfolio, we're expanding our vertical and geographic focus as well. We're seeing increased traction with clients across Continental Europe, Asia-Pacific and the public sector who are finding our comprehensive capabilities unique in their markets. In closing, it's clear that today our clients realize digital should be an enterprise-wide endeavor and that they need a comprehensive partner like Cognizant, capable of working across every aspect of the organization that technology should enrich : business, operations and systems. Let me now turn the call over to our new President, Raj Mehta. On our last earnings call, we introduced you to Raj, a long-standing Cognizant leader. He's been a Cognizant associate since 1997, building strong relationships with clients throughout his 20 years at Cognizant, and leading many of our market-facing and delivery teams in driving industry-leading growth. Now, as President, he has direct responsibility for the overall P&L of Cognizant's operations. Raj will talk to you about the success we're already having in executing our strategy from his perspective running these businesses. Raj? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad to be here and honored to be taking the role of President at this important time in Cognizant's journey. Anyone who has followed the company over the years knows that we stand for three things : our relentless focus on our clients; making sure we have a world-class teams that deliver consistently for them; and scaling our capabilities to address new client needs. I know we're succeeding when clients tell me that working with us feels different. As we help clients with the shifts they need to make in the digital era, I'm doubling down on the principles that have made us successful, so far; client focus, world-class teams, and scaling capabilities while maintaining our flexible, collaborative way of working. In working closely with clients across our industry businesses, we see that we face many of the same underlying challenges. They need to deliver the convenient experiences people expect today across their complex organizations. They need to develop an operational agility to respond to fast-changing business needs. They need to free up dollars to invest in innovation and transformation by optimizing and modernizing their legacy IT systems. It's these challenges that are practices Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technologies are focused on, helping clients answer. Working closely with Cognizant Business Consulting and domain experts from our industry businesses, we're creating frameworks, platforms, and solutions that clients are finding valuable as they pursue next-level savings and new revenue streams. Now, I'll review the performance of each of our industry verticals, highlighting key trends and some of the areas we're focusing on with our clients. Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 7.1% year over year. During Q3, the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low-rate interest environment that we have commented on throughout 2016 continued to moderate spending at several of our larger banking clients. Our super-regional banking businesses continue to perform well as many of those clients look to us for solutions which both optimize cost and generate revenue. While we've seen a slowdown in spending in recent months with several of our insurance clients who are also pressured by the low interest rate environment, demand has remained solid over the past year. Clients have been particularly interested in Cognizant digital operations solutions that transform underwriting and claims processes through managed services or other outcome-based delivery models. Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, grew 3.5% sequentially and 5.7% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of the largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our healthcare payer practice. Still, we remain positive that the fundamental shifts under way in the market will create long-term opportunities. Through solutions from our Cognizant digital operations practice that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant services, we are well positioned to help clients deal effectively with this disruption. In our life sciences business, demand has picked up steadily over the past year as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In particular, we're seeing a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging analytics, cloud technologies, and platforms. Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 2.8% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Strength in manufacturing helped to offset ongoing softness in retail. A number of retail clients have moderated their discretionary spending over this past year as consumer spending has been weak. Cognizant digital business has seen growing demand among manufacturing clients who want to help in transforming the products they make through sensors, IoT, and analytics. They are also looking for solutions that increase the productivity of core IT infrastructure and application services. Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.7% sequentially and 13.6% year-over-year. Last quarter, we highlighted that macroeconomic uncertainty was causing a slowdown in decision making for our information, media, and entertainment clients. This has largely been offset by a rebound in our communications business. Let me give you a few examples how Cognizant is partnering with clients in engagements that are pivoting their businesses and shifting their industries in meaningful ways. Let's talk first about KeyBank. Cognizant has partnered with KeyBank on a variety of different initiatives over the past 10 years, assisting in significant projects like the recent integration of their acquisition of First Niagara Bank. Today, KeyBank wants to leverage digital to compete and lead in their category, and they started that journey with Cognizant. We are working together to simplify the way they do business and offer their customers streamlined experiences, financial wellness tools, and digital product offers and services. Cognizant is helping with implementation of a transition to the Oracle Banking Platform. As part of our work, we're helping in delivering improved digital experiences on web and mobile interfaces, reengineering business processes, and enabling new technology architecture for the banks' retail digital channel. This retail digital channel modernization is the first wave of the transformation, but we'll expand the use of this platform to manage other core processes and to deliver new differentiated services to customers within the coming year. Let me tell you about another project we're doing in the manufacturing space, helping a top five auto manufacturer change what people expect from their cars. As sales and developed markets plateau, our client is looking to serve new needs of their customers by offering a range of transportation services and solutions. We are their strategic partner helping to develop their strategy and user experiences and to build a platform that will be the backbone of an evolving new ecosystem of offerings. While this platform will initially focus on areas such as parking, vehicle health, and retail and awards program, the data captured by their platform will eventually be used to model how people will move differently in the future. We will work with our client to develop this and other potential opportunities to expand the services that they offer to their customers. Finally, I would like to highlight a growing part of Cognizant digital systems and technology where our deep knowledge of client legacy environments enable us to modernize their IT by migrating to cloud-based solutions, utilizing providers such as AWS. A couple of recent examples. We recently worked with LexisNexis to develop a cloud-based solution on AWS that supports search capabilities on a database of over 2 billion searchable documents on their news archive platform. For Sotheby's (18:39), we migrated their critical business applications including their flagship website from on-premise data center to AWS. For both clients, this is a major step forward towards the modernization of their IT infrastructure. In future calls, you'll continue to hear more from me about what Cognizant and our clients are focusing on together, how we're building world-class teams to serve them better, and how we're scaling our capabilities to meet changing needs. Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial performance. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $24 million or approximately 70 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $42 million or 130 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.3% within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 was $0.01 above our guidance range of $0.82 to $0.85. As a reminder, the remittance of cash from India to the U.S. that occurred in the second quarter had an incremental tax impact of $24 million in quarter three and is expected to have a similar impact in the fourth quarter. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.04 per share impact on our Q3 GAAP EPS that was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of the transaction. Before I provide a detailed commentary on the quarter's performance, let me provide some additional color on the ongoing internal investigation, which is being overseen by our Audit Committee. As Frank noted, based on the results of the investigation to-date, we are not restating our historical financial statements. At present, the investigation has identified a total of approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments for certain company-owned facilities in India. Of that amount, based on the preliminary results of the investigation to-date and as disclosed in our Form 10-Q and earnings release, we determined that it was appropriate at this time to record an out-of-period correction of $3.1 million related to certain of these payments. Also, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q, we announced a determination of a material weakness as of December 31, 2015 and the subsequent interim period. As based on the results of the investigation to-date, certain members of senior management may have participated in or failed to take action to prevent the making of potentially improper payments by either overwriting or failing to enforce the controls established by the company relating to real estate and procurement principally in connection with permits for certain facilities in India. We have already taken and continue to take remediation measures in the areas of procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in India. Now turning to third quarter performance. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.4% and 42.6% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 2.4% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 2.6% sequentially and 10.3% from Q3 a year ago, driven by strength across digital operations and the infrastructure portion of Cognizant digital systems and technology. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 3.3% sequentially and 7.9% year-over-year. Europe declined 1.7% sequentially after a 4.4% negative currency impact and grew 5.6% from last year after an 8.3% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp of work coming from recent wins particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The UK declined 5.7% sequentially and 2.3% year-over-year after a 7% and a 13.9% negative currency impact, respectfully. Continental Europe grew 3.5% sequentially and 17% over the prior year. We have established a solid foothold on the continent and expect this to continue to be a driver of future growth. Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 3.8% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year. During the third quarter, 37.5% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 322. We added 11,500 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 16.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 350 basis points from the year-ago period. While attrition remained slightly elevated, we are pleased with the year-over-year decline as we continue to enhance our various employee engagement initiatives. Total head count at the end of the quarter was 255,800 employees globally, of which 239,500 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates in our training program, was 79%, and on-site utilization was 90% during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was up by $390 million from the quarter ending June 30 and up by $861 million from the year-ago period. Moving on to receivables which were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 74.5 days. This is roughly flat with the last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $424 million, down from $451 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 58% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October, and the decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $900 million at the end of the quarter, and there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $594 million. Financing activities were a $119 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were $74 million during the quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $145 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.5 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q3, we had repurchased 48.8 million shares for a total cost of $2 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $3 billion, we had approximately $1 billion remaining unutilized. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. For the full-year 2016, we are trimming the high end of our revenue expectations to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.51 billion including $18 million of incremental negative currency impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice, and fewer billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth. During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.88. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 609 million shares. For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.38 to $3.41. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 609.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 35%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance. Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thank you for releasing your 10-Q. Could you talk a little bit about the Financial Services vertical? And how much of the Q3 and particularly Q4 pace of business is sort of unique to this year and unique to the current challenging environment for your clients? And how much of it may be more secular in nature? Thank you. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. Hey, Edward. This is Raj Mehta here. Look, we've talked about Financial Services in terms of some of the macroeconomic trends, especially around the low-rate interest environment. But I think it's important to note, it's not just banking, but it's across many of our industries we serve that technology is becoming more intensive to our clients, and our clients are becoming more dependent on technology and the data to compete. We continue to believe that the benefits of outsourcing, including the ability to attract talent, scale efficiently and bring deep technology and domain knowledge, have not changed, and the benefits clients can \u2013 they can't replicate that on their own. So \u2013 in summary, right, the range of skills that are required, and the technology is broadened and not narrowed, and we're still very looking forward in terms of continuing to growing these businesses in that respect. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the FCPA update and the materiality stuff there. So, has the FCPA issue had any impact on the client side and on the investigation itself, what needs to happen from here for the issue to be resolved? Could there be any additional costs to remedy the internal controls, for example? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hey, Tien-Tsin. It's Frank. Look, I would say, it's business as usual in terms of serving clients at this point. As I said, we expect no impact on our ability to provide high-quality services to clients, and in fact, haven't seen any. The fundamentals are we've got great associates doing good work every day on behalf of our clients, and I think our clients recognize that. The investigation is ongoing. I don't want to speculate on how long it's going to take or the costs that may be associated with it going forward, but our commitment is to conduct a thorough investigation and we're committed to doing that. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment at least on the Healthcare vertical. You've had some pretty large customers there that have throttled back on spending all year. Any conversations with them that might indicate the tenor or demeanor of their spending in the next year, should those investigations be resolved? I understand they're right around the corner, so I don't know what their spending intentions are or if you'd talked to them with regard to contingency plans one way or the other. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah, it's Frank. Let me try to take a stab at that. Look, I think the Healthcare business at Cognizant \u2013 before I talk about the specifics, let me just back this up, right. I think that Healthcare particularly as it relates to the Healthcare payers is really a core area of deep, deep strength at Cognizant. It has historically been one of our strongest verticals and with the addition of the capabilities from the TriZetto acquisition, I think it further strengthened our position there. The combination of Cognizant's services capabilities with TriZetto's platform capabilities has enabled us to create a truly unique platform-based offering in that marketplace, and we continue to see good traction in services and solutions that combine TriZetto's software and Cognizant's core services capabilities. The pipeline of opportunities around that area remains robust, and I continue to be optimistic about the opportunities there. Offsetting that, as we've said to you over the course of this year, is some slowness in the spending from the biggest payers who are particularly the ones that are involved in the potential large combinations. It's a little too early to forecast what happens with those payers as we go into 2017, but as a general matter, I would say that we have seen them slow spending, discretionary spending, through this period of uncertainty. And so, as though situations get resolved one way or the other, my expectation is that we have a great portfolio of services to offer that group of customers, and we will be as relevant if not more relevant than we've ever been to serving those needs of those customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about Cognizant Business Consulting? Just an observation that many of the winners, so far, in digital have been some of the very high-end private consultancies. And I'm curious to know, kind of I know you've got Cognizant Business Consulting, kind of what you're doing to continue to develop that business as well as how you're seeing demand for digital evolving and whether it's kind of moving beyond kind of the high-end consulting tip of the spear and into more, I'd say, mainstream IT services at this point. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. Hey, Lisa. It's Frank. Let me try to address that. So, let me start with the three practice areas that we discussed on the call today. We've refocused and rebranded our offerings under these three broad practice areas. Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations, and Cognizant digital systems and technology. And it's not an oversight that the word digital appears in all three of the practice names. The reason is that as we've said to you for quite some time now, our core and fundamental belief is that digital technology is really embedded in all areas in all aspects of our business in some way, shape or form. And so, Cognizant digital business uses digital technologies to create and deliver meaningful business experiences for clients. Cognizant digital operations uses digital technology to enable and automate core business operations in our clients' core transaction processing areas. And then, of course, Cognizant digital systems and technology is focused on modernizing, securing, and scaling legacy technology environment. Digital exists in all those places, and to your question about CBC or Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Business Consulting is really an enabler across all three of those practice areas. The Business Consulting capability is woven in across all of those three practice areas, and really a lot of the work that we are doing today in Cognizant Business Consulting is what I consider to be tip of the spear kind of work that then leads to downstream work in one or more of those three big practice areas. We've clearly seen digital move beyond just high-end consulting to implementation. Raj, for example, spoke in his prepared comments about the work we're doing to migrate \u2013 that we've done to migrate two big clients to a cloud-based AWS environment, that's an example of sort of what I think of as core technology work that's enabled by new digital technologies, and like that across all the practices we're seeing, not just tip of the spear consulting work, but also downstream implementation work that relates to digital. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Just wanted to ask about the impact of business due to departure of former President, Gordon Coburn, any big reaction out of clients? And then just secondly quickly, Karen any impact to the non-GAAP tax rate due to the internal investigation? Thanks so much. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Let me talk about Gordon's departure. I would say that Raj has been a Cognizant veteran for 20 years. Raj has run most of the business operations of the company, the business development, front-end sales and also the delivery operations for several years now. And so, I would say the transition has been seamless. Raj is supported by a very strong team of Cognizant veterans who have been around the company for many, many years. And so, I would say that transition has been seamless. Our platforms business or what we are now referring to as Cognizant digital operations business reports to me at this point, I have direct oversight on that part of the business. And let me turn it over to Karen on the tax rate question. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Sure. So, Bryan, there was certainly no impact on the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter based on the investigation. So during the quarter, there were two things that happened related to the investigation, we talked about the out-of-period adjustment of $3.1 million that we've recorded. And then, obviously we had some professional fees in conjunction with the investigation that's ongoing, but those were recorded both in our GAAP and in our non-GAAP financial statements. The tax rate did come out a little bit lower than we expected for the quarter, but that was just based on the settlement of some discrete items in the quarter. Nothing to do with the investigation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. I understand digital can be seen across the business, but just given how much of a driver it is now, is there any way to quantify the actual percentage of your revenue you'd consider digital and kind of what the growth rate is relative to what we've seen in some of your competitors? And then, just for Karen, can you just revisit the strategy again over margins, the stability of margins and the capital return strategy around potential buybacks, given \u2013 in light of what's now a somewhat slower top line trend? Thanks, guys. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Sure. So, Darrin, I'll take both of those. So, on the first one, on digital, as we've talked about, and I think we demonstrated in our conversation today around the script, right, we think that digital is becoming really an enterprise-wide initiative. And as we've said, we think that the definition of digital and how people think about digital revenue will continue to evolve in the coming months and quarters. And so, we have been reluctant frankly to define digital because we don't think there is a clear digital definition across the industry today. And we've talked about this notion of digital, started in the front-office and now has increasingly moved to the mid-office and the back-office, and hence, the alignment of our three practices that we talked about around digital business, digital operations, and digital systems and technology, which I think starts to get at that notion that it really has become an enterprise-wide initiative for both clients and ourselves. And increasingly, we think it will impact all of the segments of the business. In fact, it already is today. So, we have been reluctant to break out what's digital because how do you define a project, whether it's got a digital component to it or is the entire project digital? So, I think those definitions in the market will continue to evolve, and we'll continue to focus on that. I think in terms of margins, clearly, we have talked about staying in the 19% to 20% range. We have done that historically, and I think certainly for the foreseeable future, people should expect that that is a comfortable range for us to operate in. Obviously, it gives us room to make investments to grow the business. Those investments continue to shift as we look at more platforms, as that business continues to expand, as we continue to expand new skill sets and new offerings to support the digital marketplace. Those are most of the investments that we continue to focus on, but I think from a modeling perspective, you should expect us to stay in the 19% to 20% range. From a capital allocation perspective, there's really no change in our strategy there. I think as we said in the past, people should expect that over the course of a year, we will essentially maintain share neutrality. We have the buyback program available to us, and we will use that as and when we think it's appropriate to do that, and obviously, we demonstrated that with the number of shares that we bought back in Q3. And we still have about $1 billion left under that program as we look forward into Q4 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Given the Q4 growth rate you're guiding to implicitly in around 8% or so, can you kind of give us a sense about based on the backlog of business you see heading into say Q1 or in the beginning of 2017, whether you see that as a kind of a sustainable growth rate at least in the short term given some of the pressures near term that you mentioned before? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Jim, this is Karen. I think it's premature to comment on Q1 or 2017. Clients are just getting under way with their budgets, and so we will obviously work with them on those budgets as we get further into this quarter. And when we release earnings and provide full-year guidance in February, we'll provide an update at that time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. I want to ask a question, Frank, similar to past question. But if I look at Wipro, Infosys, TCS, and Cognizant both for the reported results of September and guidance and Street numbers for December, it suggests that the industry is growing around 8%. And part of that, ADM is growing less than 5%. And so, as we begin to reflect on calendar year 2017, I'm wondering what's different as we look at 2017 that's going to allow Cognizant to grow at something better than 8%. And part of the question is driven by for the past number of years, probably five years, Cognizant has provided guidance for a full calendar year that's below the Street expectations. So, Frank, I was wondering if you wanted to make any comments on the industry. And the second part of that is how willing would you be, Frank, to pursue M&A that would pressure margins in order to capture some incremental revenue growth? Thank you. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hi, Keith. So, there were a number of \u2013 I think a number of questions, and I will try to get to each of them. I would say that at a macro level, our industry is one \u2013 well, first of all, the world continues to become more technology and data intensive. So, that's sort of the 50,000 foot view. Technology is becoming more complex to implement the skill set, as Raj pointed out in his I think Q&A a minute ago, we have a much broader range of skills that are required to implement new technologies today. And so, we believe that that makes services firms like Cognizant as relevant if not more relevant than we've been in the past. It's also a fragmented industry, so the opportunity to gain market share and the opportunity to capture markets is very much there. And we believe that if you drill down further that when you look at our footprint of industries that we serve, if you look at the footprint of geographies that we currently operate in, there remain significant growth opportunities in places where we are underpenetrated. And so, when you put all of that together, we believe that we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us, that our ability to invest to capture those growth opportunities exists in the company with our financial formula, and so that forms a core thesis and a core basis for how we think about the business going forward. As it relates to acquisitions, we've said that we will continue to focus. We have a robust M&A program. We look at traditionally smaller tuck-in acquisitions. That's been the primary focus. We will continue to do that. I would expect that as we go forward, you'll see us focus on those kinds of acquisitions. I would expect that we would be more focused on digital and making digital acquisitions as we look to the next few quarters to bolster our digital capability. I think we've got good strong digital capabilities, but particularly as we look to new industries and geographies, I think you'll see us using inorganic means to grow faster there. Typically, when we do small acquisitions, the margin profile of those companies may not be where the Cognizant margin profile is, but through our ability to largely keep to cross-sell their services into our core business, we're rapidly able to bring them to Cognizant average margins. And so, I expect we'll continue to do that. For the small tuck-ins, if there's an acquisition that, when we buy it not at Cognizant margins, I'm not too concerned about that because we've shown that we can bring those back up to Cognizant levels through our ability to cross-sell. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. I wanted to come at the digital question a little differently. Maybe you can give us some color on how you're measuring success in that business internally and how you're staffing for it. I think the Street has heard some others frame their exposure, and it would be helpful just to be able to measure how you stack up or to have a little bit more information so we can understand your positioning in that business. Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: I think the primary measure that we are using \u2013 Joe, it's Frank \u2013 is what portion of our existing client base is engaging us on digital capabilities in some way, shape or form. Now, as Karen said, there's a question of how we define digital. What we are doing is looking at our newest service offerings and making sure that as our clients define digital \u2013 and each of our clients define digital in a slightly different way \u2013 that we are engaged with them in their most important and strategic engagements. That's always been the way that we've defined success at Cognizant. We define success really through the eyes of our customers, and our primary goal is to make sure that with our customers that we are engaging with them in the technology-driven, technology-enabled initiatives that are most important to them at any given point in time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Frank, I want to go back to a previous response that you'd given where you kind of said that the ability to provide high-quality services continues and so on, but that really has never been in doubt. I think maybe the real question is, are there clients who are sort of in a wait-and-see mode because of the ongoing investigation, because they maybe want some sort of an external approval of your processes and so on. Are you seeing any impact from the client side? And is that potentially \u2013 because I haven't heard you mention the ability to add $1.5 billion of revenue next year, which you've mentioned the previous couple of calls, perhaps at least in the last call. Could you comment on those? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: I would say, Ashwin, that we haven't, as I said \u2013 let me be more specific. We haven't seen clients beyond what I would consider to be the normal course of business slowing down in any way. I would say that it's a little too early to look at 2017 as we've said. And so, I don't want to be providing a view of 2017. As Karen mentioned, right now, we want to get through our clients' budget cycles. Those are just beginning as you know. That's been our traditional pattern. There's no difference from prior years, and once we get through that process, I think we'll be in a better position to give you a sense of where 2017 lands. I think we'll be looking at Financial Services and Healthcare in particular as we go into 2017 since those were the two industry groups that for reasons that we've discussed with you at length, didn't perform as we would have liked this year, and so we'll be looking to those as we go into 2017. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. I guess, it relates to the full-year guide. You obviously lowered the high end of the guide perhaps as a combination of sort of being in the midpoint of the range this quarter, but more broadly, I just want to get a sense for the business environment both fundamentally and overall from a macro perspective relative to let's say three months ago. And maybe at a high level sort of, maybe Karen can describe why the high end of the guide comes down. Obviously, we got the incremental FX in there, but any other factors? And as it relates to the FCPA investigation, are we confident at this point that it's been fully scoped at that kind of $5 million or so range? And I guess, I was surprised at how quickly you've sort of gotten clarity on this. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Glenn, let me take a stab at that. I think in terms of the business environment, I wouldn't actually say there's really been any change in the last three months. So, obviously, earlier in the year, we had talked about sluggishness in Financial Services and Healthcare, and then over the summer, post the Brexit vote, while we haven't seen disruption I would say specific to Brexit, we certainly saw some concern among insurance clients as well as Financial Services, and we talked about that on our last call. I wouldn't say there's really been any change in that environment or deterioration in that environment. I think it continued as it was in the quarter or in Q3. Obviously, the pound has deteriorated and so that resulted in an additional $18 million negative headwind as we went into Q4 based on that. And if we had left the range where it was for Q4, obviously, it would have been a very broad range and certainly, more significant growth than we'd ever added in Q4. And we thought it was appropriate to taper the top end of the growth range down into something that we thought was more reasonable based on typical buying patterns in Q4 given the fact that there are lower bill days, there are furloughs, the retail practice, as you know, shuts down quite significantly in Q4 as retail clients get ready for the holiday. They shut down all discretionary spending typically right about now. So, I think what we're seeing in Q4 is a very typical seasonal pattern for the business other than the impact of the FX. And I'm sorry. Can you repeat your question about the FCPA investigation? Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Are you confident that you fully scoped it at the $5 million and how did you get clarity so quickly? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. My apologies. So, it is early days in the investigation. I think, as we've said both in the Q and on the script today, we are continuing to pursue the investigation. We've obviously been working very, very hard to get our arms around this as quickly as we could. And as we said, we've identified to-date $5 million of potential improper payments. We were able to get to a place where we thought it was appropriate to record the $3.1 million of the $5 million as an out-of-period adjustment in Q3, but we will continue the investigation until we're confident that we've tracked it all down. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Okay. I think we're just about out of time, folks. So, I want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

Additionally, we have loaded an Investor Presentation onto the Investor Relations portion of our website. This presentation covers the key points discussed on the call. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Francisco, please go ahead. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear about our 2016 financial performance and our outlook for the upcoming quarter and year. For 2016, we finished within our guided revenue and EPS ranges. Our Q4 revenue was $3.46 billion, up 0.3% sequentially and 7.1% year-over-year. Our full-year 2016 revenue was $13.49 billion, which represented 8.6% growth over 2015, including a negative currency impact of 120 basis points. Turning to guidance, we're confident that the investments we've made position us well to deliver strong results in 2017. For Q1, we expect our revenue to be within a range of $3.51 billion to $3.55 billion. And for the full-year 2017, we expect our revenue to be within a range of $14.56 billion to $14.84 billion, representing full-year growth of 8% to 10%. Now, as we customarily do during our first call of the year, let me provide some color around client demand and our strategic outlook. For some time now, we've been speaking to you about our client's dual mandate. On the one hand, they have to run better and optimize their core operations; on the other, they have to run different and invest in the digital technologies that are reshaping business models. Over the last few quarters, we've seen clients' relative emphasis on these two shifts towards digital. For some time now, you've been asking us to break out our digital revenue. We've defined Cognizant's digital revenue as work with clients to help them win in the digital economy by applying technology and analytics to change consumer experiences to drive sustainable growth, deploying systems of intelligence to automate and improve core business processes, and improving technology systems by deploying cloud and cyber security solutions and as-a-service models to make them simpler, more modern, and secure. Our digital revenue for the full-year 2016 represented approximately 23% of total revenue and is growing well above the company average. Going forward, we expect that trend growth weighted towards digital to accelerate and will periodically break out our digital revenue to give you a sense of how that shift is progressing. Our investments to-date have positioned us well to solve our clients' digital challenges, but we know there is more to do. We've long prided ourselves in making the investments our clients require to stay ahead of their changing needs. That's why we're excited today to announce a plan that will accelerate Cognizant's shift to digital services and solutions. The plan has three elements, and is the result of many months of careful planning between management and our board that culminated in our Cognizant 2020 strategy, which as you know, we've been executing since last summer. The plan has been complemented by productive conversations in recent weeks with Elliott Management and other shareholders. As you know, we announced this morning a cooperation agreement with Elliott. We believe this plan is a constructive outcome that reflects the best interest of Cognizant's shareholders, clients, and associates. Now, with that perspective, let me discuss the three elements of our plan to accelerate our shift to digital. The first part of our plan began with the re-alignment that we announced last quarter of our horizontal teams into three practice areas across business segments. These three practice areas are designed to address the needs of our clients as they transform their business and technology models. Cognizant Digital Business helps clients architect and implement new digitally-enabled business models. Cognizant Digital Operations reinvents and manages our clients' most essential business processes. And Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology simplifies, modernizes, and secures client applications, platforms, and infrastructure. Going forward, we'll invest to scale these digital practice areas aggressively across industries and geographies both organically and through acquisitions. With more than 90% of our revenue in Financial Services, Healthcare, life sciences, Retail, Manufacturing and entertainment, we're at the center of the FinTech, health tech, and smart product revolutions. Our clients are depending on us to keep them at the vanguard of that shift. We will also continue to invest extensively in training and re-skilling our team and in substantially expanding our local workforces in the U.S. and other local markets around the world where we operate, as agile development and the pervasive influence of technology increases the value of co-location and a consultative approach. To complement this organic investment, we are intensifying our efforts to acquire companies, expanding our intellectual property, industry expertise, geographic reach, and platform and technology capabilities. We've recently ramped up this activity and we expect to accelerate the pace further in 2017, while keeping to our strategy of focusing primarily on tuck-in acquisitions. As the second element of our plan, we will continue to ensure that our core business, which includes service offerings related to IT infrastructure, applications, and business process services remains robust and healthy. These offerings are critical to fulfilling Cognizant's digital ambitions, because our clients' digital futures are built upon the backbone of their traditional systems. Having deep knowledge of our clients' core systems is a significant advantage as we work with them to build new digital capabilities. Our clients are looking to run their operations more effectively to redeploy capital to fund their digital investments. We've carefully analyzed and identified advanced automation and delivery efficiencies. In addition, we will make careful choices among business opportunities to avoid less profitable areas to balance growth and margin. While this strategy might lower our revenue growth in this part of the business, we believe it will be offset by strong digital revenue growth resulting in robust, higher-quality growth for the company overall. Executing the first two elements of this plan, will migrate our business mix to higher value, digitally-oriented IP and platform-based revenue. This, along with opportunities to leverage our scale, makes it possible for us to remove our historical margin cap (08:28) and allow margins to increase gradually over the coming years. At the same time, we will still invest strongly in the business for growth. And finally, we also took the opportunity to carefully consider our current cash balances and our future cash generation prospects. We believe that with Cognizant's strong cash profile, coupled with our debt capacity, we can continue to make the necessary investments in the business, while prudently returning capital to shareholders. Beginning in 2017, we will launch a robust capital return program, initiating a quarterly cash dividend and a share repurchase program that will return approximately $3.4 billion to investors over the next two years and 75% of our U.S. free cash flow in subsequent years. Before I turn the call over to Raj, let me summarize. We believe that the opportunity before us is greater than any we've seen before and we're optimistic that the plan we've announced today will allow us to capitalize on the prospects ahead. We're serving large and growing markets. We have a structure and strategic approach in place that positions us well to serve this increasing demand. We will continue to invest in capabilities that help clients become digital in every part of their businesses and are confident that we can expand our margins and return capital without compromising that purpose. Clients in 2017 are looking for digital capabilities at scale and are affirming that we've made the right investments by turning to us for integrated, high-impact, strategic initiatives. We're committed to creating value for both our clients and shareholders over the long-term and we see significant opportunity ahead of us. Now, Raj will discuss our performance and Karen will provide more financial details. I'll be back to take your questions. Raj? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you. Frank has talked to you about our plan to accelerate our shift to digital, which now accounts for approximately 23% of revenue. We're pleased with our position in digital market, and a number of prominent industry analysts and sourcing advisors acknowledge the expanding depth and breadth of our digital capabilities. Leading independent observers including Gartner, IDC, Forrester, Everest, and others have ranked us among the top global players in categories such as strategy and consulting, Internet of Things, intelligent automation, artificial intelligence, business analytics, design thinking, workplace services, and digital operations. Frank outlined key priorities for our path forward. I would like to elaborate on how we are operationalizing them. Last summer, we began to implement several transformational initiatives and entered 2017 well-positioned to advance our Cognizant 2020 strategy and accelerate our journey. Let me touch on some of the highlights. First, we're accelerating our shift to digital by establishing new practices, developing the skills of our people, and scaling up our local workforce. For example, we are expanding the number of client innovation spaces, we call collaborators, with locations in the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific. In addition, we are supplementing our expertise with select acquisitions. For example, Idea Couture provides digital innovation, strategy, and design services; Mirabeau specializes in digital marketing and customer experiences; and KBACE adds cloud strategy and integration skills. As we scale our digital capabilities, we are also scaling the way we bring digital to market. We have segmented our client base, and we better aligned our client-facing teams to bring Cognizant's expanded portfolio of capabilities to a broader range of buyers within our clients. This allows us to sell more effectively and productively. Second, to ensure that our core business is robust and healthy, we unified our delivery capabilities, allowing more holistic and cost-conscious deliver. Leveraging automation and scale will improve our efficiencies in utilization and pyramid optimization. And we will continue to deploy very commercial and delivery models including managed services, fixed bid, output and outcome-based pricing, and platforms. Let me give you an update on our three practice areas. In our Digital Business practice, we offer insight, digital strategy, and implementation. We're helping clients to realize the superior experience and financial benefits of the app economy. Our approach combines data science, design thinking, holistic process knowledge, and deep industry expertise. For example, in the digital customer experience area, we're helping a global package delivery leader digitally transform the last mile deliveries by moving from cumbersome, handheld devices to smartphones, benefiting multiple stakeholders with a superior process and delivery experience. Next, our Digital Operations practice is focused on transforming and hosting key processes, while leveraging automation and digital technologies. We enable core process transformation, driving deep business impact through automated, data-driven platforms and industry utilities. Our approach helps clients reengineer, digitize, manage, and operate their most essential business processes. Along these lines, we're helping a financial services client to more than double productivity in mortgage information processing by leveraging robotic process automation and self-learning, cognitive technology. Finally, our Digital Systems & Technology practice helps clients simplify, modernize, secure, and transform IT backbones to run their business better. This practice continues to provide a critical foundation for the broader enterprise transformation efforts with our clients. For instance, we're helping a global agricultural company transform the majority of their application portfolio with agile and DevOp tools. Now, an update on our key industry segments; our banking and Financial Services segment which consists of banking, capital markets, insurance, and transaction processing clients was down 1.5% sequentially and up 3.5% year-over-year, as many continue to struggle with the macro economic situation. Going forward, business drivers for institutions includes intensifying focus on customer centricity and on expanded revenue streams. They're shifting investment towards the areas offering transformational benefits including digital, automation, cloud, and agile development. We recently acquired Adaptra in Australia to augment our insurance expertise including Guidewire capabilities. Our Healthcare segment, which consists are of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients grew 1.2% sequentially and 5.6% year-over-year. Going into 2017, our clients are focused on investments in digital transformation of their business, consumerism, and value-based reimbursements. Though there is a slight uptick in discretionary spend, our clients are currently tracking the future of the Affordable Care Act under the new administration and are cautiously proceeding with new initiatives. Our Healthcare clients continue to see significant value in our combined TriZetto and Cognizant offerings. Both smaller and larger payers are showing increasing interest in platform-based solutions. Now turning to our performance by geography; from a geographic standpoint, North America grew 0.2% sequentially and 7.2% year-over-year. Europe declined 0.4% sequentially after a 3.5% negative currency impact, and grew 2.7% from last year after a 9.5% negative currency impact. Continental Europe grew 7.4% sequentially and 21.9% over the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by ramp-ups from recent wins in Germany, France, and the Nordics. The UK declined 6.8% sequentially and 10.8% year-over-year after a 4.2% and 15.4% negative currency impact, respectively. Finally, we saw continuous strong transaction in the rest of the world which was up 2.9% sequentially and 17.8% year-over-year. Digital transformation is indeed accelerating among our clients and we're excited to be well-positioned to help them succeed in the New Year. Before I turn the call over to Karen, let me comment briefly on a topic that I know is in the minds of many of you. As you know, there has been considerable discussion recently on the topic of skilled immigration in the U.S. This has been an ongoing discussion for many years. Cognizant's business growth requires us to attract and retain the best and brightest talent to meet our client's needs for technology, business processes, and consulting solutions and services. The plan we have announced today will require us to continue to build our teams in the U.S. and in other geographies around the world where we operate. Consistent with this need, we continue to focus on taking steps to ensure that we have access to a robust supply of talent in the U.S. In 2016, we hired over 4,000 U.S. citizens and residents. To support this, we have built out a robust network of over 20 U.S.-based delivery centers and plan to add additional capacity in 2017. Over the next several years, we plan to significantly increase the size of our U.S. workforce. For over five years, we have had an active program to recruit qualified students from the undergraduate and MBA schools across the country. We continue to scale up this program. As we scale up our M&A program, we expect this to contribute to our local workforce around the world. And, finally, to address the longer-term talent needs, we continue to make investments in training and retraining programs that help U.S. workers obtain in-demand technology and business skills. Now, I'll turn over the call to Karen to discuss our financial performance. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. You heard from Frank and Raj how we are accelerating our shift to digital, while ensuring that the core business remains robust and healthy. Additionally, as an ongoing commitment to creating shareholder value, we are also enhancing our financial model in two principal ways. Before getting into details of the quarter, I'd like to explain our new financial strategy in greater depth. First, we are instituting a robust capital return program that rewards our long-term shareholders. Given our size and scale, our strong cash flow profile, and the confidence we have in our future growth opportunities, we are stepping up our capital return commitment to our shareholders. We have thought very carefully about our future cash balances in making these decisions and, despite a considerable capital return program, we expect to maintain balance sheet strength and sufficient financial flexibility to run our business and take advantage of both organic and inorganic investment opportunities that may present themselves in the future. We are announcing an expanded share repurchase program and, subject to board declaration, announcing the initiation of a dividend. Over the next two years, we expect to return a total of approximately $3.4 billion in capital through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We are initiating a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share starting in Q2 which will amount to approximately 1% dividend yield based on yesterday's closing price. We plan to utilize $2.7 billion of cash to step-up our share repurchase program significantly over the next two years. This plan includes a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase which we expect to commence in Q1. We anticipate spending an incremental $1.2 billion during 2017 and 2018 to buy back stock in the open market. The capital return plan is expected to be funded by current U.S. cash balances, future U.S. cash flows, and incremental debt financing. Beginning in 2019, we plan to return 75% of U.S. free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Second, as Frank said, we are changing how we manage our operating margins. We will strive to balance our revenue and profitability, and in doing so, we'll move beyond the historical 19% to 20% non-GAAP operating margin target. We will accelerate our pursuit of broad-based, high value digital transformation work and reassess less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace. We will leverage our scale to improve cost in 2017 and 2018 through cost optimization efforts and intelligent sourcing. And we will aggressively use automation to drive the optimization of traditional offerings such as application, infrastructure, and process services. Some of these efficiencies will be offset by critical investments in building new digital capabilities as well as potential pricing pressure in some traditional lines of service. Given our evolving mix of business towards higher-margin digital revenues and our focus on driving continuous improvement in our business, we believe that we can expand our margins to 22% in 2019, while ensuring sufficient investments in the capabilities and solutions required to drive digital transformation for our clients. But what gives us confidence that we can deliver these higher margins? In 2016, we conducted a comprehensive review of our cost structure including our delivery and SG&A cost. This initiative helped us to identify 360 basis points to 440 basis points of margin enhancements that we can generate over the next three years through levers such as increased employee utilization, an optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure, and leveraging our corporate functions spend more effectively. The implementation of these savings initiatives will allow us to continue to invest in our digital capabilities, while still delivering improved margins over time. These financial targets are based on our current knowledge of industry trends, and we will continue to monitor and evaluate the possible impact of any potential events such as changes to immigration or tax policies or changes in pricing and wage inflation trends, which can have either a negative or a positive impact on our margin profile and overall financial model. As a management team, we remain very confident in our business and believe these changes to our financial model will enhance shareholder value over the long-term. Now, let me give you details on our fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.46 billion met our guidance and represented growth of 0.3% sequentially and 7.1% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $23 million or 70 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $51 million, or 160 basis points. During the quarter, we adjusted our estimate of 2016 incentive compensation downward to reflect the performance of the business during the year. This revision positively impacted our Q4 operating margin by approximately 215 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 18.7%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 was within our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.88. Our non-GAAP operating margins in Q4 were below our normal range due to certain investments that we made in 2016 in our Digital Operations business in certain geographies, combined with approximately $20 million of costs incurred in the quarter due to the ongoing FCPA investigation. While these expenses will continue to negatively impact non-GAAP operating margins in 2017, we expect that the optimization efforts that I just outlined will offset the negative impact of these expenses and begin to drive margin improvements in Q2 and beyond. For the full-year 2016, revenue of $13.49 billion represented growth of 8.6% year-over-year including a negative currency impact of 120 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.5% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.39. As a reminder, the remittance of cash from India to the U.S. that occurred in the second quarter had an incremental tax impact of $24 million in quarter four and $238 million for the full year. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.04 per share impact on our Q4 GAAP EPS that was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the non-recurring nature of the transaction. Turning to additional details on our financial performance, consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.5% and 42.5% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 0.5% sequentially and 5.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue was roughly flat versus last quarter and grew 8.7% from Q4 a year ago, driven by strength across Cognizant Digital Operations and the infrastructure portion of Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology. During the fourth quarter, 39.3% of our revenue came from fixed-priced contracts. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 329. We added 4,400 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 15.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 350 basis points from the year-ago period. Total head count at the end of the quarter was 260,200 employees globally, of which 243,700 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 74%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 79%, and on-site utilization was 90% during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $5.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this is up by $329 million from the quarter ending September 30 and up by $626 million from the year-ago period. Moving on to receivables, which were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter; we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 71.8 days. This is down almost three days compared to last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $349 million, down from $424 million at the end of Q3. We billed approximately 56% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $881 million at the end of the quarter and there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Turning to cash flow, operating activities generated $598 million, financing activities generated $11 million of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were $87 million during the quarter. Before turning to guidance, I would like to take a moment to update you on our ongoing FCPA investigation, which is being conducted under the oversight of the audit committee. The investigation has progressed significantly. We have identified a total of approximately $6 million in potentially improper payments relating to company-owned facilities in India, an increase of $1 million from what we reported at the end of the third quarter. During the fourth quarter we recorded an out-of-period correction of $1 million. To-date, of the identified $6 million in potentially improper payments, we have now recorded a total of $4.1 million in corrections. We have continued to aggressively implement remediation measures, including in compliance, the real estate function in India, and procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in India. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and for the full-year 2017. For the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.56 billion to $14.84 billion which represents growth of 8% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the first quarter of 2017, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.51 billion to $3.55 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be at least 18.7% during Q1 and at least 19.5% for the full-year 2017 as the benefits of further margin optimization begin to accrue. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.83. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. Our guidance does not assume any potential impact from events like changes in immigration or tax policies. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 611 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $3.53. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 597 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. This guidance also includes the impact of the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase which we expect to commence in Q1 subject to market conditions. We will provide additional details on full share count impact once the purchase has been completed. Operator, we can open the call for questions now. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, so I thought that's nice, exciting stuff with the new plan. I guess I'll ask the revenue impact or revenue implications of some of these changes in this period from 2017 to 2019. Can you comment on that and what that might look like and maybe what you expect your digital revenue mix to be by 2019? Thank you. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hi, Tien-Tsin, this is Frank. Thanks. Yeah, we are excited about the plan that we have announced today. I think that we've been talking to you for some time about this shift to digital, and this gives us an opportunity to really accelerate that shift. What I would say is that, as we think about that shift to digital, we will of course emphasize the growth in the digital side of the business; making the investments that we need to scale up both organically and inorganically, that side of the business. And as we said, we'll continue to be thoughtful about growing the core business, making sure that we invest to stay competitive there. We think that the core business is an important part of our ability to serve clients and our ability to be an integral part of their digital futures, because as you know, most of our clients are building their new digital capabilities on the backbone of their traditional systems. Having said that, we do expect that in the core business we're going to make thoughtful choices about the business areas on which we focus and, if appropriate, pivot away from lower margin part to that business. And so, that may have somewhat of an impact on revenue, but we think it'll be offset by growth \u2013 above-company average growth in the digital side of the business. So, as we execute on this plan our commitment is to continue to deliver high-quality, sustainable growth and we think this plan enables us to do that. As it relates to our digital revenue, as you know, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we're breaking it out for the first time for you based on feedback that we've received from all of you. It was approximately 23% of revenue in 2016. And as I said, we expect going forward that it will continue to grow above-company average. I don't have targets for where it'll wind up, but we'll just periodically report progress to you on that number so you can get a sense of how that shift is unfolding. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. All the best with the new strategy here. Just curious on slide 9 you talk about 120-basis-point to 200-basis-point impact, does that incorporate, I guess, the shift you said to more U.S. and other non-Indian locations? And does that \u2013 what kind of pricing assumption is based in there, and is there any higher implied visa cost in that number as well? Thank you. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Ed, good morning. This is Karen. So, as you mentioned on slide 9 of the investor deck that's out on the website, we talk about the different components of the 22% non-GAAP operating margin target in 2019. And as you mentioned on the right side of that slide, in particular, we talk about some headwinds that will result in about 120 basis point to 200 basis point impact over the next three years. That's a combination of all of the things on that part of the slide, which includes the talent strategy, current industry pricing trends, and then some of the investments that we're obviously making in digital and automation and so forth. Really, what that assumes is no change in pricing based on what we've seen to-date, so no further deterioration. And as Frank talked about, we're going to be fairly selective in the types of work that we'd go after particularly around the core business in the future. And then around the talent strategy, as both Frank and Raj talked about, obviously we've been expanding our local hiring and retraining and so forth in various geographies around the world, but assumes essentially that we continue on that path with no significant changes in terms of immigration policy or so forth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Could you give us a sense of your spending intentions of your Financial Services customers for 2017, clearly, given big changes with a new administration, higher net interest margin and attempts to roll back Dodd-Frank? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. Hi, David. This is Raj Mehta here. Look, with our Financial Services clients, they're obviously in much better shape going into 2017 than they were in 2016. And as you touched on, the increasing interest rate environment some roll-backs in regulation, I think it's a little too early for us right now. We're cautiously optimistic about what that means in terms of spending patterns moving forward. But right now, it's a little too early for us to see the impact of those changes. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Congrats on this shift in strategy. Just touching on the digital one more time, 23% of total revenues, I appreciate that statistic. Can you just touch on, again, I guess \u2013 I know someone else asked the growth profile of that over time or what it can get to. What is it growing at right now? And then what is the rest of your business, the components of the rest of your business growing and if you could break us down now that we have that piece the growth profiles of each of the other pieces along with digital itself today? And then, Karen, just a follow-up on liquidity and capital return strategy, can you give us a little more granularity, the sources of capital and cash coming for the buyback and the dividend? And what target leverage ratio you have now? Thanks again, guys. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Sure, Darrin. So, on the digital growth, as Frank mentioned in his prepared remarks, it is growing significantly above company average; he did give a specific number. But I think, as you would expect and as others have seen, it is certainly been the big growth driver for quite \u2013 for the last, certainly, several quarters and the last couple of years now and we would expect that to continue. Obviously, it does mean that other parts of the business \u2013 some of the core parts of the business are growing slower than company average. And then from an industry perspective, as we saw last year, obviously, we had some slower growth in banking and Healthcare, some of which was specific situations around Healthcare with M&A and so forth, but certainly a little bit slower growth there. So, I think very consistent with what others are seeing in the marketplace and the demand from clients which is that digital will be the high-growth driver for the coming years, and we would expect that to continue to be a meaningful driver for us. In terms of the sources of cash, at the end of the year, we have about \u2013 as you'll see when we file our 10-K, we have about $1.1 billion of cash in the U.S. today, and the cash \u2013 the funds for the dividends and the buybacks will come from our existing cash balances in the U.S., from U.S. free cash flow that we will generate over the next coming years. And then we will, as necessary, lever the balance sheet up a little bit. As you know, we have a revolver today, which has about $750 million of capacity in it and then, if necessary, we would take debt on beyond that, but certainly, our intent is to maintain a very strong balance sheet, maintain very strong investment-grade rating if and when we went to the rating agencies to do that, and to maintain a lot of flexibility for both organic and inorganic investments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, and congrats on the transition from me as well. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talked about, obviously, you're going to ramp up your level of acquisition activity as you kind of accelerate into digital businesses. Do you have a set target in terms of what you might anticipate to spend? How aggressive you might be on that front? And then maybe a follow-up with how the pipeline looks as you head into the New Year? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. Brian, it's always been the case that we focus first on the quality of acquisitions and we're selective on making sure that the acquisition \u2013 particularly as we look at the tuck-in acquisitions that they are focused on achieving one or more of a specific set of goals that we're looking for : technology, industry, capability, geography. Those are the major criteria that we look at. So, as a result of that, I don't have a specific spend target or a specific volume target, but as you know and as you saw, we did a number of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2016, and I would expect that the pace would continue at that level or maybe a little bit even ahead of that. We also, in 2016, did a couple of investments and the first time that we've taken investments in promising companies that we think are complementary to the company and I think you should expect to continue to see us doing some of that as well. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got that. And maybe just to follow up, are you seeing a change in the valuation and competitive nature of these deals, or are you kind of shooting above where most of that deal competition is in terms of size of deal or what you can bring to the table from a Cognizant point of view? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: I'm looking to Karen as well to see if she has a different perspective. I don't think that we've seen the market change meaningfully in terms of valuation for the kinds of firms that we're looking for. Obviously, there are valuation differences between what I would think of as traditional services, digital services, and then platform or IP-based companies, but those are well understood. I don't think there's been meaningful change in that over, let's say, the last 12 months. And as I said in my prepared comments, we continue at the moment to focus primarily on looking at tuck-in acquisitions to expand our digital capabilities. Really right now focused on expanding digital across the industry segments and focusing on expanding digital across the geographies around the world where we operate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, and congratulations on the capital allocation program. My question is on immigration. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about \u2013 I understand fully that you're increasing your hiring in the U.S., but if there are changes to the current H-1B program as it stands today, potentially a salary bid process or some other process that would change kind of the minimum floor on labor rates, would you consider accelerating the hiring in the U.S., or would you be more likely to sort of just continue to request H-1Bs at the same level as you are now? Maybe just comment on the broader outlook there from a policy perspective. Thank you. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Jim, it's Frank. Look, first of all, I would say that it's very difficult for us to speculate on potential changes to the program there. As you know, even currently, many alternative proposals out there, and over the last several years, have been even more. I would say that our intent has always been and continues to be to scale and to hire in the U.S. as aggressively as we can. As Raj said in his prepared comments, last year we hired over 4,000 citizens and permanent residents. But we also have to continue to supplement that with talent from around the world, because we do see shortages of talent in certain areas. We are trying to address that by focusing on retraining and re-skilling. But I think going forward you should expect to see that that will continue to be somewhat of a balance. We will continue to be as aggressive as we possibly can on scaling up and focusing on local recruitment, but I believe that there will be some prudent balance between those two things going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on that question and one other. But just to be clear, so in the context of raising the margin target to the 22%, you haven't factored in anything sort of extraordinary for, sort of, the visa reform. I just want to understand the context of it. Is it just too speculative at this point and you'll deal with it in an extraordinary \u2013 sort of on an extraordinary basis? And the other question I had is just for Karen, sort of, just thinking about the cadence to get to the 22% margin target in 2019 and I would assume there's a certain normal level of revenue growth embedded in that to get a fair amount of SG&A leverage, which would be a key part of the margin story. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. So, Glenn, this is Karen. On the immigration and what's baked into the margin, I think, as we said in our comments and it's highlighted also in the deck that's on the website, we have assumed sort of current status for immigration. We've obviously assumed that we will continue expanding our local hiring in the markets in which we operate, but we have not factored in any material changes to the immigration policy. At this point, it is just too speculative to try and make that determination. So, we will address that if and when the time comes. In terms of the cadence to get to the 22%, as we mentioned, our guidance for Q1 assumes that we have flat margins with Q4, and then on a full-year 2017 basis, that we'll be at least 19.5%, which is where we landed for the full-year 2016. So, what you will see is that the benefits of the margin optimization, those actions are already starting to be underway and will continue to increase as the year goes on and as we move into 2018. And so, we will see improvement as we go through the year. And as we mentioned, in my comments, that's a three-year program to generate the 360 basis points to 440 basis points of margin opportunity, but the vast majority of that happens in the first two years. And so, you'll see some improvement this year to offset some of the pressures we've seen \u2013 or the investments that we made last year. And then as we move into 2018, you'll get the full benefit of the 2017 actions as well as incremental actions that will happen in 2018. And then in 2019 is when we would expect to generate the 22% non-GAAP operating margin base for the full-year 2019. So, it'll be phased; it will incremental each year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. One question and a quick follow-up. On top line, when I look at fourth quarter results, Cognizant came in towards the low end of guidance for revenue, but the first quarter guide for 2017 shows a solid pick-up in top line growth. I think the midpoint of the range is something like 2% sequential. I remember last year I think Cognizant's growth was down 1% sequential 1Q 2016, so I'm just curious on the change in demand you're seeing there for a stronger pick-up starting in this first quarter? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, I think, Bryan \u2013 this is Karen. As you said clearly, Q1 this year looks like it will be much stronger than Q1 last year. I think we are seeing good demand across the business at this point. Last year, if you remember, in January is when the banking sector really started to fall apart and that put a lot of pressure on our Q1 numbers. We have not seen that this year. We have our January results. January came in exactly as we expected. So, we do think that Q1 is off to a good start. The other thing is a small impact but impacted sequential growth a little bit is, as we have said when we did the TriZetto acquisition, part of our objective there is to move into more annuity stream revenue versus just pure license sales. So, if you remember Q4 is always their strongest because of the license sales. We've started to make that transition, so it's a little bit less of an impact than it would have been in prior periods with them as well which obviously helps fund the overall Q1 number. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. And I'll just add to that, in addition to Financial Services, we're starting to see some \u2013 we had a lot of M&A in Healthcare in the beginning of 2016. So, we're starting to see some resolution, at least some of the discretionary spend. As you know, one of the large M&A transaction has been decided on and you're starting to see some discretionary spend starting to happen on that since that didn't move forward. And so you have a little bit of clarity in that. Plus, in addition to that, we have \u2013 we've talked a lot about our platform play that TriZetto BPaaS opportunities and you're seeing good traction in those areas as well. That's helped bring the stability with Healthcare. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Joseph A. Vafi - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Hey, Guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I think first if maybe \u2013 this would be little more theoretical but is there a way to quantify how much work that maybe being done right now by visa holders could be migrated back to offshore facilities without impacting service levels? And then secondly just a housekeeping item, is the accelerated buyback built in to the guidance on the EPS line for 2017? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hey, Joe. It's Frank. I'll let Karen answer the second part of your question while I think about the first part. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Joe, I think as we mentioned, we have baked in an estimate of the impact of the ASR into the share count. So, nothing in Q1 but in the full-year share count for Q2 \u2013 or I'm sorry, for the full year rather the 597 million does assume that we are able to start \u2013 launch the ASR sometime in Q1. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. And Joe, to the first part of your question, it is somewhat theoretical. What I would say is that, as I said I think in my prepared remarks, as we shift towards digital, those are the kinds of services where the value of colocation with the client is actually higher. You need to be close to the client. You need a more consultative approach. And so, I expect that those services will require us to continue to have folks on-site and scale up, as we said, our workforces around the world. I think if you look at the traditional business, there might be an opportunity to optimize a little bit around the edges in terms of what I think of as shoring, that is moving work to other parts of the world, but I don't think that's a significant opportunity. It might move the ratio between our on-site and offshore teams by a point or two, but I don't think it's going to be substantially higher than that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. I was wondering, do you think raising the margin profile, just given the commoditization and your efforts to invest in digital, might make you a little less competitive? And can you give us more color on the current margin profile in digital? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. Obviously we thought long and hard about this, Joseph. I think that we think we've landed in a good place that balances our ability to invest in the business. We were careful to make sure both when thinking about our income statement and our balance sheet that our first priority was to make sure that we protected our ability to invest in the business, to continue to do the things that will allow us to make the transition to digital; and at the same time, be prudent about, in the case of the balance sheet, returning capital to shareholders, and in the case of the income statement, increasing our margins. I think at 22%, we feel like we're \u2013 it's a good solid place to be. It's a balanced margin profile, and puts us squarely in the competitive set, but also allows us to make the right investments in the business. Operator : Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of outlook for the various pieces of Healthcare in 2017? I think you spoke very briefly on that so maybe talk a bit also about what you're seeing in pharma? And then does guidance \u2013 top-line growth guidance for this year also include the impact of the acquisitions that you've done so far and what would that be? Thanks. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. So, I'll kick it off and talk about just guidance for the year and, Karen, you can jump in on the acquisitions. But look, I think, overall we're pleased that we're off to a good start in 2017. Obviously, when we entered the year in 2016 we had the M&A overhang on the Healthcare deals and the financial Brexit and other issues that we had in the Financial Services industry. So, going into 2017, we're on to a positive start. I think there's still some caution out there. There is still \u2013 clients are still, obviously, nervous about what will happen with Affordable Care Act and they're waiting to see what the current administration will do towards that. But overall, we're seeing good pick-ups in terms of some of the discretionary spend in Healthcare. And in addition to that, like I touched on earlier, we are seeing a lot of traction on our BPaaS solutions that we've had around TriZetto. And I think we'll see continued acceptance of that model within other payers as well too. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Moshe, this is Karen. On the M&A front, obviously, we've made a couple of small acquisitions in Q4, and then we have the investments that we did earlier in the year in ReD and a couple of other acquisitions and in Measure as well. ReD and Measure, remember, don't generate any revenue for us. Those are just investments. So, there's no revenue there. And then from the rest of the group, it's less than 2% of the revenue. So, about 1% of revenue for the year would be from the rest of the acquisitions; it's very small. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Good. So with that, we'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. And, as always, we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you.

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are : Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q filed later today. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Cognizant is off to a solid start this year. Our first quarter revenue was $3.55 billion, at the top end of our guided range, and up 10.7% your rear. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.84. Turning to guidance, we expect second quarter revenue to be within a range of $3.63 billion to $3.68 billion, and we continue to expect full-year revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10%. I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing how we're accelerating our shift to digital by helping clients become technology enabled across their businesses. As the markets we serve move away from the physical and towards the digital, our clients know that they must build new customer experiences and automated processes on top of secure and scalable technology. That's the only way to compete effectively in a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, algorithms, bots, and big data. Doing so at scale, however, is a tall order, and that's why Cognizant's mission is to help clients transform their business models, their operating models, and their technology models in tandem to deliver the promise of digital at scale. Now we realize the word digital carries many meanings. For Cognizant, it goes well beyond building user interfaces or implementing collaboration platforms. For us, it's about using technology to enable clients to run better and run different. It's about the dual mandate to achieve more efficient and effective operations while reshaping business models for innovation and growth. This is the digital that matters. As noted on the Q4 call, Cognizant's digital revenue is generated by all the work we do to help clients excel in this new economy. That work spans the development of more engaging customer experiences, automated core business processes, and modern secure technology systems. It's because we care about the success of our customers and can speed their movement from doing digital to being digital that we realigned our company last year into three practice areas. At the point where clients engage their customers, partners, and employees, we work with them to build compelling experiences across channels and devices to create new value, revenue, and growth. That's what Cognizant's digital business does. To make their operating models more efficient and agile, we help elevate their operational core with processes that apply automation, managed services, and systems of intelligence. That's the focus of Cognizant's digital operations. And for their core infrastructure and technology, we simplify and modernize their legacy IT systems and implement a flexible backbone to deliver auto-scaling infrastructure, real-time data management, and adaptive security. And that's the role of Cognizant Digital Systems and Technology. Our cohesive approach extends from personalized customer interactions all the way through the IT infrastructure. Our three practices work closely with our industry verticals, which is the way we go to market, as well as with our geography and Cognizant business consulting to create industry-tailored solutions. By aligning all of our offerings within these practice areas, we've been able to open up significant new growth opportunities. Our aim is for clients to become fully technology-enabled in every aspect of their businesses. But what does that entail, and how do clients benefit? Cognizant has been working with a multinational insurance and financial services firm to overcome its process, organizational, and technology challenges and speed its journey towards digital. Because the firm lacked uniform processes and relied heavily on manual intervention, its insurance policies were prone to errors, and new products could take up to two months to roll out. Few of its agents had adopted advanced technology, and therefore few could take a 360-degree view of their customers' needs. There were no end-to-end digital channels for selling and issuing policies, and rigid back-end systems couldn't keep up with their expanding roster of customers whose own needs were growing. By the way, this example of legacy IT constraining the business is one we often see amongst our clients. In a three-phase engagement, Cognizant digitized the firm's enterprise applications relating to the administration of general and life insurance policies, enabling straight-through processing. Then we helped the firm use its new enterprise foundation to build its own customized user interfaces. And now in the third phase, we're providing all their partner channels and entities with digitized customer interaction platforms that integrate the firm's data, processes, and services. As a result, this client's new product rollout cycle has been reduced by 35% to 50%. And with its new 360-degree view of customers, the firm can design products for diverse customer segments, upsell products, and enhance its overall product marketing. This is an example of how two of our practices, Digital Business and Digital Systems and Technology, come together to transform a client's business. On our last call, we expressed our commitment to accelerate our shift to digital services and solutions. Here are some signs of our continued strong momentum. Building on our acquisition of companies such as Idea Couture, Mirabeau, and Adaptra, we acquired Brilliant Service in Q1 to strengthen our digital capabilities in Japan. Brilliant Service provides end-to-end Android and iOS applications, embedded software, and user experience design to major corporations in Japan. We continued the momentum of our client innovation spaces, opening two more of these collaboratories, one in Amsterdam and another in Melbourne. And in Barcelona, we opened the Salesforce Solutions Focus Lab that combines a supply center and a delivery center. In addition, to ensure that our teams remain at the vanguard of mastering advanced technologies, we're stepping up investments in professional training. This year our goal is to develop more than 10,000 engineers and architects plus another 10,000 across niche areas of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cognitive computing. Given the tens of thousands of employees already skilled in these areas, we expect to have about 100,000 employees by the end of this year with a depth of knowledge and skills that will enable them to pursue the most specialized areas of digital. All of these initiatives are needed because as client interest in becoming technology-enabled across their businesses grow, we're engaging with an increasing number of larger, more complex digital-at-scale projects. Our progress is receiving broad validation from industry analysts. We remain a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for providers of managed workplace services. IDC named us a leader in IoT consulting and systems integration. Everest Group calls Cognizant a leader and star performer in digital services, and HfS Research placed us in the Winner's Circle for digital marketing operations. Overall, our digital-related revenues are growing well above company average. We continue to pursue tuck-in acquisitions to expand our intellectual capital, domain expertise, global reach, and our platform and technology capabilities. Of course, we maintain our focus on strategic clients across our core industries. Raj will provide a bit more color on how we're accelerating our shift. It's exciting to think about the scale of the opportunity ahead as technology embeds itself into almost everything, as tens of billions of devices join the Internet, and as the amount of digital information reaches an expected 35 trillion gigabytes by 2020. Cognizant's Center for the Future of Work studied 2,000 companies across six industries globally to determine what percent of their overall revenue is driven by digital transformation. In 2015 it was nearly 5%, but by 2018 we expect this technology to influence more than 11% of all revenues these companies generate, or more than $2 trillion. There's a virtuous cycle at work. The more clients invest in new technologies, the greater the return, and the more they want to invest. We see the pervasive build-out of advanced technologies significantly expanding our market opportunity. Now I'd like to cover two central elements of our plan, which are to improve margins and execute an enhanced shareholder capital return program. We moved quickly to implement our capital return program. In March we launched a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program that is ongoing, and today we announced the company's first quarterly cash dividend. On the margin front, we have a number of operational efficiency and cost reduction work streams underway. In addition, our board has shifted management compensation to more closely reflect the balance we're striking between revenue and profit growth. The board and the company leaders, including me, are intensively focused on executing both these plan elements. Karen will provide more detail within her remarks. We also continue to refresh our board, and in March we announced the appointment of two new directors who will replace two retiring directors. I want to take this opportunity to welcome two independent directors who joined the Cognizant board on April 1, Betsy Atkins and John Dineen. Betsy is the CEO of venture capital firm Baja Corporation and an entrepreneur who has cofounded and led enterprise technology companies. John brings extensive leadership and operational experience from his 28 years in senior roles with GE, most recently as the CEO of GE Health Care. We look forward to benefiting from their expertise on our board. I'd also like to thank Tom Wendel and Lakshmi Narayanan, who will not be standing for reelection at our upcoming annual meeting, for their many years of service to the company. To wrap up, being digital is the defining challenge for today's C-suite and the enterprises they lead. Digital touches every part of every company strategy and operations, and therefore it touches every part of our business. We're committed to accelerating the shift to digital to create value for both our clients and our shareholders, and we're committed to executing our plan on margin improvement and capital allocation. And now over to Raj, who will discuss first quarter performance in greater detail, followed by Karen, who will cover our financial results. Raj? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thanks, Frank. Building on Frank's discussion, I'll outline our progress in executing the shift to digital. And then I'll review our industry verticals, focusing on our financial performance and how we're helping our clients manage through their challenges. To speed our progress, we have many initiatives underway. Here are the top three. First, we're expanding our solutions portfolio. To do so, we're deploying repeatable industry-tailored solutions faster across our three practice areas, and we're further developing offerings through selected partnerships and acquisitions. Second, we're deepening and broadening our digital skills under the guidance of chief digital officers in each of our industry and regional business units. Our CDOs oversee the building of domain-based solutions, and they ensure that our teams, which focus on our strategic clients, have the skills they need. As a result, our teams are broadening Cognizant's reach and deepening our relationships, particularly with decision-makers who are outside the clients' CIO organizations. Third, we're enhancing our digital engagement with clients. For example, at our Newark laboratory, co-innovation centers in Amsterdam and Melbourne, our strategists, designers, data scientists, human science, and cyber security experts work with clients and partners to design, prototype, build, and run new customer experience and business processes. During the first quarter, about 50 clients visited our innovation centers. Today in every industry, our clients face common challenges. They must strike a balance between optimizing cost and investing in innovation. We help them to do both at the same time on their journey to implement digital at scale. Through our engagement, clients are able to drive profitable growth by enhancing their customers' experience, speeding products to market, and deploying new business models. I want to turn now to our financial performance in our industry verticals and provide examples of our customer engagements. Let's start with Banking and Financial Services, which consists of our banking, capital markets, insurance, and transaction processing clients. First quarter revenues were up 7% year over year. Consider the work our Digital Systems and Technology practice is doing with ABN AMRO Clearing. We are cloud-enabling their global IT infrastructure and laying the foundation for digital transformation. Cognizant will modernize their existing global technology infrastructure and transform their IT operating model across their core trading system, reporting systems, and other business services. We'll also provide hybrid cloud security network management and end-user services. Doing so will enable ABN AMRO Clearing to increase their operational resilience and application availability. They'll able to operate with greater speed and agility to better manage market volatility, and they'll lower their capital investment and operating cost. This is what we mean by driving digital at scale. For insurance clients, our Digital Operations team is able to rationalize their life and annuity platforms, supporting policy issue, building collections and claims. With these integrated platforms, clients can manage their legacy products more efficiently while providing a foundation on which to build more customer-centric digital capabilities. Turning to healthcare, this segment consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients. First quarter revenues were up 9.7% year over year. To help clients balance cost and investment, we're developing solutions that address cost, access, and quality of care. These solutions will improve membership engagement and combine clinical and claims data through advanced population healthcare management initiatives. Client interest in our healthcare platforms, including TriZetto, continues to grow. Take the work our Digital Operations practice is doing with LifeBridge Health, based in Maryland. We're working to transform communications across their network and drive stronger relationships among physicians, patients, and regional health facilities. LifeBridge's communication network is built on our cloud-based Onvida software-as-a-service platform. Our platform combines customizable software with 24x7 phone and online access to clinical specialists. As a result, patients have self-service access to consultations and information to manage their healthcare, and doctors can receive near real-time customized communication about their patients. This means better care coordination and better transition of care. To deal with the launch of new projects and rising pricing pressures on existing products, our life science clients know they must enhance their patient, provider, and payer engagements. In response, these clients are increasingly interested in patient engagement, clinical analytics, investigator collaboration, new commercial models, and customer service transformation. Here's a case in point. A large U.S.-based pharmaceutical and medical device company is using our MedVantage platform to transform their field services, quality, and complaints processes. Our cloud-based platform, which is part of digital operations, will help them drive higher levels of agility and productivity and improve customer experience. Turning to retail and manufacturing, this segment grew to 16.4% year over year. We've renamed this segment Products and Resources to more clearly convey the industries we serve here, retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality, manufacturing and logistics, and energy and utilities. These clients are managing through a challenging retail and consumer business environment. And so they're giving priority to optimizing costs, transforming their supply chain, and building omni-channel customer experience solutions. We've responded with an industry-specific suite of offerings that leverage automation, big data, and cloud. Our clients in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities continue to see solid growth. They're on a path of scaling their digital transformation by leveraging connected products and process reinvention. Let's look at what our Digital Systems and Technology practice is doing for Cargill, a global provider of food, agricultural, and industrial products. As part of a multiyear agreement, we will migrate Cargill's application to the cloud to modernize, transform, and run their global IT applications. We'll be applying a lean, agile delivery model that will enable Cargill to achieve best-in-class operational excellence while enhancing their go-to-market capabilities. From this quarter forward, we will refer to this segment we formerly called Other as Communications, Media and Technology. This segment grew 16.5% year over year. The name change signals our progress in developing our business in these industries and our increasing focus given their growth potential. This practice services many of our Silicon Valley digital leaders, including four of the top five born-digital platform firms. Now let's take a quick look at performance by geography. North America grew 10.6% year over year. Europe was up 6.5% over last year after a 7.4% negative currency impact. Integrating multiservice solutions and our expansion through targeted acquisitions contributed to our success in Europe. For example, clients view our recent acquisition of Mirabeau, a specialist in developing digital marketing and engaging customer experiences, as another hallmark of Cognizant's differentiated value in the marketplace. To close out our geographic discussion, we have continued strong growth in the rest of the world, which was up 25.6% year over year. As I wrap up, I want to offer a quick update on a topic I discussed on our last call. Given our attention to the H-1B visa program, we want you to know that we're evolving our workforce and delivery in the United States. Cognizant hired 4,000 U.S. citizens and residents in 2016. In 2017 and beyond, we expect to significantly ramp up our U.S.-based workforce by hiring experienced professionals in the open market and by making more use of university, veteran, and related programs. We are shifting our workforce largely in response to clients' increasing need for co-innovation and collocation. While we still seek visas for highly specialized and skilled talent, we're reducing our dependence on these visas. In fact, during the most recent filing period on April 1, we applied for less than half the number of visas we sought last year and we expect to further reduce our need for these visas going forward. As part of our shift, we continue to expand our U.S. delivery centers. A good example is our Tampa delivery center, where we employ over 1,000 technology and business professionals. They provide business process services, application services, and testing for financial services and healthcare clients. At our center, we're employing a broad skill mix that includes longtime local residents as well as veterans and recruits from local colleges. At similar delivery centers around the country, we've expanded our retraining programs and are working with local institutions to implement special curriculums that will help us meet growing client needs. Today we have over 20 U.S. delivery centers, and we continue to expand this footprint. To sum up, we are executing the shift to digital at scale by helping our clients simultaneously optimize their costs as they invest in the future. And we are shifting our workforce rapidly in the U.S., with more U.S. jobs and U.S. delivery centers. Now I'll turn over the call to Karen to discuss our financial performance Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. The business got off to a solid start in Q1, which positions us well to achieve our full-year guidance. First quarter revenue of $3.55 billion was at the high end of our guidance range and represented a year-over-year increase of 10.7%. We had a negative currency headwind, which impacted year-over-year revenue growth by $35 million or 110 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and realignment charges, was 18.9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.84. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.2%. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter is lower than our previous guidance, as we recorded certain income tax benefits that were previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements. The timing of this adjustment was primarily driven by the lapse of the statute of limitations. As Frank outlined in his comments, we are committed to a comprehensive return of capital program. In March we launched a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, program. Today we declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2017. This dividend will be payable on May 31, 2017. Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and Technology Services and Outsourcing Services represented 57.8% and 42.2% of revenue respectively for the quarter. Consulting and Technology Services grew 10.6% year over year, driven by strong performance in Cognizant Business Consulting and an increased demand for digital solutions. Outsourcing Services revenue grew 10.9% from Q1 a year ago. During the first quarter, 38% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. We continue to make progress over the long term towards changing the mix of our business towards more fixed-price and/or more managed services arrangements. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 336. We are strongly committed to our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019. To ensure we achieve this target, we have engaged outside advisors and have a number of work streams underway to focus on cost and operational efficiency, increasing utilization, optimizing our pyramid structure, improving our talent supply chain to better align resources with client demand, simplifying our business unit overhead, and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively. Within the corporate functions, we are focused on a number of areas, including but not limited to span of control, automation, and vendor consolidation. Additionally, our Board of Directors has organized and chartered our recently announced Financial Policy Committee. And as Frank and Raj mentioned, we are accelerating our shift to high-value digital transformation work while continuing to reassess less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace. In Q1, we incurred approximately $11 million of charges related to our realignment program, including advisory fees and severance costs. During the remainder of 2017, we expect to incur additional costs related to severance, including those associated with our recently initiated voluntary separation program, lease terminations, and other facility-related shutdown costs and advisory fees. These actions will ultimately improve our cost structure and operating margins while allowing us to continue to invest in the business for growth. We expect to show gradual improvement in our margins throughout 2017 as these efforts take hold. We have already started driving utilization higher by slowing hiring and improving resource alignment to better meet client demand. As evidence of this, we added just 1,000 net new hires in the quarter. While we will carefully manage head count and our cost structure, it is important that we continue to hire and invest in critical skills to support our evolving digital capabilities. Annualized attrition of 14.7% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was roughly in line with the year-ago period. Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 74%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 79%, and onsite utilization was 91% during the quarter. We would expect these ratios to improve gradually over this year, as many of the actions we took in Q1 begin to accrue in Q2 and the remainder of the year. Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was down by $1.2 billion from the quarter ending December 31 and $369 million from the year-ago period, reflecting the use of cash on hand to primarily fund the ASR. Receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 72 days, flat with last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $395 million, up from $349 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 57% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, which included a $350 million outstanding balance on our revolver. Turning to cash flow, in response to investor requests, beginning with this quarter's release, we have included a condensed cash flow statement. Operating activities generated $277 million in the quarter and we invested $66 million in CapEx, resulting in $211 million of free cash in the quarter. The U.S. portion is roughly one-third of our total free cash flow. As previously mentioned, as part of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders, we launched a $1.5 billion ASR in March. At that time, we received and retired 21.5 million shares, a portion of the total expected shares to be repurchased under the ASR. We expect to complete the transaction during or prior to the third quarter of 2017, at which time the total number of shares to be delivered will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price during this period. Our diluted share count decreased to 607 million shares for the quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and for the full year 2017. For the full year 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.56 billion to $14.84 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 10%. Our guidance is based on current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the second quarter of 2017, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.63 billion to $3.68 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be at least 19.4% during Q2 and at least 19.5% for the full year 2017, as the benefits of our realignment program begin to accrue. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.89. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 591 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $3.64. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 595 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 23%. This guidance also includes the impact of the $1.5 billion ASR, and we will provide additional details on the full share count impact once the purchase has been completed. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, and realignment charges. For the full year, it also excludes the recognition of the Q1 income tax benefit that was previously unrecognized. Our guidance does not account for any potential impacts from events like changes to immigration and tax policies. In summary, we had a strong start to 2017, and we expect to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth this year along with a substantial capital return to shareholders. Operator, now I'll turn it back over to you for any questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys, congrats on the strong quarter. Just looking over at 2Q revenue guidance, that range seems to be a little bit wider than usual. I was just curious. Is that some different demand outcomes from clients that's causing that wide a range? Because I think historically we've seen more of a pickup between 1Q sequential and 2Q growth rates. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Sure, Bryan. This is Karen, good morning. So Q2 revenue, the range is actually about the same as the ranges we've been providing in recent quarters and in Q1. It's about a $50 million range between the low and the high end of the range. One thing that we should point out that was not in the prepared remarks is this year is a little unusual with the calendar, so Q2 actually has less billing days than Q1, which is the first time in my history with the company that that's happened. And it's partially just because of the way the holidays and weekends line up this quarter. So that's why a little bit the Q2 seasonality doesn't seem quite as strong as it would in prior years. But we're very comfortable. The demand environment, as we were talking about in our prepared remarks and obviously I'm sure we'll have more conversation over the next few minutes, the demand environment continues to be solid. We haven't seen any change in that as we went into Q2. It's primarily just a matter of the number of bill days. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, and then a quick follow up, maybe Francisco. Any changes in clients' appetite to use Cognizant services due to some of the stuff going around on immigration reform? Has anybody pulled back or looked to be more hesitant than usual? Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Good morning, Bryan. I would say specifically related to immigration, we really have not seen any slowdown or impact on client demand. And overall, we were pleased with Q1 at the top end of our range. And so I think that there wasn't any impact obviously in Q1, and we haven't seen anything that concerns us going forward. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, nice start to the year here. I'll ask about the healthcare outlook. Just a lot of noise there obviously, just curious about the progress or maybe movement in the BPaaS pipeline. Are you seeing any pent-up demand at payer clients? Maybe anything else you can give us on the outlook in healthcare this year would be great. Thanks. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hi, this is Raj here. Look, I think we're pleased with the start of healthcare this year. Obviously, as you know, Q1 has a lot of seasonality in there with the TriZetto business being a software business, and in addition to that our life sciences business, which has a lot of discretionary spend and budget flush that happens in Q4. So overall, we're pleased with the start of healthcare. I think obviously there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of what happens with proposed legislation around the Affordable Care Act. But we are seeing some stability, especially given that some of the large M&A deals that were out there, we're starting to see some. Given that those are not moving forward, we're starting to see some pent-up demand, which is a good start for us as well too. I think look, BPaaS in terms of our platforms, we continue to see a lot of traction, a lot of client interest around our solutions, and along with that, a lot of initiatives around digital, especially around customer engagement and analytics, security, and cloud-related services. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, congrats. Does TriZetto, could you remind us if TriZetto has a license fee impact on the model and what quarter it might hit, or is it all spread over the life of whatever the engagement is? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Good morning, Ed. This is Karen. So as you know, obviously when we brought TriZetto, they were very focused on software sales and had tremendous seasonality in their business, with Q4 being their strongest quarter historically. That still continues to be true. But over time, obviously, one of the things we've been trying to move them towards is more of an annuity-based structure. So in Q1 of this year, the sequential decline in TriZetto revenue was about $20 million from Q4 to Q1. That's down from last year, where it was over $25 million sequential impact from Q4 to Q1. So we're slowly starting to move them into much more of an annuity-based structure so that over time we would have less of that lumpiness. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe dive a little bit more into the immigration comments you touched on earlier. Can you maybe give us any kind of quantification around absolute numbers of visas you applied for either last year or this year, just to give us a sense about what the half, the 50% mark implies? And maybe just give us a sense about what your plans are in terms of campus recruiting, both in India and the U.S., over the next year, and how you think about the head count additions for the rest of the year relative to some of the rationalization efforts you talked about, part of the restructuring. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Okay, why don't I \u2013 Jim, this is Frank. I'll take some of that and then I'll ask Karen to cover some parts of it. We don't disclose numbers around our use of visas for competitive reasons. But I think, as Raj said in the prepared comments, this year we filed for half the number of H-1s that we had filed last year. We wanted to put that out there just to give you a sense that we are continuing to aggressively shift the model, to continue to give you a trend line that says as the business shifts more toward digital, as our clients \u2013 as the demand from clients is more about collocation and co-innovation because that's the kind of work that digital demands, that we're shifting the model accordingly. As a U.S. company, we're committed to hiring and reskilling employees, not just in the U.S., but really in all the markets around the world where we operate. Specific to the U.S., we're hiring more here. We've got what we think are very innovative training programs with colleges to help train the next generation of technology workers. As Raj said, we're expanding the number of our U.S.-based centers. He gave you an example of the Tampa center and some color around that one. Like Tampa, we have 20 other centers like that already around the U.S. that we will continue to build and grow and expand our footprint in. And let me ask Karen to cover head count and our thinking around head count as we look through the rest of the year Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yes, sure. Thanks, Frank. So, Jim, obviously we haven't and will not provide any head count guidance. But I think at a macro level, it's safe to assume that utilization will go up throughout the year. We will certainly continue to hire as we continue to drive forward with the change in the skills mix. So as you saw in Q1, we added about a net of 1,000 people. That will move up and down throughout the year as we bring on some of these new skills and continue to also retrain our workforce, as Frank talked about. In terms of the balance between campus and lateral hiring, that will continue to shift from quarter to quarter. As you know, we have a very robust campus hiring program in India. That continues. In the U.S., we continue to expand our campus hiring programs, and that's everything from working with local community colleges and retraining and skilling programs, all the way up through the big MBA and Master's programs. And then similarly in Europe, we also do a lot of campus recruiting there. So we've got very robust campus programs that we've put in place over the last few years, and continue to look to those as ways of expanding our local presence onsite. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could start by maybe touching on gross margin a little bit. It seems as though on the gross margin side, it was a little bit softer in the quarter. So I was just wondering what in terms of business mix, or maybe we're not accounting for charges correctly as we're backing them out, might be included in that number. And then I have a quick follow up. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hi, Brian. This is Karen. So it was a little hard to hear you, but I think you were asking about gross margin for the quarter. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So gross margin, as we've talked about from time to time, will move up and down. Our focus is always on non-GAAP operating margin. But what you saw putting pressure on gross margin, we saw this last year as well, is in 2016 we hired a lot of people, and frankly, head count grew much faster than revenue. That already did start to subside, at least on a sequential basis, this quarter and will continue to subside this year and will bring those two back more in line. And certainly head count growth I would expect to grow actually slower than revenue this year. So it was really the lower utilization that was putting pressure on gross margin, but as I said, that will start to reverse itself as we get through the rest of the year. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And on operational efficiency initiatives, maybe if you can offer a little bit of color in terms of what you made progress with in the first quarter and how we should anticipate ongoing initiatives to trend through the remainder of the year? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So I think really the vast majority of the initiatives are just starting now, so I would say the January and February timeframe was a lot of planning. We want to be very thoughtful. It is most critical that we continue to invest for growth and the shift to digital that we're seeing in the business. So that's our \u2013 first and foremost, we need to make sure we protect that while at the same time, obviously, we're looking for opportunities to enhance our cost structure and further optimize our cost structure. So there were some small actions in Q1. As you saw, there was about $11 million of realignment cost that was a combination of advisory fees to help us prepare for this, as well as some severance. But most of the actions will begin here or have begun already in Q2. We just launched earlier this week a voluntary separation package. That program will go through the end of Q2, so we'll start to see the benefits of that as we get into Q3. Similarly, as we're looking at real estate and other opportunities and vendor consolidation and so forth, the vast majority of those benefits we'll start to see towards the end of Q2, but most of that will really start to kick in as we get into the back half of this year, which will then hopefully set us up very well as we move into next year and we start to see the full-year benefits of those. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Hi, Frank. Hi, Raj. Hi, Karen. So the performance with regards to revenues and EPS was in line with our expectations, but the gross margin decline was a bit sharper than I expected. Can you break down the decline in terms of the impact from revenue mix versus the investments you're making or miscellaneous factors? What I'm trying to get to is how much of the impact is likely to be ongoing versus you get a recovery as you proceed through the year. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Ashwin, this is Karen. I'll take that. I think similar to the answer to Brian's question, this is really about utilization in Q1. As the business mix continues to take hold, digital becomes a bigger piece of the business. We are actually seeing that business continue to be margin accretive. And we expect that to continue, and that is certainly a big piece of what will help drive our margin profile in the outer years. But in the short term, because of all the hiring we did last year and the fact that we had such a big drop in utilization year over year as we went through last year, that's really what's putting the pressure on gross margin. And as I said, we would expect that to start to reverse as the year goes on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Please go ahead with your question. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, thank you. Karen, is there a way to think about how your cost base is changing? What I mean by that is you're requesting or applying for fewer visas, but you're adding more onshore labor, so your costs \u2013 your general costs are increasing per head count. Is there a way to think about how that is unfolding for the year? In other words, are your costs per head count going up by 5% or 10% or not really changing? I know some of your strategic initiatives are designed to alleviate that pressure. But is there any way to quantify as you're growing your onshore head count how that's changing your cost base? And the second part of the question is, how much more can you move mix to be offshore? We've talked to some customers, and they seem more willing to move with the H1B1 \u2013 H1 issues that are arising. It seems like clients are more willing to let work move offshore. But how much more do you think room is there to move work offshore to mitigate some of the impact of what is generally I think higher cost wages that you have to pay for your onshore labor? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Sure. So, Keith, I'll start and I think I'll let Frank add some color as well. In terms of the onsite costs, this is interesting. On a like-on-like basis, if we're hiring the same skills with a local worker versus somebody who comes over on a visa, there really isn't significant difference in the cost structure by the time you factor in the cost of the wages, the relocation, et cetera, versus the compensation that we're paying. And obviously, we have to keep in mind that when you're using the H-1B program, there are prevailing wage structures that set the salaries that we are going to pay to our people. So essentially, those salaries are set at market wage. So we're not seeing any significant difference as you shift the workforce. The biggest challenge is finding the right talent, and that has always been the concern and the challenge. So as long as you can find the right skill set, the cost structure is not significantly different. In terms of the ability to move work offshore and the willingness, I think it's the same issue. If clients can find the talent here in the U.S. or in Europe as it may apply, then I think certainly people would avail of that. But when the talent is not available, people are certainly willing to look at moving work offshore. And I will ask Frank, he may have color to add to that as well. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: I think Karen has covered it well. I have very little color to add. All I would say is that on the issue of moving more work offshore, I think in general you have to look at that by line of service. I think that generally speaking, we're pretty optimized by line of service. But on some of the older lines of service, application maintenance, quality assurance, and so on, there may be some incremental opportunity to optimize the mix there. That's driven by maturity of those service offerings, more comfort that clients have with executing in a global delivery model, and to some extent driven by advances in technology, better communications technology, better collaboration and interaction technologies. I don't think that's a significant move. And to some extent, as we look at the portfolio overall, that move is somewhat at the portfolio level offset by the digital, the new digital work that requires more collocation, co-innovation closer to the client. At a portfolio level, I'm not sure you'd see significant shifts one way or the other. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Frank, maybe this one's for you, I imagine this transition that your business is undergoing right now is one of the biggest challenges you've had in the 20-plus years you've been there. Can you just talk about what are the most difficult aspects in your view of the transition both to digital on the revenue side as well as the margin expansion shift on the cost side of things and how you're addressing those? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Lisa, I would say while this is a transition that we're taking the company through, I think the company \u2013 and I give the team a lot of credit. I'll take a minute here to recognize everybody on the Cognizant leadership team and all of the people around the world who have gotten behind making this transition happen. It's not dissimilar to many other transitions that we've managed through in the past. We lived through the financial crisis and came out stronger at the other end when close to 50% of our revenue back then came from the financial services industry. We made the shift from year 2000 to the Internet and e-business and so on and so forth. The company is a little bit bigger today than it was back then, so the magnitude of what we're doing is a little bit bigger, but I would say the elements are similar. The reality is that we have a very, very strong market position that comes from incredibly strong client relationships that go back many years. We understand our clients. We understand their businesses. We understand their technology environments. And our advantage in digital comes from the fact that clients are moving into this phase where they are doing digital at scale, which means they're transforming their business models, they're transforming their operating models, and they're transforming their technology models, all of these in tandem simultaneously. That is Cognizant's advantage, that we have this capability to be able to work with them to transform their business model, their operating model, and their technology model through that in tandem in one strong, solid integrated fashion. So we've got a strong value proposition. We've got a strong \u2013 in the marketplace. Now in terms of the changes, the core capabilities that we have, our consulting teams, our strong industry domain expertise, those are relevant. We are going through a large process, as I said in my prepared remarks, of re-creating and reskilling the teams. That's mostly related to new digital technologies. We're doing that at scale, so that's a heavy lift given the number of people that we need to take through that. But we've got a great workforce, a workforce that's committed to continuous learning. And so it's a question of making that happen as opposed to desire or will to have that happen. So I think we're taking the company through that. Look, I think in terms of the margin expansion program, the company is committed to this. We're looking at it as an opportunity to simplify the business, frankly. We've had 20-plus years of rapid growth. The company was probably a little bit more complicated internally than it needed to be in some areas. This is an opportunity for us to simplify. It's an opportunity for us to get better. It's an opportunity for us to be more efficient and more effective in how we do things, and the emphasis is on simplification. And given that, I think the team is rallying around that because they see that this is an opportunity for us to run the place better and be stronger as a result of that. So I think we're well on our way. We feel very good. The management team is deeply committed to this plan. We see the opportunity as we shift to digital. We see the benefits of simplifying the business. And I think as Karen said, we're off to a good start in Q1, and you'll start to see the actions on the margin front in Q2. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Operator, I think we have time for one last question. Operator : Yes, that question will be coming from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Pacific Crest. Arvind Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi, good quarter. So when you look at these digital projects, they're certainly gaining scale, and clients value your consulting and advisory services even more so now than in prior years. Can you talk about your consulting offering and how you're looking to scale that given your onsite hiring? Particularly among the Indian players, you're certainly well positioned, but I'm sure there's more to do on building scale. And finally, how are you also leveraging your consultants on your account (56:20) management? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Arvind, it's Frank. There were multiple parts to that question, so I'll try to address them all, so a couple of things. I would say in terms of consulting scale-up, as you know, the consulting business at Cognizant is one that we've been building for years. And so in terms of the basics of that business and the basics of scaling that business up, I think we've got a very robust mechanism in place now. We've got strong campus hiring, MBA campus hiring, both in India and in the U.S. and Europe, so we hire MBAs from the top institutions around the world. That feeds the consulting permits. So the basic mechanism of scaling that up I think is very much in place and very strong. Having said that, as you pointed out, consulting has never been more relevant. And we continue to look to other ways to scale up our consulting group, particularly inorganically in addition to the organic things that we're doing. So you will continue to see us looking at consulting companies as part of our inorganic screen. I would say that in terms of areas of focus, we will continue to deepen in the industries that we serve our consulting capability. We're also looking to scale up technology consulting in particular areas that relate to digital around cloud migration. You will see us scaling up. We've already done, as you know, a few acquisitions in what I think of as the front end, the business model side of digital, so experience, design, creative, human factors, all of those kinds of things which are very consultative in nature. And then the last part of your question relates to integrating consulting more tightly in the client interface, and that's certainly something that we're doing. We've moved now increasingly to a model where, in addition to having client partners on our biggest clients, which is the historical model, we're also infusing the client interface with more dedicated, more full-time consultants from the Cognizant business consulting team. So all of that very much in the works and continues to scale up, so hopefully that addresses all the parts of your questions. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: And with that, I think we're just about out of time. So I want to end by thanking everybody again for joining us today. Thanks very much for your questions. And as always, we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Cognizant delivered strong second quarter results. Q2 revenue was $3.67 billion, which is at the high end of our guided range and up 8.9% year over year. Three of our four business segments were strong contributors to our performance. Healthcare, Products and Resources, and Communications, Media and Technology averaged double-digit growth rates. And our digital-related revenues continue to grow well above company average. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.93. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved sequentially from 18.9% to 20%. In light of our strong first half results, we have raised the lower end of our full-year guidance range. We now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $14.7 billion and $14.84 billion. And as we continue to invest in the business for growth, we expect our full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 19.5%. We've now delivered two consecutive quarters of solid performance in 2017. This is a result of our strong and distinctive position in the marketplace and our ability to execute against the large opportunity in front of us. During recent earnings calls and investor conferences, we've discussed our plan to accelerate Cognizant's shift to digital services and solutions. As a reminder, the three elements of our plan are : one, to invest in and scale our digital practices to solve clients' current and emerging challenges; two, to continue to invest in our core business, which remains very relevant as we accelerate our shift to digital; and three, to implement our margin improvement and capital return programs. We believe our performance through the first half demonstrates the consistency of our execution against this plan. So this morning, I'd like to highlight our progress in helping clients achieve the full value of digitizing their entire enterprises, or what we call being digital at scale. For clients, digital at scale is both their defining competitive challenge and their long-term direction. Now that digital is mainstream, enterprise transformation is no longer an elective. It's mandatory for competing effectively. This enterprise-wide effort is about remaking their business models, operating models, and technology models, all three simultaneously, so it's a heavy lift. As a result, clients need more from us than ever before. They're seeking our expertise to reimagine, redefine, and transform their businesses to create new sources of value. And that's why we've invested in and continue to scale our three practice areas, which run across our business segments. They are Cognizant Digital Business, Cognizant Digital Operations, and Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology. Cognizant Digital Business now harnesses the expertise of more than 40,000 digital professionals who focus on developing virtual channels with customers and creating smart products. These digital business experts identify insights, develop strategies, and they design, prototype, and scale digital experiences to reshape clients' products and business models, all of this effort in generating new growth. Turning to Cognizant Digital Operations, our team is drawing on deep process and technology knowledge to help clients reengineer, digitize, manage, and operate their core business processes to lower costs and deliver growth. Within digital operations, we're making good progress building repeatable industry utilities both organically and through acquisitions. As part of our extended strategic relationship with Health Care Services Corporation, we announced an agreement in June to acquire TMG Health, a subsidiary of HCSC and a leading national provider of business process services for Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and managed Medicare plans. TMG Health will further strengthen our scalable business process and service on BPaaS solutions for the government and public health programs markets. Along with building industry utilities, we are continuing to push the envelope of the intelligent automation of clients' repeatable vertical processes. Examples include mortgage document processing, insurance claims processing, and medical claims management. In these cases, we're applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to bring significant efficiencies to tasks such as adjudicating and processing claims, reconciling invoices, and retrieving and comparing complex data. Cognizant robots based on our own automation technology along with other intelligent automation solutions now process hundreds of thousands of transactions a day for several of our customers across industries. Turning to Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology, we're working with clients to simplify, modernize, and secure their heritage IT infrastructure and applications. For example, as our clients look to create an agile, secure, and resilient platform, we're increasingly helping them migrate workloads to the cloud. Cloud migration and operation, which take many forms, have become a significant opportunity for us. For example, in May we moved our flagship TriZetto products to the Microsoft Azure cloud and launched our TriZetto Healthcare Cloud Solution, a secure compliant SaaS platform for healthcare players of any size. With our new TriZetto Healthcare Cloud Solution, the more than 300 active TriZetto clients now have the option to migrate their on-premise software to the cloud, and we can help them with the services to do just that. Once their workloads are migrated, we can provide ongoing technology services to securely manage and maintain the software or even move them to a BPaaS model where the Cognizant Digital Operations team can manage their end-to-end business and technology operations. There's another way of helping clients take advantage of cloud computing's agility, flexibility, and cost savings, and that's by moving their custom applications to cloud platform-as-a-service environments. For example, we've expanded our alliance with cloud native leader Pivotal to speed the enterprise-wide adoption of cloud applications and software platforms. And by the way, Cognizant now has more than 4,000 cloud professionals, the majority certified on Pivotal, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Now cloud migration is just one example of how the Digital Systems & Technology team works with clients. In the course of simplifying, modernizing, and securing clients' heritage IT environments, our team is working to ready their technology backbones for the rigorous demands of an always-on, high-throughput, highly secure environment, which is typical of large digital deployments today. In this way, the knowledge of our clients' technology environments, built up over many years, has become a significant advantage in our ability to provide them with the technology transformation services. Now the way we pull together the full range of services and solutions from our three practice areas is through Cognizant Consulting. As these practices work with clients to transform their business, operating, and technology models, Consulting makes their journey faster and smoother. Now nearly 6,000 strong, our consultants advise CEOs, CFOs, chief operating officers, and line of business heads in addition to the CIOs we've long worked with on issues that cut across strategy, operations, and technology. Consulting is a powerful enabler for our practices and continues to drive large transformational deals for us. And I'm pleased to report that IDC has now positioned Cognizant as a leader, one of only four in its global MarketScape for digital transformation, consulting, and systems integration services. To sum up, as our second quarter results confirm, we continue to grow our business while shifting an increasing focus to enabling digital transformation. Most businesses today recognize the need to go all in on digital. They know they can't simply glue digital solutions onto industrial business models. So clients need a partner with the proven ability to transform their entire enterprises. We believe Cognizant is one of the few companies with the range of knowledge and capabilities that clients need to be fully digital. And therefore, the market is moving our way, directly into the wheelhouse of our expertise. We think this transformation mandate will drive our success for years to come. We're committed to fully executing our strategic plan and extending our lead in digital, and that's how we will sustain our momentum in 2018 and beyond. And now over to Raj, who will provide examples of how we're building repeatable industry-specific solutions for clients to take advantage of this opportunity. Raj? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thanks, Frank. Like other members of our leadership team, I spend much of my time with our strategic clients. And I listen for new ways to add value to their businesses, including how to help speed their transformation journey. Our clients of course pay close attention to the rising expectations of their customers and the competitive moves of their peers, so they know how fast things are changing and how easy it is to be left behind if their business, operating, and technology models are not digital through and through. We're responding by investing in the build-out of repeatable industry-specific solutions that we can deploy across our practices. These platforms solve pressing problems and deliver measurable results. Frank talked about clients needing to digitize their entire enterprises, so let's look at a few examples of how they're deploying digital at scale. Many consumer product companies today are running to catch up to their retailers' new expectations for engaging customers. Retailers expect relevant product suggestions and self-service channels as well as speed and convenience when placing orders with their suppliers. In response, Cognizant has developed a next-gen sales platform that enables businesses to acquire and retain more customers and sell more product. Next-gen sales is built on our Onvida SaaS platform, which is a cloud-based and omni-channel. You may recall that Onvida also serves as the foundation for the physician and patient communication network of LifeBridge Health, a client I talked about last quarter. To create next-gen sales, we have integrated digital commerce, email marketing, account acquisition, and advanced analytics in one platform. Consider the impact of this platform on a large consumer products client. This organization needed to replace its traditional phone-based sales operation with a digital ordering and service platform, a true digital commerce and marketing portal. They also wanted to become more effective at cross-selling and upselling products by applying advanced analytics. In just a few quarters, we ramped from inception to production. We are now in the process of onboarding their thousands of B2B customers as we move more than 25% of their phone transactions to digital channels. Among the benefits they will see are : a significant uplift in revenue; a double-digit reduction in operating costs; and a far more compelling customer experience. Many companies face similar challenges and need cloud-based digital commerce solutions, so we see plenty of market opportunity for our next-gen sales platform. Another area where operating models need to be modernized and automated is workflows. To bring intelligence to these workflows, we've developed and are deploying our proprietary digital automation fabric. This fabric combines image recognition, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and process automation. Here are two examples of clients applying our advanced framework. For a leading mortgage information service provider, we've worked to redesign the workflows of their loan origination, servicing, and support functions. The result, our implementation reduces staff by a third and can pass (14:55) more than 200 million pages a year with data accuracy that exceeds 99%. And for a global property and casualty insurer, our deployment has substantially reduced unnecessary claims and saved tens of millions of dollars. We continue to expand this framework to other industry solutions. Now I want to turn to the financial performance of our business segments and geographies. Let's start with banking and financial services. Second quarter revenues were up 4.1% year over year, driven mostly by our growth in insurance. In insurance, we're seeing broad-based growth across clients and strong demand for multi-service line managed service deals. The overall performance of our banking clients has improved from the first quarter, but we still see large money center banks taking a conservative approach to their spending and continuing to focus on optimizing their cost structures. This is being partly offset by continued strong growth in our mid-tier accounts. In healthcare, our second quarter revenues were up 9.5% year over year, driven by both our life science and payer clients. Broadly, we've seen a healthy pickup in demand across our payer clients. This includes pent-up demand from those healthcare payers involved in M&A activity last year. The healthcare industry continues to shift from fee-for-service to value-based care models. In response, healthcare organizations seek new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiency and lowering medical costs. These competitive pressures persist despite continued uncertainty about the ACA's future. We've invested heavily in our healthcare practice, creating a differentiated offering that has positioned us well to meet evolving client demand. And we're actively helping many of our clients manage through this transition. Let's turn to our other business segments, Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology. Today they make up over a third of our total company's revenue and are meaningful contributors to our growth and our portfolio diversification. Products and Resources grew 13.2% year over year as a result of continued strong performance with our manufacturing and logistics clients. As these clients sensor-enable their products, they're embracing enterprise digital transformation. To harness the power of their connected products, we must rearchitect and transform their supporting business processes as well as simplify and modernize their technology models. That's how they'll create new digital products and drive new revenue streams. Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter of broad-based growth, up 16.8% year over year. Our clients in CMT are focused on creating a differentiated experience that delivers personalized content to their customers. Doing so requires each client to efficiently and effectively manage content, from acquisition through targeted distribution and analytics. We're responding with a repeatable digital content operations solution. It uses human intervention, machine learning, and digital platforms to ensure the right content is viewed by the right person at the right time and place. Now let's look at our performance in emerging geographies. Europe was up 5.7% year over year after a 6.1% negative currency impact. This was driven by strength on the continent in key markets such as France and the Netherlands and by strategic investments made in the second half of 2016. By the way, earlier this month we opened our new London Digital Business Collaboratory. This co-lab combines human-centric design with digital technologies to enable clients to deliver engaging new experiences for their customers. To close out our geographic discussion, we had continued strong growth in the rest of the world, which was up 21.2% year over year. This growth was driven by key Asia-Pacific markets such as India and Australia. And just as we have done in continental Europe, we're building a strong local presence and investing both organically and inorganically in these emerging markets. In recent calls, we've talked about Cognizant's evolving workforce and delivery. I'd like to add a few points to this discussion. The engines of our digital practice areas are our talented and deeply skilled professionals. To ensure they stay on digital's cutting edge, we're investing tens of millions of dollars this year to continuously deepen and broaden their skills in areas such as analytics, artificial intelligence, data science, and digital security. Cognizant is also building skills and capabilities in local communities where we operate around the world. One way is by partnering with educational institutions to establish and fund retraining programs in high-demand digital technologies. For example, we partner with Per Scholas, a national organization to create a job training program in the south Bronx. It's designed to help New Yorkers access career opportunities in tech, and we plan to hire at least 350 of the program's initial graduates for our client sites in New York's five boroughs. We've also been developing similar training programs in Des Moines, Tampa, Phoenix, and Charlotte as well as internationally. For example, in Singapore we're partnering with educational institutions to provide the local community with STEM-related training. And in Switzerland, we run an apprentice program that trains students in application development and testing. In short, our company runs on talent, and we remain committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent in the world. To wrap up, we're driving digital scale by building repeatable industry-specific solutions that enable clients to add significantly more value to their businesses. Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to cover our financial performance. Karen? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. Q2 performance continued to be strong, and we made significant progress on each element of our overall plan. Second quarter revenue of $3.67 billion was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 8.9% year over year. We had a negative currency headwind that impacted year-over-year revenue growth by $35 million, or 100 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and realignment charges, was 20%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.93. In the second quarter, we continued to execute the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, with completion expected during the third quarter. And today we declared our second quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on August 22. This dividend will be payable on August 31. Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services represented 58.7% of revenue, and outsourcing services 41.3% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 11.4% year over year, driven by an increased demand for digital solutions. Outsourcing services revenue grew 5.6% from Q2 a year ago. The slower growth in outsourcing is largely attributable to the timing of the ramp-up of several client engagements and clients continuing to optimize their spend in certain areas such as application maintenance. We expect growth in our outsourcing services to improve in the second half, as projects ramp and demand in digital operations and infrastructure services remains strong. During the second quarter, 38% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts. We continue to make progress toward shifting the mix of our business over the longer term towards more fixed-price or managed services arrangements. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 343. And now moving to an update on margins, in Q2 we took some actions that will improve our cost structure and operating margins while allowing us to continue to invest in the business for growth. These actions resulted in approximately $39 million of charges related to the realignment program, primarily from severance cost, including those associated with the voluntary separation program that was initiated and concluded in the second quarter. Of the $39 million of realignment charges, $35 million was for the roughly 400 associates who accepted our voluntary separation package. We expect approximately $60 million of annualized savings as a result of the VSP. During the remainder of 2017, we expect to incur additional cost related to advisory fees, severance, lease termination, and facility consolidation costs. We remain committed to our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019, and to date have made good progress towards this target. We've made good headway in Q2 driving utilizations higher by slowing the pace of our hiring and improving resource alignment to our reskilling and multi-skilling programs. These adjustments are structural changes that will help improve our profitability through greater operational efficiency while continuing to provide sufficient resources to support the growth of the business. While our overall head count decreased by approximately 4,400, gross hires were 10,800 in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 23.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, increased from 17.1% in the year-ago period. Our attrition level was higher than normal given reductions resulting from performance evaluations and the voluntary separation program. While we will of course carefully manage head count, we will continue to hire and invest in critical skills needed to grow our digital business, and we expect attrition to decline in the coming months. Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 76%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program was 80%, and onsite utilization was 93%. We expect these ratios to continue to improve over the remainder of the year, as the full benefit of our resource alignment program comes through. Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $4.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was down by $900 million from December 31 and $188 million from the year-ago period, reflecting the use of cash on hand to primarily fund the ASR. Receivables were $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 73 days, marginally higher than last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $409 million, up from $395 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 61% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $991 million at the end of the quarter, which included a $150 million outstanding balance on our revolver. As previously mentioned, as part of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders, we launched a $1.5 billion ASR in March. At that time, we received and retired 21.5 million shares, a portion of the total expected shares to be repurchased under the ASR. We expect to complete the transaction during the third quarter, at which time the total number of shares to be delivered will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price during this period. Our diluted share count decreased to 591 million shares for the current quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full-year 2017. Following our strong first half performance, we are raising the low end of our full-year 2017 guidance range, and we now expect revenue to be in the range of $14.7 billion to $14.84 billion, or growth of 9% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the third quarter of 2017, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.73 billion to $3.78 billion. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.94. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 592 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. For the full year 2017, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be at least 19.5% and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $3.67. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 595 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 23%. This guidance also includes the impact of the $1.5 billion ASR. We will provide additional details on full share count impacts once the purchase has been completed. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, and realignment charges. For the full year, it also excludes the recognition of the Q1 income tax benefit that was previously unrecognized. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to immigration or tax policies. In summary, we have continued our momentum from the strong start to 2017, and we expect to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth this year along with a substantial capital return to shareholders. Operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if we could just touch on your outlook for the growth in the healthcare space briefly. Obviously, we've heard across the space that in light of the uncertainty around repeal/replace and the Affordable Healthcare Act (sic) [Affordable Care Act] that there's some hesitancy with regard to budgets. So I'm curious in terms of what you're seeing on the budget conversation side with your clients, how much is being held back versus how much is a recovery in pent-up spending demand. And then maybe as a follow-up, any pressure on the BPO or BPaaS side as a result of some of the larger payers pulling out of exchanges? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hey, Brian, this is Raj. Look, I think when you look at healthcare, we've invested very heavily on our healthcare practice, and it's really created a differentiated offering which has positioned us well. And if you look at the entire practice, with what's happening with the healthcare ecosystems, with the providers, the payers, and the pharma, with all the collaboration that's going on there, and these are all big practices for us, so I think that we're positioned very well in healthcare. And in addition to that, we've talked about last year we had a couple large M&A transactions, and obviously with those going away, you see a lot of the pent-up demand. So there's still some uncertainty with what happens with the ACA. But overall, I think this year and going into next year with the position we are, we're well positioned. Regarding some of the BPO, we haven't seen any impact on that at all. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Karen, this one is probably for you, just a question around the margin plan and your hiring plans. First, just relative to where you were six months ago when you put forward the margin plan, would you characterize the actions you've taken so far as going better than expected or in line with expected? And then a related question, you mentioned that the gross hiring in the quarter was 10,800 folks. Can you give a sense for the skill mix and locations of those folks and in particular whether they're coming in at a higher revenue per head level? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Sure, Lisa, so I think in terms of overall plans and margin trajectory, I think we're right on track. I think Q2 was a little stronger than we expected. Headcount came down a little faster than we thought and utilization came up a little bit faster than we thought it might, so I think that was positive as we get into the back half of the year, though obviously we'll have raises and promotions. And I would not expect head count to decline from here. It will actually start to tick back up as we continue to invest for growth and as we look forward to next year and what our plans are for growth there, so I think we reached a low point, at least for 2017 anyhow. In terms of the hiring, as you mentioned, we added 10,800 gross hires during the quarter. As has been the case for the last several quarters now, you're really seeing a shift mix towards more of the digital skills, higher-end consulting, designers, the data scientists, et cetera, folks who can support our infrastructure business, and then certainly the digital operations business as well, which is experiencing high growth rates. So it's really a mixture of those three sets of skill types. In terms of the onsite/offshore ratio, we haven't seen a significant change there. You'll see head count shifted a little bit onsite this quarter, but that was really mainly because of the decline in head count for the quarter. So from a hiring perspective, hiring hasn't really shifted from quarter to quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the financials vertical, obviously muted spending, conservative spending from the banks at this point. Maybe just talk about what you think gets them unstuck in terms of their discretionary spending plans and whether you have any visibility in terms of bookings, that that's actually going to happen before year-end. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hi, Jim. This is Raj. So look, I think the overall financial services, I think if we look at the entire practice, obviously insurance continued doing well. Where the challenge is, is a little bit on the banking side. And as we talked about, regional banks are healthy, strong growth. Where we're challenged is on a couple of the large money-center banks. The good news here is obviously we're in a better position than I think we were at this time last year with them. But as we look out, they're still very much focused on the cost side and optimizing that, but we are, obviously, engaged with many of them on digital-type engagements. Now as these projects become larger scale enterprise initiatives, I think we're well positioned to benefit from that. But right now, that's our focus area right now in terms of continuing to invest and continuing to be well positioned for those large enterprise transformations. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning and congratulations. A quick question, the TMG Health deal, is that in your guidance or not, and about how much would it contribute this year? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Ed, this is Karen. We have really not baked in any significant revenue from TMG. As you know, that deal still requires regulatory approval. So in the guidance, we did not bake anything in until we get a little bit more clarity \u2013 or anything significant until we get a little bit more clarity around the timing of those approvals. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys, just a question on the overall environment. First, what areas are showing strength versus the original plan? Obviously, we saw the lower end of guidance increase, and maybe you can hone in a little more on the healthcare financial side. But really when we think about \u2013 you're trending at about 10% growth year to date, year over year, and comps look like they get easier in the second half. So is there anything we should consider in terms of elements on guidance being conservative or any other factor that would cause a deceleration in the second half? Thanks, guys. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Why don't I take that, Darrin? It's Frank. I would say we've invested significantly, as you know, over the last years in building and realigning our business around these three practice areas that I talked about that cut across our business segments. And we think we're really well positioned right now to capture the emerging and evolving demand for digital solutions, so I think that's the core driver of our growth. As I said in my prepared comments, three out of our four business segments grew when taken together on average double digits, so strong growth. Financial Services was the only business segment that didn't have strong year-over-year growth. So we feel like we're well positioned. We feel like the solution set that we've been building with these three practice areas is resonating in the marketplace, and we're well positioned. I think as we look to the back half of the year, it's largely that that gave us the confidence to take the lower end of our guidance range up. But just to set the expectation, I would say given where we are in the year at this point, there's not that much time in our business. We don't have a lot of runway here to deliver above the high end of our range. So we think it's a prudent range that we've given you in the 9% to 10% range. I don't think there's a lot above that, but I feel very good about how we're positioned as I think about 2018 and beyond. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: I think, Darrin, if I could just add to Frank's comments, if you look at Q3 and Q4, it's just for argument's sake you assume that we're in the middle of the range. I think you'll actually see the growth versus last year \u2013 growth rates in Q3 and Q4 would actually be higher than in 2016. So I don't think we're seeing a decelerating trend there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with our question. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys, congrats on the solid results. I want to ask on the non-GAAP operating margin. It came in at 20% in 2Q 2017. I guess I'm curious. Why wouldn't that adjusted operating margin continue at or above that 20% level in the second half? Maybe it has to do with some of the raises and promotions, but I thought there would be some other offsets, but just curious on that. And then secondly, looking at the implied 4Q 2017 guidance, it looks like stronger than anticipated sequential revenue growth in that fourth quarter. What's driving that? Thanks so much. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Bryan, this is Karen. Let me take that. So margins in the back half of the year, there will be a couple of things that will happen. One is we will have raises and promotions kicking in later this year. The other thing, as we mentioned earlier, while we have not assumed a lot of revenue from the TMG contract, there are some ramp-up costs that are already starting to take place that will accelerate as we get into the back half of the year before the contract even moves over officially. And then obviously, we want to continue to invest for growth. So as we always have in the past, when we used to talk about a 19% to 20% range and that we would invest above that to continue to drive growth, the same story holds true this year. So as we think about what we need for next year and beyond to really continue to drive the digital transformation, we will continue to invest. As I mentioned, we would expect head count to certainly not decline any further and, if anything, will start to come back up a little bit as we get back into the back half of the year. So all of those will lead to some decline in margin essentially versus Q2. And as we said earlier, we remain committed to be at least 19.5% for the year and feel that we're very comfortably on track for the 22% in 2019. As it relates to Q4 revenue, I think certainly we are seeing some good growth as we get into the back half of the year. The pipeline continues to be strong. We're seeing a nice recovery in the healthcare practice. So I think we're certainly shaping up for a very nice Q3 and Q4 as we get into the back half of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good morning, nice quarter. Karen, how much inorganic growth is factored in that 9% to 10% number for the year? And then just in general, I think, Raj, you spoke about a couple of large banks that are maybe a bit weaker in terms of performance. Are they predominantly Europe-based, European, maybe some color on that? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Sure, Moshe, I'll take the first part of that and turn it over to Raj for the BFS question. We have not baked any incremental inorganic revenue into our guidance for the remainder of the year. And obviously, we've done a couple of very small deals this year, but nothing that's material in the current run rate either, so the 9% to 10% is essentially organic revenue. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Moshe, the large money central banks obviously have both a European and U.S. presence. So I think you're seeing softness there because of the discretionary work not kicking in as fast as we would like it. Now again, like I said, we're engaged in a lot of the digital initial work with those banks. And as these banks continue to get healthier, I would expect that you would start seeing some more of the enterprise transformation initiatives that we're expecting. And I think we're well positioned. If you look at it from the business to the operations to the technology layers, I think there are very few companies that can help these banks. And so that's obviously areas that we're investing in, and we're hopeful for future growth as they get healthier. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, nice results here. Just \u2013 I think it's smart to not include TMG Health, I'm just curious about the BPaaS pipeline. How does that look today? How active is it? And then on TriZetto cloud, will you actively mine your legacy accounts to convert them to cloud? Is there any way to size the impact of this potential work if you flip the whole portfolio to cloud? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hi, Tien-Tsin. It's Frank. Let me try to take that. Look, the BPaaS pipeline is really healthy right now. We feel very, very good about the TriZetto BPaaS, the healthcare BPaaS opportunities. Obviously, TMG Health is part of a relationship, BPaaS relationship that we are building with TMG's parent, HCSC. And so that's just one example that we feel good about where we are with healthcare BPaaS. And I think that it's fair to say that our strong performance \u2013 part of our strong performance in healthcare this second quarter and going forward is the result of the investments that we've made in the scaling up of our BPaaS offerings, so good traction there. As I said in my prepared remarks, the healthcare cloud, the TriZetto Healthcare Cloud that we launched on Microsoft Azure, it's still early days. We have 300 active TriZetto clients that we could migrate over. We absolutely will go back to them and work with them on the migration. And as I said, the economics will generally be a one-time revenue opportunity for us to migrate but then an ongoing revenue opportunity for us to manage, maintain, monitor, upgrade, support those implementations once they're in our cloud. And then of course, there's an additional opportunity beyond that, which is converting them to our full BPaaS offering once they're on our cloud, so I think it's a multi-layer opportunity. Given that the 300 clients range from small health plans all the way up to the very biggest health plans, each individual opportunity I think is quite different and varied in size. And so I'm not going to give you an overall opportunity, but 300 clients and I think multi-layers of the opportunity as I look over multiple years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just on automation, can you give us an update on your automation investments and your progress there? Any quantitative details you could also share, whether it's level of FT (47:38) savings or just client-based implementations? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: It's Frank. I would say that we continue to push forward actively across many areas of the business in looking at applying advanced automation. And I would just remind you that historically, we've always had a practice of automating in our businesses, in our practices. So my comments here are related specifically to what I think of as advanced automation that makes use of new technologies like robotic process automation and artificial intelligence and machine learning and so on and so forth. We gave you a few examples during our prepared remarks in our Digital Operations business. We have several clients. We have a proprietary Cognizant technology that came to us as part of the TriZetto acquisition, which we've now expanded, not just to serve healthcare clients but to serve a broad range of clients. That combined with the work we're doing with third-party automation providers, we now have hundreds of thousands of \u2013 we process hundreds of thousands of transactions across many clients. But we're not stopping there. We are working to automate in our Digital Systems & Technology business, particularly infrastructure, application value management, quality engineering services. All of these are opportunities for us to automate, and we continue to do that. So that's the second part of it. The third part of it is that as we're building out industry solutions, as Raj spoke about, we often find that, for example, in the digital automation fabric that Raj mentioned, machine learning and artificial intelligence are important components there as well. So across the business, we continue to push forward very hard in automation. It's hard to give you quantitative numbers. We're seeing automation benefits anywhere from 10%, 20% productivity to 30% productivity. There's a wide range in there. And I think we'll continue to see those benefits as the impact of automation broadens across the business. And I think that's part of the reason that we will continue to drive utilization higher as we automate more. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is Damian Wille on for Ramsey. I'm hoping you can help us frame how much of your digital sales come from cross-sell versus signing a new logo. And along the same lines, if you could speak to how much of the digital cross-sales you think of as a push from you or a pull from the client. Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hi, Damian, it's Frank. Let me try to address that. I would say just it has been historically been Cognizant's pattern that in any period \u2013 month, quarter, year \u2013 the vast majority of our revenues come from cross-sell to existing clients. The foundation of our business model, as you know, is serving a small number of clients, serving them very deeply, building multiyear-long relationships with our clients. So that continues to be the case with digital. I would remind you that core to our competitive advantage in digital is this notion that we're able to use the knowledge that we have of our clients' technology environments, our clients' operating model to help them as they look at transforming their business model. And so our perspective on digital is this transformation of the business model, the operating model, and the technology model simultaneously. That's really where we feel we have a really strong core competitive advantage, and that advantage is strongest where we have existing relationships. And we've had a long history of serving the client and understand their technology and operating models in detail. So I would say that a significant portion, certainly the majority of our digital revenue comes from cross-selling to existing clients. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Joseph A. Vafi - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I was wondering if you could comment on sustainability of onsite utilization rates at this level if hiring picks up again and if shift to digital drives shorter project durations and potentially a higher onsite mix. Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Joseph, this is Karen. I'll talk about that, and obviously Raj and Frank can chime in. But running at 93%, where we were for Q2, is fine. Onsite utilization, as long as it doesn't get above say 95%, is absolutely fine. We can continue to grow at the pace at which we expect to continue to invest in the business. So while it certainly came up from Q1 over the last couple of quarters, utilization has ticked down both onsite and offshore. So bringing it back up into a 93% \u2013 94% range is very comfortable for us and we can continue to invest and drive the growth that we want. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: I have nothing to add to that, Joe. We could say that as we continue the process of building out regional centers in the U.S. as opposed to our historical model where folks have been more onsite in our client locations, I think that that will help drive utilization actually higher, because when we have people in a physical location, our ability to redeploy them across clients and so on and so forth, the project then becomes higher. Now that's a longer-term trend. Our journey of building out regional centers is well underway, but we have some ways to go on that. So I think as regional centers become a greater portion of our overall onsite workforce, I think that will be a contributor to being able to take onsite utilization up higher. And I think, operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Yes, our final question will come from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys, congrats and thanks for fitting me in. So it looks like these digital projects are certainly gaining scale and clients clearly value your consulting and advisory services. Can you talk a little bit more about your consulting capabilities and how you're looking to scale at onsite hiring and leveraging consultants on management? And part two of that question is the impact on margins by hiring more onsite consultants. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Let me try to address that. So first just the data, as said in my prepared remarks, consulting is now just shy of 6,000 people. It has been a focus of ours for more than a decade. We continue to grow it. Our consulting capability is \u2013 I would say in the last few years we've really, really focused it and emphasized the vertical aspect of consulting very, very hard. So I think our 6,000 consultants, the vast majority of them are deep domain experts in the industries where Cognizant is strong. And increasingly now the work they do is very focused on digital transformation and leading various aspects of our clients' digital transformations. We will continue to grow, and we will continue to scale Consulting. We remain very committed to that business. You're absolutely right. The Consulting team is becoming a more and more integral part of our client account management teams as they build long-term relationships with clients beyond the technology organizations, and so that's a trend that we view as positive and will continue. And then in terms of margin impact, I think proportionately I don't see Consulting growing dramatically as an overall part of the total company revenue, so I don't think that it has a meaningful margin impact one way or the other. We continue to be very comfortable with our ability to grow that part of the business and still maintain our overall margin goals as we think about 2018 and 2019. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: And so with that, I'll wrap up. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions, and we look forward to talking with all of you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Cognizant delivered solid third quarter results. Q3 revenue was $3.77 billion, which is at the high end of our guided range and up 9.1% year-over-year. Three of our four business segments were strong contributors to our performance. Healthcare, product and resources and communications and media and technology averaged double digit growth rates. Our third quarter digital related revenue grew well above company average. And to further enhance our digital capabilities, we recently announced two acquisitions. Netcentric, a leading independent Adobe partner in Europe and a leading provider of digital experience and marketing solutions for some of the world's most recognized brands. And Zone, a UK based leading independent full service digital agency that specializes in interactive digital strategy, technology and content creation. These acquisitions will broaden our portfolio of digital services and solutions. To continue with our financial results, non-GAAP EPS quarter for the quarter was $0.98 and our non-GAAP operating margin was 20%. For 2017, we delivered three consecutive quarters of strong execution at the top and bottom lines. This consistent performance underscores the soundness of our strategy and investments and the continuing strong demand for our portfolio of services. Turning to guidance, we are again raising the low end of our revenue guidance range and expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.78 billion and $14.84 billion. And we expect our full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 19.6%. Now, we're in the business to help our clients adapt, compete and grow in the face of continual shifts and disruptions within their markets. Therefore, we've systematically built out significant capabilities to enable clients to transition from the physical to the digital world. Today making that shift has become mandatory for them. Most clients now know they must become digital enterprises themselves or more precisely, the right mix of physical and digital. So we work with them to transform their business, operating and technology models simultaneously. This three layer transformation is what we mean when we talk about digital at scale. In prior calls, we've discussed how we enabled this transformation, applying our deep industry knowledge, innovation, advanced technologies and consulting expertise. More recently, we've also been emphasizing our client co-innovation centers and our platform based software and solutions. The result of developing and integrating all these capabilities and intellectual property is that we are turning Cognizant into a different kind of company that's envisioning and building the digital economy. Increasingly, we see ourselves as a leading firm that develops repeatable solutions by infusing software and services to deliver business outcomes that make a real difference to clients. And this morning, I'd like to highlight how this new Cognizant is resonating with clients and winning in digital. The best place to begin is with a few client examples of digital at scale, delivering a competitive upside for Cognizant. For a US car company that's preparing for a future of ride sharing and driverless cars, a team of consultants, developers and social scientists from Cognizant and ReD associates help to reimagine the relationship between driver and automaker. And then they jointly develop a marketplace that offers mobility services to help drivers move around more easily and access services remotely from vehicle diagnostics to smart parking reservations. For a leading financial institution facing slowing growth in a major business, Cognizant developed an artificial intelligence enabled robotic investment advisor that would appeal to a new market of approximately 90 million millennials and that will enable the firm to achieve its goal of doubling retail assets under management by 2020. To envision and build this digital solution, we brought a cross-functional team from the client together with Cognizant digital business designers, strategists, technologists and financial services experts. And we also helped a leading life sciences company bring to market new drugs with proven therapeutic benefits for smaller patient populations. We assembled a team of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and technology and design consultants to drive efficiencies in the clinical development process and apply digital marketing techniques. As a result, the client was able to achieve the goal of bringing new therapies to even relatively small patient populations. Absent this new approach, these drugs might not have been economical to develop and market. The upside for Cognizant is that most of the world's companies are now dealing with these digital at scale challenges in one form or another. And therefore, we can keep combining our services and software in new ways to create repeatable solutions for a wide variety of clients. Now, enterprise transformation is such a demanding work that we make sure that all our services and solutions are organized from the client's perspective, which is why last year we established Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant Digital systems and technology. These three practice areas, which run across our business segment, mirror our client needs and the parts of their enterprises they need to transform. And Raj will talk about how our digital practices are progressing in solving client's current and emerging challenges. Within these practices, our value to clients hinges of course on the depth, breadth and currency of our knowledge. So we've been aggressively building high-end digital skills in areas such as data science, design thinking, cyber security, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and automation. But strong digital skills alone are not enough. So, we combine these skills with our industry expertise to speak the language and understand the core processes and technologies of every industry we specialize it. And we draw on this knowledge to build specialized software platforms and industry specific solutions to quickly create new value for clients. You can see all of this come together for example in the way we've invested to extend our leadership as a fully integrated digital healthcare technology and operations provider. We've made major health care investments, beginning with the TriZetto healthcare administration platform, a leading software platform used by payers and providers. Earlier this year, we moved our TriZetto products to the Microsoft Azure Cloud and launched our healthcare cloud solution, a SaaS platform for healthcare payers of any size. And having completed the TMG Health acquisition in August, we've now combined TriZetto with the business process services of TMG. TMG Health has further strengthened our scalable business process as a service or BPAAS solution for the government and public health program markets. These investments along with our market leading footprint in the commercial space establish Cognizant as the top solution provider of enhanced government processed platforms, digital solutions and services for commercial and government managed healthcare programs in the US. Since TriZetto, we have invested in many other platforms in areas such as digital content operations, sales transformation, mortgage servicing and patient safety. All of these technologies and platforms provide the benefit of scale, enabling Cognizant to develop repeatable offerings that can be used by multiple clients across multiple markets. While digital at scale is a heavy lift, Cognizant has the resume to execute this transformation successfully. It starts with a high level of client trust that encourages and enables the successful co-innovation of solutions with clients. Once we've established for the future, we know how to design, prototype and scale digital experiences to reshape clients, products and business models. But building digital experiences for the front end of a client's business is not enough. We have the deep knowledge to help clients reengineer, digitize, manage and operate their core business processes and build software platform for specific processes and industries. We couple this with a mastery of the technologies, software and tools to develop digital solutions as well as the ability to combine digital technologies with clients' heritage systems and applications. And we provide much of this capability to clients using our highly efficient and reliable global delivery model, which works at scale. And finally, we have the global consulting expertise to advice on strategy, operations and technology and orchestrate all of the knowledge, services, software and solutions that come together to enable enterprise transformation. Cognizant bring this entire set of capabilities to the table. That's what continues to differentiate us in the marketplace. And by integrating all of these capabilities and intellectual property, that's how we're turning Cognizant into a different kind of company that's envisioning and building the digital economy. And now over to Raj who will talk about the work our three practices are doing to drive digital at scale for clients and then review our business segment performance. Raj? Raj Mehta : Thanks, Frank. At the core of our competitive advantage in digital is our ability to lead clients through the three layer enterprise transformation Frank just described. This work is the focus of our three practice areas. Cognizant digital business helps clients conduct business digitally by developing virtual channels with customers and creating smart products. Our experts design, prototype and scale digital experiences to reshape clients' products and business models, all aimed at generating new growth. Cognizant digital operations draws on deep process and technology knowledge to help clients reengineer, digitize, manage and operate their core business processes to lower costs and deliver growth. And Cognizant digital systems and technology works with clients to simplify, modernize and secure their heritage, IT infrastructure and applications. In addition, our nearly 6000 consultants as well as CEOs, CFOs, Chief Operating Officers and line of business heads in addition to the CIOs, we've long worked with on issues that cut across strategy, operations and technology. Since digital at scale requires our clients to rebuild all three models, Cognizant will often apply the capabilities of all three practice areas on their behalf. Here's an example of our multi practice efforts. We're partnering with a leading provider of educational content that needed to pivot its business to deliver more affordable next generation learning that is both interactive and immersive. In the first stage of our work, Cognizant digital systems and technology helped the client set up a shared service center. The center consolidated the global systems and technologies, delivering economies of scale and saving tens of millions of dollars and have become the backbone of the clients' more agile and efficient IT operations. In the second stage, our digital business teams worked with the clients to develop a new operating model for content that leads with digital delivery. To achieve this, the operating model including building learner center design labs that will enable experienced based learning. And then the next stage, the prototypes from these labs will be developed into interactive content within their client content operations center, which Cognizant digital operations will run. By the way, this was a consulting led engagement, our consultants define the roadmap for the future of content operations and then put together the full range of services and solutions from our three practice areas. By understanding this transformation journey, our clients will achieve efficiencies that can be reinvested in designing, building and distributing tomorrow's educational content. Now, let's turn to the financial performance of our business segments and geographies. Banking and financial services grew 3.8% year-over-year. We had a solid contribution from our insurance business and double digit growth in our mid-tier banking accounts. This helped to offset the continuing weakness of large money central banks, which remain focused on optimizing their spending on legacy systems and operations as we shift investments to new areas of spend, such as digital. Among our recent wins in this segment is Voya Financial which engaged us for an end-to-end transformation that included infrastructure, security and data center transition. Voya, a long standing client of ours chose Cognizant for this expanding engagement because of our history of reliable delivery and our advanced as a service model, which will enable them to substantially improve service levels, while lowering their costs. In healthcare, our third quarter revenues were up 9.3% year-over-year. We saw consistent demand across peer clients and increasing interest in our digital, analytics, cloud and virtualization solutions. As Frank mentioned, our third quarter acquisition of TMG Health extended our position as a leading software and services healthcare partner. In fact, Cognizant now provides products and services to more than 230 organizations that support a substantial percentage of the Medicare Advantage and manage Medicaid markets. And to further enhance our healthcare consulting expertise, we acquired Top Tier Consulting, a California based healthcare management consulting firm with strength and strategy, operations, IT and business intelligence. We're well positioned to capitalize on the continuing digitization of the healthcare industry as it strives to reduce costs, improve quality of care and deploy new business models. Let's turn to products and resources and communications, media and technology. Products and resources grew 14% year-over-year. We continue to see strong growth with our manufacturing and logistics clients and our energy and utility clients, which offsets sluggish growth in retail. The strength in manufacturing reflects both our emphasis on leading with digital offerings and the fact that CSOs increasingly engage us to create smart products and transform their business models. Communications, media and technology had another strong quarter of broad based growth, up 18.2% year-over-year. Third quarter saw a solid growth across this segment, but in expansion in areas like creating and curating content. Our clients are turning to Cognizant to help them transform the delivery of their customer facing channels by improving the experience with personalized and bridge content. Now, a quick look at our performance by geography. Europe grew 16.9% and the rest of the world was up 19.9% year-over-year. Within Continental Europe, we signed a 10-year agreement to become the strategic provider of IT and business process services for a major Belgian French financial institution. The goal is to transform the technology infrastructure and lay a foundation for more agile, efficient and secure operations. This agreement and the [indiscernible] that Frank discussed. For example, the managed service platform we're developing will provide a utility for processing structured loans for other European clients. Cognizant Progress is receiving broad validation from industry hours. Everest Group named us one of only two star performers at the top of its leaders, for redefining the customer experience with digital. An IFC Research ranks Cognizant as a leader in this cloud provided research, citing our leadership in public cloud infrastructure consulting, implementation services, managed services and brokerage. I'm also pleased to mention that Fortune magazine has named Cognizant to its new Fortune Future 50 list, the rankings of US companies that are best positioned for future growth. Clients turn to us to lead them through their enterprise transformation journeys, because they simply do not have the range of skills to do this work themselves. What's more, the technology is constantly evolving and digitally skilled people remain scarce. Cognizant has long invested heavily in the retaining and reskilling of our associates, but building skills when technology changes today requires an expanded approach. That's why we are pursuing several paths to attract, build and retain the workforce of the future. These include developing and acquiring skills in advanced technologies, exploring new sources of talent and investing in public private partnerships to provide intensive technology training programs. In addition, we're building and expanding our local delivery centers across the globe. That way, we can quickly deploy talent closer to our clients while establishing training hubs with our educational partners to rescale the local workforce. Cognizant is absolutely committed to recruiting and training associates everywhere we operate. To sum up, to stay competitive, our clients are determined to do digital at scale and they view Cognizant as a go to partner to help them become digital enterprises. Karen, over to you. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Raj and good morning, everyone. Q3 performance was solid and we continue to make significant progress on each element of our overall plan. Third quarter revenue of 3.77 billion was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 9.1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses and realignment charges, was 20% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.98. In the third quarter, we completed the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program and today, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on November 20. This dividend will be payable on November 30. Now, let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services represented 58.6% of revenue and outsourcing services 41.4% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 11.3% year-over-year, driven by an increased demand for digital solutions. Outsourcing services revenue grew 6.1% from Q3 a year ago. During the third quarter, 38% of our revenues came from fixed price contracts. We continue to make progress towards shifting the mix of our business over the longer term towards more fixed price or managed services arrangement. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as the potential to generate at least 5 million to 15 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 350. And now moving to an update on margins. In Q3, we continued to take actions that will improve our cost structure and operating margins, while allowing us to continue to invest in the business for growth. These actions resulted in approximately $19 million of charges related to the realignment program, primarily from severance costs incurred in the quarter. Going forward, we expect to incur additional costs related to advisory fees, severance, lease termination and facility consolidation costs. Additionally, as we accelerate our pursuit of broad based high value digital transformation work, we will continue to reassess less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace. We remain committed to reaching our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019 by balancing growth and profitability and to date have made significant progress towards this target. Utilization in Q3 moved higher, as we continued to effect structural changes in our headcount management. We expect that these changes will help improve our resource alignment, help drive greater operational efficiency and thus improve our profitability. While our overall headcount was essentially flat, growth hires were almost 14,000 in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 22.5% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, increased from 16.6% in the year ago period, but declined over 100 basis points from the previous quarter. While our attrition level was higher than normal, partially due to the continuing impact from performance management and severance programs initiated in the first half of the year, we did see an increase in voluntary attrition during the quarter. While we will of course carefully manage headcount, we will continue to hire and invest in critical skills needed to grow our digital business as well as work to bring voluntary attrition back to more normal levels. Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 79%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates joining our training program, was 82% and on-site utilization was 93%. Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.7 billion of cash and short term investments. We had strong operating cash flow in the quarter, generating 773 million, reflecting improved profitability of the business. Receivables were 2.9 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 74 days, down slightly from the year ago period. Our unbilled receivables balance was 403 million, broadly flat from the end of Q2. We built approximately 61% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October. Our outstanding debt balance was 823 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on our revolver. As part of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders, we completed the $1.5 billion ASR in quarter three and received and retired 2.2 million shares in addition to the 21.5 million shares received and retired at the commencement of the ASR in March. Our diluted share count was 592 million shares for the current quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2017. Following our continued strong performance, we are again raising the low end of our full year 2017 guidance range to be in the range of 14.78 billion and 14.84 billion or year-over-year growth of 9.5% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rate at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of 3.79 billion to 3.85 billion. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.95. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 592 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. For the full year 2017, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be at least 19.6% and to deliver a non-GAAP EPS of at least $3.70. This guidance anticipates the full year share count of approximately 595 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 23%. This guidance includes the full impact of the $1.5 billion ASR. We remain committed to our plan to repurchase an additional 1.2 billion by the end of 2018 and we'll provide additional details on that program at a later date. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, acquisition related expenses and amortization and realignment charges. For the full year, it also excludes the recognition in Q1 of the income tax benefit that was previously unrecognized. Our guidance does not account for an extensional impact from events like changes to immigration or tax policies. In summary, we have continued our momentum throughout 2017 and we expect to close out the year with solid revenue and earnings growth along with a substantial capital return to shareholders. Operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just I want to ask actually about your margin performance, especially in SG&A, which stood out, it was especially low versus our model. So a couple of questions there. Just the confidence to have the lower SG&A so far hasn't hurt your sales pipeline, your ability to replenish the pipeline, the backlog and then also just gross margin implications in the fourth quarter and next year, given all the moving pieces with utilization and wages and whatnot. I know, you managed the overall margin, but just kind of any help between the two lines would be appreciated. Karen McLoughlin : This is Karen. I think we've been very thoughtful around cost management this year. We knew going into 2017 based on the work that we did late last year that there were opportunities to more effectively manage our SG&A spend, particularly around the corporate functions and we've talked about things like facilities and other costs within SG&A. So, well, SG&A overall was down in terms of dollars, Q3 versus Q3 of last year. We're very comfortable that we have protected the investments that we need to make to continue to grow the business. And, I think you'll see SG&A move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter as we continue on that path. In terms of gross margin, it is obviously trending a little bit lower than where it had been. Part of what happened in Q3 or a significant part of what happened is that we did take up our variable compensation accrual rates during the quarter. Obviously, the business has performed very well this year. It's been a tough year for a lot of our folks as we've gone through a lot of this transition and so we wanted to ensure that, as we move into next year that we can pay out good variable compensation for the year. So that did put some pressure on the Q3 gross margin as of the year-to-date catch up. What you'll see as we move into Q4 is that raises and promotions will kick in, in Q4 effective in October. Typically that's been in the July timeframe, we did defer that this year with all the transition happening in the company. And then as you said, as we move into 2018 and beyond we'll continue to manage to the operating margin targets that we've set for the organization. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Essex : Karen, I was wondering if you can comment a little bit on contribution of TMG in the quarter, how that might impact your full-year guidance. And the opportunity there is that going to be maybe similar to TriZetto where you have longer sales cycles or how do you think about that and how that kind of builds into the healthcare portion of your platform. Karen McLoughlin : So thanks Brian, so the TMG deal did close towards the end of the third quarter. So there's a small amount of revenue in Q3 for that transaction. As you may know the vast majority of that work is with one client and then there were a number of other third-party clients as part of that contract. It will start to move towards a steady-state essentially in Q4. We have not broken out the size of the transaction. But it is essentially straight line revenue for the next two years and then it will move to more of a transaction based pricing model in the future. There's a combination of contract structures in that deal, but roughly speaking it will be straight line for the next few quarters of revenue. Brian Essex : I know you had some in the healthcare segment exposure to some consolidation, the rumors around a transaction with Aetna and consolidation in the CRO market, are you seeing any of that, it doesn't really seem like you are, but just wondering if you - that's coming up in conversation at all. Karen McLoughlin : Go ahead. I'll let Raj comment on that. Raj Mehta : Look Brain, I think over our healthcare - healthcare just remains strong for us. Nothing or any conversations or impacts right now of any potential acquisitions, I think overall as you know we've invested a lot in our healthcare business. We see strong growth in both the mid-size payers along with large payer company out there. In addition to that we continue to see a lot of opportunities on our BPaaS solutions. Karen McLoughlin : I think a move that remains to be seen what happens if some of those deals go through, the Aetna CVS deal for example. I think it's early to tell at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi, I want to follow on Tien-Tsin's question a little bit on the margins. It looks your guiding operating margins on a non-GAAP basis in Q4 to be called the mid-19 level. And calendar year it sounds Q4 would also still benefit from some workforce realignment. My question is, can I think you said that in next year, calendar '18 you wouldn't anticipate further headcount reductions. But I'm unclear on without the headcount reductions, how do you continue to advance those operating margins, particularly given some of the gross margin pressure that still seems to be exhibiting. If you could talk a little bit about the forces from here, how do you continue to try to march those operating margins up, when most your competitors' margins are eroding. Karen McLoughlin : Keith, let me break that into a few pieces. In terms of the Q4 margin, we are guiding to a slightly lower Q4 margin than Q3 that is because of the raises and promotions that will kick in in October that's typically about 100 basis points of margin decline. We have obviously not paid all of that into our guidance because we will continue to see some of the benefits occurring from the cost optimization that we've taken so far. So that's what's pushing down the Q4 margins. As we move into 2018 and beyond. We haven't really said that you know we haven't made a statement one way or the other frankly about headcount and what will happen to headcount next year. Margin improvement as we move into 2018 and then into 2019, 2018 will be a continuation of the cost savings that we generated this year and a number of those cost savings didn't start until the mid-summer timeframe. So we'll get the full-year benefit of that. There are additional cost saving opportunities that we continue to look at, whether it be around facilities or travel or other types of expenses as well as headcount and what that means going forward. And then as we move further into '18 and into 2019, we have said that a lot of the margin improvement would come from the shift in the business towards the higher, you know, continuing to move towards higher margin digital business as well as CPaaS, our platform business becomes a larger part of the organization and starts to mature and starts to reach strong margin profile in that business as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : I guess another question on this point about, you now, now that you've got utilization levels back to basically their all-time highs, 93 onsite and about 80 offshore. Can you give some detail around, so what you're doing from a pyramid structure and operation efficiency initiatives to centrally take utilization up further as we look forward. I know you've talked about how you're sort of taking Cognizant into a new stage of maturity when it comes to how you're managing the labor model. Can you just give a little bit of color around that? It feels like now you're sort of at the stage where you've gotten - you've kind of gotten back to where you used to be and from here you've got to take it up one leg further. Karen McLoughlin : So Lisa, I think that's fair in a sense. I think with utilization what we've always said is that as the business continues to grow and mature that utilization rate should continue to trend upwards over time. At 93% onsite we can run the business very comfortably. I think you can get to 94, maybe 95, not sure we can get above 95 on a consistent basis. Certainly offshore as we continue to grow we think there's opportunity to continue to take up utilization. It won't be quarter to quarter, but certainly over the long term that trend line should move upwards. I think as you mentioned another one of the big levers we've been looking at is the pyramid. Historically, we have had a more top heavy pyramid than our peer group and in part to the business that makes a lot of sense, and other parts of the business we think there's opportunity to optimize that. We are also starting to see things like automation kick in both on the delivery side of the organization as well as in our corporate function. So if I look at my finance organization for example, we're using automation to help streamline some of our processes in the organization which allows us to scale the business without having to add headcount. So I think you'll see a number of those opportunities over the next three years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jim Schneider : I was wondering if you can maybe just address the financials vertical a little bit. Raj, you provided some helpful color, the difference between the weakness you're seeing from money center banks and with some of the strength in insurance in the smaller banks. Can you maybe give us the sense of, in your client conversations, what they are saying in terms of balancing increased IT budgets potentially in 2018, whether that is part of the conversation or not versus optimization with some legacy systems and kind of directionally where you see their total consulting and outsourcing spend budgets going next year. Raj Mehta : Jim thanks, this is Raj here. So look at overall financial services, its strong growth that we're seeing on the insurance space clients. Continued a lot of work in terms of digital and obviously looking at new areas in terms of continued optimizing work that we're doing at those clients. The banks it's a mixed story, I mean we're you know as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing double-digit growth on the regional banks. But some of the challenges that exist on these large money center banks that we have and there there's I guess a tale of two stories, right. There's obviously there is continual focus on the cost optimization. And they're obviously leveraging that to free up some of the dollars in terms of investing on the digital side of the business. Now the good news is, obviously we're engaged in many of those digital opportunities with those banks. And actually our digital revenues is growing at those banks in line with the rest of the company as well too. But we haven't seen there an influx of new budgets, obviously we're seeing the whole focus of in terms of continued optimization, freeing up dollars and investing on the digital side. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane : Just looking as, Francisco, just an overall feel for how you guys are doing in transitioning Cognizant's business model to this new model to plan to get to 22% adjusted operating margins in two years. Just curious, so we had a plan, app plan everything is going exactly how you thought, just wanted to get just a feel for that. And then Karen just on digital is there a percentage of total revenues digital now represents and maybe the growth rate. Thanks so much. Francisco D'Souza: I'll talk a little bit about the overall plan. I think we're roughly right on track right where we expected to be. I think about the transition or the shift to digital in two pieces that sort of the services that we offer to clients. And I think we continue to make great progress there. I'll let Karen comment on the overall digital revenue, it grew again double digit - at a double digit pace much ahead company average this quarter. The two acquisitions that we announced a few days ago Netcentric and Zone add to that capability. And we feel good about the transition of the service mix to digital. I think it's also important that just to note that as we've said before that today our portfolio if you look at the entire portfolio of digital revenue it is running at a higher margin than the rest of the business. So overall just a very healthy mix shift going on and I think that that will continue to unfold through 2018 and beyond. The other side of that - of this transition that we talked about when we laid out the plan for you a few quarters ago, at the beginning of this year is on the margin improvement side. And I think we've demonstrated there that we're well on track there. This year, if anything I think we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be. That's good. And we'll continue to, you know, we feel very comfortable as Karen said in her prepared remarks with a target of 22% by 2019. And I think we'll just keep executing on that. And I'll turn it Karen to talk about percent of digit revenue. Karen McLoughlin : So we did not break out the percentage of digital revenue this quarter. As you may remember last quarter we said it was about 26% of revenue, it continues to grow upwards of 25% year-over-year and continues to become a larger part of the business each quarter. One of the things we've also been looking at with Raj referred to in his comments about the FS is that we're seeing very nice traction nearly across all of the business units and all of the industry. So continue to see very good progress there and will continue to update as there's relevant information on that metric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Moshe Katri : Going back to the commentary regarding the large money center banks and their spending patterns. Raj, is there any indication about the outlook for 2018, and is there an expectation internally in terms of when some of those deals that you're talking about could actually start converting. Thanks. Raj Mehta : So look it's a little bit too early right now to start looking into 2018. Obviously I think the bigger opportunity comes as what we've always talked about is digital scale. And many of these large money center banks we have numerous engagements going on. But I think as those opportunities become larger that's when we have an opportunity to see back to the growth that we've gotten accustomed to at those banks. Francisco D'Souza: Having said that, Moshe it's Frank, I think it's worth adding one additional piece of color for you which is that, Karen mentioned that last quarter digital revenue as a percent of total company revenue was about 26%. We are right around there in financial services as well. So this isn't a story of we're waiting for digital revenue and financial services to convert. We're already doing a substantial amount of work in digital, in financial services. So I don't think by any stretch that we are not a significant player in financial - in the digital aspects of financial services as these big money center banks start to think about and start to execute on their digital plans. Moshe Katri : But would you say that some of those deals that you're talking to those large banks about could - if they do convert into digital could be pretty significant down the road? Francisco D'Souza: Again, I want to separate. We are already doing a considerable amount of work. So, yet there are deals that if they convert could be significant going down the road, but we are already - the point I was making, Moshe, is that today digital is already and financial services is roughly in line with our company average. So think about the 26% number, we're right around there in financial services. So we're already doing a considerable amount of work in digital and financial services. Karen McLoughlin : Moshe, this is Karen, let me just sort of wrap that. I think as both Frank and Raj talked like strong digital business and banking, I think it is too early to say whether or not that results in a net increase in growth in 2018. We're not making any commentary right now on 2018 or whether we continue to see the shift that we've been seeing with the banks today which is they take money from one pocket in terms of their legacy spend or their business as usual spend and redirect that spend to digital. How that balance plays out in 2018 I think it's too early to tell. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Anil Ramnani with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arvind Anil Ramnani : I just had a question on your healthcare business over the past few years your healthcare capabilities has been materially enhanced based on the internal capabilities, acquisitions, your client base. At the same time, the healthcare market has changed and expected to continue to change with value based care et cetera. How do you all think of the opportunity over this space over the next two three years and how do you feel you all are positioned? Francisco D'Souza: Look I think Arvind, I'll turn it, I'll let Raj answer as well, but it's Frank. Look I think changes is, change plays to our strengths actually. As the healthcare market changes and evolves we have just sort of a very strong end to end portfolio of service offerings whether that's consulting to help our clients figure out what they need to do to respond to the changes, whether that's operating in terms of our BPaaS offerings and our ability to run core parts of the operation for our client or whether that's on the technology front as they think about modernizing and digitizing their technology backbone. I think we're very well positioned both at the business model, the operating model and the technology model level. So as these changes come to healthcare given that we have such a strong portfolio of assets both software assets, intellectual property in the form of our people and capabilities. I think you put that together and we're very - we feel like we're very well positioned for healthcare going forward. Raj Mehta : I would just add to Frank's comments, I think we've obviously seen a lot of traction around our BPaaS solutions. And then strong growth in the payers rate as well. But I think as we move look out, as the healthcare industry continues to evolve, you're starting to see a lot of providers, large providers come up with the own plans. And I think that's a good opportunity for us as well with Evolution, obviously there are showing a lot of interest in our BPaaS solution as well. So I think we're well positioned and continue to look forward for next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller : First question is about EmblemHealth and the impact on the quarter. How much was that still not thrown over from third quarter last year. And I guess that should be to lay out in the fourth quarter. I think we estimated around 100 bps or so to the overall growth rate, but just whether TMG is outstanding there. And then just a follow up on capital allocation, you finished 1.5 billion accelerated buyback. I know you have a couple of billion in your authorization left. I don't remember ever hearing, but can you tell us what you've - what you guys would want to do for capital allocation towards acquisitions, just given the digital push. And on that topic what was inorganic, what contributed to inorganic growth this year from acquisitions. Thanks guys. Karen McLoughlin : So Darrin, this is Karen, let me start and Raj and Frank can join in if necessary. We start with the capital allocation question around the buyback, as you mentioned that we completed the ASR in Q3. We have also committed that between now and the end of 2018, we'll allocate another $1.2 billion back to a buyback program we haven't defined that we'll provide more color on that in an appropriate time. We have not broken out the dollars that we're committing towards M&A. But certainly in our capital allocation strategy we have we've held a nice fair amount for M&A deals. We've talked now for some time about ramping up the volume of those deals. And obviously we've been doing that closed or find rather not closed two deals last week. And certainly our pipeline of M&A deals is quite active and so we would expect to continue to ramp up that volume of deals. And we will keep a nice balance between returning cash to shareholders services both organic and inorganic growth for the organization. In terms of TMG and Emblem, so Emblem as you said did start to lap in the middle of Q3. So small incremental year-over-year revenue growth for Emblem and then in Q4 that will fully lap. And then TMG as we said we haven't broken out the size of the TMG relationship, but it did start in the last part of the third quarter and we'll obviously ramp to full scale in Q4. In terms of overall organic versus inorganic growth, the inorganic growth in 2017 is very small. We had a couple of [indiscernible] so forth, which were all very small deals that we've closed over the last 12 months, a very small percentage of growth this year has been from inorganic. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : I wanted to ask on the marketing related acquisitions you had last week and then others in the past. Can you just talk about how you're integrating them into your tech services or if you're running them autonomously, how that will work? And then what are really the top two or three KPIs you're using to determine the right targets for you? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: It's Frank, let me take that. When closed the two acquisitions will become part of the Cognizant digital business practice area. So recall that as I said in my prepared remarks, we have - and Raj talked about as well, three big practice areas, Cognizant Digital Business, Cognizant Digital Operations and Cognizant Digital Systems and Technology, these two acquisitions will become part of Cognizant Digital Business. We will continue to let them operate relatively independently, but of course we have a synergy plan which is largely focused on revenue synergies around taking their capabilities and taking those to a broad range of Cognizant clients. We do a tremendous amount of marketing work today for our clients across all three practice areas. So in Cognizant Digital Business, we're doing marketing work that relates to content, content creation, marketing, marketing strategy, channels those kinds of things. In Cognizant Digital Operations we're doing marketing related work that's largely around content and content management, content creation, and curation that Raj spoke a little bit about in his prepared remarks. And in Cognizant Digital Systems and Technology, we're doing a lot of marketing work that you can think about in the broad area of marketing technology, right. So across all of our three practice areas, we're doing a significant amount of marketing related work. These acquisitions in a sense will allow us to put a front end on a lot of that work that we're doing and take that to a client in a more integrated and holistic way. And so that's broad plan. So we'll run them relatively independently, let them continue to do the great work that they've been doing for their clients. We'll execute on the revenue synergy by bringing them - largely by bringing them into our clients. We think there maybe some opportunity to cross-sell our traditional services into their clients and we'll continue to execute on that going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Anil Doradla : So Francisco and Karen, you guys talked about the 22% target. So that's about 200, 250 bps from where we're going to exit this year. So if I look at the trajectory, is most of that increase going to be coming in '19 or is it '18 or is it linearly spaced out based on some of the efforts that you guys are doing. Karen McLoughlin : So Anil, we obviously haven't given 2018 guidance yet, but you should expect to see some benefit next year and then the last part of it will be in 2019. Anil Doradla : Francisco, you talked about repeatable business in your opening comments. Are you introducing some new metrics to kind of quantify that? Some are the obvious metrics. But are you creating some new incremental metrics to emphasize on some of that repeatable aspect of the business. Francisco D'Souza: Yeah, I think what I was referring to when I talked about repeatable is the sort of the solution packages and solution offerings that we're creating which we've been talking to you about in the past things like our BPaaS offerings and so on and so forth. By combining sort of our services and software capabilities increasingly together, we're creating these - think of them as solution offerings capabilities that we take to the market. We've always as a company tracked repeat business from our existing clients. And I think that's where you'll really start - where you really see it continue to play out is repeat business from our existing clients because that's going to be the metric that we focus on is to say, are we continuing to be relevant to our existing clients. And to be relevant to our existing clients, we've got to continue to innovate, we've got to continue to find new sources of value and that shows up in repeat business because every year or every period, our clients are assessing the work we're doing for them and they're choosing to give us new work based on the relevance of that work. So the metric that we use internally is repeat business from our existing customer base which is the metric we've been tracking from the beginning as far as I can remember. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. D'Souza for any closing comments. Francisco D'Souza: Well, thanks very much. Look everyone thanks again for joining us today and thanks for your questions. We're pleased with the results this quarter and I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions third quarter 2017 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

The question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Nelson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year\u2019s 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. Additionally, we have loaded an investor presentation onto our website. This presentation covers the key points discussed on this call. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza: Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call. This morning I\u2019d like to cover three topics; first, Cognizant\u2019s current view of the industry and where our clients are headed; second, a few highlights from our 2017 performance, which includes full year revenue growth of nearly 10%; and third, how coming off a solid year, we plan to use our momentum to deliver a strong 2018. Let\u2019s begin with how we see the current environment. In recent years the big story in tech has been the rapid rise of digital native players like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Today another important story is being written with entirely new players. Companies that have long stood as the pillars of our economy are emerging as a new generation of digital heavy weights. These firms many of which are longstanding Cognizant clients, are already leaders in financial services, insurance, healthcare, manufacturing and other industries. With Cognizant as their partner, they are combining their industry expertise and assets built over decades with powerful technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, analytics, robotic process automation, cybersecurity and hybrid cloud to create entirely new performance thresholds and customer experiences. This blending of industrial with digital promises to dramatically improve the way the world\u2019s industries serve our needs and improve our lives. Digital technologies have become so integral to remaking business models and core processes that no enterprise can ignore them and still remain competitive. That\u2019s why the rate of digitization across industries and countries continues to rise, and why digital now accounts for a substantial and growing percentage of new enterprise IT spending. Most clients realize that competition today is not about being either digital or physical, but rather about being both digital and physical. Hybrid business models are the new way work will get done at the enterprise level. As we continue our productive partnerships with our digital native clients, we\u2019re also focused on building a strong position in the digital industrial economy. We are resolved to be the go-to-partner for this new generation of digital heavyweights, helping them figure out what stays physical, what goes digital and what becomes a mix of both. Cognizant is only one of a handful of companies with a range of capabilities to help clients transform at every level of their enterprises. So we believe we are in a strong position to pursue this huge market opportunity for digital at scale transformation. Now let\u2019s review Cognizant\u2019s 2017 performance. Throughout 2017, we stayed focused on executing our plan first articulated a year ago to accelerate our shift to digital services and solutions. As a reminder, the three elements of our plan are; to scale our three practice areas, maintain a robust core business, and fully implement our margin improvement and capital return programs. During 2017, we made significant progress across all three elements. Here are a few highlights; first, we delivered four consecutive quarters of consistently solid performance at the top and bottom lines. Our 2017 revenue grew nearly 10% to $14.81 billion which was within our guided range for the full year. Second, we took a number of actions to improve our cost structure and slightly exceeded our full year non-GAAP operating margin target. Third, our 2017 digital related revenues grew almost 30%, well above company average and accounted for about 27% of total annual revenue. In addition in 2017, our portfolio of digital services generated above company average margins. During the year, we also initiated Cognizant\u2019s first quarterly cash dividend, returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase program, and launched the second phase of our share repurchase program, underscoring our confidence in the long term growth of our business. Overall, we believe our 2017 performance demonstrates the consistency of our execution. Let\u2019s now turn to the third part of my discussion, how our forward momentum will deliver a strong 2018. Beginning with guidance, we expect Q1 revenue to be within a range of $3.88 billion and $3.92 billion. And for 2018, we expect revenue to be within a range of $16 billion and $16.3 billion or growth of 8% to 10%. We are confident in our ability to deliver a 21% non-GAAP operating margin in 2018. We remain on track to achieve our 22% non-GAAP operating margin target in 2019, while continuing to invest strongly in our business for growth and differentiation. And reflecting our confidence in our momentum and the benefits of the new US tax legislation, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 33% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per share. Propelling us forward is the comprehensive building, investing and operational strengthening of our business that we accomplished last year, all of which we will continue in 2018. Our three practice areas, Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations, and Cognizant digital systems and technology are proving very effective at anticipating our clients\u2019 needs and providing the most effective services and solutions for the parts of their enterprise they need to transform. We continue to invest to broaden and deepen our services and capabilities and have intensified our focus on developing more end-to-end, industry-specific solutions. At the same time, we\u2019ve expanded our geographic footprint adding new delivery and operation centers as well as collaborators [ph] in our key global markets. And through last year\u2019s five acquisitions, we welcome to Cognizant talented professionals who are highly skilled in management consulting, digital strategy and marketing, user experience, industry focused platforms, and content creation. When you put it altogether, the Cognizant difference is our penetrating knowledge of our clients\u2019 business and technology environments and the problems they must solve, coupled with our ability to use technology to transform their entire enterprise. Think about what goes into this; Cognizant is able to engage with clients on their strategy, on their approach to customer interaction, on their product and service portfolio, on their financial and people models, their underlying business processes, operations, user interfaces, applications data and infrastructure. We have the end-to-end capability, the domain knowledge, the global and local delivery, ahead of the curve investments, and non-negotiable client information to be entrusted with such a critical undertaking and to deliver from strategy all the way through expected results. There are simply no shortcuts to building all of this capability and making it work for clients. Let me wrap up by returning to the subject I\u2019ve spoken about in the past calls. As you may know, Cognizant\u2019s enduring belief is that we must enable a broader range of people to have the stem education and skills they need to thrive in this new digital era. This belief is consistent with Cognizant\u2019s ambition to be central to the digital economy and to contribute significantly to the communities in which we operate. And so today, we are thrilled to announce the formation of the Cognizant US Foundation, a non-profit focused on providing stem and digital education and skills training for US workers and students. We\u2019re establishing the new foundation with an initial grant of $100 million, which is supported by recent changes in the US tax laws. The foundation will focus on education programs in multiple cities and states across the US to help improve opportunities for US workers and their families. As you may know in today\u2019s rapidly expanding digital economy, there are far more open jobs for technical work than there are trained workers to fill them. In fact, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 1.4 million person gap in 2020 between software development jobs and qualified applicants. This skills gap threatens the competitiveness of American businesses. To help close this gap, the Cognizant US Foundation will fund and develop stem education programs, public private partnerships, and other initiatives designed for high school graduates, community college and college students, veterans and others in the workforce seeking specialized technical skills for digital business jobs. As part of Cognizant\u2019s overall social responsibility focus, we\u2019ve been enabling stem education for a dozen years. The work of our new foundation will build on our global commitment to train tomorrow\u2019s technology professionals, reskill and upskill today\u2019s workers, and give back to the local communities where the company does business. Our company runs on highly skilled talent. We are one of the largest employers of technology workers in the US. Last year we added more than 6,000 US citizen and permanent residents to our workforce. And over the next five years, we plan to hire at least 25,000 US workers. To support our growth, we have recruiting, training, and reskilling efforts underway in several American cities with plans to extend our training programs to other cities in the near future. As the economy becomes ever more technology intensive, the need for workers to be career long learners is going to increase substantially in the years ahead, and Cognizant is determined to be at the forefront of enabling this. Okay, now let\u2019s turn it over to Raj, who will discuss how we\u2019re working with clients to speed them along their digital transformation journeys as well as the specifics of our business segment performance. Raj? Raj Mehta : Thank you, Frank. When you ask our clients what sets Cognizant apart, they\u2019ll say it is our ability to create solutions that transform how they engage with their customers, run their operations, and modernize and secure their IT backbone. This year, to drive increasing value to clients and further strengthen our foundation for profitable growth, we continue to develop and deploy our broader portfolio of industry platforms and solutions across our three practice areas. Examples include Cognizant MedVantage for the life sciences industry, Cognizant LifeAdmin Core for insurance, and Cognizant ClaimSphere Clinical Plus for healthcare to name a few. We also offer digital capabilities that cut across industries such as cloud enablement, legacy transformation, intelligent process automation, and more. Each of our practice areas has clearly defined its range of solutions and capabilities, and the distinct value they provide. This has made it easier for clients to understand the full range of our capabilities. Given the increasing complexity and scale of the processes and systems within our largest clients, we\u2019ve continued to evolve our client engagement. We\u2019ve been embedding chief marketing officers and chief digital officers in each of the industries and key geographies that we serve. These leaders are supporting our aggressive drive to continue expanding our presence well beyond the CIO to other decision makers within our accounts. In addition, we\u2019ve continued to evolve our account leadership team, which are focusing on more output and outcome based results. They are helping clients optimize their legacy environment and fully leverage Cognizant\u2019s increasing localization and integrated delivery. Last year, we skilled over 100,000 associates in high-end digital capabilities in areas such as data science, design thinking, cybersecurity, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and automation, and this year we\u2019ll continue our substantial investment in training our associates. At the end of the day, of course what matters to clients are outcomes. So let me offer an example of digital transformation work we\u2019re doing for one of the world\u2019s largest healthcare companies. In the medical device segment, where this client operates, market leaders realized that the quality of their field service and their ability to comply with regulatory changes are differentiators. Working with a client, we can see the future of predictive services of seamless parts, management across the digital supply chain, and building quality compliance. We prototyped a future state for the client using Cognizant\u2019s MedVantage, our integrated sales, service, complaint handling, and quality management cloud solution. We are now rolling out our solutions to more than a dozen of the client\u2019s operating companies spread across 50 countries to meet the need of thousands of users. Once our deployment is complete, we believe that client will be able to achieve significant benefits that include a 5% to 10% increase in revenue from service contracts, a 30% increase in the productivity of field service personnel, and a significant reduction in regulatory citation. This case study conveys the tangible value we can create for our clients, value in the form of increasing revenue, lower cost, and reduced error rate. Now let\u2019s turn to the financial performance of our industry segments and geographies in the fourth quarter. Banking and financial services grew 5.4% year-over-year. In the quarter, we had double-digit growth in our insurance business and in our mid-tier banking clients. In insurance, the growth was driven primarily by large strategic deals. We see growing interest among the insurers, and they are using advanced technology. Examples include watching for secure data, sharing, drones for property inspection, and artificial intelligence to help decide personal injury claims. Moving to banking, while certain large banking clients\u2019 spending has continued to be under pressure, we see the beginning of a recovery as these clients sharpen their focus on an investment in digital technologies. We are prepared for this transition by all the work we\u2019re doing to help them optimize their spending on their legacy systems and operations, and then apply these savings to driving digital transformation across the enterprise. Turning to healthcare, our revenue was up 11.9% year-over-year. We saw consistent demand across payer clients and increasing interest in our digital, analytics, cloud and virtualization solutions. Healthcare delivery is shifting from fee-for-service to a value-based care model that is focused on effective consumer engagement with data driven insights. As a result, healthcare organizations seek new ways to deliver consumer centric care while driving operational efficiency. This is leading to increased collaboration and partnerships across peers and providers. Our differentiated offering, which combines software and services position us to capitalize on these fundamental changes within the healthcare industry. The addition of TMG Health extends our position as a leading software-as-a-service healthcare partner in a growing market for government programs. We now provide products and services to more than 430 organizations that support more than 70% of the Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid markets. Within life sciences, we had a strong fourth quarter particularly in biopharma. Among our life sciences clients, we see growing interest in digitizing core business processes like clinical development and regulatory operations, as well as in transforming the patient and care experience. Turning to products and resources, we increased revenue 13.7% year-over-year. We continue to see strong growth from our manufacturing and logistics clients, which offsets sluggish growth in retail. Our strength in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utility areas result from our emphasis on leading the digital offerings. CXOs increasingly engage Cognizant to create smart products and transform their business models. Communications, media, and technology had another strong quarter of broad based growth, up 19% year-over-year. In Q4, we had solid growth across all the sectors, with expansion in areas like creating and curating digital content. As you know, the digital economy is all about content and context, the right content to the right person at the right time through the right channels to create meaningful experiences. And in Silicon Valley, our clients are relying on us to help support their operations not only in the US, but also globally, where they tend to have smaller operational footprints. Looking at our geographies, our international markets crossed the 3 billion revenue mark in 2017, reflecting our successful growth campaign. We\u2019ve made good progress in integrating several recent acquisitions including Netcentric, Zone, Adaptra and Brilliant Service. We now operate in 38 countries and much of our growth has been enabled by successful localization across our 37 centers, in which more than 30 languages are spoken. Europe grew 18.1% year-over-year in Q4, including a 640 basis point positive impact from currency and the rest of the world went up 17.5% from a year ago, including a 200 basis point positive impact from currency. As a sign of our growing European reputation for delivering digital interactive solutions to C-suite decision makers, the Football Association which is based in the UK selected Cognizant as their digital transformation partner. We will be developing and managing digital solutions to make it easier for soccer\u2019s 800 million global fans to build a deeper relationship with the sport and drive its growth. To sum up, over the past year, we\u2019ve focused considerable energy and investment in strengthening our foundation of profitable growth and extending our capabilities to help clients succeed in their transformational journeys. Karen over to you. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you Raj and good morning everyone. Q4 performance was solid, rounding out our full year result which were within our expectations and reflect successful execution of our strategy to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. Fourth quarter revenue of 3.83 billion was within our guidance range and increased 10.6% year-over-year, including a 120 basis point positive impact from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses and realignment charges was 19.7% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.03. In the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 22.4% and excluded the $617 million one-time impact of the recently enacted US Tax Reform Act, resulting primarily from the deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings on foreign subsidiaries. For the full year 2017, revenue of 14.81 billion represented growth of 9.8% year-over-year, including a 10 basis points negative impact from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7%, slightly above our guidance of 19.6% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.77. As part of the capital return program laid out one year ago, we repurchased $1.5 billion of shares in 2017 and initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share beginning in Q2. In the fourth quarter, we launched the $1.2 billion phase of our capital return program through a $300 million ASR. We are currently evaluating the new US tax legislation and in particular the longer term impact that this legislation may have on our overall capital return program. We are supportive of this legislation as it levels the global playing field and increases the competitiveness of US companies. The implementation of a modified territorial tax system will permit capital to flow across markets with greater ease allowing more flexibility for future investments. As a first step, we are pleased to report that our Board has approved a significant increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.20, reflecting our confidence in the strength of the business, coupled with the benefits of tax reforms. This increase will bring our dividend more in line with technology peers, while allowing us to continue to invest strongly in the business both organically and inorganically. Additionally as Franc described, we plan to significantly expand our ongoing commitment to stem education through our planned $100 million contribution to the Cognizant US Foundation. Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services represented 57.3% of revenue and the outsourcing services 42.7% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 10.2% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand for digital solutions. Outsourcing services revenue grew 11.1% from Q4 a year ago, as we continue to see strong growth in digital operations and infrastructure services. Turning to fourth quarter, 39.5% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts. We continue to make progress towards shifting the mix of our business over the longer term towards more fixed price or managed services arrangements. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with the potential to generate at least 5 million to 15 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 357. And now moving to an update on margins in Q4 we continue to take actions that we expect will improve our cost structure and operating margins, while allowing us to continue to invest in the business for growth. These actions resulting in approximately $3 million of charges in the quarter, related to the realignment program. Going forward we may incur additional costs related to advisory fees, severance and further optimization of our real estate cost. Additionally, as we accelerate our pursuit of broad based, high value digital transformation work, we will continue to reassess less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital market place. In 2018, we expect to make further progress to our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019 through continued focus on driving higher value services in addition to continual improvement in our business, focusing on leverage such as sustained higher levels of utilization, optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively. We have also invested in further automation of our systems and processes in key areas such as customer management and forecasting of supply and demand. We enter 2018 on solid footing after the steps we took in 2017 to right size our cost structure. The implementation of these savings initiatives allows us to continue to invest in our digital capabilities, while still delivering improved margins in 2018 and 2019. Moving to headcount, another key metrics, offshore utilization in Q4 moved higher as we continue to effect structural changes in our headcount management. We expect that these changes will help improve our resource alignment, help drive greater operational efficiency and best improve our profitability. We added 3900 net new hires in the quarter, while annualized attrition of 17.9% during the quarter including BPO and trainees decreased over 400 basis points from the previous quarter. Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 80%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduate doing our training program was 83%, and onsite utilization was 92%. Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash and short term investments. We had strong operating cash flow in the quarter, generating $836 million, reflecting improved profitability of the business. Receivable were 2.9 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 71 days down one day from the year ago period. Our unbilled receivables balance was 357 million, broadly flat from the end of Q3. We\u2019ve build approximately 63% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. Our outstanding debt balance was 873 million at the end of the quarter, which included a $75 million outstanding balance on our revolver. Our diluted share count was 589 million shares for the current quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $16 billion to $16.3 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time of which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. We expect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 will be immaterial to evolve revenues. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect to deliver revenue at the range of 3.88 billion to 3.92 billion. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $1.04. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 589 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 24%. For the full year 2018, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 21%, and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $4.53. This guidance anticipates the full year share count of approximately 585 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 24%. This guidance includes the impact of the $1.02 billion share repurchase, which we anticipate will be phased in over the balance of 2018. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes stock based compensation, acquisition related expenses and amortization, realignment charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the additional impact of the enactment of the US tax reform act and our planned contribution to the new Cognizant US Foundation. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment in areas such as immigration or tax. Before I close, I would like to comment briefly on our longer term tax rate. As you know, our tax rate is determined by a combination of factors globally, including our geographic mix of earnings and related income tax rates and the jurisdictions in which we operate recent changes to tax legislation such as the US Tax Reform Act, and tax structures in various international markets. Based on what we know today, we anticipate that our tax rate will be in the 24% to 26% range beginning in 2019. In summary, our solid execution in 2017, along with continued investment in the business has positioned us well to deliver another strong year of revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Operator, we can open the calls for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane : Just wanted to ask about the large banking showing signs of improvement. Do you think that\u2019s just a little bit of the tax reform coming through to spending, just trying to think about what could cause a little bit of pickup in that large banking side? Raj Mehta : Bryan, this is Raj. Look, I think within banking, we\u2019ve always had with our mid-tier banking accounts the demand environment and it\u2019s been quite healthy, where the challenges has been on some of the large money center banks. And given obviously, we are starting to see a pickup obviously some with the tax reform, but some of the regulation changes, and you\u2019re starting to see a lot of investments that are starting to come in in the forms of digital transformation. And I think we\u2019re positioned very well for those to capture that growth, but obviously we continue to balance along with additional engagements in digital. There\u2019s still a focus on some of the optimization around the legacy work and we\u2019re making prudent decisions in terms of balancing both revenue and margins on outlook. Bryan Keane : And just one follow-up for Karen, just the first quarter \u201918 revenue guidance, this is a little stronger than we anticipated. Anything to think about that is pushing those numbers higher, is that just a little stronger demand, extra days, just thinking about the seasonality there versus demand. Karen McLoughlin : On a year-over-year basis Bryan, there\u2019s a little bit of currency impact that\u2019s helping with the growth as well as sequentially. But honestly, we think the year\u2019s off to a solid start, so we think Q1 will play out quite nicely. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now live. Darrin Peller : I just want to start off first with the embedded expectations for, I guess currency and M&A in the outlook, and then really more on the margin side, if you could help us just bridge a bit \u2013 a little more detail bridging the gap to the 21% operating margin expectation for the year from where you are now. I know it\u2019s been a \u2013 it\u2019s part of the plan over the few years, but maybe some more specifics on the gross margin and then some of the variables. Karen McLoughlin : Sure Darrin, it\u2019s Karen, let me take that. So let\u2019s start with revenue guidance. So in the 8% to 10% revenue guidance, there\u2019s about 100 basis points of currency right now that we see as the benefit year-over-year, so 7% to 9% on a constant currency basis would be the growth projection. There\u2019s no incremental M&A built into that, so just obviously the full year impact of the deals that we did last year, so Netcentric and Zone, which we did in Q4 and then obviously the TNG contract you\u2019ll get the full year impact versus this year, we\u2019d about five months of that. So that obviously helps with the growth rate, but beyond that there\u2019s no large deals or no M&A built in to the guidance at this point. And then on the margin front, obviously we\u2019ve guided to approximately 21% non-GAAP operating margin. A lot of that is driven by the benefit of the cost savings we\u2019ve implemented in 2017 that will carry over into 2018. We\u2019re also, as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re seeing, as the business shift to more of the digital work that has higher value; it\u2019s been higher margin work. So as we\u2019re seeing that start to continue to become a bigger piece of the overall pie that will continue to drive margin expansion as well. And then we\u2019ll continue to focus on continuing leverage around pyramid, will sustain high levels of utilization. We believe there\u2019s more work to do in terms of scaling the corporate functions and really driving the leverage out of that. So it\u2019s no individual lever, but there\u2019s a number of pieces that will come together to drive the expansion. Operator : Our next question is coming from Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. You line is now live. Brian Essex : Karen I had a question for you on the taxes. Is there anything operationally that you\u2019re changing, I mean tax rate in longer term coming in under, I think where we expected? Are you changing billing policies, transfer pricing, and might this potentially fix longer term issues of where you\u2019re generating cash and where that cash gets trapped geographically? Karen McLoughlin : Brian there\u2019s nothing certainly that we\u2019re doing in regards to the outcome of the US Tax Reform Act, obviously overall that is helping to drive the rate down. As you know in India over time the rate will increase as tax holidays start to expire and so that\u2019s why in the guidance we\u2019ve put a rate of 24% to 26% to accommodate a little bit of that increase as we look out into the future. But today, the rate has been and will continue to be based on a number of items including all the various geographies in which we operate, and nothing unusual that we\u2019re doing though because of that. Operator : Our next question is coming from Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just wanted to double check on the margin outlook, just any guidance on how we might see margins progress throughout the year and how it might be different than past years. And I know Karen you don\u2019t give gross margin guidance per se, but can you give us some high level views on gross margin specifically. I know you mentioned utilization pricing, I think you also mentioned contract profitability focus, so anything you can offer there will be great. Karen McLoughlin : So Tien-Tsin as you mentioned, we don\u2019t give gross margin guidance and certainly don\u2019t intend to at this point, but I think what you\u2019re going to see is margins will bounce around a little bit during the year, a lot of it will be depending on hiring, the ramp up hiring. So as you saw in Q4 we did add about 3900 net resources. We also in Q4 gave raises and promotions related to 2017. Typically we\u2019ve done that in Q3, so depending when we do that this year that obviously has a bit of an impact in the quarter that that happens. So our intention is to target the approximately 21% on a full year basis, but that won\u2019t be a linear path throughout the year. It will really depend on the timing of investments that we make. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. You line is now live. Jim Schneider : I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little more color on the revenue outlook and how that\u2019s likely to progress through the year. First of all, does it assume that the banking and financial services revenue growth rate will continue to improve ratably through 2018, given some of Raj\u2019s comments, and then secondly, can you maybe the comment directionally on your hiring plans throughout the year? Francisco D'Souza: Jim let me try to take that. We expect revenue to unfold in roughly the same way its unfolded in past years. From a seasonality standpoint Q2 tends to be our strongest quarter from a revenue growth standpoint. Q3 a little less so, and as we get in to the holiday season in Q4 the revenue growth tends to be a little slower. So that\u2019s kind of the pattern we expect. I don\u2019t see anything unusual unfolding this year. I think from the financial services we don\u2019t have significant improvement in the environment baked in to our current outlook. As Raj said, we see some green shoots, but certainly not calling a significant turnaround in that business. So that\u2019s I would say modest assumptions baked in to our guidance for financial services for the year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jason Kupferberg from Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Jason Kupferberg : So we\u2019re starting off the year here with really the same 8% to 10% topline growth outlook as last year, and obviously in \u201917 you came in more or less at the top end of the forecast. So I just want to get a sense of the visibility you feel you have on the 2018 outlook today versus what you had on \u201917 a year ago. I know that the visibility on the discretionary piece tends to kind of firm up more in March, April, May timeframe, but it does sound like there may be some encouraging data points among the money center banks, so just overall comments on visibility would be real helpful thanks. Francisco D'Souza: Jason I would say, we set guidance sort of the same way at the beginning of the year every year. So I don\u2019t think there is any meaningful difference at this point in \u2013 as we said here at the beginning of \u201918 versus where we were at the beginning of \u201917. We go through a very thoughtful process of bottoms-up almost account \u2013 an account by account forecast of revenue for the year, that\u2019s based on our client teams\u2019 best views of what we have in backlog plus our pipeline, plus some factor for business at this point aren\u2019t identified. We use that same methodology every year. So I would say that our visibility at this point to 8% to 10% is the same as it was last year at this point. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is now live. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I want to ask a margin question, so if you made no other realignment type changes, how much 2018 margins go up just because you\u2019re in a better place. And then I also have a sub-part question on margins which is at some point as the one-off actions like the alignment in structuring end, would you expect a narrowing of difference between GAAP and non-GAAP items. Karen McLoughlin : Ashwin I think in terms of the 21% that we\u2019ve guided to for 2018, I think a lot of that\u2019s going to come from shift in the business and actions that we\u2019ve already taken. As we\u2019ve talked about for some time now we\u2019ll continue to look to optimize the pyramid, the automation continues to become a bigger piece of the work that we\u2019re doing both for clients as well internally for ourselves. So there\u2019s a number of things that are taking shape that don\u2019t necessarily require what I would call a realignment charge to execute on. They are just how we will manage the business going forward. So we\u2019re very comfortable the 21% target that we\u2019ve set for ourselves for this year. And then as we move in to 2019, obviously we haven\u2019t given guidance beyond 2019. But as you know today the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is driven by a number of items including stock comp, FX gains and losses which we can\u2019t predict. So, excluding one-time items those things will continue to be the big drivers of the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP and then from time to time there maybe one-time items, whether it be realignment or tax reform or the donation that we\u2019re making to the US Foundation later this year. So those obviously will continue as they occur. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bryan Bergin from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : I wanted to healthcare business, any outlook there? Can you comment on the launch of your pipeline and do you see 4Q performance somewhat as a baseline for 2018? Francisco D'Souza: I think healthcare continues to do well for us, especially given all the investments that we\u2019ve done as you\u2019re aware of the TriZetto and now with TMG. I think as we look out in to 2018 I see that continuing. We\u2019re seeing strong traction specially around the digital space and with interactive after modernization and just all the work around digital engineering and a very strong pipeline developing, continuing with our BPaaS deals, not just around Facets but also around TMG. And I think as you know there\u2019s some potential mergers that are out there and I think we are positioned well for potential work that may come down in to those transactions. So I think overall the investments in healthcare serves us well and we see a strong growth in 2018. Operator : Our next question is coming from Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Karen this is for you. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about how FX is impacting the margin guidance that you\u2019ve given. Some of the disclosure in 10-Q would suggest that there\u2019s a pretty strong tailwind the margins with the headwinds, the hedges you haven\u2019t placed rather. Not clear how the dollar is impacting the margin though. But if you could just talk a little bit about FX broadly speaking in terms of the impact of the margin guidance? Karen McLoughlin : Sure Keith, if you think about it there\u2019s really three currencies that drive both top line and potentially bottom line impact for us and it\u2019s really the pound and the euro and some of them with Swiss Franc, but the smaller impact and then the rupee. The pound and euro tend to be a natural hedge, so whatever movement we see in those currency effects bottom revenue and cost essentially in line, a little bit of a difference, but it doesn\u2019t have a material impact to the margin line. The big driver that can impact margins is really the rupee. But the rupee frankly has been fairly stable for the last several months; I mean it\u2019s sort of been hovering in the 63 to 64 rupee to the dollar rate. So that\u2019s not having a significant impacts on the margins at this point. And then as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we typically hedge about 50% of our rupee exposure in any given year, and that\u2019s consistent from year-to-year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Glenn Greene : Maybe Karen just a higher level, obviously one year later, but how are you feeling about that 22% margin goal after 19, but or worse or sort of neutral relative to the initial goal, and then just a quick update on the pricing landscape and the environment? Karen McLoughlin : So I think in terms of the 20% target that we set for 2019 for non-GAAP operating margins, I say we feel neutral when we\u2019ve set those targets to ourselves and made a commitment to our shareholders around that. We had done a lot of work in terms of how we would get there over the years. I think we are extremely pleased with the way the company performed last year and everybody really rallied around making those improvements while continuing to invest for the long term growth in the business. So I think we\u2019ve done a great job so far of managing both revenue growth and expanding margins and I think we\u2019re very comfortable with the trajectory that we\u2019re on there. I think in terms of pricing, pricing has been very stable. Very similar to the trends we\u2019ve seen over the last few years where certainly clients are looking to continue to optimize cost if there is legacy or business as usual, environments and redirect those dollars to transformation dollars. But certainly what you\u2019re seeing is some of the digital work and some of the more transformative work is higher value work. That is higher priced work and that is also obviously a big part of the margin shift that we\u2019ve been seeing and expect to continue to see. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mayank Tandon from Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. Mayank Tandon : With the ongoing shift at digital, can you comment on the challenges you\u2019re facing in terms of hiring the best talent and the right talent for the type of work and then the implications for wage pressure and employee attrition as you shift your talent based on more digital type work. Francisco D'Souza: Mayank, its Franc I\u2019ll touch on that. Look whenever you \u2013 you\u2019re thinking of a key point, whenever you have these big technology transitions you do have contractions, not contractions but rather shortages in pockets of the workforce skills. That\u2019s why we invested very heavily last year and will continue to invest very heavily this year in retraining the workforce. Last year we retrained about a 100,000 of our associates with variety of new digital skills. That\u2019s an ongoing effort. Digital skills are a little different than say past generations of technology because you have a number of different skills. There isn\u2019t sort of one or two main predominant skillsets, when you talk about digital you actually have lots of skillsets, so that the ongoing training is important and we\u2019ll continue to do that. I do think that\u2019s part of the reason that we have had somewhat higher employee attrition, that\u2019s also a phenomenon we\u2019ve seen in the past when we invest in retraining, then it becomes attractive sometimes for competitors to take people that we\u2019ve invested in in making the training efforts. We continue to feel comfortable though that we can continue to stay ahead of that, and that the training efforts and the training engine that we have is strong. I\u2019d also say that a part of the reason that we announced today is the formation of the Cognizant US Foundation is to try to address this problem on a broader and a more systemic basis. We believe that the skill shortage within the US is very real and that we \u2013 given the fact that we are probably one for ourselves for Cognizant we\u2019re probably one of the largest in-house training operations in world. That we can take some of that knowledge and externalize it and use it to train the workforce in the US outside of perhaps the traditional IT work force and use that to create new sources of talent for the entire industry. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Edward Caso : I was curious on the size of digital engagements, are they rising, what pace are they rising at? And as they do get larger and more transformative of traditional systems, is that bringing back some of the traditional competitor. So help us with your relative positioning to your market given as the digital world evolves? Francisco D'Souza: Ed its Franc, look for some quarters we\u2019ve been seeing, now we\u2019ve been talking about this concept of digital at scale. Certainly something that we\u2019ve seen over the last or over 2017 that after an initial phase of call it, piloting or experimenting our clients, these new digital heavy weights that I talked about, the firms that are looking combine digital and physical that are leveraging existing assets, existing positions in industries are strongly investing in putting a digital layer on top of their physical assets and their capabilities. That\u2019s driving larger scaled digital projects. We think about large scale digital as projects that involve or they transform the business model, the operating model and the technology model of our clients. So that trend continues to unfold, and I think will continue to unfold through 2018. And as I said in my prepared comments, we think that there are very few companies in the world that have the end-to-end capabilities, they can work with the client on digital, all the way from strategy, all the way through execution. And this is hard work, right. It\u2019s not easy stuff both executing for clients, but also building the internal capabilities and stitching them altogether in a way that\u2019s effective at the client interface. And we think that we are very well positioned because of the investments that we\u2019ve been making not just in the last couple of years but going back a decade when we started building consulting and so on. So over a very long period of time we\u2019ve build strong foundational capabilities to do digital end-to-end, to do kind of large scale integrated programs for client end-to-end. And we really think there are very few companies in the world that have that range of capabilities. Operator : Our next question is coming from Frank Atkins from SunTrust. Your line is now live. Frank Atkins : Wanted to ask if you\u2019ve seeing any difference in client behavior as a result of the tax changes, or if the tax changes impact your M&A philosophy at all going forward? Francisco D'Souza: Let me take that and I\u2019ll ask Raj if there\u2019s anything to add. I think Frank its surely to tell if there have been real changes to client behavior as a result of the US tax reform, maybe I\u2019ll give you an update next quarter if we see anything, but right now it\u2019s just too early to tell. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s fundamental change to our M&A philosophy as a result of tax reform. We\u2019re assessing that. As you know tax reform will allow us to access cash that was overseas for some period of time. That may change the geography of M&A, but I think the philosophy will remain largely where it\u2019s been. Operator : Our next question is coming from Arvind Ramnani from KeyBanc. Your line is now live. Arvind Ramnani : I wondered to kind of really dig in to a topic. You\u2019ve touched upon a couple of times, and as you enter this new age of compute with a richer set of technology options and also with technology strategy becoming comparative differentiator for very traditional companies. How is this demand environment changing, and have client expectations changed, and also if you can comment on how Cognizant is positioned? Specially I\u2019m looking to see if you can comment on how you\u2019re enriching your consulting experience, your M&A priorities and also do you feel better for the demand environment over the next two or three years, or has it made it harder to manage the business? Francisco D'Souza: Arvind let me set the stage and then I\u2019ll ask Raj to comment. Look, I think I\u2019ve said this for a while, right, I think the macro trend here in my mind is that the world in general is becoming more technology intensive. So businesses are becoming more technology intensive, governments are becoming more technology intensive, societies are becoming more technology intensive as a result. We\u2019re using more technology in our personal lives, we\u2019re using more technology in the business world. So as the world become more technology intensive that sets the backdrop for our demand environment, which is that, our clients whether those are businesses or government need access to skill, they need access to capabilities, they need to access large scale program management and governance to be able to develop, deploy, integrate all of that technology so that it actually delivers results. So that\u2019s the macro and then I\u2019ll let Raj comment a little bit about the more specifics. Raj Mehta : Arvind I think when Franc touched on it a little bit earlier, right. When you look at companies, many of our clients \u2013 digital is not just about the front end, the user experience, it\u2019s really about being able to make changes at the business level, the operating level and as well as the technology. And there are only a handful of the companies that can make that kind of impact for the companies and provide all the governance and execution that\u2019s behind it. And I think we are well positioned for that and we\u2019re seeing that. As these projects become larger in scale, Cognizant continues to benefit from those. Francisco D'Souza: Operator I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly our final question today is coming from Joseph Vafi from Loop Capital. Your line is now live. Joseph Vafi : May be ask the growth question one more way Franc, if you could parse out where you\u2019re seeing growth this year, digital versus non-digital relative to that 8 to 10 points of growth that you outlined for the year, especially relative to your comments early on about legacy companies becoming digital giants. And it seems like you\u2019re placing your bets more on the digital side and maybe versus some of the older technologies that they are continuing to deploy. Francisco D'Souza: I think that as a macros it\u2019s going to vary a little bit industry by industry. But as a macro statement our clients are going to continue I think to optimize legacy and invest in digital growth. Now having said that, I think it\u2019s important and I\u2019ll make this point that optimizing the legacy is still in many cases a really solid and good business for us. We know how to run clients legacy systems, we know how to optimize them, we know how to keep them up and running. And these legacy systems are still very much the backbone of our clients operations. So they are not going away and they are very important because digital gets build on top of legacy. In fact, sometimes I say that \u2013 we talk about legacy, but actually these legacy systems are our clients\u2019 heritage, right. And so they are really important to have that backbone. So we\u2019ll continue to invest in that business, we\u2019ll continue to stay very relevant there, and there\u2019s a lot of value to be added to clients to just being able to go in and say, look, we can help you run your existing traditional legacy environment, more efficiently, more effectively, lower unit cost and so on and so forth. On top of that, we have to continue to invest in digital to remain relevant. And so we are doing that. Our digital revenue last year grew almost 30%, 3x the company average almost in \u201917. So we\u2019ll continue to make those investments, that\u2019s an ongoing process, but I think I can say to you with confidence that that process is well underway at this point. We are very competitive across the industries that we serve. We\u2019ve got good differentiation, our clients look at us as very credible players in digital. So, those two trends will continue to play out in to 2018 and I feel pretty good about how we\u2019re positioned. And with that I think we\u2019ll wrap up the call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. I would say that we are confident in our ability to deliver a strong 2018 and all of us look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

All lines have been laced on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson : Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. This morning, I'd like to cover two topics : first, a few highlights from our Q1 performance; and second, an update on how we're competing effectively and scaling up our business in the current environment. Let's begin with the quarter. We've gotten the year off to a solid start. First quarter revenue was $3.91 billion at the high end of our guided range and up 10% year-over-year. Our first quarter digital revenue grew about 27%, well above company average and represented about 29% of total revenue, reflecting the profile of many of our clients who are pivoting quickly to digital. Our portfolio of digital services generated above company average margins, and our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.06. Turning to guidance. We expect second quarter revenue to be within a range of $4 billion to $4.04 billion. We now expect full year revenue to be within a range of $16.05 billion and $16.3 billion, a growth of 8.4% to 10%. And we remain confident in our previously stated guidance of achieving a non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 of approximately 21%. Moving to my second topic, thriving in today's environment. Cognizant continues to be one of the world's fastest growing professional services companies, even at our scale. We've sustained our growth by innovating in response to macroeconomic and technological changes and the resulting shift in our clients' needs. The current environment is defined in part by global economic momentum, accelerating technological progress and increasing demand for colocating with clients. As a result of these trends, we see tightening labor markets and skill shortages in many parts of the world. To thrive in this environment, we continue to emphasize three broad approaches that I'd like to cover this morning. I'll refer to them as digitized, internationalized and localized. Let's start with digitized. We have a distinctive approach to digital that really resonates with our clients. We help them become digital to their core, digitizing their products and services, personalizing the experience they offer customers, fully automating their business processes, modernizing their IT infrastructures and doing all of this in tandem. We use this approach to transform clients' entire enterprises, their business, their operating and their technology models. This three layer transformation enables us to build digital at scale and at speed throughout three practice areas : digital business, digital operations and Digital Systems & Technology. This ability to, in essence, run a digital plumb line through all layers of a client's enterprise gives us an edge in pursuing and capturing a significant portion of the huge market opportunity for enterprise transformation. It also serves to expand our presence well beyond the CIO to other decision makers within our accounts like the CFO, COO and the chief marketing officer. Reflecting our commitment to partnering with the CMO, we're delighted that Cognizant interactive, which is part of our digital business practice, was just recognized by Ad Age as one of the world\u2019s largest digital agency networks. At the same time, we've built a strong and scalable foundation on which to keep advancing our digital capabilities and leadership. Our broad foundation has many elements. These include our trusted intimate relationships with strategic clients and our penetrating knowledge of clients' industries, business models and technology environments. We know how to apply powerful new technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, virtual and augmented reality, robotic process automation, blockchain, cloud and more. As clients more fully adopt these technologies, we'll be able to use our leadership position in these areas to capture a substantial portion of the growth opportunity for all of the services and solutions that will emerge. In the meantime, our understanding of how to apply these technologies serves to amplify our ability to anticipate client\u2019s needs and rapidly develop solutions at scale and at the highest levels of reliability. Perhaps the most important element of our growth foundation are our high-end skills, our global and local delivery and the end-to-end capabilities which include our global consulting teams that advise on strategy, operations and technology, all of which enable us to build and deliver specialized software platforms and industry-specific solutions to quickly create new value for clients. And therefore, we're sustaining our investments to further scale our digital practices aggressively across industries, geographies, both organically and through acquisitions. Now with over 80% of our revenue coming from the work we do for clients in financial services, health care, retail and manufacturing, we're at the center of the fintech, health tech, biotech and smart product revolutions. Our clients depend on us to keep them at the leading edge of these shifts. We do so by developing solutions to advance their businesses. Here are two quick examples. We partnered with an engine manufacturer to identify potential engine failures on long haul truck runs. We helped the client increase truck utilization and catch 20,000 faults per month, enabling preventive maintenance across a fleet of 150,000 vehicles. We also helped a leading health care company save as much as $60 million by identifying 85,000 at risk patients. We developed an advanced machine learning algorithm to analyze and report on the warning signs of patients who are exhibiting behaviors that may indicate patterns of substance abuse. This enables professionals to intervene early to improve these patients' quality of life. We continue to invest to broaden and deepen our services and capabilities, and we've intensified our focus on developing more end to end industry-specific solutions. Based on our forward momentum and sustained investment, we expect our digital portfolio to continue to grow at double-digit rates. Our second approach to today's environment is to further internationalize. Non-U.S. markets are, of course, sizable and fast growing and the application of digital technologies is absolutely a worldwide phenomenon. Last year, our businesses outside the U.S. crossed the $3 billion revenue mark for the first time. We've expanded our geographic footprint organically, adding new delivery and operation centers, as well as Collaboratories in our key global markets. We have digital-at-scale projects underway with the likes of the English Football Association, Softbank Robotics, Centrica, Dexia, BHP and a consortium of Indian life insurers, to name just a few projects. And many of our acquisitions over the past couple of years have been outside the U.S., among them Idea Couture, Mirabeau, Brilliant Services, Adaptra, Netcentric and Zone. In essence, we've been methodically planting seeds across Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, and many of these have already become growth engines for us. In short, we have the clients, the talent, the operating model and the integrated delivery to excel outside the U.S., and we see the potential for several of our non-U.S. markets to each become billion-dollar businesses early in the next decade. Our third emphasis is on continuing to localize. As you can imagine, when you're partnering with clients to transform their business, operating and technology models, the need to engage with them locally is essential. In fact, the growing volume of digital at scale work we're doing typically involves agile development and a deeply consultative in-person approach with clients. So we continue to invest extensively in training and rescaling our teams and in substantially expanding our local workforces around the world. Our goal is to complement the massive delivery capability and operations we have in India with additional specialized points of delivery around the globe. That's why we've built a network of local and regional delivery centers in Europe, Asia, North America and Latin America. With their proximity to clients, these delivery centers also enable high-quality digital, agile and secure services that comply with local regulations and are delivered using the technologies and languages clients require. These centers also enable us to hire, develop and retain talented local people who can serve multiple clients. By the way, as we've built skills and capabilities in the local communities where we operate, we're also partnering with educational institutions to establish and fund retraining programs in high-demand digital technologies. To wrap up, our business is strong as is our ability to sense and respond quickly to market shifts. Our digitized, internationalized, localized approach is serving us well in today's business environment. We're one of a small handful of companies with the range of capabilities to help clients transform at every level of their enterprises. We've developed a strong and scalable foundation on which to extend our leadership as the builder of the digital economy, and we expect our forward momentum to deliver a strong 2018. And now over to Raj, who will discuss how we're working with clients to speed them along their digital transformation journeys as well as the specifics of our business segment performance. Raj? Rajeev Mehta : Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. To echo Frank, we feel very good about Cognizant's range of capabilities, business model and sustained investment. In combination, they're enabling us to be the scale builder of the digital economy and the go-to transformation partner for our clients. I am going to cover our industry, segment and geographic performance. But first, I want to add to Frank's discussion about how we create value for clients, and there's no better way than with a concrete client example. Consider the work we're doing with a top property and casualty insurer of high-net-worth individuals and families. Our client needed help rethinking and redesigning a key moment of truth in their claims process. This is a point where a policyholder calls to report an accident or damage to property. Of course, people are often stressed when they make such a call. So that experience can determine client satisfaction and retention. Cognizant developed an analytics platform informed by artificial intelligence to transform this first notice of loss. Our AI solution enables the insurer to audit and analyze conversations between policyholders and customer service representatives and guide the rep in real time about how best to respond. We brought together machine learning, chat bots, voice-to-text transcription and analytics to automate repeatable processes. The machine learning alone have dual [ph] knowledge gained from reviewing 25,000 policyholder calls. This has improved the quality of the information captured and reduced the likelihood of misunderstandings that can result in litigation or fraud. As a result, the insurers saw about a 30% reduction in call length and associated expenses and a 15% reduction in total labor and expect to see significant improvement in client satisfaction. We have many other client engagements underway in which we're doing AI-enabled work that delivers business outcomes of this importance. It's this combination of capabilities, including continued investment in our client facing teams and further scaling of our practice areas, that equips us to be the go-to partner for our clients' digital-at-scale transformations. Let's look now at how our industry segments performed in Q1. Banking and Financial Services grew 6.2% year-over-year. In the quarter, we had double-digit growth in our insurance business that was driven primarily by large strategic deals. Insurers are increasingly interested in using advanced technology to transform the customer experience as conveyed by my earlier example. Moving to Banking. We continue to see strong growth amongst our mid-tier banking clients as they work to transform their business models, which involves greater investment in advanced technologies. As large money-center banks reported more positive industry business climate, they're putting more pressure on their run-the-bank spending while stepping up investment in the change-the-back technology. While we're seeing a pickup in this digitally intensive work, we anticipate continued optimization of the legacy portion of our banking business and a modest overall improvement. Turning to Healthcare. Our revenue was up 11.8% year-over-year. We saw consistent demand across payer clients with increasing interest in our digital, analytics, cloud and virtualization solutions. We continued to invest and position our health care practice to capture demand as clients shift their underlying business models from fee-for-service to value-based care. To complement our strong position in the payer market, we've expanded our scope to include the provider network of doctors, hospitals and other clinicians. We recently closed our acquisition of privately held Boulder Healthcare Solutions, a leading provider of end-to-end revenue cycle management solutions to hospitals and physicians. Boulder expands our health care consulting, IT and business process services portfolio and extends our leadership in digital health care technology and operations. By bringing together Boulder Healthcare with TriZetto, TMG Health and Top Tier Consulting, we now have offerings that span the payer and provider business value chain. Turning to Products and Resources. We increased revenue 11.4% year-over-year. Strong growth from our manufacturing and logistics clients continues, which offsets sluggish growth in retail. Our strength in the manufacturing, logistics, energy and utility areas result from our emphasis on leading with digital offerings. The infusion of digital has already made many products smarter and the consumer experience richer. And now AI-based autonomy enabled by sensors, data analytics and machine learning is making machines far more versatile and self-driven than ever before. This has caught the attention of CXOs who are increasingly engaging us to implement advanced digital process to transform their business models. Communications, Media and Technology had another strong quarter of broad-based growth, up 18.4% year-over-year, with an expansion in areas like creating and curating digital content for digital platform providers. The digital economy is all about creating meaningful experiences with personalized content. As we have seen with many of our Silicon Valley clients, this requires the ability to help manage and run digital business to deliver personalized content. These clients seek our help with sheer volume of content monitoring and moderation, particularly as they intensify their efforts to verify the authenticity of user-generated content and scale globally. Looking at our geographies. Our markets outside the U.S. continue to exhibit strong growth. Europe grew 22.4% year-over-year in Q1, including 11.7% positive impact from currency. And the rest of world was up 11.9% from a year ago, including a 310 basis point positive impact from currency. We now have offices in over three dozen countries, and much of our growth has been enabled by successful localization across many of these countries. The value we create for clients is predominantly knowledge-based work so we depend heavily on the insight, passion and collaboration of our global associates. We continuously invest in the skills and development of all of our associates to keep Cognizant strong and relevant to clients. At the same time, we're aware that our annualized attrition rate of 20.3% this quarter is several points higher than our historic norm for Q1. We believe the higher attrition is largely the result of increasing global demand for the very skills we specialize in, including shortage of technology talent, particularly in the local markets and the transition our organization has gone through to build a scalable foundation for expanding our digital leadership. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and management. To sum up, over the past year, we focused considerable energy and investment in strengthening our foundation for profitable growth and extending our capabilities to help clients succeed in their transformation journeys. Karen, over to you. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. The business got off to a solid start in Q1, which positions us well to achieve our updated full year revenue and margin guidance. First quarter revenue of $3.91 billion was at the high end of our guidance range and represented a year-over-year increase of 10.3%, including a positive 210 basis point impact from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses and realignment charges, was 20.3%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.06. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 24.6% was higher than expected primarily due to the updated interpretation of the global intangible low tax income or GILTI provision of the new U.S. tax law. As I will discuss further in the guidance section of my remarks, this updated interpretation of the GILTI provision is estimated to have a full year EPS impact of $0.09 per share. In the first quarter, we demonstrated our commitment to return capital to shareholders through launching a $300 million accelerated share repurchase or ASR program in March, with completion expected during the second quarter. This ASR marked the second piece of our expected $1.2 billion share repurchase by the end of 2018. And today, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22. Additionally, during the quarter, we repatriated $2 billion of earnings that were available for distribution to the United States as a result of U.S. tax reform. We have already deployed approximately 25% of that cash through the acquisition of Boulder. We are continuing to evaluate the implications of U.S. tax legislation on our overall capital return program. Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58% and 42% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 10.7% year-over-year and outsourcing services revenue grew 9.7% from Q1 a year ago. During the first quarter, 39% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and we continue to make progress, over the long term, changing the mix of our business to more fixed-price or managed services arrangements. Also, as we've spoken about for some time, we are seeing an increasing trend towards output or transaction-based pricing. And so beginning with Q1, we are breaking out transaction-based contracts separately, which were approximately 9% of revenue in the quarter. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 364. And now moving to a discussion on margin. We remain committed to and are on track to achieve our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019. In the first quarter, we continued focus on driving higher value services, in addition to continual improvement in our business, focusing on levers such as sustained higher levels of utilization, optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively. Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 79%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 83%. And on-site utilization was 92% during the quarter. Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $5 billion of cash, short-term investments and restricted cash. Net of debt, this was up by $33 million from the quarter ending December 31 and up $1.15 billion from the year-ago period. This balance at the end of the quarter includes restricted cash and short-term investments of $507 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the India income tax department. Receivables were $3 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO of 75 days, up 4 days versus last quarter. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard increased our DSO for the quarter by two days. Our outstanding debt balance was $773 million at the end of the quarter. Our diluted share count was 589 million shares for the current quarter. Now I would like to now comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $16.05 billion to $16.3 billion, which represents growth of 8.4% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $4 billion to $4.04 billion. And for the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $1.09. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 586 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%. For the full year 2018, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 21% and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $4.47. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 585 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. As I mentioned earlier, our tax rate expectation has increased from our previous guidance due to an updated interpretation of the GILTI provision. The impact of this higher estimated tax rate on EPS is partially offset by our better than expected performance in Q1, as well as the expected benefit from the Boulder acquisition, which closed last month. As we receive additional clarification and the interpretation continues to evolve, our estimate of the impact of the GILTI provision could change. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes stock-based compensation; acquisition-related expenses and amortization; realignment charges; net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses; any future adjustments to the onetime 2017 incremental income tax expense related to the tax reform act; and our contribution to the new Cognizant U.S. Foundation, which we expect to fund in the second quarter of this year. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment in areas such as immigration or tax. In summary, our solid execution in Q1, along with continued investment in the business, has positioned us well to deliver another strong year of revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask if there's any change to your organic revenue growth outlook versus 90 days ago. The Boulder Health, I thought that would have a little bit more impact starting in the second quarter. So can you also maybe update us on the acquisition contribution to revenue this year? Thanks.. Karen McLoughlin : Sure. Tien-tsin, this is Karen. Let me take that. So as you would have seen obviously, we took up the bottom end of the revenue guidance to about 8.4%, which did account for the Boulder acquisition. However, FX also moved against us so that offset about half of the benefit that we'll get from Boulder this year. So if you recall, at the beginning of the year, we had said there was about 100 basis points of FX year-over-year impact. That number has now dropped to about a 70 basis point impact on a year-over-year basis because of the recent movement in the European currencies. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. So on the organic revenue side, any change there, since I'm at it, on the 606 front? What can you - go ahead, sorry. Karen McLoughlin : Yes. So on an organic basis, no changes in our guidance other than for Boulder and the FX movement as we talked about. The 606, as you saw, was a little over $20 million for the quarter. Obviously, that's more of a timing issue than anything because, ultimately, that reverses as those contracts mature. So on a full year basis, we still don't expect to have a material impact from 606. Tien- tsin Huang : There is a material, okay. Thank you, Karen. Operator : Our next question is from the line our Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. I'll ask my questions upfront. Just looking at Financial Services, on the larger bank spend. It doesn't look like we've seen any real pickup in increase in spend there. And then secondly, Karen, how long can you guys continue to grow the revenue growth high single digits to low double digits without growing the headcount much? Thanks. Rajeev Mehta : Yes. Bryan, this is Raj. I'll take the first part, and then Karen can answer the second part. Look, financial -- our banking portfolio, I think, it's in transition. Obviously, you're seeing a good healthy growth in the mid-tier banks, but the challenge is obviously the large money-center banks. And honestly, our portfolio is in transition. In one side, you have some of our portfolio which represents more of the legacy work. That continues to get optimized. And with that, we continue to evaluate what we think is strategic and to make sure that we can continue to deliver high margins on that work. And then we're starting to see a strong pickup on the digital portfolio at these banks, and we're actually winning a lot of work there. And we're winning in mobility solutions. We're winning in legacy app modernization, even some initial work in blockchain. So the business in digital is really growing at a healthy pace, consistent to the overall Cognizant digital growth. But - so the overall - look, the business is growing there. But the portfolio, as we get - as additional digital spend continues, I think then we'll start getting back to the healthy strong growth that we've seen in banking. Karen McLoughlin : And Bryan, so to answer your question about headcount. So I do think that as we look to the next few months, we'll start to see headcount increase on an overall basis. There's a number of things. Obviously, did a great job of bringing up utilization last year, and it held fairly flat on a sequential basis from Q4 to Q1 both on-site and offshore. But I wouldn't want to take it up much beyond where we are right now given the current environment and the demand environment and this need for new skills and so forth that we're seeing in the marketplace. But having said that, while you've got headcount growth and strong demand obviously in digital, then there are parts of the business where automation and so forth are also helping us to drive utilization and manage headcount more effectively. So I do think you'll see headcount grow in the coming months. But as we've talked about in the past, I would no longer expect headcount and revenue to grow in line with each other as the business continues to evolve. Bryan Keane : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one more on the financials, Karen. Can you maybe talk about the extent to which you expect attrition to tick down either short term and what your plans are to kind of reduce the attrition rate longer term? And maybe talk about how much of the attrition was voluntary versus involuntary in the quarter. Rajeev Mehta : Yes. Jim, this is actually Raj. Look, we don't break out the voluntary and involuntary. I think the key point to notice are the number that we quoted includes everything, includes our attrition that happens in our BPO business, our training pool, all the voluntary, involuntary and plus the trainees. I think one thing you got to keep in mind in this -- look, obviously, we're committed to reducing the number in terms of attrition. But we've invested over the past -- I would say, over the past seven years, we've been investing a lot around digital, especially with all of our SMAC, social mobility analytics and cloud initiatives. So in addition to that, we've trained many of our associates around all the digital skills, and so it's not surprising, especially in this environment that we're at. A lot of our employees, a lot of our associates, given their latest digital technology skills, it's not a surprise our competitors use that as an opportunity to attract associates. But we continue to monitor the levels. I think we've seen this in the past during the dot-com days. We had fluctuations in terms of our attrition. But we continue to attract, we continue to monitor and we continue to engage our employees. And we think we have a great platform for growth for our associates, and we would expect that -- attrition levels to come down in the future quarters. Karen McLoughlin : Yes. And I think, Jim, let's also keep in mind there is some seasonality to attrition, right? So we tend to see attrition spike after bonus payments. You tend to see a spike after promotions and raises and so forth. And if you recall, last year, we didn't -- we've deferred our promotions and the raises until the fourth quarter. So I think we've seen a little bit of a change in the seasonality pattern. Obviously, this year, we expect to do raises and promotions on a normal schedule, back in early Q3, but there is some seasonality to those numbers. Jim Schneider : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow up, can you maybe provide us with a little bit of an update on your M&A outlook and particularly your willingness to commit to some larger deals rather than some of the tuck-in acquisitions you've been doing thus far? Francisco D'Souza: Jim, it's Frank. I would say largely consistent with what we have said in the past, which is that the primary focus will continue to be small tuck-ins. And as we've said in the past, as we become bigger, the definition of what is small and what tucks in gets larger. Boulder was a little bit bigger compared to things that we've done in the past. But I'm also - and I've said that we are open to looking at something that's larger, more transformative if it's the right thing. We feel like the TriZetto acquisition that we did a few years ago is now well integrated. We have the capability and the capacity, the management bandwidth to be able to integrate something larger at this point. But we'll be cautious, and we will only do something large if it makes strategic sense that the - and the economics work and we think we can create value for shareholders obviously. The places that we'd obviously be continuing to look would be things like digital. We've talked a lot about digital and the progress we've made there. If we found something that could accelerate our shift to digital, we would consider something along those lines. If you - we look at international expansion. We talked about international on the script today and I think that -- in prepared comments. I think those are also interesting potential opportunities. We think there's plenty of growth left for us in non-U.S. markets, so we could look at something like that. And then, of course, we continue, like we did with TriZetto, to look at software and IP and platforms and those kinds of assets. Jim Schneider : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up to start on the attrition point. I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit of color on which parts of the pyramid perhaps drove the increase. I know, in the past, when there's been a spike, it's tended to be kind of at the lower levels. And around the middle of last year, we had that dynamic, and are you contemplating higher wage increases this year vis-\u00e0-vis last year to try and combat some of the war for talent? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. Jason, it's Karen. So in terms of where the attrition is happening, it does tend to be in the lower ends of the pyramid, which is historically where we've seen attrition. Over the years, the middle, top end of our pyramid tend to have very low attrition, tend to be skewed towards offshore obviously, which is where the vast majority of our - the junior part of our pyramid is based. So that's fairly consistent with what we've seen during other periods of high attrition. In terms of wages, we will base ourselves on what the market does, both in India and elsewhere around the world. And so as that becomes a little bit more apparent as to what competitors are doing, we will certainly make sure that we are competitive in the marketplace in that regard. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Moshe Katri : Thank you. Just a clarification. When you spoke about Financial Services, did you say that you expected a modest improvement this year? And then just to follow up, is there a way to quantify the portion of the legacy business in Financial Services just to kind of give us a feel of how to kind of look at the entire growth -- the growth of the entire vertical this year? Thanks. Rajeev Mehta : Yes, Moshe. So look, what I said is that we are having -- we're starting to see a pickup on the spend on the digital side of the business, and it is growing at a very healthy pace, with -- in line with the company. I think with that, right, as we continue to -- the large money-center banks, you're starting -- they're obviously much healthier with all the -- some of the changes with the tax reform. You're starting to see more spending there. So I would expect that as some of these engagements continue to get larger and more prevalent with the \"money-center\" banks, at some point, you'll get the increasing demand there to outstrip some of the optimization that's happening in the legacy portfolio. So in terms of the business -- I mean, in terms of -- we are going -- so the business is growing even with all the focus on some of the optimization. And then along with that, right, you have some of the money-center banks also looking at - with some of the changes in regulatory and amount of work that they've outsourced, they continue to look at some work in-house as well too. So overall, with all that, the business is growing, and I would expect some sort of pickup at some point later in the year. Karen McLoughlin : Yes. And I think, Moshe, if I could just add to that. In fact -- obviously, while banking is growing slower than the overall Financial Services practice, Q1 was, in fact, the strongest year-over-year growth in the last several quarters. So I think while still not where we'd like it to be, it's certainly starting to trend in the right direction. And then in regards to your question of legacy versus digital type spend, the banking practice is right in line with company average. So the company average is about 29% of our revenue right now is digital, and that's right in line with our Financial Services practices as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hi, thanks. I wanted to start off with a clarification. Karen, when you said full year ASC 606 is immaterial for revenues, would that apply to operating income and EPS as well? And then the question on reskilling is, can you comment broadly? As you roll out technology training and such, what percent of new skills come from new hires versus reskilled people? And does that have an impact on attrition? Karen McLoughlin : So in terms of -- Ashwin, in terms of the rev rec changes, obviously, a lot of this is a timing issue. So depending on the timing of contracts and the structure of contracts and so forth, revenue will get pulled forward or deferred. And similarly, on the margin side, what happens is, under the new rules, there are more of the -- what I would call transition or implementation costs that we are required to capitalize than we did in the past. So you saw a little bit of that impact in Q1. At this point, we're not expecting that to have a material impact on the quarter -- or on the year rather. But obviously, as new contracts come in, that will certainly make the final determination of what that looks like. In terms of -- go ahead, Frank. I'll turn it over to Frank for reskilling. Francisco D'Souza: Yes. Ashwin, I'm not sure how exactly to answer your question on reskilling. What I'd -- as you know, we reskilled tens of thousands of employees last year. We continue to do that quite aggressively, but that's not some -- that's not a recent phenomenon. As Raj pointed out, we've been skilling and training -- and more than skilling and training, we've been executing projects in the digital area for the better part of seven or eight years now from the time we first talked to you about SMAC and so on and so forth. So we think we've got a very digitally scaled and skilled workforce. And as Raj pointed out, I think part of the reason that we're seeing higher attrition is that competitors view us as a good place to get talent from. So and again, that's not inconsistent with what we've seen in past technology transitions. We have a very structured process and a very -- we're very focused when we reskill or retrain somebody. We get them deployed in the new skills as quickly as we can so that, from a career management standpoint, obviously, it's maximizing our investment when we do that, but it's also an important retention tool. So when you think about how we go through the process, reskilling and retraining and redeploying is really the primary source. And then we rely on recruiting to fill gaps when our reskilling and retraining and redeploying doesn't create the right skills in the right geographies or the right locations. So recruiting is sort of the -- in a sense, the last resort when we can't fill from internally. And when I say recruiting, I mean experienced recruiting. Of course, we're always recruiting at the entry level to continue to grow the business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Essex : Hi, good morning. And thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could first start with a follow-up to Jim's question. Just maybe outlook for M&A through the remainder of the year. And maybe to follow up, how much cash in the U.S. on the balance sheet, might we see a bit of an acceleration there, maybe what the composition of your pipeline looks like relative to prior periods. Is that getting more robust? Just a little bit of color on what expectations through the rest of the year might be. Francisco D'Souza: I would say, Brian, the pipeline of small tuck-in acquisitions continue to be robust. I would characterize it as about the same as it's been over the last 12 months, maybe a little bit more robust but not meaningfully so. And then the bigger deals are - we continue to evaluate different things, but those are, I would say, so unique that I don't think we'd have any more substantial -- any more of a substantial pipeline than we've had in the past. We've always continued to look at the bigger deals. But as I said before, we'll be very careful and cautious on what we do, and it's got to be a good fit. So if we find something that makes sense this year, clearly, we'll look at it and we'll execute on it, but it isn't a foregone conclusion by any stretch that we would do something this year. We'll continue to look and evaluate. And I'll turn it over to Karen on U.S. cash. Karen McLoughlin : Yes. So I think, as I talked about on the call, we did bring back about $2 billion back to the U.S., which was obviously a benefit we could do after U.S. tax reform. We've spent about 1/4 of that, about $500 million -- just under $500 million on Boulder. Certainly, our objective is to make sure that we have enough flexibility around the world, not just in the U.S. but in Europe and elsewhere, to take advantage of transactions as they occur. As Frank said, right, the timing is not always that predictable. So certainly, we will continue to evaluate our cash needs around the world and also evaluate the capital return program as we look forward over the next few months. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Please proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : Okay, great. I want to ask about how the underlying margin picture might be changing over time. In the industry at large, on the negative side, we've see margin disappointment at Accenture and IBM, and Infosys just guided to some meaningful margin contraction. And our pricing data do show some challenges in certain key markets. But on the positive side, your commentary about digital margins have suggested pretty good prospects. So I guess, in this context, I want to ask, is your path to achieving your long-term margin targets looking more difficult or easier given these big factors in the industry? And I'm not asking about guidance. I know your guidance for margin is unchanged. I'm asking about the challenges involved in getting to those margin targets and whether the challenges are becoming bigger or smaller as you get closer to 2019? Karen McLoughlin : Yes. So Rod, it's Karen. Let me take a stab at that. I think, as you said, right, there's a number of different factors at play. And as we think about our margin profile and the targets that we set out for ourselves, the 22% in 2019, that was really a compilation of a number of things. So we knew, and I think we said this last year, that, certainly, the 2017 and early 2018 improvements would come from utilization and optimizing some of our SG&A spend and some of our business unit overhead spend. And certainly, we've been right on track with the benefits that we expected to achieve from that. We took a lot of those actions in '17. You're now getting the full year benefit of that in '18. And then as we look forward into 2019, it is more about the shift in the business, so the shift to digital, which is currently running at higher margin than the rest -- than the core business as well as the platform business. As that continues to evolve and mature, that starts to look much more like a nonlinear business and drive higher margins. So we're sort of, right, I guess I would say, in that pivot of now looking towards the shift in the business mix to continue to drive the margins for next year. So you do have a number of things that are offsetting each other, but we are very comfortable with the trajectory of the business at this point. We've made very good traction on the -- what I would call the cost optimization, still more room on things that we think we can do around pyramid and driving automation and so forth in the business. But we continue to evolve, and then, obviously, we'll have to see where the market is heading as we get into 2019 and beyond. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen and Company. Bryan Bergin : Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on health care. Can you comment on the overall large-deal health care pipeline? And then how may Boulder affect an integrated large-deal offering across health care organizations? Thanks. Rajeev Mehta : Yes. Bryan, it's Raj. Look, overall, health care continues to do well for us. I think probably one of the few companies that have been able to -- with investments that we've made in health care now that we -- not only the payer side of the business, but we also have an opportunity to expand our provider side of the business as well. Look, in terms of the large pipeline, right, I mean, I think those deals -- like we have done those BPaaS deals around TriZetto, there continues to be some large type of deals sort of like the Emblem ones that we have done in the past, but those take a long time to materialize. So it's hard to predict when they will come in, but we do have some of those out there. But in addition to that, we've seen a lot of progress around our TMG BPaaS solutions as well. As you're aware, it addresses the Medicare, Medicaid. So we're seeing a lot of good traction and, along with that, a lot of new products that are coming out of the TriZetto space as well, the QNXT platform that addresses more the small player and then our CareAdvance solution as well. So in addition to that, right, as you're aware, there's a lot of potential mergers and acquisitions that are out there. We're excited about the opportunity because not only are we working for the company that may get acquired, but the acquiree as well too. So I think, as those transactions continue to develop, I think there'll be good opportunity for future M&A work as well. Karen McLoughlin : Yes. And I think if I could just add to that, Bryan. I think what's nice with the suite of offerings we have now in health care, with the Boulder acquisition in particular, is that really does open up that full end-to-end market of not just the payers, which has been our historical strength, but also the provider market. And with the platforms now that we have between Boulder and TriZetto and so forth, we can really offer that full-service suite of offerings for clients. And it also opens up a whole new market of clients not just in the provider. But even in the payer space, what we're seeing is now, with the platform business, bigger opportunities with what I'd call small and mid-sized payers who historically wouldn't have had enough spend, frankly, to be significant clients for us. But with the platform business, we can really open up those opportunities now, and we continue to be, I think, very bullish on the long-term benefits and opportunities for health care. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene : Thanks, good morning. I'll ask a couple of questions upfront. Given the size of the Boulder acquisition, maybe Karen, you could help us sort of frame the annual revenue contribution, the impact on margins and give us some sense of what kind of growth expectations for it. And then a follow-up for Raj would be, I thought you heard -- I thought I've heard you say that retail was somewhat sluggish, which is somewhat counterintuitive, so maybe -- the retail environment actually seems fairly solid, so maybe just some color there? Karen McLoughlin : So on Boulder, Glenn, we didn't break it out, but it's roughly - this year, it'd be roughly $100 million of contribution, fairly neutral on the margin line, a little bit dilutive but not enough to be material. So - and then, obviously, we'll expect the synergies to start to kick in probably not this year but certainly maybe split into this year or as we get into next year. And then, Raj, you want to comment on... Rajeev Mehta : Yes. So Glenn, look, I think we're starting to see a little bit of pickup in retail, but I think when I compare it to previous years, it's still a little sluggish. I mean we're starting to see the retailers are starting to invest a lot in emerging technologies, such as robotic, RPA and intelligent automation and even AI algorithms. So we're starting to see that, but again, when I compare it to previous years, it's still a little sluggish for us. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Arvind Ramnani : Hi. Just a quick clarification. From my understanding, your guidance doesn't include M&A, right? Karen McLoughlin : So Arvind, our guidance does not include prospective M&A. It includes the benefits of Boulder and the deals that we've already completed, but it does not include prospective M&A. Arvind Ramnani : Great. And just a broader question on digital. The definition has certainly evolved from SMAC to digital. Can you comment on what the high-growth areas of digital are, and how are you able to stay in front of these newer technologies? And also, if you can expand on how you're changing your sales and delivery team with the definition of digital is - keeps evolving? Francisco D'Souza: Arvind, it's Frank. There are, I guess, a number of different areas within digital, so I'll point out a few of the key high-growth ones. First of all, digital engineering, which is sort of the new way of app development, is obviously high growth. And continuing within what we call digital systems and technology, things like cybersecurity, cloud migration, replatforming to the cloud, all of those are, I would say, high growth. Within the digital operations business, the higher growth parts there are, as Raj pointed out, robotic process automation, intelligent process automation, using other forms of automation and artificial intelligence to automate key business processes. And then within our digital business practice, virtually all of that is higher growth. You look at things like data and insight, you look at Cognizant interactive that I spoke a little bit about during my prepared comments, looking at smart products both within the [indiscernible] and the digital business portfolio. So digital business is almost entirely all high growth. So that gives you a little bit of a picture. As I -- as we said in the past, there is no real consistent definition of digital across the industry. So I think our definition is a prudent but perhaps somewhat conservative definition. We are trying to give you a good sense of kind of what we think of as the core high-value digital works that we do so that you get a sense of the progress that we're making as we continue that shift. And I think the second part of your question was on skilling and retraining. I think that we've talked a lot about skilling and retraining, and we're doing a lot of it, equally focusing on rotation of our associates across the business because we think it's important to give people exposure to multiple technologies and skills and capabilities. I think one of the things that's just worth noting is that, in many ways, the company has a very strong engine of retraining and reskilling. It's not something that we've -- that's new in the digital world. I mean, we've been reskilling and retraining our employees from day one. So we've got a very strong DNA, and we've got a very strong capability. And I think reskilling, retraining is something that we do particularly well. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. We have time for one final question, which will be coming from the line of Frank Atkins with SunTrust. Frank Atkins : Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. I appreciate it. A quick question, in your prepared remarks, you talked about driving further international business. Can you talk about demand outside the U.S., especially on the digital side and the margin for that work? And then, as my kind of second part, can you explain a little bit more clearly exactly what the change was in the view on taxes for the year? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: Sure, Frank. Let me talk about growth outside the U.S. As we said during -- I said during the prepared comments, last year, our non-U.S. market crossed $3 billion. We still think there's tremendous opportunity upside and growth there. We see -- as you know, the economies around the world are -- certainly in the markets where we participate largely, are doing quite well. The economies are doing well, so we see the same fundamental drivers of growth in many parts of the world as we see in the U.S. -- of digital adoption as we see in the U.S. In some parts of the world, as happens with technology, you even see stronger growth as some economies leapfrog one generation of technology and go straight to digital, skipping over older generations of technologies. So we see good demand around the world. And in general, as we've said, the margin on our digital work is higher than company average margin. And let me turn it over to Karen on the tax question. Karen McLoughlin : Yes, sure. So Frank, regarding the tax, right, I think, as we all understand, the new U.S. tax laws were put in place fairly quickly back in the fourth quarter. And as we've gone into 2018, there's been a lot of folks continuing to look at the language in the tax law and continuing to refine both the interpretation of the laws. And in some cases, there have been some clarifications and updates to that. In particular, the one area of focus that has received some, I guess I would call it, review scrutiny is around what they call the global intangible low tax income or GILTI. And essentially, what that means for us is that it provides a limit on the amount of foreign tax credits that we're able to get. This was not clear back in the fourth quarter and back in February when we gave the original guidance, but as we've looked at the law more closely, at least in its current writing, we believe that, that will impact our tax rate for this year. And as we've said, it's about $0.09 of EPS. It is possible that there may be some clarifications around this later this year or in the future or perhaps even a complete revision. We're not sure at this point. But for now, we thought it prudent to base our tax -- our guidance and our tax rate and EPS on the law as it is currently drafted, and that's what caused the change in the impact there. For anybody who has more questions, you can certainly reach out to us on that, and there will be more clarification in our 10-Q filing when that is filed later today or tomorrow. Francisco D'Souza: Great. And with that, I think we'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for joining us again today and for your questions. And we look forward to speak with you again next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call. This morning I'd like to cover two topics, first, a few financial highlights in Q2 and then a brief update on how we're continuing to gain share with our leading digital services. Let's begin with the quarter. We're now about halfway through executing the financial strategy we announced 18 months ago. As this quarter's results show, we're making solid progress on key aspects of our plan and we're on track to meet our goals for the year. Second quarter revenue was $4.01 billion, within our guided range, and up 9.2% year-over-year. In the quarter, our digital revenue grew in the low 20% range, well above company average, and is approaching 30% of total revenue, reflecting our continuing shift to digital revenues. Our portfolio digital services generated margins above the company average, and our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.19. As these results underscore our emphasis on digital services is helping us win more business with attractive margins. And that enables us to deliver higher quality growth for the company. During Q2, we also launched a $600 million accelerated share repurchase and we're on track to deliver on our commitment to return $3.4 billion to stockholders by the end of 2018. Turning to guidance, we expect third quarter revenue to be within a range of $4.06 billion to $4.1 billion. We expect full-year revenue to be within a range of $16.05 billion and $16.3 billion, a growth of 8.4% to 10%. And we remain confident in our previously stated guidance of achieving non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 of approximately 21%. Now moving to my second topic, thriving in today's business environment. Last quarter, I covered Cognizant's execution progress using a three-part framework, digitize, globalize, and localize. Using that same framework, I'd like to talk about how we're continuing to advance our business, starting with digitize. To underscore our digital progress, consider some of the new work we're doing in two areas of growing importance to clients; first, artificial intelligence and analytics; and, second, cloud. Through our digital business practice, we use data and analytics, optimized with machine learning and artificial intelligence, and, of course, intimate knowledge of our clients' businesses to help them drive greater levels of personalization, productivity, and growth. Incidentally, Cognizant operates one of the world's largest AI practices, measured by numbers of professionals and scope of services. A recent engagement tells our AI and analytics story. A multi-national banking and financial services client needed to stem costly credit card fraud losses. Our client handles some 700 million card transactions a month, of which about 1.3 million turn out to be fraudulent. Using machine learning algorithms we built a solution that runs real-time transactions against multiple newer network models. With our AI solution, the client was able to understand new fraud patterns, increase their fraud capture rate by 30% and reduce the rate of false positives, that is, legitimate transactions wrongly declined by 100%. We see abundant opportunity to apply AI and machine learning to our client's business to help them improve their operational performance and generate new growth. Cloud is another enabler of end-to-end digital transformation. By year-end, we expect our global cloud workforce to exceed 20,000 associates. Today, about half of our current cloud focused associates work in our Digital Systems & Technology practice, which brings together applications, infrastructure and security to help clients rapidly deliver new applications and services, support product development at scale and shrink time to value from years to months. For a major health insurer, we moved 18 business critical applications from their legacy infrastructure to the pivotal cloud foundry platform in just months, managing every step from analysis, design, and remediation to application release and program management. Doing so not only reduced application failures and infrastructure costs, it also helped the insurer move to a rapid software development model, speeding the movement of applications into production with weekly instead of monthly code releases and eliminating the need for downtime due to upgrades or refreshes. Clients turn to us because we've built the composite of end-to-end capability, domain knowledge, global and local delivery and continuing investment to deliver some (07:02) strategy through implementation and outcomes. And that end-to-end capability includes thousands of certified cloud experts who can accelerate clients' cloud journeys by drawing on our strategic partnerships with all of the major cloud providers, including Azure, Amazon Web Services, Salesforce.com, Workday and more. So we expect our digital portfolio to continue to grow at double-digit rates. Our second approach to today's environment is to further globalize. We continue to expand our geographic footprint and add new delivery and operation centers, as well as client co-innovation centers, our collaboratories. A key measure of our progress is how well we're able to think globally, think locally and act on both levels simultaneously, which is essential for our largest clients. We take exactly that approach in helping a global banking client that operates in over 50 countries become fully digital. We've been this client's business partner for more than a dozen years and we fully aligned our operating model to their business by bringing together global delivery, our digital practice areas and consulting along with regional engagement as well as specialized teams to enable the adoption of service transformation through cloud, automation and digitization. As a result, we've had a transformative impact on our client. We serve them globally through our operation centers in seven countries. We're their strategic partner for implementing a core banking product platform, we provide end-to-end digital business, operations and technology services for their global asset management group. We've enabled the rollout of new customized applications for digitizing their private and retail banking platforms. And we support their global infrastructure of more than 1 million servers and databases and 0.5 million web applications. Our global clients find this level of comprehensive global engagement compelling and differentiating. With our global foundation, which we continue to scale, we believe several of our non-U.S. markets could each become $1 billion businesses early in the next decade. A third emphasis is on continuing to localize. In every large scale digital transformation a portion of the work needs to be done close to clients. Core to our localization efforts is our network of client delivery centers in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. A quick update on our progress in North America. We now have delivery facilities in over 20 states in the U.S. as well as multiple centers in Canada and Mexico, with plans to expand this network in 2019. We have centers that specialize in key technologies and industries with, for example, Dallas becoming our digital engineering hub, and Tampa focused on Financial Services and Healthcare. And some of our centers are designed to create dedicated educational and community partnerships to speed their development of talent that's specific to our client needs. So to wrap up, we recently reached a major milestone, 20 years on NASDAQ, a sign of how far we've come and how much our business has grown and evolved over the past two decades. As the world's technology dependence increases and the definition of digital broadens to encompass new technologies, our market opportunity keeps expanding. We're successfully executing our strategic plan to accelerate Cognizant's shift to digital. Our business is solid and we remain confident that we can both invest for growth and achieve our financial targets. And now over to Raj who will talk about how our industry segments performed in the quarter. Raj? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Over the last several years, we've been investing to diversify our business beyond Financial Services and Healthcare and expand our presence in new industries where we're building a range of digital capabilities for clients. A sign of how well our effort to diversify is working is that the company grew over 9% in the quarter, despite the underperformance of our largest industry segment, and three of our four industry segments delivered double-digit growth. Let's take a closer look at how our verticals performed, starting with our Communications, Media and Technology, which had strong year-over-year growth of 15.8%. This performance came mostly from our Technology and Media clients and offset slower growth with our clients in the Communications industry, where consolidation and M&A activity are under way. Among our Technology clients are a who's who of Silicon Valley marquee names. Their rapid growth is enabled in part by our ability to help accelerate digital-at-scale. These digital native leaders deal with billions of users and vast amounts of content, so they turn to us to help them efficiently monitor, verify and manage their ever-expanding volume of information and streamline and manage their ad operations. For our Media clients, it's a similar story. We look to their strategy of using digital first approach to drive a differentiated customer experience across all their content. These clients seek our help to become digital businesses at the core. And we respond with solutions that span the full content life cycle from creation to consumption. We also provide marketing and advertising solutions that leverage their rich data capture across all their touch points to create personalized offerings in the new digital world. Moving to Products and Resources, we increased revenue 12.4% year-over-year led by strong growth of our energy and utility clients. Within this segment, we've been stepping up investments in their energy and utility markets to the point where our clients now include 4 out of the top 6 oil and gas super majors, 7 of the top 10 U.S. utilities and 5 of the top 10 electric utilities in Europe. As an example of our energy sector work, we're building a data-driven digital organization for Australia's Endeavor Energy, which supplies electricity to more than 2.4 million people. Endeavor called our business and SAP experts to design a feature-ready scalable SAP platform. With this new platform, Endeavor is transforming and automating their customer experience, their buying and selling of energy, and their core business processes such as procurement and supplier management. They're now able to deliver better services to their customers. In manufacturing and logistics, our clients include 8 of the top 15 industrial manufacturers. Here, we continue to see strength in smart product development, industrial automation and investments focused on improving the customer experience and supply chain visibility. In retail, our business saw modest continuing improvement as the industry maintains a focus on reducing costs in the face of consolidation and profitability pressures. That said, we do see signs of the retail industry picking up as clients work to enhance the customer experience they provide through a point of service applications and better execution of the in-store fulfillment processes. As a result, we are seeing increased demand of our automation solutions, IoT and supply chain optimization. Now let's turn to banking and financial services, which grew 4.5% year-over-year. We continue to see strong growth among our insurance and mid-tier banking clients as they work to transform their business models, their distribution strategies and their customer interactions by investing significantly in advanced technologies. In our insurance business, our strong growth was mostly the result of large multi-service deals. For one large insurer we helped design a data-focused strategy to drive customized financial wellness products for retirees. And for another insurer, we're implementing an omni-channel solution to improve the user experience, enhance cross-sell and up-sell capabilities. Our mid-tier banking clients are also embracing modern IT infrastructures to seize the benefits of digital technologies. For example, we redesigned Bank Julius Baer's core systems, applications, business processes and customer interfaces to automate and simplify transactions as they modernize operations. With this modern infrastructure, the bank can more quickly expand its range of wealth management products and services while improving operational agility. Now as we've discussed on prior calls, the story among our large money center banking clients remains mixed. On one hand, in today's positive business environment, some of our large banking clients are spending more on new technologies to transform their businesses. And since our digital revenue with the banking segments is seeing strong growth, we believe we're increasing our share of that change the bank is spending. In fact, we won a number of large scale projects related to blockchain implementation, cloud migration and digital engineering. On the other hand, large banks continue to face increasing pressure on their run to bank spending. As you know, a substantial portion of our work for these large banks is focused on their core IT systems. That said, the strong growth of our banking related digital revenue is helping to offset some of the pressures. And, as our engagement continues to shift from legacy to digital work, we're beginning to see some of our large clients return to a growth phase. We are optimistic about this shift because banks have realized that they have no choice but to rewrite their futures with digital. Now let's look at Healthcare, where revenue was up 10.1% year-over-year. Within our life science practice, we excel at helping biopharma and med tech companies transform their businesses. And that's why a large life science company has just engaged us to help transform every aspect of its global business. Cognizant is partnering with their IT organization to maintain, build and modernize their full application suite, which will touch nearly every process in the company, from finance, to manufacturing, to drug development. In another part of our engagement within their core operations, we'll be helping deliver a substantial boost in their productivity through automation, enabled in part by installing more than 100 bots. Within our Healthcare practice, let's turn to our opportunities in Medicare and Medicaid program servicing. The TMG transaction, which closed last year, has positioned Cognizant as one of the strongest processors of government healthcare programs. In fact, we now process claims and other mid and back office functions for a substantial portion of the Medicare and Medicaid covered lives in the U.S. Our government healthcare programs offered through TMG are positioned to capture continued growth in these segments. And we've added new clients to the TMG platform this quarter. Overall, the story of our industry segment is one of solid execution and continuing product growth. Now, before I wrap up, I'd like to offer a few comments about our talent base. Given our knowledge-intensive work, we depend heavily on the insights, passion and collaboration of our global associates. And we invest substantially and continuously in their skills and development to maintain our relevance to clients. So, of course, we're unhappy to see our annualized attrition rate reach 22.6% this quarter, we attribute this attrition to three factors : First, global demand is increasing for the very skills we specialize in, at a time when the tech talent shortage is growing. Second, there's our company's ongoing transition as we continue to strengthen and simplify our operations. And third, as mentioned on prior calls, we've implemented more robust performance management over the past 18 months. In light of these factors, our workforce strategy has several engagement and development programs underway. This includes the use of local delivery centers that Frank mentioned, which enable us to attract and retain highly skilled local talent who can serve multiple clients from a single location without having to relocate. What's more, we expect our regular annual pay increases, which take place in the third and fourth quarters, to help retain our highest performers. Now, to be clear, Cognizant remains a magnet for top tier talent in the advanced digital technologies of greatest importance to our clients. And last week, Forbes named Cognizant to its Best Employers for Women 2018 rankings, where we made the top quartile of their list. The criteria included working conditions, diversity, pay equity, and how likely those surveyed, would recommend their employers to others. We're proud of this recognition. Okay. To sum up, we've resolved to be our clients' go-to digital transformation partner and to that end, we will sustain the comprehensive building, investing and operational strengthening of our business. Karen, over to you. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. Q2 performance was solid. Revenue of $4.01 billion, increased 9.2% year-over-year, including 100 basis points favorable impact from currency. Europe grew 19.2% year-over-year in Q2, including a 6.4% positive impact from currency. And the rest of world was up 3.8% from a year ago, including a 60-basis point negative impact from currency. Results in both the UK and Asia-Pacific were impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. While acquisitions like Netcentric and Mirabeau are further enhancing our digital leadership in Continental Europe, leading to a number of recent digital wins. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and the initial funding of the Cognizant U.S. Foundation, was 22%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19, exceeding our guidance primarily due to strong operating margin performance. 18 months ago, we announced a plan to return $3.4 billion to stockholders by the end of 2018 through a combination of $2.7 billion in stock repurchases and $700 million in dividends. With the anticipated Q3 completion of the accelerated share repurchase we previously announced on June 15th, we will deliver early on our share repurchase commitment. And today, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on August 22. We are committed to maintaining a robust capital return program and anticipate having an update to the program in the coming quarters. Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services represented 57.1% of revenue and outsourcing services 42.9% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 6% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 13.6% from Q2 a year ago. In the quarter, a large transformational project moved to steady state with a corresponding step-up of operations work. This resulted in a shift from consulting to outsourcing. Additionally, outsourcing growth benefited from the inclusion of our recent acquisition of Bolder Healthcare as well as large client wins such as TMG Health. During the second quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts. Transaction-based contracts were approximately 11% of total revenue in the quarter, a 200-basis-point increase from Q1, as the EmblemHealth contract switched to a per-member-per-month pricing model. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with a potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 371. And now moving to an update on margins, we remain committed to and are on track to achieve our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019. In the second quarter, we had strong margin performance as we continued to build on the improvements we've made in our business over the last 18 months, such as sustained higher levels of utilization, optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively. Net of hedges, our Q2 margins also benefited from the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the prior-year quarter by 23 basis points. The strong margin performance in Q2 has set us up nicely to absorb wage increases and promotions along with other investments in the business in the second half of the year while staying on track to achieve our non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 21% this year. Additionally, during the remainder of 2018, we intend to continue to improve our cost structure by further optimizing the higher end of our resource pyramid. As a result of these actions, we expect to incur $25 million to $35 million in severance costs. As we drive toward 22% non-GAAP operating margins in 2019, we also remain focused on affecting the mix shift within our business through focusing on higher value services, improving profitability within our portfolio of large, structured contracts and reassessing less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace. Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. This balance, net of debt, was down by $685 million from December 31st, as we funded the acquisition of Bolder, the $900 million ASR and $100 million to the Cognizant U.S. Foundation with cash on hand. This balance at the end of the quarter includes restricted short-term investments of $419 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department. We had strong cash generation in the quarter with cash flow from operations of $640 million, and free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow net of CapEx, was $549 million. Our outstanding debt balance was $749 million at the end of the quarter, and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to take a few minutes to provide some additional color on the change in the revenue recognition accounting standard we adopted in the first quarter. With the adoption of ASC 606, certain types of fixed bid contracts are recognized on a cost to cost basis versus our historic hours to hours or straight-line approach. The cost-to-cost approach results in more revenue during the early stages of a project for us and in more consistent margins over the life of a contract. While immaterial to our overall results for the year, we do expect to see some benefit from the adoption of the new standard on full-year revenue and operating margins. Of the $52 million impact to revenue in the first six months of 2018, less than $10 million has come from existing contracts as of December 31, 2017. Substantially all of the impact has come from new contracts and modifications. The impact of ASC 606 can vary significantly based on the timing, nature of services, pricing structure or other terms and conditions of new contracts or modifications. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full-year 2018. For the full-year 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $16.05 billion to $16.3 billion, which represents growth of 8.4% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. Based on current exchange rates and the positive currency impact realized year-to-date, the full-year favorable revenue impact from currency is expected to be approximately 60 basis points versus the full-year 2017. For the third quarter of 2018, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $4.06 billion to $4.1 billion. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $1.13. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 581 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. For the full-year 2018, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 21% and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $4.50. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 585 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, realignment charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, any future adjustments to the one-time 2017 incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Reform Act and our initial contribution to the Cognizant U.S. Foundation. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment, including areas such as immigration or tax. In summary, our solid execution in Q2, along with continued investment in the business, has positioned us well to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on the environment you're seeing with respect to financials and specifically, large banks. You talked about the continued pressure on the run-the-bank kind of spend but can you maybe give us \u2013 I think in your slides you talked about seeing some signs of incremental demand at some of the larger accounts. So can you maybe give us a sense about how firm that increased demand is, what kind of services you're seeing those from, and maybe any kind of color in terms of how fast that might develop? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hey, Jim. This is Raj, here. Look, as we said, right, I mean I think the entire Financial Services story is a mix where insurance and the mid-tier banks are doing really well and where some of the challenges are is on these large money center banks. And I think when we drill in o the large money center banks, we're talking about a handful of clients. And the good news is it looks like our North American banks, the large ones, we are seeing a turnaround there. And just to give you an example, one of our largest banking accounts went through that shift a couple of years ago, the technology shift. That's really changed. We're seeing very healthy growth at that relationship now and 40% of our work is around digital. And where the challenge still comes around is couple of our European-based accounts. And I think, as we've said before, right, each one is on a different schedule in terms of shifting towards technology. We're making smart decisions as well too, in terms of making sure that the business that we're going after is profitable business and healthy business for us as well. So we're making some conscious decisions there is as well. But I would tell you that in all of them we continue to grow in digital, they're all strategic partners. The banking revenue that we have in digital is consistent to the overall digital revenue that we have as a company. And I think we will get to \u2013 we've seen that we can deliver, we can transform these accounts. At these relationships, we impact the client, not only in the digital, but in the operations and their core technologies. So we're optimistic that those will also turn, but it's hard to predict when they will turn. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful color. Thanks. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, on the margin outlook, you kind of talked about the elevated attrition and what you're doing in terms of wage increases to offset that or get that back down. Maybe, Karen, can you address kind of how the back half margins will play out, both in terms of the cost reductions you're making at the top end of the pyramid, whatever increases you're making at the bottom end? And then whether ASC 606 is still going to be a margin tailwind in the back half? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Jim, as we said in the prepared remarks, obviously, we continue to target approximately 21% for non-GAAP operating margin, which, obviously, does suggest a reduction in the back half of the year. Typically, when we do raises and promotions, you'll see about a point \u2013 one to two points negative impact in the quarter. This year we've actually split the timing of the raises and the promotions, so we're currently \u2013 as we just announced, raises and promotions for the bottom half of the pyramid, for more the junior folks will happen in Q3; for the more senior folks that will happen in the Q4 timeframe. So you will see some bump down this quarter and then subsequently in the fourth quarter. The margin benefit from ASC 606 is a little bit hard to predict. Obviously, as we've said, just given \u2013 it's hard to know the exact timing and specifics of contracts. But we don't expect it to have a material impact on the overall results for the rest of the year, but, certainly, we will see some pressure on margins because of raises and promotions as we get into the back half of the year. But we, obviously, are still committed to our approximately 21% target for the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Thanks. Good morning. So good margin upside here, but it looks like revenue growth came in at the lower end of peers. So wanted to revisit how you're balancing your margin goals versus revenue growth. What level of revenue growth are you aiming for relative to your peers or the industry? I guess, what I'm trying to get at is how you're benchmarking revenue growth when setting your growth targets as you're going into executing the second half of your margin strategy. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hey, Tien-Tsin. It's Frank. Look, I think revenue was right within the range we guided to for the quarter. So I don't see any \u2013 I don't ascribe sort of anything particularly significant to this quarter's revenue number. And I think we've said in general that as we execute this pivot and accelerate the shift to digital that our focus is on sort of balanced revenue growth. We certainly expect to grow in line with the overall industry. As Raj said a minute ago, Raj made the comment in the context of Financial Services, but I think it's true across the business. We're being prudent about making choices of the kind of work we go offer. We're focused now on accelerating the shift to digital, focusing on higher margin work, higher value work \u2013 because that's the important work for our clients that has longevity. But I certainly expect to grow in line with the industry and continue to be confident that we can deliver the margin targets that we've laid out for you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Just wanted to follow up on the Q2 revenue coming in at the low end of the range, I guess what caused that number to come in towards the low end versus the high end when you gave guidance, I guess, three months ago? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: I mean, Bryan, it's \u2013 the range is relatively small. Given our size and scale, I don't think there's anything specific, as I said, a minute ago, to point to timing of deals when they close, timing of revenue. I mean, there's just a number of things, given our size and scale the swing between the low and the middle or the high end of the range is just execution during the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the expanded disclosure. Much appreciated. My question is around BPO. You've talked about that the recent past as being a positive area. Could you sort of get us updated there and really sort of how you're being differentiated in that space? Thank you. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Ed, I'll start and then ask Karen and Raj, if they want to add anything to it. I think BPO or Digital Operations is \u2013 it's one of the faster growing parts of the business, had very strong sequential and year-over-year growth in the second quarter. The business, I would say is doing quite well and our differentiation comes from \u2013 we've said this all along but from the earliest days that we were in that business, our differentiation comes from the fact that we're able to really infuse technology into the operations. And I would say as digital has become a more prevalent set of technologies, our ability to drive real automation into the BPO business, into Digital Operations through things like robotic process automation and IPA and using artificial intelligence and so on and so forth, is really differentiating us. So I think it's a combination of deep industry knowledge, which we've always had in our BPO business, so we're very vertically-focused, as you know, in that business, most of the BPO work we do is domain-centric, vertically-focused BPO. That's one part of it. The second part of it is that we've got a \u2013 we've had a \u2013 continue to have a strong platform strategy in that business. So in Healthcare, with the TriZetto and Bolder and TMG, all come with strong platform assets. And then the third part of it is our ability to really drive strong automation using artificial intelligence, IPA, RPA types of technologies to drive productivity in that business. I think you put those three things together and we have a pretty unique position in that market. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah, the only thing I would add to that, Edward, is I think our BPO story has really expanded from the Financial Services and Healthcare and life sciences industry to now, we're very strong players in our \u2013 the Communication, Media and Technology space, we're providing lots of work to a lot of the leading digital companies out there. In addition to that you have a strong story that's being built out in our Products and Resources group as well too. So the BPO story has significantly expanded in terms of where it was a couple of years ago. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Maybe Karen, I had a question for you. As we look at your efforts to localize and optimize your labor pyramid, maybe could you comment on the current visa environment and what you're seeing with regard to company's willingness to offshore, particularly in what appears to be a more challenging visa environment? Are they more willing to balance where the work is done? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Brian, I don't think we've really seen any change from a clients' perspective. You've got some clients who are more willing, you've got other clients who prefer to keep more of the work on-site. So we really haven't seen any shift in behavior from a client perspective. I think, as we've talked about and others have talked about in the market for some time now, there were certain types of work that clients are looking to do more on-site, some more agile development and so forth. And then when you're in a heavy transformation environment like we are today and a lot more consulting that tends to have a heavier on-site ratio. But overall, I wouldn't say that we've seen any changes in behavior from clients due to any of the immigration concerns. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Can you expand upon your efforts to drive more business within the Comm, Media, Tech and the Products and Resources vertical? Do you expect to continue to grow at these double-digit levels? And talk about how you're finding the M&A channel in those verticals. Thank you. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Bryan, I'll jump in and I'll let Frank add as well. Look, the Comm, Media and Technology is a segment that, if you recall not so long ago, we called it as others, but we've seen significant traction. We've been investing heavily into the space. I do think that at some point, right, some of the clients that we have that we're working with will become some of our largest clients for Cognizant. So I think we're making good progress in doing core technology work, digital operations and then helping in terms of \u2013 on the business side as well, too, so a healthy growth. In terms of M&A, I don't think anything specific that we're focused on CMT, but I think we look at it in terms of broad, just in terms of all the practices, right? If there is a core technology that help expand those relationships, if there's key consulting capabilities that help us broaden and deepen our relationships at those clients, we'll \u2013 or if there's geographic plays or platform plays. So I think that's our approach with CMT as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a two-part question related to demand. One is, I mean, the demand commentary that you guys have seems to be certainly turning more positive, but when I look at specifically at the 2Q performance, 3Q guide relative to consensus, you're a bit light. And then there's a 4Q catch-up, it seems like. So I wanted to ask about the, sort of the visibility, if you will, into that 4Q catch-up to hit your revenue range. And then the second part of the demand question is, if the ASC 606 accounting pronouncement had been active January 1st of last year, how much of a year-over-year net benefit would it have been? Because I think that's kind of important to size out. Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Ashwin, it's Karen. I'll try and take those and others can chime in. But if you look at the 3Q guide, and let's just, for argument's sake, say you go to the middle of the range, that would suggest about a 1% sequential Q3 to Q4 growth. That's not unreasonable, I mean that's certainly \u2013 unless there's some unusual furloughs or anything like that. So I think the guidance for Q3 puts us right where we want to be for the full-year. We're not really expecting any significant acceleration in the fourth quarter. And then in terms of ASC 606, I think really the only color we can give you is the way we've broken it out, which is that because of ASC 606, there's about $52 million of incremental revenue this year. As we said in my prepared remarks, we look at the contracts that existed at the end of last year. It's only about \u2013 it's less than a $10 million impact or benefit that we've received from that. It would be almost impossible to go back and redo all the prior-year contracts, so we really just have to look at it based on the current year results and the benefit that we've gotten, which is primarily due to contracts that have been awarded this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. I was wondering, has the mix or the service offerings within digital shifted. And how do you balance the need for investments in digital versus the cost-cutting initiatives? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah, I don't think \u2013 Joe, it's Frank, I don't think there are sort of quarter-to-quarter meaningful shifts in the digital mix. Of course, as I've said, if you take a longer term perspective, the definition of digital and what constitutes digital has changed dramatically, if you look over, let's say, a five-year period. Five, seven years ago we were talking about social and mobile and analytics and cloud as being the constituent components of digital. Today we're talking more about \u2013 in addition to those things, we include artificial intelligence and blockchain and so on and so forth added to manufacturing. All of these new things that are \u2013 so the definition of digital certainly is expanding as innovation happens and new things, new technologies emerge. So over longer period, yeah, certainly, the mix, if you will, changes. But quarter-to-quarter, I don't think there's a significant mix shift. And look, I think we're managing margin and investment the way we always have, which is we have a process for thinking about or analyzing the investments that we have, that we'd like to make, that we'd like to allocate capital to. We run the business and as we \u2013 we run the business and every quarter or so, every 60, 90 days, we look at our list of investments, say what investments do you want to? We stagger the investments. We say what investments we want to make this quarter or during this period. We release those dollars and that's how we balance margin and making the investments. That's just an ongoing process. We've tightened up that process. It's a muscle that we've had in the past. I think we've strengthened that muscle over the last 18, 24 months. I think that's good healthy capital allocation discipline that we have developed \u2013 have had in the past and continue to develop in the company. And I think that's how we look at things quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month, and figure out where to allocate our dollars against the investments that we think are going to have either the most growth return or the most strategic return over a longer period of time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Amit Singh - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. This is actually Amit Singh. Just quickly going back to ASC 606 and the first part is, for your second quarter results, you have benefit on the top-line and bottom-line in margin from ASC 606. How much of that was in the guidance that you provided last quarter? The only thing I'm trying to understand is if you remove the $31 million and if it was not in the guidance then your revenues came in below the guidance range. And then the second part is, for the full-year, I'm trying to understand what does immaterial mean? Does that mean close to zero? And would that mean in the second half of the year now the ASC would be actually a negative to revenue, margins and EPS in the second half of fiscal 2018? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. So I think, one, if we go back to Q2, right, so when we gave our Q2 guidance, obviously, that was the beginning of May. So we had a pretty good handle on what contracts we're starting and the impact of any contracts, so it was included in our guidance, both from a revenue and a margin perspective. And you can't really break it out because going back to Frank's prior comments, right, we really look at the business on an annual, monthly, quarterly and a semi-annual basis to really look at where do we think margins are going to land, what investments can we make. And we make investments to adjust to the revenue growth and the margin trajectory for the company. So you can't just pull out ASC 606 in isolation because we would have made other trade-offs if not for that. So I don't think you can look it at that way. And when we look at the full-year basis, I mean, keep in mind, even at the bottom end of our range, we're over $16 billion of revenue on a full-year basis. So 1% of revenue is $160 million, and we certainly don't expect the ASC 606 revenue impact to be even that large. So at a company level, it's not material for the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Raj, in your commentary, you mentioned something in the context of focusing on high growth and high margin accounts. Are we in the process of pruning some of those that are not kind of qualifying within the criteria and that could potentially impact or cap top-line growth down the road, i.e. you guys are focusing on some of the better opportunities out there and obviously they'll be important in the context of top-line growth down the road. Thanks. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. So, look, the answer is definitely yes, right? I mean, we made a commitment to you that we were going to go focus, shift our business towards more high-value added digital work and add healthy margins. And we are being smart and making sure that we're \u2013 the work that we're doing is strategic to our clients and presents a long-term healthy growth, healthy margin opportunities for us, so answer is yes. If there are some work that we feel that doesn't present \u2013 meet that criteria, we have chosen to walk away from. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. Moshe, I would say \u2013 it's Frank. I would just add to that. I think the choices are less at the overall client level, although we may do that as well, but more what kind of work within a client we choose to focus our energy and resources on. I would say that if you think in the long run, there're two points I'd make. One is I don't think that the constraint to our business in the long run will be demand. There's lots of demand for technology out there. So it's the smart move to pick your battles carefully and focus on the work that you think is going to be most strategically significant to the client over the long run. And at some level our constraint is where do you deploy your talent and so we're thinking carefully about how we develop our talent, how do we train them for the next generation and the next generation of work after that. And then how do we deploy that talent against the work that's going to be most meaningful to them, give them the most rewarding careers, help them to be most successful over the long run. So I don't \u2013 even though we are making very thoughtful choices about the kind of work we go after, I don't think the conclusion of that should be that it slows revenue growth in the long run, because I think there's lots of revenue opportunity within the high growth and the strategic high value margin, things that \u2013 areas of the business that we want to go emphasize. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Joseph A. Vafi - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Maybe Raj, if you could \u2013 I don't know if you could answer this or not. But on those financial services clients where there is a mix headwind, is there a way to perhaps predict when we kind of get over that hump on the headwind? I know there's different clients and different schedules, but is it something that we can overcome exiting 2018 or do you think it potentially lingers into next year? Thanks. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. So, hi, Joseph. It is hard to predict because each client is different, they're all going through various business scenarios in terms of how they're leveraging technology. But I think one thing that is definitely there, right, all of them realize that it's important to invest in digital. I think \u2013 so I do think that we have the winning formula because I think one of the key strengths that we have is because the size and nature of the work that we do there for these clients, impacting lots of the digital work we're doing, the operations and technology and having the strong domain expertise that we have at the clients, I think they all view us as a strategic partner. And I do expect that as more of our mix shifts towards digital, just like it has in North America, that we'll continue to excel at those accounts as well, but it's hard to predict the exact timeframe because each one of those accounts has a different business scenario going on. David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah. Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Harshita Rawat with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question. Harshita Rawat - AllianceBernstein L.P.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have a question on Healthcare revenue growth. It looks like the year-over-year organic revenue growth was very weak, once you adjust for acquisitions. So my question is what's driving the deceleration? And what's the path to achieving mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth in that business? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So \u2013 and really the only inorganic revenue in Healthcare was Bolder, which we acquired in April. TMG is actually \u2013 is a client win that's not an acquisition. So that is organic revenue growth. So I think on a year-over-year basis, the practice grew about 10%, if you back out the Bolder. That was a small piece of it in the quarter, less than $40 million of revenue in the quarter. So I think we continue to see strong growth in Healthcare. I actually think the comps for Healthcare will get more challenging in the back half of the year because we'll start to lap TMG in Q3 and we don't have another large deal. So if you recall, in 2016, we had the Emblem deal, which started in Q3 of 2016. Last year, we had the TMG contract, which started in Q3. There is not currently another very large platform deal slated to begin this year. So the comps will get a little bit tougher because of that. But outside of that, we continue to see nice strong healthy growth in Healthcare. David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Perfect. With that, I think we'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and for your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's can teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice-President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q to be filed later today. I would like now to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. This morning, I'd like to cover two topics : first, a few highlights from Q3, and second, since we're about two weeks away from Cognizant's Investor Day, I thought I'd give you a preview on what we'll be discussing. Let's begin with the quarter. Third quarter revenue was $4.08 billion, within our guided range and up 8.3% year-over-year. Three of our four business segments delivered a strong performance in the quarter driven largely by the increasing adoption of digital across these segments. And in the fourth segment, banking and financial services, we see good growth in our digital offerings, which continues to be offset by pressure on run-the-bank spending. As a result, our digital revenue in the quarter grew in the low 20% range, well above company average and now over 30% of total revenue, reflecting the continuing shift across segments to digital revenues. Underscoring the relevance of our industry-specific digital services to clients, we continue to see our digital portfolio generate margins above the company average. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 21.1% for the quarter, putting us on track to deliver on our full-year margin commitment. And quarterly non-GAAP EPS was $1.19. As these results suggest, our sustained emphasis on digital services is helping us win more business with attractive margins and deliver higher quality growth as clients shift more of their spending from traditional IT to digital services. Turning to guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be within a range of $4.09 billion to $4.13 billion. For the full year, we expect revenue to be within a range of $16.09 billion and $16.13 billion, a growth of 8.6% to 9%, and we remain confident in our previously stated guidance of achieving a non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 of approximately 21%. Over the last couple of months, we have announced three acquisitions to further enhance our digital capabilities. Two of them, which closed earlier this month, relate to the Salesforce Platform where Cognizant has one of the industry's largest roster of certified consultants. We acquired Advanced Technology Group, which provides customer and revenue management consulting and implementation services that are focused on the Salesforce Platform. Advanced Technology Group, headquartered in the U.S., has expertise in implementing automated, cloud-based Quote-to-Cash business processes, a new and fast growing part of the Salesforce ecosystem. Their capabilities will strengthen our cloud solutions portfolio as clients shift to business models based on recurring revenue streams. During the quarter, we also acquired SaaSfocus, one of the largest independent Salesforce Platinum consulting partners in the Asia-Pacific region with operations across Australia and India. SaaSfocus will expand our end-to-end digital transformation services and Salesforce cloud capabilities in Asia-Pacific. We're especially excited about the anticipated acquisition of Softvision announced earlier this month, which will expand our digital engineering capabilities once completed. Softvision is a leader in software product innovation and development using modern agile software engineering tools, techniques, and processes. Softvision will bring more than 2,800 technologists to Cognizant, increasing our ability to provide software engineering services to our clients from a new Eastern European base in Romania, a fast emerging hub for software developers. We expect the acquisition to close later this quarter. Adding Softvision to Cognizant will enable us to create one of the world's largest digital engineering companies. Our acquisition activity complements our ongoing organic investment in digital capabilities, domain knowledge, global and local delivery, and overall ability to deliver for clients from strategy through implementation and outcomes. Okay. So, let's move to my second topic, Investor Day, which is scheduled for Friday, November 16, in New York. Our goal for Investor Day is to discuss our mid-term strategy and growth path over the next several years. This strategy centers on helping clients become digital at scale by digitizing their products and services, personalizing the experiences they offer their customers, fully automating their business processes, and modernizing their IT infrastructures. Clients find digital at scale compelling because it generates new revenue streams, new operating models, and new ways of delighting their customers. And we find digital at scale compelling because of how well positioned we are to seize what's becoming a massive market opportunity. At Investor Day, we'll also cover the financial objectives we'll seek to deliver for the company and for shareholders including our targets for revenue, margins, EPS, and capital return for the next few years. In addition, we'll give you the opportunity to meet and hear from a cross-section of our executive leadership team. Overall, our goal for Investor Day is to present our plan for the future. One more point before I turn the call over to Raj. For Cognizant, 2018 has been a year of solid execution across many dimensions of the company. We have accelerated Cognizant's pivot to digital while driving revenue growth, margin improvement, and capital returns. And therefore, we expect our forward momentum to continue to deliver strong results. And now over to Raj who will give you an update on the performance of our industry verticals. Raj? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thanks, Frank. Good morning, everyone. Cognizant's orientation is digital-first and digital at scale. It's the way we think and the way we work based on what clients need. With that in mind, let's look at how our industry segments performed in the quarter, beginning with Communications, Media and Technology, which had strong year-over-year growth of 17.1%. Within Communications, we are helping clients co-innovate the networks of the future to enable rich complex information to move at speeds more than 30 times faster than what's possible today, leading to a significant improvement in virtual reality, robotics, healthcare, and more. Within Media, analytics has become essential to our clients' long-term success, and in our Technology vertical, content moderation continues to drive client revenue. We're proud to be working with several of the world's largest born-digital companies, which also engage us to apply AI, software engineering, and IoT solutions to help develop new business models. They know that to retain their customers, they must constantly create new and compelling experiences, and it's worth noting that in the third quarter, two of our technology clients were part of Cognizant's ten largest clients and both are continuing to grow. That compares with just three years ago when our entire top ten were either banking or healthcare clients. Moving to Products and Resources, we increased revenue 11.5% year-over-year led by strong growth from our retail and manufacturing clients. In retail, we had one of our best quarters in years. Traditional retailers are racing to strengthen their digital business channels to meet the Amazon challenge of frictionless omni-channel experiences, hyper-personalized retailing, and responsive supply chain systems. We're helping retailers implement the next stage of unified commerce and partnering with them to enable enterprise-wide transformation. The example tells a story. A mid-sized U.S. retailer wanted to offer their customers a more engaging experience as well as the convenience of buy anywhere, fulfill anywhere, and return anywhere. We helped the clients a define omni-channel roadmap and implement a cloud-based commerce solution that provides full scale order management. With the new solution in place, our client has increased the number of orders through digital channels to around 1 million a month. And we see plenty of opportunity ahead in retail as clients strive to achieve better consumer engagement and retention by using advanced e-commerce and digital ecosystem management. In manufacturing, spending among our clients remains strong as they continue to invest in making their products smarter and their consumer experiences richer. This effort is also driving digital initiatives on the factory floor, including more use of AI-driven autonomy to augment human decision making. The newest phase of manufacturing uses automated and digitized systems to bring together physical with digital. This phase combines machine to machine communication, Internet of Things, analytics, and big data to provide much better visibility into operations. For example, we're working with a global industrial manufacturing leader to improve their overall plant efficiency and transform their operations, while saving them several hundred million dollars over the next few years. We're doing this by reducing maintenance downtime, improving throughput, lifting worker productivity, and enabling increased levels of automation. Our engagement will cover more than 20 global manufacturing sites and create digital trends of their environment. These are virtual replicas of what's happening on the factory floor in near real-time and continuously analyze incoming data streams. Clients will use this analysis to manage the performance of their machines, lines, and plants with the aim of achieving significant gains in up time and productivity. Now let's turn to banking and financial services, which grew 2.6% year-over-year. Banks realized they need to break away from their legacy IT foundations and become digital at scale. That's the best way to reinvent their business models, improve their customer engagement, and achieve the technical agility needed for rapid learning and adapting. As mentioned on prior calls, our banking clients' intense focus on continuing their run-the-bank spending has affected a substantial portion of our work for them. But even with that, these clients are stepping up their spending on advanced technologies to transform their businesses. And as we extend our portfolio of services, our banking-related digital revenue has seen solid growth. We believe this growth will increasingly offset the pressure we are seeing on the run-the-bank spending. We're optimistic about the shift for two reasons. First, all banks realize they must rewrite their futures with digital. And second, our banking clients headquartered in North America are beginning to see their spending on technology rise with a growing portion of that spend allocated to digital transformation. In Europe, we expect banks to follow a similar trend. So, the expansion of our digital services is starting to bring growth back into a number of our large banking clients. This is especially true in the areas of core modernization and digital engineering services. For example, a major bank sought our help to move their legacy applications onto a cloud-native architecture to reduce cost and complexity, increase their output productivity, and become more agile. Drawing on our deep knowledge of the bank's systems, we worked with Pivotal Software to re-factor legacy applications onto the Pivotal Cloud Foundry, an open-source platform. We demonstrated how seamlessly we can integrate legacy technologies with cloud-native architecture. We are able to dramatically reduce the time it takes to release code, and we provide the bank with agile capabilities such as auto-scaling and auto-recovery. Now let's look at Healthcare where revenue was up 9.6% year-over-year. For healthcare providers and payers, the focus continues to be on improving efficiencies and advancing patient care and satisfaction. We continue to invest and position our healthcare practice to capture demand as clients shift their underlying business models from fee-for-service to value-based care. To complement our strong position in the payer market, we have expanded our scope to include the provider network of doctors, hospitals, and other clinicians. And we see continuing traction in this network. During the quarter, our healthcare consulting practice, Cognizant's largest consulting practice, had very strong growth. Turning to our Life Science practice, we excel at helping biopharma and med tech companies thrive in a world of shrinking patent expirations by improving their product development and manufacturing processes in a stringent regulatory environment. We are encouraged by a couple of developments that are driving growth in this practice. First, we see continued traction in our platform solution. Our Shared Investigator Platform is now live at five large pharmaceutical clients. This cloud-based collaboration platform makes it easier for critical trial researchers to access, share and analyze data. We have another five clients signed up with implementation expected over the next few quarters. And along with the license revenue from our Shared Investigator Platform, we will typically realize consulting, implementation, and processing services. The second development fueling growth is a number of large enterprise transformation deals in the process of ramping up. For example, we're working with one of the world's largest medical device and pharmaceutical companies to help drive several of their billion dollar brands in more than a dozen markets across the globe. Our clients needed to create an agile, efficient, and scaled global marketing organization, so we're enabling this with our assetSERV digital asset management solution. It's a cloud-based pre-configured platform that helps enterprises manage end-to-end content life cycle and deliver engaging customer experiences. We're helping the client support new ways of working by enabling reduced duplication and spend, enhanced collaboration, greater asset use and reuse, and leveraged scale. Overall, the story of our industry segments continues to be one of steady execution and progress. We are resolved to be our clients' go-to transformation partner. To that end, we continue to invest significantly in digital engineering, interactive intelligent process automation, platform solutions, analytics and AI, and core modernization, all of it is directed at helping our clients drive digital at scale. With that, I'll turn it over to Karen. Karen? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. The business performed within expectations in the third quarter as revenue of $4.08 billion was within our guided range and increased 8.3% year-over-year, including a 70-basis-point negative impact from currency. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had a $33 million positive impact to revenue in the quarter. Europe grew 15.1% year-over-year in Q3, including a 130-basis-point negative impact from currency, and the rest of world was up modestly from a year ago, including a 590-basis-point negative impact from currency. Similar to trends that we saw in the second quarter, results in both the UK and Asia-Pacific were impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients, while acquisitions like Netcentric and Mirabeau are enhancing our digital leadership in continental Europe, leading to a number of recent digital wins. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and realignment charges, was 21.1% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19, exceeding our guidance due to solid operating margin performance and a lower non-GAAP tax rate. The Q3 GAAP tax rate of 28% was higher than our previous guidance of 26%, primarily due to higher net non-operating foreign exchange losses driven by the depreciation of the Indian rupee partially offset by changes to our geographic mix of earnings. The board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on November 20. Before turning to details of our financial performance, I'd like to provide an update on the status of the FCPA investigation. As a reminder, in September of 2016, we voluntarily notified the DOJ and SEC of possible FCPA violations, and during 2016, we recorded out-of-period corrections related to $4 million of potentially improper payments. Our discussions with the DOJ and SEC have progressed to a point where we are now able to reasonably estimate a probable loss and have recorded an accrual of $28 million in our financial statements in Q3. While we believe that we are getting closer to the conclusion of this matter, we are unable to predict with certainty the timing of a final resolution. Now turning to our financial performance, Consulting & Technology Services represented 57.7% of revenue and Outsourcing Services 42.3% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting & Technology Services grew 6.6% year-over-year, and Outsourcing Services revenue grew 10.7% from Q3 a year ago. Outsourcing growth benefited from the inclusion of our recent acquisition of Bolder Healthcare as well as large client engagements such as TMG Health. During the third quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and transaction-based contracts were approximately 11% of total revenue during the quarter. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with a potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 378. And now moving to an update on margins. In the third quarter, we had solid margin performance as we continued to build on the improvements we've made in our business over the last 22 months such as sustained higher levels of utilization, optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure, and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively. Specifically during the quarter, we continued to improve our cost structure by further optimizing the higher end of our resource pyramid, resulting in $11 million in realignment charges. Net of hedges, our Q3 margins also benefited from the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the prior year quarter by 74 basis points. Solid margin performance allowed us to absorb the wage increases and promotions in the quarter, while remaining on track to achieve our full-year non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 21%. As we drive towards approximately 22% non-GAAP operating margins in 2019, we expect continued margin improvement to be underpinned by both ongoing operational efficiency and discipline, as well as effecting a shift within our business to focus on higher value services, improving profitability within our portfolio of large structured contracts, and reassessing less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace. From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate at 22% remains elevated. The value that we create for our clients is predominantly knowledge-based work. So we depend heavily on the insights, passion, and collaboration of our global associates. We believe that the higher attrition is largely the result of increasing global demand for the very skills we specialize in, the growing shortage of technology talent, particularly in local markets and the transition our organization has gone through to build a scalable foundation for expanding our digital leadership. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and management. Turning to our balance sheet which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash and short-term investments. This balance net of debt was down by $144 million from December 31 and includes restricted short-term investments of $405 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department. We had strong cash generation in the quarter with cash flow from operations of $862 million and free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow net of CapEx was $768 million. Our outstanding debt balance was $724 million at the end of the quarter, and there was no outstanding balance on our revolver. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares, including 1.1 million which represented final share settlement of the $600 million ASR launched in June. Our diluted share count decreased to 580 million shares for the quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.09 billion to $16.13 billion, which represents growth in the range of 8.6% to 9%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year. Based on current exchange rates and the positive currency impact realized year-to-date, the full-year favorable revenue impact from currency is now expected to be approximately 30 basis points versus the full year 2017. This is down from our original estimate of 100 basis point impact at the beginning of the year. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.13 billion. Based on current exchange rates, the Q4 negative impact from currency is expected to be approximately 100 basis points versus Q4 of 2017. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $1.05. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 582 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 31%. For the full year 2018, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 21% and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $4.50. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 584 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 28%. Our expected GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year is higher than our previous guidance due to incremental foreign currency exchange losses driven by the depreciation of the INR against the U.S. dollar, which are not deductible for tax purposes. Additionally, earlier this month the State of New Jersey enacted legislation that would result in an incremental annual income tax expense of approximately $70 million beginning in 2018. However, we intend to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies during the fourth quarter of 2018, which we expect to significantly reduce this income tax expense resulting from this enacted legislation. Accordingly, our Q4 and full-year estimated tax rate reflects the anticipated implementation of these tax planning strategies. We are maintaining our full year EPS guidance despite the outperformance in Q3 to absorb the higher than expected tax rate. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, realignment charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, the tax effects of the above adjustments, and adjustment to the one-time 2017 incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Reform Act, and our initial contribution to the Cognizant U.S. Foundation. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment including areas such as immigration or tax. In summary, our solid execution in Q3 along with continued investment in the business has positioned us well to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. . Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Justin Donati - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. This is Justin Donati on for Ed. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, can you break out the organic revenue growth in the healthcare unit ex-Bolder? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Good morning, Justin. This is Karen. We have not broken that out, but the Bolder contribution in the quarter was fairly small. We had said when we acquired Bolder earlier in the year that the full-year estimate was about $100 million for the year. So roughly a little over $30 million a quarter is what that's running. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I wanted to ask about the tax rate, it's running I guess a little bit higher and that's causing the EPS to drop lower than consensus. So can you talk a little bit about, Karen, the sustainability of that higher tax rate as we go forward and as we model 2019? And then secondly, Raj, some speculation around CEO succession planning, maybe you can comment on those plans? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Brian, it's Karen. I'll answer the tax rate and then I'll turn over to Frank to talk about any succession planning that may or may not be happening. So the tax rate, so this has happened before. If folks go back and take a look at the spring, summer timeframe of 2013, when there's a sudden depreciation in the rupee, we have seen this impact before. Because what happens is with so many of our assets being in India and the depreciation of the rupee, we end up with this big foreign exchange movement that is not deductible for tax purposes in India. And so that drives up the consolidated rate. But it doesn't have a long-term impact. So essentially the impact hits the quarter in which it happens and there will be a little bit of spillover into Q4 just because of the timing of the rupee movement. But if we assume that the rupee stays fairly stable going forward, then we will actually revert back to the guided tax rate. So, if people recall it, earlier in the year we had guided to a longer term tax rate of 24% to 26% with the implementation of the (29:45) tax at the federal level earlier in the year we said people should guide towards the higher end of that tax rate and that is still a reasonable position for people to assume. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: And, Brian, it's Frank. I'll take the question about succession planning. At this point, there are no changes to my responsibilities or to Raj's responsibilities. You addressed the question to Raj, but I'll take it. As I've said before, succession planning is the responsibility of the board, specifically the Nominating, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the board and we have not made any announcements on that except that you would have seen an announcement recently that as it relates to the chairman of the board, Michael Patsalos-Fox was elected Cognizant's new chairman. And he's been on the board since July of 2012, has a long history and long background in management technology consulting from his many years at McKinsey, and he succeeds John Klein who was elected to our board back in 1998 and who had served as chairman of the board since December of 2003. John will continue to remain on the board. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks so much. Good morning. Just want to clarify and then ask a follow-up just on the revenue revision to the year. Can you detail that for us, Karen? Between FX, acquisitions, and what might be incrementally weaker. And then I wanted to ask around the Softvision acquisition, we like that you guys are getting into the software engineering side. What kind of synergies might you expect by putting Softvision onto the Cognizant network? Can we expect something different here versus other deals? And maybe could we expect more in the way of investments going ahead? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, let me do the revenue roll forward, Tien-Tsin, and then I'll turn over to Frank and let him talk about Softvision and the benefits thereof. So, from a revenue perspective, I would think about it this way on a full-year basis. So on a full-year basis, essentially the 606 benefit that we've received to-date, this quarter it was a little over $30 million, has essentially been wiped out by the foreign currency movement. So FX and rev rec essentially offset each other on a full year basis or year-to-date, and I anticipate it to be on a full-year basis at this point. And then from an inorganic perspective, it's less than 1 point of revenue at this point. I think it was about 40 basis points in the quarter in Q3 was the impact of inorganic revenue growth. So it's been fairly small. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Tien-Tsin, let me talk about \u2013 it's Frank. Let me talk a little bit about digital engineering and Softvision in particular. When Softvision closes, we anticipate it to close in Q4, putting Softvision together with Cognizant's existing software engineering capability, we think will create one of the largest software engineering capabilities in the industry. Cognizant already has a very strong software engineering capability that we built largely organically over the years. Part of that has come also from acquisitions that we've done in the past, for example, TriZetto and so on, which came with a strong software engineering DNA. What Softvision will bring to us once it closes is, of course, the 2,800 creative technologists, the base in Romania that we think is a significant source of software engineering talent. And of course, software engineering and digital engineering is the new way of developing software and so we see revenue synergies as we bring that combined Cognizant and Softvision platform to many of our clients across industries, including, as Raj said in his prepared comments, to the financial services industry. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: And Tien-Tsin, sorry before we move on, Katie just pointed out to me that I misspoke. The inorganic impact for the quarter was about a 1.5 point for the year, it's about 1 point of revenue year-to-date. So apologies for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. I was wondering maybe, Raj, could you speak to some of the hiring trends that you're seeing in the market? We're hearing about some of the peers, particularly in India, I guess, pursuing retention payments to improve retention rates. I know you that you guys have focused more on training up within your organization, particularly with regard to full staff developers. And then maybe on the mix shift, how you're seeing the mix shift of head count with that attrition. Are you hiring in places that you're not seeing the attrition, and how you anticipate that to impact margins going forward? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah, Brian. Look, I think overall in terms of head count, look, our global head count increased to about 274,000, up from 268,000 the last quarter. So it's about a net addition of about 5,300. Overall in the year, we were continuing to find good talent in the marketplace in all of our geographies. We hired about 14,000 professionals around the world. And we also have a stated goal of hiring about 25,000 professionals in the U.S. over the next couple of years. So, I think there's a lot of talent in the marketplace. We're obviously addressing some of the attrition. The attrition was a little bit high for us, and we're obviously continuing to investing in cross training our resources, looking at ways of \u2013 in terms of employee engagement, retaining talent, looking at ways of also creating new opportunities in terms of job rotation as well to control that. But in terms of the \u2013 look, in terms of the mix of the pyramids and geographical split, no major changes. I mean, obviously you'll have certain projects that have some greater on-site component at certain phases of their life cycle but overall no major shifts in terms of onsite and technology delivery. And I think in terms of the margin point that you pointed out, it's important to note, as we continue to hire locally, look, you'll have some resources that will be a little bit more expensive than resources that we have leveraged in the past on visas. But I think overall when you look at it, that the total cost when you include the immigration costs, the travel costs, it's fairly constant, so it doesn't really impact margins significantly, whether you hire individuals locally or leverage (37:40). Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thank you very much. I also want to ask two. I want to start, Karen, with you on the margins. If I look at your margin performance this quarter, frankly it was disappointing and I think the stock is reflecting that. If you take out the benefit of currency and the benefit of accounting transition, your margin was actually down year-over-year. And it's unclear to me when you're talking about the 22% margin aspiration for CY2019, you're actually growing more than 100 \u2013 or intend to grow more than 100 basis points. And it's just hard to reconcile how that margin aspiration isn't going to have revenue consequences and cause your revenues to frankly underperform industry growth rates. And I'd like to follow-up with a question as well. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Keith, you also have to keep in mind that in Q3 of this year, which we did not have last year, we also had the raises and promotions, which was about 1 point of margin impact. So when you look at what's happening, certainly in the quarter while there was some benefit for the rupee; on a year-to-date basis, the rupee benefit is about zero. And while there has been some benefit obviously from the new rev rec, we have also had about 80 basis points of true operational improvement through continued driving of utilization as well as managing the pyramid and our SG&A cost effectively as well. So, we are extremely comfortable with both where the company is performing today, we are exactly in line with the goals that we set for ourselves which was approximately 21% margin this year. And on track to deliver approximately 22% margin target for next year as we have always said, we do not anticipate exceeding the margin target for the year. We will continue to take any dollars that we can and continue to reinvest those in the business above the 21% and continue to drive the shift to digital. We're very pleased with how that transition is taking place. We're very pleased with the solid revenue growth that the company has had for the year and the fact that we are very much in line with the expectations we set out both for ourselves and with our shareholders at the beginning of this year. And this is a big transition that the company is going through, but we believe managing very well both at the top line and at the bottom line and we'll continue to do so. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): My follow-up is to Francisco, and I want to ask the question that was asked slightly differently previously. But there has been some newspaper articles written about succession issues at Cognizant. And you are a member of the board. And frankly, your stock has underperformed almost every metric from the last one, two, and three years. And I'm just curious how you think the board takes that into account when thinking about succession issues in terms of looking internally versus externally, and thinking about succession planning. Thank you. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Keith, let me just \u2013 I'll come to that in a second. I just want to go back to the point Karen was making on margin and reiterate the point that Karen made, which is that, we've said that for 2018, we will deliver approximately 21% operating margin, and the way we run the business, as we have in the past and as we have for many, many years is once we've set a target operating margin for a given year or a given period, we take that very seriously. We deliver to that. But then we reinvest back in the business anything above that. So our goal is this year not to, as Karen said, deliver above the approximately 21% that we are targeting for the year. But to reinvest on top of that as we run the business \u2013 rather reinvest the excess on top of that back in the business for growth and for the transition that we're going through. And that's sort of the approach to margin. So as Karen said, in any given period, we'll have some operational improvements that drive margin improvement. We'll have some good guys from other parts from other things that may or may not be inside of our control. The way we look at that sort of is a portfolio of drivers of margin which we then use to say how much do we reinvest back in the business for growth and long-term sustainability. Look, I have nothing more to add, Keith, on the issue of succession. Except what I said, as I said, the board is constantly looking at this, that the issue of succession planning is the responsibility of the board, and we are continuing to assess and continue to make plans on the topic. We have nothing to announce at this point, and when the board is ready to make announcements, we'll do that. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on BFSI, were there specific large clients that drove the decel from Q2 and was it all still Europe driven? Just trying to understand what changed there? And can you comment on whether you have any better viability for a potential inflection point in overall BFSI growth? Thank you. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah, Bryan, this is Raj. Look, overall BFSI I think it's still a mix of a couple of different stories going on. Insurance continues to be strong. We're doing really well in the mid-tier banks. It's good to see now that we're starting to see the shift in North America. All of our North American large banking clients \u2013 in the last quarter we saw digital really driving a lot of the growth that we've had, and we're seeing good traction in terms of making that shift on the North American based clients where digital is outpacing some of the losses that we have in terms of just to run-the-bank spending that's going on. So I think North America is in good shape. Some of the \u2013 I would say a couple of the global banking clients that are outside of North America are the places that we still have some challenges. But I think the good news is we know how to manage that shift, and we expect that over a period of time, those clients as well will significantly start seeing the shift more towards the digital spend. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Hey. Sorry about that. I was on mute. I guess my question is with regards to attrition which remains high, could you break out voluntary versus involuntary and what's the plan to reduce it? Also, if you can break down by level of organization or function, any color there would be great. Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Ashwin, it's Karen. We didn't break out involuntary versus voluntary, but the involuntary in the quarter, there was no real change from where it's been, it tends to obviously be fairly small. There was a small restructuring we did over the summer which was about 200 people at the senior levels. I think what we continue to see is that attrition tends to be skewed towards the very lower end of the pyramid, so the junior staff attrition at the senior levels other than what we did with the involuntary program continues to be very low single-digits. And we tend to see attrition skewed as usual a little bit more offshore than on-site. So really no changes in the trend. It's just obviously the overall number has continued to remain a little bit higher than we'd like it to be. But I think a lot of that is driven by the market demand that we're seeing both with not just competitors but clients and other companies that I think everybody around the world right now is struggling with the shortage of technology talent. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Raj, I was wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit more color on the dynamic you've highlighted for several quarters now about run-the-bank spend versus digital spend. As you look into 2019, what are your clients on the banking side telling you about their, first of all, overall wallet spend expectations? And secondly, whether the pace of the declines in some of the run-the-bank spend could moderate at all? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Yeah, Jim. So, look, I think it's a little too early right now to start getting into 2019 in terms of the budgets that we have from some of our large clients. The good news is, I mean, based on current trends, it does look \u2013 we are optimistic going into next year. Again, as I mentioned right, I think we've made that turn in North America where we're starting to see significant spend start coming in in terms of the digital. I think with especially a lot of the large banking clients, you've had a lot of in-sourcing that has been going on as well, but I think we've managed through that, and we're starting to see growth in all of our large clients. And I think you'll start seeing that going into next year. The challenge, as I mentioned earlier, right, has been some of the banks that are outside of North America as far as headquarters. Again, you're seeing some in-sourcing and some of the run-the-bank spending. But I think the good news is the relationships are very healthy. We continue to win more than our fair share at those banks. And we're still strategic clients at those banks, and I see the same playbook that we used in North America working for us as those banks continues to shift more of their spend towards digital into next year as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys, thanks. Look, let me just start off, I mean, a little bit higher level on a macro basis. Can you just provide a little more color on what you're seeing broadly with regard to IT spend from your clients in discussions as we start to get closer to the end of the year now? Anyone changing their tone around spending given macro trends or tariffs or China or rate concerns or anything else that you're noticing in terms of a pivot in any way one way or the other? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Darrin, it's Frank. I'll take that. I don't see that happening. I continue to see clients investing in technology, investing in digital. As I think Raj said in his prepared comments, I think it's notable that we had the strongest quarter in digital that we've had \u2013 excuse in, in retail that we've had in many, many years. If you look at the mix of our clients, another data point that Raj had in his prepared comments is that in the quarter, two of our top 10 clients came from the technology space as opposed to three years ago where all of our top 10 clients were in Financial Services and Healthcare. So we haven't seen a shift in demand in the short-term as a result of the, perhaps, what you're alluding to is the volatility that we've seen over the last month or so. We continue to see just clients sort of doubling down now and saying how do we get to digital at scale and continue to play into that demand as we go into next year. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. I wanted to go back to the margin question. Now kind of appears to be a good time to invest to take digital market share. Why not back off the margins and try to grow faster? And then just building on that, has the cost cutting gotten too disruptive to the culture, and how do you think about that as you continue to drive towards efficiency? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: You know, Joe, I'll let Karen also \u2013 it's Frank. I'll let Karen jump in here. I think that it's not always the case that there's this trade-off between margins and growth. There seems to be this thesis that there's a direct trade-off between margins and growth. And while at some point that is certainly the case, as we've said for a while and in fact 18 months ago when we did the analysis on the topic, a lot of the core operational improvements that we've done in the business to drive growth are good operating hygiene types of things that we think are opportunities for us just to run the engine better. We've had \u2013 in two months, we'll celebrate 25 years as a company. We had 20-something years of very, very strong growth. The focus during those years was less on operational excellence. That creates lots of opportunities for us to optimize things around the business. And those things are just good operating discipline. In most cases, those things don't have a direct impact on growth. And so while it may seem at the 50,000 foot level that there's a trade-off between margins and growth, at the place where we are right now, I feel like we are optimizing places where the company had excess, where the company wasn't optimal, we were not best-in-class relative to our peer set. We're looking at that carefully. We had done that analysis when we began this exercise. We had a third party come in and look at our operational metrics relative to competition. We've identified areas that where we are not best-in-class and we're focused on closing the gap. And in many of those cases, as I said, there isn't a trade-off with growth. As it relates to culture, I think we're building a muscle in the place around operational excellence and around operational discipline. I think that's a good muscle. I think it's a muscle that will serve the company well, well into the future. And I think that that is a good muscle to be building, and not one that I think is disruptive to the culture. I don't know, Karen, if you want to add to that? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: No, I think I would echo, Joe, what Frank said. And I think just to add to that, the benefit of what we're doing today is that because we are growing, this isn't really about cost cutting. In many cases, this is about cost avoidance and really leveraging the investments that we've already made more effectively, particularly around corporate functions and so forth. And if you think about where we have done some head count reductions, they've been extremely minor. So in 2017 in the summer, we did a voluntary program that it was a few hundred people took that program. This year we did an involuntary program at the senior level that was 200 people, on a basis of 270,000 people plus, that is an absolute nit. So I think as Frank said, this is about getting the organization to think about operational excellence and discipline along with revenue growth, and we think it's a very healthy exercise for us to be going through. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Karen, what are your assumptions for organic growth for Q4? And then you keep on mentioning pruning or pruning of low margin businesses. Is there any way to kind of quantify the impact of that pruning on the top line growth this year or maybe for the quarter? I think any color here could be helpful. Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, I'll start with the second piece first, Moshe. So on the, what we'd call the long tail accounts, there's been very little revenue impact. Again, this is part of going back to the operating muscle that Frank was just talking about, right, is getting the teams to look at clients where perhaps we're not getting the growth and the margin trajectory that we would like to see and contemplating whether there's truly a strategic relationship there and if not perhaps finding reasonable ways to exit. But the dollars, those are very, very small revenue dollars. And what we tend to see is some of those come with some of the acquisitions we've done in the past where they may have a handful of clients that we would consider strategic clients where we think there's a bigger market opportunity, and then they may have a handful of smaller clients that just won't have the scale to really partner with us in a meaningful way. So that's a constant thing we look at. But the revenue line, it doesn't really have a material impact. In Q4, in the guidance, obviously, we've assumed both the ATG and SaaSfocus deals which closed in October, but those are small, just a few million dollars of revenue. And then we're anticipating that Softvision will close later in the quarter. But again, in terms of Q4 incremental dollars, we expect that that would be very, very small because we get maybe a few weeks of revenue if that going into the quarter. So beyond that, it's just the acquisitions that we've already done, which is primarily Bolder is the biggest one this year which we said is running about $35 million a quarter of revenue. Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Yes. The question is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Glad to be back on the call. This one is I think for Frank, maybe Raj. As you're looking forward, presumably a major goal right now for Cognizant is to get your revenue growth to turn and reaccelerate. Can you just talk about what in your view the sort of building blocks for that are, meaning, do you need to get attrition down to a certain level? Do you need Financial Services growth to kind of recover to a certain level? What's the role of acquisitions in that roadmap? Does digital mix need to get to a certain level? How do you think about that? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: So, Lisa, I would say \u2013 it's Frank. It's a combination of some of the things that you talked about. I would say we are quite comfortable with the digital portfolio as it is right now, but we'll continue to do acquisitions to strengthen that portfolio of services. Obviously once Softvision closes, that will be an important arrow in the quiver as it relates to digital engineering. The second is the turn, if you will, in banking and financial services. As you saw in this quarter, we were quite pleased with the growth in three of our four segments, which all showed good growth. Financial Services, as Raj said, we see the turn happening in North America where the digital revenue growth is now starting to offset the pressure on the run-the-bank spending. When that turn comes to our clients in the Financial Services clients in the rest of the world, then I think that that will remove a drag from a segment perspective. I would point to those two as the two major factors at this point. And it goes without saying that as we execute against our plan as you've seen for many, many quarters now, the revenue base of the company diversifies away from Financial Services and Healthcare as the other two segments grow faster off a smaller base. And so we view those as large incremental market opportunities in addition to Financial Services and Healthcare that continue to be large opportunities in their own right. So we think that overall there's a big market opportunity. The digital portfolio continues to grow at very healthy rates, and so it's a question of focusing that digital portfolio on the large market opportunity that we have. And then of course the last lever is our global growth. We continue to expand the footprint of the company to markets outside of our traditional markets in North America and Europe, and so the rest of \u2013 what we call the rest of the world and Asia Pacific continues to be a focus area for us for growth. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.: Good. I think with that, we'll wrap up the call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you again in just a couple of weeks here at our Investor Day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Cognizant announced solid Q4 and full year 2018 results. We also announced, as you've seen, our plan to effect a smooth transition in our leadership team to take the company forward in the coming years. Having co-founded Cognizant, which celebrated its 25th anniversary less than two weeks ago, I've spent half my life here and I've had the privilege of serving as CEO for the past 12 years. Last year, in connection with the board's regular leadership assessment and succession planning processes, I informed my fellow board members that I was considering stepping down from my role as CEO sometime in 2019. As a board, we embarked upon a methodical search for my successor to ensure a fully thought through and orderly transition when the time came. Our announcement this morning is the result of that process. I'm pleased that Brian Humphries, who's the CEO of Vodafone business and a member of Vodafone Group's Executive Committee, will be the new CEO of Cognizant effective April 1 of this year. Brian is a terrific executive and I look forward to working with him closely to ensure the smoothest possible transition. I speak for all of my fellow directors in saying that Brian is a strong choice to lead Cognizant in its next phase of growth. I'll have more to say about Brian in a minute. Before I do, I want to take a moment to thank the entire global Cognizant team for the tremendous accomplishments of the past 25 years and in particular, during my tenure as CEO. My thank yous need to begin with my long-time colleague and the President of Cognizant, Raj Mehta. Raj has been our President for the past two-and-a-half years and has provided Cognizant with his leadership, operational skills and passion for clients for more than two decades in a variety of operating roles. We are grateful to Raj for his countless contributions to the growth and success of Cognizant over the years. He's ready for a new challenge and has decided to step down from his role as President and to leave the company shortly after Brian arrives. On behalf of the Board, I wish Raj well in his future endeavors. I'm proud of what our global team has worked with such skill and energy to build during my CEO tenure. Over the past dozen years, we've grown annual revenues from $1.4 billion to $16 billion, moving Cognizant into the Fortune 200. We\u2019ve scaled our talent base over that period from 39,000 to 282,000 associates. And since our IPO, we've increased the company's market value more than 400-fold, from less than $100 million to approximately $40 billion. I'm especially proud of how we've served as a trusted partner and guide to our clients as they transition from one technology era to the next and as they transform their businesses to improve operational performance and generate new growth. And now with the mainstream adoption of digital at scale, we have invested significantly in the distinctive capability needed to set Cognizant up for its next stage of sustainable strong growth and value creation, as we outlined for many of you during our November Investor Day. In fact, over the past several years, we've evolved nearly every aspect of our company : our domain knowledge, our services portfolio, our methodologies, our geographic footprint, global and local delivery, our leadership team and even our culture, to ensure that we can provide compelling value to clients and capture this market opportunity, which is larger than any we've seen before. We're gratified that others have recognized the strength of this foundation, as Fortune Magazine recently named us one of the world's most admired companies for the 11th year in a row. It's been an honor and a privilege to lead the best team in the industry as we've accomplished milestones that few others in the services business have been able to match. So on April 1, the time will be right for me to pass the baton to Brian who has the experience, the drive and the commitment to execute on our growth agenda. The board embarked on the search process with the view to our long-term future, knowing that the full transformative effect of the digital build-out on our clients, our company and the economy is still to come. We sought someone with the track record of success across multiple companies, industries, technology, geographies roles and organizational cultures. Brian fits that bill. At Vodafone Business for example which had annual revenues of approximately $14 billion in fiscal 2018, Brian is responsible for the entire global portfolio which consists of all B2B fixed and mobile customers, as well as IoT, cloud hosting and security services. Brian has successfully run large-scale global technology businesses and he has a focused and disciplined approach to execution and driving profitable growth. Brian's first day as Cognizant's CEO will be April 1. Until then, I'll continue in my role as Vice Chairman and CEO. And once he is on board, I'll transition to the full-time role of Executive Vice Chairman to actively support Brian and to help him get off to a running start. When that transition concludes, I'll remain on the Board as Vice Chairman. I'm fully committed to ensuring Brian's success and Cognizant's continued growth in my current and future roles. Turning to an update on our business. I'd like to run through a few Q4 and full year highlights followed by guidance for 2019. And then I'll comment on the strategic plan, we introduced nearly three months ago at Investor Day. Starting with Q4, revenue was $4.13 billion within our guided range and up 8.8% year-over-year in constant currency. In the quarter, our digital revenue grew in the mid-20% range, well above company average and is now over 30% of total revenue reflecting our continuing shift to digital revenues. Our portfolio of digital services generated margins above the company average and our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.13. For the year as a whole, revenue grew 8.5% in constant currency to $16.13 billion. During the year, we diversified our revenue base and our client roster and invested significantly for growth. We instilled greater operating discipline across the company further simplified the business and acquired five companies. And for the year, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through our capital return program. Let's turn to guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue growth to be within a range of 7% to 9% in constant currency, which falls within the medium-term target we defined at the Investor Day. And for the first quarter of 2019, we expect revenue growth to be within a 7.5% to 8.5% range in constant currency. Turning to margins, as you'll recall from Investor Day from here forward we will include stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related charges in our non-GAAP measure of operating margin. For 2019, our adjusted operating margin target will be approximately 19%. I'd like to offer a few thoughts now on the demand environment. As we referenced on prior calls, we are moving quickly to an era in which technology's role has shifted from supporting the business to actually being the business. Clients are clearheaded about this dynamic and continues to see the business case for digital transformation as absolutely compelling even against the backdrop of some global economic volatility. Our strategy for continuing to deliver disciplined and profitable growth as outlined at the November Investor Day responds directly to our clients mandate for transformation. To help client speed their journey to digital at scale, we're investing to build distinctive leadership in the six advanced capabilities interactive, artificial intelligence and analytics, intelligent process automation, platform solutions, core modernization, and digital engineering. These six capabilities are aligned to our three practice areas and play to our expertise and strong market positions. And all six areas offer ample headroom for growth. And when we combine our focused investment through these capabilities with targeted acquisitions as well as continued geographic expansion and industry diversification, we have our engine for delivering continued growth. The board and I kept this strategy front of mind during the CEO selection process we undertook. So we expect the strategy presented at the Investor Day to continue to direct Cognizant's approach to the market opportunity shaped of course by Brian's perspective as he transitions into the CEO role. I want to close by saying how fortunate I am to lead a company of Cognizant's scale and stature and how proud I am of the work our associate do every day across the globe. I look forward to continuing on the Board and to ensuring a smooth transition. And I'm confident that Cognizant's best days are ahead. With that I'll turn the call over to Karen who will give you an update on both our operational and financial performance. Karen? Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Frank and good morning everyone. Q4 performance was solid rounding out full year results which were within our expectations and reflect continued execution of our strategy to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. Fourth quarter revenue of $4.13 billion was at the high end of our guided range and increased 7.9% year-over-year or 8.8% in constant currency. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had an $11 million positive impact to revenue in the quarter. Banking and Financial Services continued to see slower growth at 2.8% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by softness at a few of our largest banking clients. As we discussed back at our Investor Day in November, the pressure in our Banking business has primarily been driven by some of our largest banking clients. Two of our top five clients continued to show good growth going into 2019, while spend at the other three clients remained under pressure. Despite the continued pressure in these three accounts, the rest of our Banking portfolio continues to grow nicely. And based on deals that we've already closed and our late-stage pipeline of deals, we do expect recovery in Banking over the course of 2019. As I will discuss in a few moments, we have made significant progress in developing platforms and solutions for the European Banking markets and expect to see accelerated growth in those markets in 2019. Moving on to Healthcare, which grew 7% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth with our Healthcare payer and provider clients excluding the contribution from Bolder Healthcare was impacted by the continued ramp-down of an account in which we were a subcontractor to a third-party and a temporary slowdown with several large clients involved in mergers where the potential spending associated with integration work is not yet underway. We expect this to continue into Q1. As Healthcare delivery is shifting from a fee-for-service to a value-based care model, we are seeing increased collaboration and partnerships across payers and providers that's focus on effective consumer engagement with data-driven insights. So, while we have seen period of slower growth in Healthcare, we believe that our investments in the industry have positioned us well to take advantage of this shift over the long-term. Products and Resources had another strong quarter showing 15.4% growth year-over-year in constant currency. We were pleased with the good growth in both retail and manufacturing and logistics in Q4 and what is typically a seasonally weak quarter for those industries. Let me give you an example of work we are doing to help clients along their transformation journey in this segment. A leading U.S. fast-food chain pioneered the concept of the classic 1940s drive-through with on-the-go convenience that's facing the challenge of digital technologies redefining the very concept of convenience. They needed to elevate the guest experience and increase operational efficiencies in order to stay competitive. Cognizant helped to develop an overall digital strategy and the restaurant changed first mobile app including location finding, menu viewing, ordering, and online payment, combined with kitchen, customer service, and supply chain management tools. When the app was initially launched purchasers saw an average of 12% increase in order value. It has now been deployed across all 2,000-plus franchise locations. Our Communications Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 20.1% in constant currency, driven by our technology clients. A recent client engagement in our Communications Media and Technology segment tells our AI and analytics story. A major software company needed to achieve a higher percentage of subscription renewals for its software and services, reduce costly customer churn and drive additional sales. The client however, lacked the central repository of information about past customer transactions, key decision-makers on accounts or product-related issues. In other words, the very details needed to expand sales and close more deals. Our team partnered with the client applying big data and machine learning to develop an automated cloud-based central data repository and predictive analytics that enabled the client to connect the dots of customer behavior across its entire product portfolio. Using machine learning and predictive analytics, the client is now able to predict customer churn with 80% accuracy, take proactive steps to retain high-risk, high-value customers and spot patterns to identify customers most receptive to cross-sell and upsell. Many of you may know that Cognizant was born in the data and analytics space and we've been consolidating our position here over the last 25 years, so we've been at this for some time. And today we are a top three leader in this market. This is just one example of our analytics and AI practice at work. Now moving on to Geo's. The rest of world grew 4.7% year-over-year in constant currency. Results in Asia-Pacific continued to be negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. Europe grew 20.3% year-over-year in constant currency. Our investments both organic and inorganic have given us a solid footprint in Continental Europe from which we expect continued strong growth. We've grown our geographic footprint organically by expanding our client roster, adding new delivery and operational centers and developing local talent in the markets we serve. Our organic growth have been accelerated with the ramp-up of a number of strategic client engagements in Benelux in banking and manufacturing, Nordics in energy and banking, France in banking and life sciences, Switzerland in life sciences and Germany with life sciences and communication media and technology. Acquisitions such as Netcentric, Hedera, Zone and Mirabeau have enhanced our digital leadership in the region and complemented our ability to service our clients across the entire range of their digital transformation. As I mentioned earlier we have made significant progress developing platforms and solutions specifically for banking clients in Europe. These include solutions for core banking, credit operations, cloud transformation and digital transformation. These solutions which require deep industry expertise and local presence are expected to bring sizable revenue opportunities in the coming years. As an example of core banking transformation, we've recently announced a partnership with three Finnish financial institutions : Savings Bank Group, Oma Savings Bank Plc and POP Bank Group to transform and operate a shared core banking platform based on Temenos T24 and Temenos Payment Hub that will enable their digital transformation plans. More than 10% of Finnish Banking deposits and loans will be managed by the new platform. This partnership will not only help support our acceleration of revenue growth beginning in the second quarter, but over the longer term will provide expanded opportunities in other markets across Europe. An example of cloud transformation is our partnership with ABN AMRO Clearing to cloud enable is a global IT infrastructure and lay the foundation for digital transformation. Further, we have a good pipeline of similar opportunities as we enter 2019. Shifting now to margins. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses and realignment charges was 19.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.13, exceeding our guidance primarily due to a lower non-GAAP tax rate. The Q4 GAAP tax rate of 20.6% was lower than our previous guidance of 31%, primarily due to net non-operating foreign exchange gains driven by the appreciation of the Indian rupee and guidance regarding the GILTI provision of the Tax Reform Act issued in the fourth quarter of 2018. This text guidance led to a reversal of the incremental income tax expense accrued for this provision earlier in the year. For the full year 2018, revenue of $16.13 billion represented growth of 8.9% or 8.5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7% in line with our guidance of approximately 21%. And non-GAAP EPS was $4.57. As we presented at our Investor Day in November, starting in 2019 we are revising our non-GAAP operating margin and EPS definitions. Going forward, our adjusted operating margin and EPS will no longer exclude stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related expenses. When calculated under the new methodology, the full year 2018 adjusted operating margin was 18.1% and adjusted EPS was $4.02. Now turning to our other metrics. Consulting and technology services represented 58.2% of revenue and outsourcing services 41.8% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 9.5% year-over-year and outsourcing services revenue grew 5.6% from Q4 a year ago. Consulting growth benefited from the inclusion of several of our recent acquisitions such as Softvision and ATG and continued strong demand for digital solutions. Within outsourcing, we saw a continued strength in Digital Operations, partially offset by the ramp down of the healthcare customer previously mentioned where we were serving as a subcontractor to a third-party. During the fourth quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and transaction based contracts were approximately 11% of total revenue in the quarter. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 385. And now moving to an update on operations. In the fourth quarter, we continued to build on the operational improvements we've made in our business over the last two years such as higher levels of utilization, improved pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure and a more effective leverage of our corporate function spend. Net of hedges, our Q4 margins also benefited from the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus a year ago by 120 basis points which allowed us to continue investing for growth. The solid margin performance also allowed us to absorb the remaining wage increases and promotions in the quarter, while achieving our full year non-GAAP operating margin target. In 2019 we expect continued margin improvement to be underpinned by ongoing improvement in operational efficiency and discipline a continued shift within our business to focus on higher-value services, improving profitability of our portfolio of large structured contracts and ongoing reassessment of less profitable opportunities that do not further our long-term strategic position. From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate at 19% declined over 300 basis points from Q3, but remains elevated. While, we are pleased with the decline in the attrition rate we continue to focus on our workforce strategy and overall management. Turning to our balance sheet which remains very healthy. We finished the year with $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, down $545 million from December 31, 2017. Net of debt, this balance was down by $417 million from December 31, 2017. As a reminder, our cash balance includes restricted short-term investments of $423 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the India Income Tax Department. We had strong cash generation in the quarter with free cash flow of $606 million. On a full year basis, free cash flow of $2.2 billion as the ratio to net income was just over 1 times. Our outstanding debt balance was $745 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares and our diluted share count decreased to 579 million shares for the quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow 7% to 9% in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates this translates to growth of 6.3% to 8.3%, reflecting our assumption of a negative 70 basis points for foreign exchange. For the first quarter of 2019, we expect to deliver revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5% in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates this translates to growth of 5.8% to 6.8% reflecting our assumption of a negative 170 basis points for foreign exchange. For the full year 2019, we expect adjusted operating margins under our revised definition to be approximately 19% and to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $4.40, a 10% increase versus 2018 on a like-for-like basis. This guidance anticipates the full year share count of approximately 578 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. This tax rate range is consistent with our midterm expectations. Guidance provided for our revised non-GAAP measure, adjusted EPS excludes realignment charges and other unusual items if any, net non-operating foreign currency, exchange gains and losses and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment, including areas such as immigration and tax. We are committed to the more balanced approach to capital allocation that we outlined at our Investor Day last November. Beginning in 2019, we intend to utilize approximately 50% of global free cash flow annually for dividends and share repurchases. This should allow us to maintain a dividend payout ratio of about 20% and reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 1% annually. The Board had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on February 21st. Additionally 25% of our annual global free cash flow is intended to be used for acquisitions that enhance our longer-term strategy of enriching our digital capabilities, expanding our geographic footprint, and enhancing our vertical expertise. In summary, our solid execution in 2018 along with continued investment in the business has positioned us well to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth in 2019. Operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much. I want to say, Frank congrats on a amazing run as CEO, enjoyed working with you and interacting with you. So, best wishes to you and Raj as well. I want to -- let's start with that, I guess, on the CEO transition plan. So, Brian Humphries you gave a lot of good detail there. What stood out for him to be chosen as CEO as an outsider? Can we infer that his international experience may be signals a greater global focus for Cognizant on top of carrying forward the plan you set up three months ago? Francisco D'Souza: Tien-Tsin thanks a lot for the kind words. Yes, look -- I think that -- I'd say a couple of things. When we set out to think about my successor, the Board conducted a thorough process. And what we were really focused on Tien-Tsin was sort the strategy that we laid out for all of you at Investor Day as the sort of the core of what's going to take the company forward. And as we assessed our choices, Brian is just a solid choice. He is well-regarded -- highly regarded Technology Executive. He's got a great track record of success across multiple companies, industries, technologies, geographies, roles, and organizational cultures. And I think with his global perspective, but also client focus experience with transformational technologies, he is the right Executive to execute on our strategy as digital continues to permeate and power every industry. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it, got it. So, maybe if I can just add a quick outlook question. Just thinking about fiscal 2019, the big differences here, and how you might see growth shape up versus 2018. It looks like you're guiding the top end of the outlook to be pretty consistent what you achieved in 2018. Karen McLoughlin : So, I think that's fair Tien-Tsin. If you remember back at Investor Day, right, we talked about that we thought near-term -- near to midterm growth would be in the 6% to 9% on an organic constant currency perspective, and that in the near term we'd be at the lower end of that range. And then as we continue to grow and add on more acquisitions we would move up the range. So as we're seeing this year, we think it plays out very consistently with what we outlined at Investor Day. Q1 is a little bit slower than the full year. But as we talked about in my comments, we are starting to see some nice recovery with some of the new partnerships in Financial Services particularly in the European markets, and so we're very confident that as we get into the second quarter that we'll start to accelerate growth in banking, which then obviously supports the overall growth rates for the year. But I think in terms of general trends, obviously, shift to digital continues and really no significant changes from where we saw the recent quarters. Tien-Tsin: All right. Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning. I'll echo Tien-Tsin's comments. Frank, congratulations on a phenomenal run. I think we\u2019re all curious to see what you're off to next. I will actually start then taking this opportunity to ask you one more long-term industry vision question. As you are moving into a -- moving out of your CEO role at Cognizant, when you look out over the next five to 10 years in what ways in your mind will the IT services industry be meaningfully different and comment on Cognizant's distinctive positioning relative to those changes, things that perhaps we're not -- we don't have from our seats the opportunity to see in the way that you do? Francisco D'Souza: Yeah. Thanks a lot Lisa. I appreciate again the kind words. It's been quite a run. And just as an anecdote I was thinking about it the other day, this is my 48th quarter that I will be reporting as the CEO of this place. So I guess as a CEO you measure by public company quarters. Look, I think, Lisa, here's what I would say to your question. I think that as I look forward, the difference that we're going to see over the next five, 10 years is -- and we've been saying this and it may even sound somewhat clich\u00e9d at the moment, but technology is really going from a decade ago when it was supporting the back office of a business to really being the very essence of businesses today. I say often that every enterprise is now a technology enterprise. Every business leader is really a technology leader. Every budget can be to considered a technology budget inside of our clients. I mean, there's really this pervasiveness of technology where we're already starting to see, and therefore, which I think we're going to continue to see as technology becomes just more and more integral to not just businesses, but governments and societies and so on and so forth. Against that context, I think that firms like ours need to really have a set of capabilities that line up directly with that role that technology will play going forward. And that's why I think that the six capabilities that we outlined for you at Investor Day are so important. If you look at them as capabilities, they individually represent big market opportunities. But if you look at them as a set, as a group they really represent what I believe as the core capabilities that every enterprise is going to need to embed deeply into their operations, into their P&L into their business, so that they can fully take advantage of digital at scale. And so, I think that this notion of how you organize yourself as a services business and how you respond to this idea of digital at scale, the pervasiveness of technology across the enterprise is really going to be the core trend that services businesses will have to respond to over the coming decade. Lisa Ellis : Great, thank you. And then maybe as my follow-up, I'll ask the inevitable every two-year's question, I suppose. With new Congress in session inevitably over the next couple of months, I imagine we'll hear some noise surrounding H1B visa reform. So just perhaps to get ahead of that, can you proactively highlight what progress Cognizant has made over the last couple of years, reducing your dependence on H1B visas? I recall, I believe, at Investor Day you gave some statistics about the percentage of your U. S. workers that are now permanent residents or citizens etcetera. Can you just maybe put those top of mind before we see any of that noise coming out over the next couple of months? Thanks. Francisco D'Souza: Thanks Lisa. Look I always start the immigration questions with the big picture answer which is that, the reality is that in many parts of the world certainly in the United States, many parts of Western Europe there really is a significant shortage of technology talent which needs to be addressed for these economies to stay -- to remain competitive. If you go back to the first part -- your question as the world becomes more technology-intensive we -- these economies really need skilled technologist to maintain the competitive edge. We continue to make progress. At Investor Day we shared with you that, at the moment in North America over 40% of our North American workforce or let's say our U.S. workforce is citizens or permanent residents. We continue to make significant progress and I expect that in the medium term we'll be well over 50%. Karen McLoughlin : And I think, Lisa, -- this is Karen. If I can just add to that, I mean as I think and if you\u2019ll recall last year we set up our U.S. Foundation which we funded with $100 million initially to continue to launch more training programs in the U.S. As Frank said, obviously the biggest challenge is shortage of talent not just here, but in other parts of the world as well. So we are certainly focused on helping to change that trajectory in the coming years. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you, both, and congrats again, Frank. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Edward Caso : Hi, good morning. I was curious if you could give more color to your strategic accounts 385 of them. Sort of how many at this point are above the desired $5 million? And maybe like some of your peers could you array them as to over $100 million over $50 million? Just give us a little bit more color other than, it goes up seven every quarter? Thank you. Karen McLoughlin : Sure. So Ed this is Karen. All of those accounts are actually over $5 million and most of them are considerably above $5 million on an annual run rate. We have not broken out how many accounts we have over $100 million, but it is in the range of -- doing this off the top of my head about 30 -- over 30 accounts at this point. So, there's a fairly large number of significant clients that has emerged over the years. Edward Caso : Right. And my other question is on the Healthcare. How sensitive are you to winning sort of these large transformational deals to sort of get the Healthcare group back on track. Thanks and Congrats to Frank. Francisco D'Souza: Thanks, Ed. Look I don't think we are dependent on winning large transformational deals. The business is built on this -- and the vast majority whether it's in Healthcare or in any of other verticals, is built on this idea of continuing to grow with our clients in a methodical way. That usually involves many, many small and medium-sized projects with each client to continue to grow. We'll continue to do large transformational deals. We announced the deal that Karen spoke about recent -- this quarter with the three Finnish banks. That's a great example of the transformational deals that plays into our strategy, platforms, and so on and so forth. And so I certainly don't -- will not rule out doing those deals going forward but I don't think the engine or the Cognizant business is built on an assumption that we're going to do those deals to continue to grow. Karen McLoughlin : And I think, Ed, if I could just also add to what Frank said, I think we talked about this last quarter a little bit, right, particularly with the platform deals, so the TMG deal and the EmblemHealth deal, you want certainly that large feed client to launch the platform and be able to build out the capability and so forth. But after that it actually enables you to add a lot of smaller engagements with smaller clients that historically we may not have not been able to really support in a meaningful way and we're certainly starting to see that traction now particularly with the TMG relationship and being able to onboard now smaller opportunities which obviously you can move a lot faster and they become accretive quite quickly. So, that's certainly happening in that side of the business. And then overall in Healthcare as we had talked about, there's been obviously a number of mergers that are underway in Healthcare. And while we certainly expect to get our fair share of the integration work once that commences, we certainly have seen a little bit of pullback recently as those clients are planning for integration, that's typical. We said that at some point, we thought that would happen and we've seen that a little bit over the last few weeks. But at some point, they will move into execution of the integration. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Essex : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Karen maybe if -- wondering if you could touch on inorganic contribution in the quarter. You guys had a pretty active fourth quarter with deals and it sounds like you continued that activity into this year. Just wondering what the contribution is and how we might anticipate contributions through the remainder of the year. And I have a quick follow-up. Karen McLoughlin : Sure. So, M&A contribution in Q4 was about 250 basis points on a year-over-year perspective. That is also true in Q1, so you will see that again in Q1. But for full year 2018, it was about 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis versus 2017. And in our 2019 guidance that includes the deals that we have already completed, which is also about 150 basis points of revenue. New deals as we talked about at Investor Day, we would expect to add about 150 to 200 basis points a year of new deals, so we've, obviously, done that for 2018, we will done that again included in our 2019 guidance and then new deals in 2019 would be beyond that. Brian Essex : Got it. That's super helpful. And then maybe if we could touch on, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the impact of the rupee appreciation gave you a little bit of flexibility to invest for growth. I think some are anticipating a little bit of maybe that's flipping to a headwind this year. And if that's the case, what sort of measures might you have to continue to, I guess to manage that and continue to invest for growth throughout fiscal 2019? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. So I mean we certainly ramped up hiring in the fourth quarter to support growth as we go into 2019 and we'll put those folks who could use, I think as we look at 2019, utilization stayed fairly consistent last year with 2017. We know we've got a little bit of room to continue to push that if need be. Certainly we continue to focus on our pyramid as we move into 2019. And then really scaling some of the larger, more structured deals or platform opportunities as we have said, really two years ago when we had started outlining this new frameworks that initially those deals do tend to be margin dilutive. And as we get into the outer years such as where we're starting to get now with some of the original ones, you start to see that margin accretion kick in, which then allows us to continue to fund more investments. So those will be some of the major things that we're looking at this year as well as continuing to leverage SG&A but really our focus right now is driving for growth and making sure that we're investing in the talent and re-skilling and so forth to do that. Brian Essex : Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And good luck to you Frank in your next phase of your career. Maybe just to start off on the overall IT spending environment you're hearing from your customers right now. Clearly they are spending more on digital and less on maintenance. But can you maybe talk about their overall posture as we go into 2019? Any signs of worries around an economic slowdown or pullback in IT spending or are things pretty much running the same course as they have been? Francisco D'Souza: Jim, it's Frank. Look I think as I said in my prepared comments, what I see is an environment as you said in traditional and what you would think of as traditional IT clearly a pressure on running the business, maintenance types of activities in order to free up the dollars to invest in growth. That trend has been going on for a while. Equally importantly as I said, as technology permeates organizations, I think we are able to tap into new budgets. As I said, almost every budget is now somewhat a technology budget whether it's the R&D budget, whether it's the marketing budget, all of these become new sources of opportunity for us. And so overall, I think our market opportunity has never been larger. It continues to expand given technology permeating all aspects of organizations. I think as it relates to the macro environment clearly there are concerns out there about various issues in Europe, in relations with China and so on and so forth. I haven't seen it yet translate into a meaningful impact on demand for us. And so at this point, when I think about 2019, I see a solid demand environment. Jim Schneider : Thanks. And then maybe as a follow up. Regarding the outlook in Financial Services in particular, I think Karen referenced a couple of specific deal wins that would improve the trajectory in Q2. I guess what's your level of confidence in that improvement in financial to sustain itself? And can you maybe just kind of address what you're seeing in your U.S. banking client base as well? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. So in terms of the confidence, Jim as we talked about the Finnish deal for example as a signed deal, so we're just waiting for final clearance and closing of that. We have other deals similarly in the pipeline that we're very close to finalizing here. So we have a high degree of confidence particularly in the European markets in terms of what we're seeing. And then as it relates to -- I'm actually going to talk about North America as well as the top 5. So if you recall at the Investor Day where we talked about top five and that two of them had returned to very nice growth. That continued in Q4 and continues into Q1 where we're talking about, in some cases double-digit year-over-year growth and those are obviously very large relationships. So it's a very nice turnaround there. The other three accounts continue to be under some pressure. And at this point we are not -- certainly not assuming a big turnaround for our guidance for those accounts. But then if we look at the rest of the North America banking business, it has and continues to grow quite nicely. It just gets under pressure when you have some of these larger relationships pulling down the overall growth rate of the business. Jim Schneider : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane : Congrats Frank. I did want to ask about the CEO change. I'm a little bit surprised it didn't -- the background of Brian isn't somebody with a little more IT services background or an executive from one of your peers or competitors. Can you just talk about why some of the outside the industry necessarily was the right hire for Cognizant? Francisco D'Souza: Thanks Bryan. As I said before, the board conducted a very methodical search for my successor. We kept in mind very carefully a sort of the strategy that we outlined for you during our Investor Day a few months ago. And as we went through that process we just determined that Brian is the right executive. We think that, he's got terrific track record of success across companies in the technology space, multiple industries, obviously technologies themselves, the geographies, roles in organizational cultures. And when we put all of that together we just think that Brian is the right executive to execute on the strategy that we outlined for you at Investor Day as digital continues to permeate and power as I said before every industry. Bryan Keane : Okay, that's helpful. And then Karen on the -- just thinking about the guidance, I know the fourth quarter came in about 8.8% in constant currency. Guidance is calling for 7% and 9%, so I guess you're already running at the high end of the revenue guide and with Financial Services improving in 2019 just thinking about what pulls down maybe the range towards 7% to 9% and not a touch higher since you guys have a little bit of momentum heading into 2019? Karen McLoughlin : I think Bryan, I mean certainly, we -- the guidance is consistent with what we outlined at Investor Day. Q1 is a little soft which obviously puts a little bit of pressure on the full year, although, we're very comfortable with the ramp to the back half of the year. But I think, obviously, we like to be prudent particularly earlier in the year. And as we see things start to evolve, we will certainly take that into consideration. But I think right now we're very comfortable, this is consistent with what we said back in November and we've made the investments to support this growth range for this year. Bryan Keane : Okay. All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Regarding your onshore hiring efforts, can you comment on the inflation levels in this tight labor environment, particularly around digital capabilities? And then how are clients responding on pricing and your ability to pass those costs through? Francisco D'Souza: I would say a couple of things which we've said in the past. On a like-for-like basis, once you look at sort of all-in costs our talent base in the U. S. whether that talent base is, if you will, hired locally or folks like here on some sort of a Visa, there isn't a meaningful cost difference between those two talent pools. So, we are, from a cost standpoint, indifferent. Of course, as I said earlier, we are in a tight -- in a constrained market as you pointed out. And so given the demand for our services, we're always struggling to find the talent that we need to fulfill our growth ambitions. But like-for-like, all-in, the costs are about the same. Karen McLoughlin : Yes. And I think -- and I'd just add to that [Indiscernible] talking a little bit about pricing. So, I think as Frank said, like-for-like you're actually not seeing a big change and certainly I don't think wage inflation given skills we're hiring has -- we've seen that in a significant way. What you do see obviously is -- and this is always true, skills that are in hot demand, come with a high price. That's no different now versus the last 10 or 20 years so. But the flipside is that in this environment clients need that talent as much as we do and you'll get the pricing to accommodate that. So, I think as we talked about last year, pricing has remained quite consistent. And, in fact, last year was the first year in quite a while that you actually had some pricing strength in the market because of the shortage of talent and that trend has continued. Francisco D'Souza: And the last thing maybe I'll add -- sorry to jump back in. But remember that when we look at our portfolio of digital revenue from digital that is running -- it has and continues to run at above company average margins, which I think speaks to our ability there to drive pricing, despite the fact that in general the talent pool as Karen pointed out in the digital part of the business is a higher cost talent pool. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi, thank you very much. First, Frank, congratulations on Brian. I know him from his HP days. I think he's a terrific choice. As a matter of fact, I think getting somebody from outside of industry could certainly help Cognizant quite a bit. So congratulations on that. My question was a little bit different in that, if I read the press release correctly you're the founder of the company as you said have tremendous success over a number of years. You're going to move to the board seat I think after a transition period. Frequently particularly with founders there are situations, in which when new leadership comes on board they eventually get off to allow the new leadership to have unbridled capabilities to direct the strategy. But it doesn't sound like you plan on doing that? Am I correct in reading that? Francisco D'Souza: Keith, my primary and really only goal here is to ensure that we do whatever is necessary to make sure that Brian is incredibly successful as we go through the transition and beyond that. And my commitment to my fellow board members and to the company is that I will play whatever role is necessary to make sure that that happens, and not a bit more than that. And so we will play that as things come. But at the moment my commitment is to all of you, to our shareholders, to my 282,000 fellow associates around the world and to my fellow board members that my commitment is to make sure that I do whatever is in my power to ensure we have an absolutely smooth transition. Keith Bachman : Fair enough, fair enough. Just one for you Karen. I just want to understand 606 in 2019. 606 was a help both the top line and the margins in 2018. My assumption is it's neutral in 2019. I know it's hard to predict because it depends on the nature of the contracts. But is that the right assumption that 606 is neutral to both the top line and to the margins in 2019? Karen McLoughlin : Yeah. That is a fair assumption Keith. And we will no longer -- in 2019 we will not be breaking it out. That was a one-year requirement to make that disclosure. But from a modeling perspective, just assume it\u2019s neutral. Keith Bachman : Okay. Many thanks. Cheers. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our last question this morning will come from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : Hey, there. And I\u2019d echo the last comment. I think Brian is a great hire, and it's nice to see the new thinking about being more global and so on. I wanted to ask in that context a couple of things. Do you expect as the CEO change occurs that anything related to guidance or financial targets might be reconsidered? And also do you expect any management departures related to the CEO change besides the one that's already been announced? Francisco D'Souza: Rob, it's Frank. Multiple parts to your question there. Let me just first of all just say that as we think about Raj, I want to just say that, it's worth really spending a minute to thank Raj for his countless contributions to the growth and success of Cognizant. When Raj joined the company, I think we were $20 million in revenue. And from that to over $16 billion last year, Raj has provided leadership, operational skills, passion for clients for over two decades in a variety of operating roles. And he's as you know served as our President for the past 2.5 years. So I just want to thank Raj, acknowledge his many, many, many contributions to the company on this call and wish him well in his future endeavors. I think that as we've outlined for you today, our targets and our guidance for 2019 are based on our best view of the business at this point for the year. We're providing those to you as we always do having considered all of the factors that could positively or negatively influence our performance and this is our best view and that continues to be the case with the 2019 guidance. I am sure that, as Brian comes in, he will bring his perspectives to the role. And when we have updates we will provide those to you and -- or Brian will going forward. I don't think we have anything else to add to that. Karen? So, I guess, thanks very much, everybody. Thanks, again, for joining the call. I want you all to know that I've truly enjoyed many, many interactions with all of you over the 48 quarters that I've done this. I look forward to introducing Brian to you in the days ahead and during the transition process once he's on board. So thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ms. Royce. Please go ahead Ms. Royce. Katie Royce : Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are : Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Before I pass this to Brian, let me address one issue. We understand that there was some inadvertent communication of our release and other materials this afternoon shortly before market closed. Obviously we are going to take a look into what happened here. We simply wanted to let you know that we are aware of the issue and we will undertake a review. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Well, thank you, Katie and good afternoon, everybody. I'm pleased to join you today on my first earnings call as Cognizant's, CEO. I've long admired Cognizant from my vantage point at other leading technology companies. Since moving into the role five weeks ago, I've been busy getting into the heart of the company's operations. I traveled across three continents to listen directly to our clients and partners. I've conducted more than two dozen deep dives into our industries, lines of service and regions. And I've met with nearly all of our global executive leadership team and talked to hundreds of our associates in person. I can tell you that the initial reasons for my enthusiasm about Cognizant have been strongly confirmed. I'll share some observations later in the call. This is a great company and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the company forward. That said, we had a disappointing first quarter performance. We have a lot of work to do to get back to what I believe this company is capable of achieving to seize the market opportunity in front of us. In Q1 our revenue grew 6.8% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.1 billion. This fell short of our guidance and resulted in an earnings shortfall. Our softness in top line growth resulted from a weak performance in Banking and Financial Services which was flat year-over-year in constant currency and slowing growth in Healthcare, excluding the contribution of Bolder Healthcare Solutions. Our revenue performance reflects both external factors including in-sourcing among a few large Financial Services clients and the spending pullback in Healthcare clients that are in the midst of merger integration, as well as Cognizant-specific execution issues that we need to get behind us. Offsetting this weakness in Financial Services and Healthcare, we delivered strong double-digit growth in two of our other major business segments; Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology. Later in today's call, I'll let Karen take you through the details of the quarter. Beforehand I want to offer three observations : First, notwithstanding a disappointing Q1 the foundation and capabilities of business are solid and the market opportunity is robust. I've spent enough time reviewing the business and meeting with clients and partners over the last five weeks to know this to be true. I want to stress that our customer centricity is as strong as ever. Having met face to face with hundreds of our associates over the past five weeks, I can attest to their passion for clients, incredible resourcefulness, innovation and desire to win. Their winning spirit derives from decades of commercial success. This kind of spirit is hard to create, but once it becomes the core culture -- cultural attribute as it is in Cognizant, it's also hard to break. Second, we know we can and must do better. We are committed to delivering consistent financial performance that aligns with the expectations that we set and communicate. And third, we also recognize that the first quarter revenue weakness follows a loss of top line momentum over the past 18 to 24 months. One of my top priorities is to act to restore top line momentum. Restoring our momentum goes to a question I've been asked many times by associates and others about revenue versus margin trade-offs. I've long believed that it is possible to achieve solid revenue growth and drive margin expansion simultaneously. I've seen nothing to-date at Cognizant that changes this belief. To do both, we must be fit for growth. And by this, I mean establishing a healthy cost structure that allows us to be cost competitive whilst enabling us to make investments that create value for our clients. Investments, of course can take many forms including marketing, demand generation, partnerships, re-skilling, increased sales coverage or increased spend in platforms tools and automation. I believe cost equals growth. They are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, as we said about reviving top line momentum, we will improve our cost structure as a means to invest in growth and unlock higher levels of performance. One example is our cost of delivery. During my recent trip to India, I saw firsthand how important our delivery teams are to our strategy. Through our customer engagements, our teams in India not only deliver, but also develop solutions and drive customer innovation that bring our digital capabilities to life for clients. This is a prized asset and a valued competitive advantage, but we must also be more efficient to ensure we can accelerate growth. As we set about getting fit for growth, change management, clarity of roles and responsibilities and communication are critical. We will ensure that all of our associates understand the connection between top line momentum and a healthy cost structure and that everyone is clear about our go-forward priorities and their role in making this happen. For example, I want our sales and delivery teams focused on customer acquisition, up-selling and cross-selling within the existing clients, co-creating innovative solutions to customer pain points and maximizing customer satisfaction. Meanwhile Karen and I will focus on ensuring a rigorous approach to non-investment costs, while prioritizing investments related to growth. Once we get the balance right in steady state, I believe we can accelerate growth and deliver margin accretion simultaneously. That aside in the meantime, I'm doing what you would expect a new CEO to do. I will dig into every part of the business to fully understand our strategy, market structures competitive dynamics, client buying behavior, control points and the engagement levels and collaboration of our teams. As I intend to leave no stone unturned, I've already launched a series of work streams to review our growth and margin opportunities. These work streams focus on areas including : our organizational structure, to assess role clarity and decision rights among our verticals regions and lines of service, and to ensure a clear accountability model that drives a culture that is both empowered and performance-oriented. Our sales model, including how we segment customers, align sales coverage and establish sales performance metrics and more leveraged sales commission plans. The must-win battles in our digital strategy as well as the practical matters of ensuring our pivot to digital will be successful via structural leadership and compensation actions. And our delivery model particularly on lowering the cost of delivery through pyramid actions, tooling and automation and optimizing the mix amongst our delivery locations. Finally and acknowledging people are at the heart of everything, we have work streams focused on our leadership and culture, emphasizing rigorous data-driven talent management, succession planning and leadership attraction and development. While, we're on the topic of leadership an essential part of my role is to ensure we have the right team in place to propel Cognizant forward. Having conducted over two dozen 4 to 5 hour business reviews in the last five weeks, I've had a good deal of interaction with most of our senior leaders. I believe we have a highly experienced, deeply knowledgeable and accountable team that serves our clients and shares my commitment to getting the company back to executing the basics well. Recognize, however that when a new CEO joins some reshaping of the leadership team is inevitable and this has already begun to happen. As you know with my arrival Frank D'Souza moved into the role of Executive Vice Chairman and will transition to Vice Chairman of our Board at the end of June. Raj Mehta has stepped down as President. I'm not planning to backfill this role. I want to be deeply engaged in the business and also want to flatten our organizational structure, so that we can take out layers of costs, communicate quicker and move with greater speed and agility. With the view to sharpening our focus and accelerating our growth in digital business I've just appointed Malcolm Frank as the new President of Cognizant Digital Business. Malcolm will bring significant customer centricity, passion, a strategic mind and a partnership mentality to this critical position. And to improve our performance in Banking and Financial Services, which represents 35% of Cognizant's annual revenue, I've asked Prasad Chintamaneni our EVP and President of Global Industries and Consulting in addition to his existing responsibilities to also assume the direct management of the banking business on an interim basis. Earlier in his career, Prasad led our Banking and Financial Services segment. Therefore I'm confident that he will immediately make a difference as we launch the search for a new head of our banking business. Prasad will continue to maintain all of his existing responsibilities in addition to his interim role. Finally before turning the call to Karen, I would like to touch briefly on Cognizant's significant market opportunity. One of the things that drew me to Cognizant is our large addressable market. The rates of digitization across industries creates a significant opportunity for us and clients, as they recognize digital as both an opportunity and a threat. We built leadership positions in many industry verticals and strong client relationships where we can upsell and cross-sell our lines of service. We have an opportunity to further diversify our client base. And on a geographical basis, there's a huge opportunity outside of North America with our global growth markets currently accounting for just over 1/4 of our total revenues. I believe that we have the right strategy and portfolio of services and solutions to capture the market opportunity and we will double down on execution to ensure success. We have been focusing over investments on six advanced capabilities that our clients need to become fully digital businesses. These six capabilities which form the core of our digital strategy are : core modernization; digital engineering where I'm really enthusiastic about the capabilities enabled by Cognizant's Softvision; AI and analytics; intelligent process automation; industry and platform solutions; and interactive customer experiences. To this list, I have added one more capability, Internet of Things. The advent of 5G will vastly expand the impact of IoT and create significant opportunities across our verticals. As we help our customers be successful in a digital world, we need to extend our IoT portfolio of offerings and build out our IoT partnership ecosystem. We see ample headroom for growth in all of these areas which offer strong margin profiles and a combined market opportunity that we estimate to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. As we get after these opportunities we will be ultra-efficient in our legacy operations, prioritizing our investments, investing in partnerships and ensuring we digitize our own operations. In short, my mission is to ensure that Cognizant is well positioned for long-term success. My aim is to leave no stone unturned so that we can identify all opportunities for improvements in growth, efficiency and profitability. I look forward to giving you an update on our progress in the coming quarters. We have a solid strategy engaged associates and incredible client centricity and we are fully committed to executing this strategy. Okay. With that it's my pleasure to turn it over to Karen who will give you an update on both our operational and financial performance as well as a view on how we see the year ahead. Karen? Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. While the quarter started as expected, we saw a deterioration in our performance in the second half of the quarter which led to a slower-than-expected Q1 revenue of $4.11 billion, an increase of 5.1% year-over-year or 6.8% in constant currency. Digital however continues to be the most significant driver of our growth and now accounts for over 1/3 of total revenue. Moving to the industry verticals, whereas Brian mentioned the Q1 underperformance were primarily driven by Financial Services and Healthcare. Financial Services growth was flat year-over-year in constant currency driven by both banking and insurance. In insurance, growth was slower than our expectation at the beginning of the year as executive transitions underway at several of our clients, slowed the decision-making process in the latter part of the quarter, particularly around larger deals in the pipeline. In banking we continue to see softness at a few of our largest banking clients, but during the quarter we also saw a more conservative approach to spend with several of our regional banking clients in North America, including some banks that were impacted by M&A activity. Consistent with what we communicated at our Investor Day in November, two of our top five clients continue to show good growth while spend at the other three clients remains under pressure. We have however made progress in furthering our platforms and solutions strategy for the banking clients through the recent acquisition of MeritSoft, a capital market software platform for post-trade receivables and payables processing with offerings in regulatory, tax, operations and fees and billing. And the previously announced partnership with three Finnish financial institutions to transform and operate a shared core banking platform based on the Temenos platform which began as expected in the second quarter. However we are seeing some cautiousness in the banking sector around levels of spend in the second half of the year with a moderating outlook for growth in their business. Moving on to Healthcare which grew 4.6% year-over-year in constant currency. Within our Healthcare vertical slower-than-expected growth of our payer clients was largely the result of several large clients involved in mergers, as well as the accelerated movement of some work to captive at a large client. The continued rampdown of an account in which we were a subcontractor to a third party also continued to negatively impact revenue. We expect these trends to continue and likely deteriorate in the second quarter as some of these clients finalize new contract negotiations before embarking on the execution of their integration plans. Over the last several years, we've seen periods of heightened industry consolidation in Healthcare creating pressure on our organic growth rates during those periods. While the revenue associated with integration work that typically follows M&A can be meaningful, we recognize the volatility that has resulted from a handful of large clients over this period. As we broaden our client base within Healthcare by expanding into new care clients through platform offerings developed for contracts such as TMG, as well as the provider space, the diversification of our client mix should over time contribute to more consistent growth. Life Sciences saw broad-based acceleration in the quarter contributing above-company average growth. We are seeing good traction in large enterprise transformation deals and momentum with our industry-specific platforms such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials. Products and resources had another strong quarter showing 13.8% growth year-over-year in constant currency. We saw double-digit growth in constant currency across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality, as well as manufacturing logistics energy and utilities. Building on the momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter, retail continued to perform well, despite a handful of bankruptcies in some of our smaller relationships during the quarter. We continue to see strength in cloud and digital engineering services and increased demand for interactive IoT and analytics solutions across clients. Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 19.6% in constant currency driven by software and platform clients within the technology sector. Within media and communications, growth was primarily driven by digital services for media and entertainment clients to accelerate their transformation to modern media companies, partially offset by slower growth with communications clients involved in industry consolidation. Technology delivered double-digit growth driven primarily by our digital content solutions. Now moving on to geos. The rest of the world grew 7.1% year-over-year in constant currency. Results in Asia Pacific continued to be negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. On a constant currency basis, the three industry segments outside of Financial Services saw double-digit growth in the quarter. Europe grew 14.3% year-over-year in constant currency. In Continental Europe, we saw strength in Life Sciences and telecom while a few of our larger banking relationships in Europe remain under pressure we did see good growth from several of our newer logos. While North America remains a significant and growing market for us we see tremendous opportunity for growth in other parts of the world. We have made a number of organic and inorganic investments in Continental Europe which have given us a strong foundation for future growth. Going forward, we expect to increase our investments and drive an even greater focus on international growth particularly in Europe. Shifting now to margins. Our GAAP margin and EPS were 13.1% and $0.77 respectively. Our GAAP margin and EPS were negatively impacted by a $117 million accrual related to a recent ruling of the Supreme Court of India interpreting certain statutory defined contribution obligations of employees and employers which altered the historical understanding of such obligations by extending it to cover additional portions of an employee's income. Our accrual covers prior periods and assumes retroactive application of the Supreme Court ruling. However as further discussed in the financial tables to our earnings release, there is significant uncertainty as to how the liability should be calculated and whether the Indian government will apply the ruling on a retroactive basis. As such the ultimate amount of the company's obligation may be materially different from the amount accrued. As a result of this ruling, the contributions of our employees and the company in future periods are required to be increased. This change will result in approximately $15 million of incremental spend for the remainder of 2019 related to the employer portion of this contribution. Adjusted operating margin which excludes realignment charges and the $117 million incremental accrual related to the India defined contribution obligation was 16% and our adjusted EPS was $0.91 in Q1. Q1 margins followed our typical seasonality and were lower than the full year projection. In Q1, we also had the continued absorption of headcount additions and wage increases and promotions from the fourth quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was below our expectations for the quarter due to costs related to headcount growth outpacing the lower-than-expected revenue growth in the quarter which negatively impacted operating margins by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.04 and an anticipated increase in bad debt expense related to a few bankruptcy filings by clients, primarily in our Products and Resources segment. This bad debt expense negatively impacted operating margins by 30 basis points and EPS by $0.02. For the remainder of 2019, we expect margins to remain below our previous expectations, but to improve in the second half of the year as we align our cost structure with revised revenue expectations. As we discussed during our Investor Day back in November, while we have taken steps to improve our cost structure there remains much more we can do to enhance margins through areas such as pyramid optimization, sustaining higher levels of utilization and improved pricing levers. There is additional opportunity to simplify parts of our business unit overhead structure and take a hard look at the cost of delivery. Additionally a shift to higher-value services such as digital will continue to support margins. From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate at 19% is flat with Q4, but remains elevated. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and overall management. Turning to the balance sheet which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments, down $843 million from December 31, 2018. This decrease is largely due to the $750 million of share repurchases under our stock repurchase program including the funding of the $600 million accelerated share repurchase program launched in early March and annual bonus payments. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $427 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department. We generated $163 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Following the typical seasonal pattern, free cash flow in Q1 was impacted by the timing of our bonus payouts. Additionally we had an uptick of DSO of three days compared to Q1, 2018 which negatively impacted free cash flow by $125 million and included an increase in unbilled receivables. We billed approximately 57% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April which is in line with our historical norms. Our outstanding debt balance was $746 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares and our diluted share count decreased to 575 million shares for the quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 3.6% to 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates this translates to growth within the range of 2.7% to 4.2% reflecting our assumptions of a negative 90 basis points of foreign exchange for the full year. This revised guidance reflects the slower growth in quarter one as well as a more muted outlook for Financial Services, including Banking and Insurance as well as Healthcare. For the second quarter of 2019 we expect to deliver revenue growth in the range of 3.9% to 4.9% in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates this translates to growth in the range of 2.6% to 3.6% reflecting our assumption of a negative 130 basis points for foreign exchange for the second quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 17% and to deliver adjusted EPS in the range of $3.87 to $3.95. The reduction in our operating margin guidance is primarily the result of headcount which grew faster than revenue for the last two quarters. While we will better align our cost structure with our revised revenue growth expectations, we will also continue to invest in talent and development of solutions that further our position in the digital marketplace. In the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating margins to be in line with Q1 at approximately 16% while we take perspective cost alignment actions that will take several months to implement. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 572 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted EPS, excludes realignment charges and any other unusual items net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, the incremental accrual related to the India defined contribution obligation and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment including areas such as immigration and tax. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we intend to utilize approximately 50% of global free cash flow annually for dividends and share repurchases. In Q1 we executed share repurchases that will reduce our average share count for the full year by more than our target of 1%. In addition the Board has declared a Q2 cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22. Additionally we intend to utilize approximately 25% of global free cash flow on acquisitions and have closed two acquisitions thus far in 2019. We continue to look for acquisitions that enhance our longer-term strategy of enriching our digital capabilities, expanding our geographic footprint and enhancing our vertical expertise. With that, I will turn the call back over to Brian. Brian Humphries : Well, thank you, Karen. Before we take your questions let me close by saying once again, how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this great company. My 286,000 colleagues and I recognize that we have work to do to get Cognizant back to basics and to strengthen our execution. We will roll our sleeves up and ensure that we tenaciously follow through on our strategy to produce the kind of results I know Cognizant is capable of achieving. We are all dedicated to our clients and we are all committed to advancing Cognizant's pivot to digital and spurring the next phase of growth and success. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for your questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Hi good afternoon guys and welcome Brian. I look forward to working with you. Brian Humphries>: Thank you. Lisa Ellis : Can you give a sense -- I know you've just been on the ground like you said for five weeks or so, but given you've landed in an organization that's clearly in this pretty tough period of transition, can you just map out for us a little bit how you envision the next 6 to 12 months for you looking like? Like where are you going to focus? Are there some immediate shifts and changes you can already envision you might want to make things you want to be doing faster investing in more aggressively? Any, just early thoughts? Thank you. Brian Humphries : Yes, I'm happy to do so. And ultimately over the last five weeks I spent my time across three continents and ultimately have been prioritizing business reviews, spending time with our associates and spending time with clients and partners. And to a great extent that will be how I will continue to spend my time going forward. From my point of view, but the great news is that we have an exciting market opportunity. The potential is there. But one of the things we're going to have to get back to doing is understanding the relevant trade-offs between costs investments and growth. I don't view costs and investments to be the same thing, but I do view costs and growth to be the same thing. We have to be fit for growth. So in order to do so we need to invest in growth, in order to invest in growth we need to free up dollars for investment. And to a certain extent Lisa, I really feel that we have to restart the engine that was the secret sauce of Cognizant. We have very engaged associates who have a winning spirit. There's a great opportunity out there, but we have to go back to making the investments, getting our cost structure right, really embracing digital and doing the basics well. And sometimes those basics in companies can be overlooked in terms of structural decision rights, sales commission plans etcetera, etcetera. If we get all of this right I think we will be in a position to execute our strategy and to do well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you and Brian, thanks for the thoughtful comments. I wanted to ask you, our understanding was that the Board when they selected the CEO that would ultimately carry out the strategy that they laid out at Investor Day late last year. So given what you've learned and what you described in 1Q results are the company's longer-term growth and margin goals still relevant? Or are changes required again based on what you've seen and observed? Brian Humphries : Well, I can't really comment on what the Board sought in a candidate so the question is for them to answer over time. What I will say is that five weeks into my tenure, I'm still very much in a steep learning curve as you can well imagine. I'm delighted to be here and obviously optimistic about our potential. And why? Of course as I said the market opportunity is there to be taken. I'm surrounded by a lot of really smart people with broad industry knowledge and I'm going to be leaning on them to help me execute our plan in the years ahead. We do have a base of associates as I said that are client-centric which is a huge asset to have a winning spirit and that's based on years of commercial success. Now we have a set of customers who like Cognizant and that gives us the opportunity to up-sell and cross-sell to our installed base, but we also have an opportunity to go after new customers within our largest spend and most successful verticals as well as in the other segments and indeed as Karen touched open within growth markets. And we have to embrace digital further and leverage our strong C suite relationships notably at the CIO stack to better penetrate the rest of companies in their digital ambitions. What's easy or what's easy to articulate in one hand is obviously harder to execute. You asked me what needs to change? Too early for me to comment and I'll be in a better position to address that obviously down the line in the outer quarters. Maybe let me answer your question indirectly by saying and touching upon some of the work streams that I\u2019ve started. What's really clear and important to me in good companies is that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. Teams are empowered with responsibility clarification and empowerment so too goes accountability. And core to all of that his decision rights. And we have a matrix as every company has a matrix, but we need to and I will explore the D if you will on a rapid between horizontals verticals and the deeper markets. There must be clarity in the matrix. I also really want to look at how we get after the sales opportunity and not just in terms of the CIO versus the rest of the C-suite where we in theory should be able to better leverage our CIO relationships to cross-sell into the CMO, the COO and indeed the CEO and shift ultimately from the run portion of the business which will always be under some degree of constraint into the optimization or transformation portion of the business, leveraging more of a shift to advisory and indeed our digital offerings. But we have to look at some of the basics as well customer segmentation, commission plans, accounts-based marketing all of these are critical to growth and it's important to get the basics right and of course as it expands our delivery model. So look in short I'm learning the business. With every passing week I get a little smarter, but I've got a lot to learn and I'm rolling my sleeves up as you can imagine with the team spending time with clients and they themselves will have a huge role to play in informing my priorities going forward. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Essex : Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess either Brian or Karen I was wondering if we might be able to get a little bit more color on the Banking and the Financial Services side? And it sounds like things are a little bit softer than you anticipated particularly with North America and regional banking clients? I was wondering maybe if you could help us wrap our arms around that a little bit to understand what -- where the softness came from and is this a temporary issue? Or might there be a fatter pipeline kind of in the back half of the year as you kind of progress through the year? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. Brian it's Karen. I'll take that. So I think, certainly as we've talked about for several quarters, the top five banking clients have been under pressure and we saw the nice recovery in two of the top five last year and that continues into this year. We haven't really seen any change of the profile of those clients or their behavior. But we did, as we said on the call in my comments see some pullback in the regional banking clients. Some of it was M&A as we\u2019ve always talked about when there were acquisitions happening between clients particularly when both sides of the acquisition are clients of ours. We do tend to see some pullback as the deals are getting finalized and closed before integration spending, so there was a little bit of that in the quarter. But we saw some general softness at some of our other regional clients as well, not on a material basis in any individual client, but a number of small pullbacks across the industry. I think it's early to say what's happening in the broader market. But at this point I don't expect to see a significant recovery as we move into the back half of the year. But neither do we expect to see significant deterioration beyond what we've already seen with the three of the big five banking clients, but it was a little bit of a surprise in the quarter as we got further into it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi, thank you very much. I want to -- Brian this is for you and I wanted to start with you're lowering estimates, which I don't candidly think as a surprise, but the magnitude's certainly a bit larger than we were thinking. And as you indicated you've been there a short period of time. And so I just wanted to get kind of comfort level that you had enough time to at least give some assessments that would suggest that the estimates are set at a reasonable spot. And the second part of the question is you are taking a fresh look at things. And one of the things that does surprise me a little bit is the free cash flow targets, in other words, using 25% of your free cash flow for acquisitions. And given your attached rates to some of the troubled banks and the gravity that that poses, I would think that Cognizant would be well-served by perhaps leaning a bit more on M&A as your friends from Accenture doing in other firms. And so the corollary part of the question if you saw opportunities that would advance the cause of Cognizant would you be willing to flex away from some previous statements that were made to advance Cognizant? That's it for me. Brian Humphries : Well, thank you, Keith. Let me first start with capital allocation because the M&A question is inherent in that. Look you can well imagine Keith, our Board of Directors and I will continue to evaluate our framework on an ongoing basis to ensure we're maximizing value for people like you and our shareholders generally. We do have a very strong balance sheet. At this moment in time, there is no change in our previously disclosed capital allocation framework. I will say more explicitly to the question on M&A, it has been and will continue to be a level of -- a lever to execute our strategy. I'm very clear in my mind that M&A is not a strategy, it is a means to execute a strategy. So, all acquisitions that come forward to me needs to be contextualized against our strategy and we need to have clear business ownership and sponsorship and a clean line of sight to integration. At the moment, we're not working on major acquisitions and I'm more historically favorable to tuck-in acquisitions as opposed to anything beyond that. And I do think we should be able to use those as a means to an end to drive further revenue growth in line with our strategic ambition. Back to the first part of your question which relates to the margins, look everybody knows I've been here five weeks, so I arrived in April 1st, the quarter was closed and immediately we started looking at the results and trying to decompose them down understanding what happened in the latter part of the quarter. By definition, I have been focused on what is a secular trend versus a cyclical trend, what is an external factor versus a Cognizant-specific factor? I'm pleased with the work that Karen and I have done to try to get below those as best we can. I'm obviously focused on putting guidance out there that I know we can actually execute against. And that will enable me to invest in the long-term health of the business to ensure we can drive shareholder value creation. So, at this moment in time, that's as much as I can say. Karen McLoughlin : And I think Keith if I could just add to Brian's comments on capital allocation and acquisitions. As you'll recall at Investor Day what we outlined was a framework that on average in a given year, we would deploy 50% of our free cash flow for buybacks and dividends, 25% for M&A, and then 25% on average goes to India. But we continue to have a very strong balance sheet both with cash and excess capacity for debt if we needed the appropriate time for acquisitions or other investments. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane : Hi, good afternoon. I know you guys gave guidance on February 6, so I'm just trying to understand in the first quarter, the miss of op income was by $100 million versus $300 million and margins ended up being down 170 basis points. So -- and I know we talked about margin expansion this year. Margins were going to be up 100 basis points. Now they're going to be down 100 basis points. So I'm just trying to put what happened to the margin expansion and just the shortfall in revenue for the quarter doesn't make up for it. And I'm sure you knew about headcount raises already. So I'm just trying to reconcile the differences? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin : Yes. So I think Bryan the way to think about it is that the revenue shortfall was clearly the biggest piece in the sense that we have ramped up hiring in Q4 and then the beginning of Q1 for the anticipated growth this year. And as you know it's hard to -- you can pull down the hiring, but once you have the people on board you need the revenue to support that. And when we gave guidance, while we did not give quarterly margin guidance certainly our Q1 margin does tend to be below the full year average. And so while the 16% adjusted operating margin was slightly below our own expectations we had expected that there would be a ramp of margins as we went through the year as revenue continued to build and as we were be able to deploy the headcount that we had bought on in Q4 and the early part of 2019. And I think what you'll see, as I\u2019ve said in my comments that margins, there will be a little bit of a different seasonality this year. So margins -- adjusted operating margins in Q1 and Q2 will be roughly the same. Q2 tends to be our strongest margin quarter, but given the pullback of revenue and the headcount that we have on board now, Q2 margins will be similarly in line with Q1, but then we'll see the ramp as we get back into Q3 and Q4 and we can better align the cost structure to the revenue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jim Schneider : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and welcome Brian. Maybe if we could go back to the conversations you've had with clients over your initial month at the company. Can you maybe just talk philosophically about what they've told you about their willingness to potentially give you more business, if business conditions were different? In other words, for example with respect to pricing is -- do you believe that you could actually accelerate revenue growth at the company by potentially being a little bit more aggressive on pricing? And can you maybe -- understanding that you don't believe there's a direct trade-off between revenue growth? And margins, just talk about your thoughts on how you could re-accelerate revenue growth beyond all of the kind of temporal issues that are going on with the clients in Banking, Healthcare right now? Brian Humphries : Yes. I think it's a good question and inherent in that is the notion of elasticity and also our position within clients in terms of where we stand, not just in legacy but also in the new. I've seen quite a lot of clients across three continents and I have approached those meetings very openly soliciting feedback on Cognizant, on our brand, on what we stand for, on our client teams and delivery and project management. I've tried to obviously in the same vein understand what those customers are working on. And I would say very clearly and consistently spend pressure continues on the run side of the business in Financial Services everywhere else kind of consistent theme. And all firms are fully aware of the do-or-die notion that digital disruption brings their way. So they are in a highly competitive market with legacy competitors as well as new. And so very often the message is, we have to find ways to get our investments down in legacy, free up dollars for investments in security, but also free up dollars for innovation, to enable them to better participate in the digital world, if you will. So there is spend, but it's not always where we would traditionally played. And so our task is to optimize our portfolio, being as efficient as possible in our legacy business, and better positioning ourselves then in the digital world. And that brings with it complications as well as opportunities. The nature of the contracts from longer-term contracts to more project-based contracts is the fact that we have to juggle with, the nature of the skills required to get at those opportunities and the relationships, how we get into the front door? How we leverage our strength with CIOs and strong customer NPS to sponsors with their CMO, COOs, CEOs? How we get the right skill sets? Who we talk to? How we talk to them? How we follow-up? What collateral to leave? You name it. It's fundamentally an opportunity for us, but also something we have to grow into and continue to flex our muscles in, as we become more of an advisory element. Cognizant Digital Business is really important to making that happen. Winning new logos of course will enable us to grow too. But more broadly, almost two-thirds of our business is in Financial Services and Healthcare, so it's important that we turn those businesses around. It's important that we buttress our North America business with further growth in global growth markets, which grew 12% in the first quarter. And, if we get all of those things right and invest for growth, I am confident that over time in a steady-state, we will be able to simultaneously deliver better margins and accelerated growth. At this moment in time, of course, we have a lot of work to do. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Please proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : Hey, welcome, Brian, and nice to have the fresh perspective. Hey, I just want to go back to where we had been recently. I mean, it does seem that the Analyst Day and the related financial targets that were set by the outgoing management, it does seem that those targets were awkwardly timed. And so I just wanted to inquire, a couple of things. One has the process for forecasting risk rating prospects in the pipeline and so on, has that process changed as you've come to the helm? And two, is there a plan for the role that Frank will be playing going forward? Is he ultimately going to transition out or is he staying for an extended period? So any clarity on that in the context of having these financial targets that were issued when there was the CEO change eminently about to occur. I think a lot of people are now especially now wrestling with the awkwardness that was created with that. So has the guidance process and the forecasting assumptions and approach changed? And is there a plan for the role of Frank going forward? Brian Humphries : Well, let me first start with the latter question around Frank who's been nothing short of a gentleman in the transition period with me. And I've been delighted to have the opportunity to spend time with him and work with him. He\u2019s somebody I reach out to almost on a daily basis to get guidance and counsel within the same vein. He's clear that he hasn't gone from the CEO role for the next three months or the next two months at this stage to move into an EVP or Executive Vice Chairman role and thereafter, will transition to the Board. And I'm sure will be available for me in non-operational capacity, but as a counselor as needed and as I choose to use. With regards to the process for forecasting and the Investor Day guidance and Q1 guidance, I can't really comment on the past. It's very clear obviously that, I understand the importance of setting expectations we can meet and consistency of earnings. It's something that I hold near and dear to my heart. We will continue to work to get rigor in our forecasting process and not just forecasting, but an annual budget process. Forecasts happen on a monthly basis, bottom up from accounts. But at the end of the day, we set a cost structure and we set leadership bonuses based on the annual budget. So we want to make sure we're rigorous, not just against forecasting and predictability of guidance, but also against the inherent plan as we enter a year. Rod Bourgeois : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Darrin Peller : Hey, thanks, guys. Listen just to dissect the shortfall on revenue versus your initial outlook, I mean, when we think of the magnitude of $500 million $600 million of revenue here, I guess, I'd just love to get a little more granularity as to how much of this is a handful of large clients? How much of it is broad-based? And then, really, I didn't hear you say you digital \u2013 sort of, digital revenue growth rate. Maybe if you can give us that and if that's not been really enough to offset, what you're seeing is legacy revenue decelerating at a faster pace now. Thanks, guys. Karen McLoughlin : So, Darrin, it's Karen. So the digital, what we've said in my comments was that it's about a-third of revenue now. It grew low \u2013 above 20%, so \u2013 but low 20s, so consistent with where it was running towards the end of last year, so no real significant changes there. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask on Healthcare. With the political cycles starting to ramp and then the rhetoric around health insurance also ramping, can you discuss what you're seeing in spending behavior in conversations with your managed-care clients. I'm trying to understand the underlying outlook here, that's independent of the captive and also independent of account ramping down. And really, when do you expect that segment can potentially show a turn of the corner here? Karen McLoughlin : It's Karen. So I don't \u2013 I think the behavior we saw in Q1 was really related primarily to the merger and acquisition activity that we've seen in Healthcare. So as we all know, there have been two very large mergers in the last few months. All four of those companies were clients of ours. And that was the majority of where we saw some pullbacks and where we expect see some deterioration, as we said, going into Q2 and sluggishness for the rest of the year. And then, we had one large client that did accelerate the move to a captive during the quarter. At this point, I think, it's more about those client-specific situations versus anything that might be happening in the broader regulatory environment with Healthcare. But I'll ask Brian to maybe add some color to that as well. Brian Humphries : Well, thanks, Karen. Well, first of all, it bifurcates. Obviously, Life Sciences has been very strong and grew double-digit, as we said. In the health care payer business, we've had a different story and certainly excluding some M&A, it's been slow. I would say, on a positive nature, health care is still about 18% of the nation's GDP and we're starting from a position of strength. So we need to understand, of course, we've had disappointing Healthcare results this quarter, but we need to do better. In the last few days, I've spent about three hours with CIOs of some of the largest Healthcare companies in the world. And the message I received was very clear. Help them on the run to optimize your opportunities, which optimize their run business and get cost savings and yet they are very open to embracing Cognizant under transformation and digital agenda, where we have so much opportunity. And so for us now and Malcolm in his new offer \u2013 in his role to get after those opportunities and make sure we bring our assets to bear in customers where we've historically had very strong customer satisfaction and growing business in prior years. Karen McLoughlin : And with that, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining and for your questions. Brian Humphries : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining. Earlier today, we announced results for our second quarter. Q2 revenue grew 4.7% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.14 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.94. While we are pleased that we met our revenue and margin guidance, we are not satisfied with this level of performance. Our second quarter results do not reflect what Cognizant is capable of achieving in this market environment, neither on revenue growth nor margin rate. So as we said about correcting these trends, I'm convinced that a large part of what we need to do is in our own control.Softness in Banking and Financial Services, which was up 1.7% year-over-year in constant currency, and Healthcare, which was down 1.5% in constant currency, impacted second quarter revenue growth. While certain market dynamics have impacted our results, I believe that much of our weakness in Banking and in the non-Life Sciences portion of Healthcare is attributable to Cognizant-specific issues.My interaction with clients in both industries underline that they are committed to investing in innovation to help increase their competitiveness and growth. Specific to our banking practice, we've recently implemented a new operating model, which includes a team solely focused on new logos, a team dedicated to the platinum accounts which are a subset of our largest global clients and a banking practice and solutions team to ensure we develop more compelling thought leadership and better align the key partners.In Healthcare, factors such as the in-sourcing of a large health care payer client and the spending pullback by clients that are in the midst of merger integration impacted our performance in the quarter. Fundamental market changes are reshaping health care requiring our clients to do more with less and get ahead of regulatory compliance and complexity while dealing with cyber threats and privacy concerns. We have a market-leading position in Healthcare and a position of considerable strength upon which to build.I believe industry specialization would be more important than ever with this shift to digital and hence, expect to be spending a great deal of time with our Healthcare business and clients to ensure we turn around this prized asset. Over the past three months, we've changed the leaders of both Banking and Healthcare to get a fresh perspective, new energy and even greater customer focus. On a positive note, we delivered double-digit growth in Products and Resources and in Communications, Media and Technology. I continue to be pleased with our momentum in international markets. Our global growth markets region, which encompasses our non-North America operations, surpassed the $1 billion run rate for the first time in our history. We intend to invest in our international business, which should continue to be a growth driver for Cognizant.Later in the call, Karen will take you through the details of the quarter, including segment commentary. As you know, I assumed the role of CEO on April 1. Since then, I have significantly deepened my knowledge of the company whilst reviewing the market opportunity, structure and competitive dynamics. Over the last 18 weeks, I've met with more than 100 clients and partners across three continents and conducted over 60 deep-dive strategic and operational reviews of the company.I've actively solicited client input on our strategy and the strength of our commercial and delivery teams. I've also spent a great deal of time considering customer needs and buying behavior, our brand position, our business strategy, the effectiveness of our organizational structure, our operating discipline, our portfolio of solutions and indeed, our talent and culture.It is clear to me that Cognizant has a proud heritage, significant customer loyalty, a broad portfolio of offerings and engaged and talented associates throughout the world. However, we can position ourselves better to participate in the market opportunity, and this work includes : refining our strategic posture and associated enablers to ensure we better participate in the categories that are most relevant to our clients' needs; developing greater thought leadership and an innovation agenda by industry vertical; accelerating investments in revenue growth, including increased sales and marketing, targeted innovation and enhanced partnerships; significantly lowering our cost structure to facilitate these investments in growth and to ensure we are more cost competitive in deals; and ensuring greater operational discipline and a more performance-based culture to make certain we execute with rigor and focus.Our path to accelerated growth starts with customers, the lifeblood of every company. It is important that we ready ourselves to address the pricing demands of customers in our traditional areas of strength whilst readying ourselves also for the changing dynamics in digital. Given advances in technology, customers regardless of their industry vertical are faced with an unprecedented pace of change and risk of disruption. Against this backdrop, they are focused on modernizing their environments, extracting value from data, better understanding their own customers and accelerating innovation and cloud migration to increase their competitiveness, security and agility.As investments are shifted to digital, budgets in the legacy are pressured with increased focus on cost reduction during renewals. Given our traditional business mix, Cognizant has been exposed to this headwind. We partially offset this via -- through mid-management, automation and other delivery efficiency levers. In addition, given our strong customer NPS, we have often been able to provide incremental savings to clients by consolidating the work of other vendors.While these strategies may be effective in the short term, we need to significantly accelerate our shift to digital as we consider our intermediate and longer-term future. The pivot to digital requires us to rethink many aspects of our company, including our brands, skills, processes, systems and tools. Client engagements will become more project-oriented, meaning more contracts with lower TCV. Our account teams will need to build relationships with the broader C-suite as budget owners, decision-makers and influencers extend well beyond the CIO.And we will need more consultative selling skills, more digital talents, more targeted sales compensation programs and more intellectual property and thought leadership aligned by industry vertical. Delivery will be increasingly agile with near and onshore delivery complementing offshore centers. The skills of our associates and our leadership team must further evolve. This is a multiyear transition that is essential to our future.Against this backdrop, customers are choosing their strategic partners. So as we more readily embrace digital, we must ensure our client-facing resources and our branding represent our strategic ambition. Meanwhile, we need to be even more deliberate in our solutions portfolio, which includes increasing our investment in areas that provide the greatest value to clients while generating the best return for Cognizant. This requires a rigorous capital framework to accelerate our position in emerging categories whilst reducing our cost structure in mature and declining categories.We have a strong foundation to build from in some of the growth categories. One such example and one I'm extremely excited about is digital engineering. This is a large, attractive market with 20%-plus growth rates. To accelerate our position in this market, we have recently decided to combine Cognizant's digital engineering capabilities with Cognizant's Softvision. Until now, our assets have been distributed across Cognizant, and our structure and operating model have been fragmented and inconsistent. This combined practice with over 11,000 associates and revenue of approximately $800 million would provide a powerful combination of software product development and application modernization services to clients across the globe.I believe that our focused efforts will ensure greater brand recognition in this important category and allow us to do more meaningful -- more meaningfully participate in the market opportunity. Our increased focus in digital engineering reflects the market opportunity before us and the growing needs from our clients to achieve top line growth, improve customer engagement through superior experience and boost productivity at an accelerated pace. With this combined practice, we will bring together current and emerging technologies, scale cross-functional teams and innovate talent and delivery methods into a single product-centric operating model.We are building the digital culture into our operating model that influences how our clients conceive, design, engineer and shift digital projects at speed. At the same time, we are leveraging decades of experience and expertise in our clients' technology stack to produce a cloud-ready architecture.We will finalize our strategic positioning in the coming weeks. However, as we enable our customers to disrupt and innovate the modern, scalable, agile, data-enabled and future-proof architectures, it is clear that we should further accelerate our investments in digital engineering, cloud and IoT. And we must strengthen our partnerships with industry leaders to buttress our own capabilities. That being said, this is not a strategic overhaul but rather a refinement of the strategic positioning, our capital allocation and the enablers critical to execute our strategy.Against this strategic backdrop, we need to determine the necessary steps to be taken to unlock Cognizant's growth potential. For this reason, we have established a transformation office, which is charged with reviewing six areas of focus as follows : strategic choices, which include where we want to make strategic bets to better expose us to growth categories; organizational structure, which includes our operating model, our matrix and roles and responsibilities within this; talent, which includes attracting, developing and retaining talent, our culture, our compensation structures and our skills; delivery transformation, which includes optimizing our unit cost of delivery across a global delivery model; sales force transformation, which includes compensation plans, customer segmentation, increased partnerships, sales coverage ratios and consultative selling; and finally, fit for growth, which aims to ensure we have the cost structure, processes and tools to facilitate growth. Each work stream is led by a member of our executive committee. It's cross-functional in nature and is set against a comprehensive change management and communications framework.We've made significant progress in a short period of time. I'm personally excited about the findings of the transformation office, which underlines to me that we can meaningfully change our competitiveness in this market. We've identified opportunities to sharpen our strategic focus, simplify the organization, clarify roles and responsibilities, empower our teams closer to the customer and free up investments in growth by significantly reducing our cost structure.But we have more work to do in the weeks ahead, including internal change management and communications to maximize associate engagement. We expect to outline the details of this program, including the execution plan and associated restructuring charges, on the third quarter earnings call.Happy customers feed the first line of the income statement, so as we aim to accelerate our revenue growth, I want to lead by example by striving to be in front of customers every single day. I've asked for greater innovation and growth focus from our executives and have made some changes in the leadership team, both external hires and indeed internal promotions. Meanwhile, to ensure our senior leaders get closer to our customers and our frontline operations, we've initiated a process to optimize our spans and layers. This has the added benefit of speeding up decision-making, improving communication and reducing costs.Growth also requires investments in sales coverage, targeted M&A and a competitive cost structure. Therefore, even ahead of the execution of the conclusions of the transformation office, we have moved on a number of things, including: the acquisition of Zenith Technologies, which expands Cognizant's IoT portfolio and extends our Life Sciences domain expertise by enabling us to become a single-source provider of end-to-end smart factory capabilities, a key growth driver in Industry 4.0; the separation of Digital Systems & Technology, one of our three service lines, from our delivery organization to increase focus on that service line; the establishment under one leader of an end-to-end delivery organization aimed at dramatically reducing our unit cost of delivery whilst optimizing delivery KPIs; and the approval to hire 500-plus revenue-generating associates over the coming quarters, a combination of customer-facing and sales support professionals, will help us expand existing accounts as we generate new ones.Finally, we need to drive more of a performance culture in our client teams. Therefore, we will overhaul our sales commission plans for the new fiscal year, ensuring that we can better attract, retain and reward top performers. The new plans will have a greater mix of variable compensation, ensuring greater meritocracy and better align our overall incentives with the company's strategic direction.The growth mandate is now starting to permeate the entire company, informing our big decisions and investments and beginning to reshape the critical behaviors of our employees. As we focus on growth, we've also made some operational and cost structure decisions that Karen will address later in the call. This will help our cost structure in the second half, even ahead of the full conclusions of the transformation office.Cognizant is a vast organization, brimming with talent. In a time of change, we must engage the winning spirit of our 290,000 associates to get back to the basics that resulted in our long record of success. Leaders are key in transitions. For our most talented leaders who are at the director level and above, we recently implemented a retention program to let them know how valued they are and how committed we are to their continued career growth with us.Communication is more important than ever right now, so in recent months, we've also greatly increased communication to our associates. We've stressed that growth is our number one priority and provide a context on which -- on what is needed for us to return to growth. I personally am spending a lot of time meeting with associates, reminding them of our tremendous assets and great heritage that we're building on and the substantial market opportunity in front of us.Let me wrap up by saying that I now have a much clearer understanding of the market opportunity, which is meaningful, and Cognizant's opportunities and challenges against this backdrop. While we've taken some tactical decisions in the last three months on cost and growth, the true potential of Cognizant and the extent of the work to be done on costs and transformation in the quarters ahead is becoming apparent via the transformation office. The opportunity teed up from the output of these work streams gives me reason to be optimistic. I see plenty of opportunities to take cost out of the business, to invest in growth and to improve our working capital. We will spend more time on this in the third quarter earnings call.I've covered a lot of ground so let me quickly underscore the five focal points of our work : refining our strategic posture; developing greater thought leadership and an innovation agenda by industry sector; accelerating investments in growth; significantly lowering our cost structure; and ensuring greater operational discipline and a more performance-based culture.While there is a lot of work to be done to ensure Cognizant returns to its historical levels of performance, I can assure you that our team is up for the challenge and looking forward to winning again. With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen, who will give you an update on both our operational and financial performance as well as a view on how we see the balance of the year. Karen? Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $4.14 billion was at the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 3.4% year-over-year or 4.7% in constant currency. Digital revenue growth accelerated from previous quarters to the mid-20% range and now contributes approximately 35% of our total revenue.Moving to the industry verticals where overall company performance continues to be impacted by both Financial Services and Healthcare. Financial Services growth was up 1.7% in constant currency, driven by modest improvement in Banking primarily from the contribution of the previously announced partnership with three Finnish financial institutions to transform and operate a shared core banking platform. In insurance, growth continued to be sluggish as delays in decision-making impacted the start of new work from projects in the pipeline. We anticipate some improvement in insurance in Q3 with the ramp-up of several of these projects.In Banking, we continue to see softness at a few of our largest banking clients and a cautious approach to spend with several of our regional banking clients in North America that were impacted by M&A activity. Consistent with recent trends, two of our Top 5 banking clients continue to show good growth while spend at the other three clients remains under pressure.We anticipate some cautiousness in overall levels of spend in the banking sector in the second half of the year due to weakness in capital markets across banking, M&A activity with the U.S. regional banks and weak macro factors. Moving on to Healthcare, which declined 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Within our Healthcare vertical, the decline with our payer clients was largely the result of several large clients involved in mergers as well as the accelerated movement of some work to a captive at a large client. We continue the ramp-down of an account in which we were a subcontractor to a third party, also continue to negatively impact revenue. While the ramp-down of the work is largely complete, we expect some continued year-over-year revenue impact in Q3 and a minimal impact in Q4.For our payer client, moving work to a captive and those involved in mergers, we expect the second half of the year to stabilize near Q2 levels. We continue to expect that there will be meaningful future revenue opportunity associated with integration work that typically follows a merger. Life Sciences had another quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year. We are seeing good traction with digital operation services, managing pharmacovigilance cases globally, large enterprise transformation deals and momentum with our industry-specific platforms such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials. And as Brian mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Zenith Technologies earlier this week.Products and Resources had another strong quarter, showing 12.3% growth year-over-year in constant currency. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. We saw continued positive momentum in retail where we have well above the company average mix of digital revenue in our largest clients. And we continue to see strength in cloud and digital engineering services and increased demand for interactive, IoT and analytics solutions across clients.Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 14.1% in constant currency. Technology saw double-digit growth, driven primarily by our digital content services and solutions. Through our acquisition of Softvision, we are also seeing good traction for digital engineering solutions with our technology clients. Within Communications and Media, growth was negatively impacted by spending reductions in a few large clients. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to see some slowdown in the year-over-year growth rate of the technology vertical as we start to lap the significant ramp-up of the digital operations work with several large clients. We expect this to be partially offset by improvements in Communications and Media.Now moving on to the geographies. Europe grew 14.2% year-over-year in constant currency. In both the U.K. and Continental Europe, we saw strength in Life Sciences. And while a few of our larger banking relationships in Europe remained under pressure, we did see good growth from several of our newer logos including the partnership with the three Finnish financial institutions.Additionally, in the U.K., we saw strength in Products and Resources. The rest of the world grew 6.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Results in Asia Pacific continued to be negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. We saw double-digit growth within insurance, manufacturing and logistics and Life Sciences clients in the region as well as good traction with winning work with a number of new clients.Shifting now to margins. Our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 14.9% and $0.90, respectively. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes realignment charges, was 16.1%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.94 in the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations but down approximately 300 basis points year-over-year.While year-over-year headcount growth slowed from the prior two quarters, the year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily due to costs related to the headcount growth of 7% outpacing constant currency revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter; and the impact of contract renegotiations with recently merged Healthcare clients, which negatively impacted operating margins by 320 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively.Revenue and headcount in digital operations continue to grow above company average, and we saw a slight increase in the on-site mix at senior levels for the organization. This was partially offset by lower incentive and stock-based compensation. The lower segment operating margins in our Communications, Media and Technology segment reflects the growth of digital content services and solutions in this segment, which generate lower margins than other services in the portfolio.For the remainder of 2019, we expect margins to improve as we align our cost structure with our revenue expectations. While we expect to be in a better position to discuss our longer-term view of margins in the coming quarters, there are several areas that we can and will address in the second half of the year to allow us to reduce costs to reinvest in areas to drive growth, including attracting and retaining the best talent and expanding our portfolio of digital solutions.Even ahead of the conclusion of a broader benchmarking exercise, in the second quarter, we took targeted actions at the senior levels of our pyramid to simplify our organization structure. These actions are expected to result in $65 million of annualized savings with approximately half of that to be realized in the remainder of 2019. In Q3 and Q4, we expect to further reduce overall costs through a number of actions, including aligning headcount growth with revenue growth by further slowing the pace of hiring and being thoughtful on where we backfill attrition. Headcount growth on a full year basis will align to our full year constant currency revenue guidance.We will have greater discipline on capturing improved pricing levers, more closely aligning promotions and wage increases with bill rate adjustments; more rigor around redeploying unbilled resources in our accounts, and we will continue to optimize our pyramid by adjusting our spans of control. And we will have enhanced oversight regarding our use of subcontractors and the balance between subcontractors and full-time associates. We will also have significantly tighter control of areas within SG&A such as disciplined hiring of non-billable resources, further rationalization of our real estate portfolio, tighter control over T&E including significantly reduced travel for internal and other nonclient-facing meetings, limiting business-class travels, relocations, et cetera, and only investing in marketing events that will provide an appropriate rate of return. These actions will help fund our continued investment in areas that support revenue growth. Additionally, the shift to higher-value services such as digital will continue to support higher margins.From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate of 23% was up from 19% in Q4 but flat versus the prior year quarter. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and management such as the announced retention program to recognize and retain our best talent. We expect to incur an additional $48 million of compensation-related costs during the remainder of 2019 for this program.Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy. We have finished the quarter with $3 billion of cash and short-term investments, down $1.5 billion from December 31, 2018. This decrease is largely due to the $1.8 billion of share repurchases completed year-to-date under our stock repurchase program, including over $1 billion of repurchases in the second quarter. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $429 million related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department.We generated $479 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Additionally, we had an uptick of DSO of 3 days compared to Q2 2018, which negatively impacted free cash flow by $135 million. Approximately half of the DSO increase was due to unbilled receivables related to the billing construct of certain long-term contracts. We believe that we have the opportunity to improve our cash conversion and are initiating a working capital program that we expect will improve free cash flow by several hundred million dollars in the coming quarters.Our outstanding debt balance was $746 million at the end of the quarter. There was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the second quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 18.7 million shares for approximately $1 billion, and our diluted share count decreased to 564 million shares for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased over 28 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. We have $738 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.For our cash generated from operations, remaining cash on the balance sheet and our revolving credit facility, we continue to have access to plenty of liquidity to fund both capital return and acquisitions.I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 3.9% to 4.9% year-over-year or $16.75 billion to $16.9 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth within the range of 2.8% to 3.8% or $16.57 billion to $16.73 billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 110 basis points for foreign exchange for the full year compared to an assumption of a negative 90 basis points in our prior guidance. This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for Banking and Healthcare.For the third quarter of 2019, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the range of 3.8% to 4.8% year-over-year or $4.23 billion to $4.27 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth in the range of 2.9% to 3.9% year-over-year or $4.2 billion to $4.24 billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 90 basis points for foreign exchange for the third quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 17%. Based on the actions taken in Q2 and prospective cost alignment actions for the remainder of the year, we anticipate adjusted operating margins of approximately 18% in both Q3 and Q4.We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.92 to $3.98, an increase from our previous guidance of $3.87 to $3.95, primarily reflecting a lower share count assumption based on the stepped-up repurchases completed in the second quarter and the contribution incentive. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 562 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes realignment charges and other unusual items, if any, net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses; clarification, if any, by the Indian government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India-defined contribution obligations; and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment, including areas such as immigration and tax.With that, we can open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman : And welcome again, Brian, your first quarter under ownership, so to speak. And my question is going to be directed towards you. If -- there's a lot of moving parts, it sounds like, both on how I think about the offense of trying to chase revenues while at the same time trying to balance costs. And so we have your margin targets for the year, but just philosophically, how should we be thinking about these two goals of trying to really nurture the revenue line while at the same time trying to optimize the cost structure? How should investors be thinking about this over the course of this longer journey? Brian Humphries : Keith, well, I mean, the first thing I'll say is I do not believe they're mutually exclusive, but let me start first with revenue and then I'll spend some time on costs. We grew, as you know, 4.7% this quarter in constant currency. Within that construct, I would say we had very muted performance in two of our larger segments, Banking and Financial Services and indeed Healthcare, which represents 63% of the business. So one of the first things we have to do to get back to a stronger growth performance is to actually help turn those businesses around, just the law of numbers becomes meaningful.On top of that, I think we are at the stage now of investing more in growth, changing the dialogue internally, prioritizing growth. As you've seen, we have approved, at this moment in time, and I believe over time we will add to this number, over 500 revenue-generating resources or revenue support resources. So the inclination is to get back to what we've always done, which has been to focus on client centricity and revenue growth.Now cost is, of course, and strategy is important to revenue growth. First of all, what are our strategic postures, how are we exposed to faster-growing categories of the market, which are both technology categories such as digital engineering, our way of working, IoT, cloud, as well as geographic categories. And that's why I'm pleased to see the continued momentum we have in the global growth markets, which is our non-North America region.Costs, however, are important to growth because you need to have a very efficient and disciplined cost base to be able to take pricing in the deals, to be able to absorb the renewals, pricing pressure that we are seeing in our traditional business as well as being able to invest in the future. I talked in my prepared remarks around the importance of pivoting to digital and the associated parameters of that, smaller TCV contracts, more contracts, a different delivery model, et cetera.We also need to invest in people, in M&A and indeed in the brand to make sure that we are more associated not just with the area of the business where we are loved by customers but also with the pivot to digital. Many of these areas are, as you know, key to our constrained assets, both M&A targets as well as even just getting digital resources into the company.But I will say, I'm four months in at this stage. Having interrogated the data for four months and having spent a great deal of time in the transformation office, I see huge opportunity here on revenue growth and indeed on costs. I'm not going to get into a guidance discussion today around next fiscal year or indeed a multi-year view. But at this moment in time, this, from my perspective, is something that I only see opportunity in, to improve our performance from today's performance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Glad to see a lot of heavy buybacks, well done there. Just wanted to ask actually on gross margins. Looks like it's the lowest level we've seen in some time. What's driving this? I heard the Healthcare renegotiations. I'm not sure if that was related there. Maybe any comments on pricing, contract execution, that kind of thing and maybe any outlook on gross margin. Karen McLoughlin : Sure. So Tien-Tsin, it's Karen. It's really two factors, one of which is the Healthcare renegotiations that you talked about, about a 40 basis point impact in the fall in gross margin and then also the fact that headcount continued to grow faster than revenue in the quarter. Part of that is our digital operations business, which is growing considerably faster than headcount -- than, sorry, company revenue at this point.Headcount grew in line with the revenue growth digital operations, but you know that does come at a typically lower gross margin than the IT business. But overall, headcount for the rest of the business did grow faster in revenue, and the vast majority of that cost is sitting in gross margin. And that is obviously one of the things that as we continue to focus on tackling the cost of delivery to the organization, we will be looking to optimize in the coming months and quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Brian, as you're thinking about your overall strategic plan, can you provide a little bit more color on how your -- you believed you guys should be tackling the deterioration in Cognizant's traditional services, meaning shifting away from or reaccelerating, or whatever the right answer is, those more traditional legacy pieces of the business, which just at an industry level, maybe flat or even in structural decline. That strikes me as one of the trickier aspects things to navigate through here. Brian Humphries : Yes. It's a good question because we have strength in our existing customer base, and if you look at the Pareto, we have very strong positions and are highly concentrated in a set of customers but we need to pivot more to digital. As we are pivoting to digital, as I said, there are different characteristics of the deals, of the skill sets we need, of the delivery models, of the buying decision makers, if you will, on behalf of the customers. And this is an area that we definitely want to invest into the next S curve and make sure we are, from a capital allocation point of view, really prioritizing that.Now in the more traditional businesses, some of them actually give us a foothold into the new application modernization, we'll go hand-in-glove as I said, with the digital engineering space as we start thinking about cloud-native applications. But in a broader sense of the word, Lisa, I'm a big believer in drawing hard decisions across your portfolio and trying to understand where you need to be extremely disciplined from an investment and from a cost structure point of view in terms of optimizing legacy whilst investing in the new. And those are disciplines we need to obviously continue to drive here in Cognizant as we're investing in some of these newer growth categories that should accelerate our CAGR growth.You have seen in the last quarter, we have aggregated all of delivery under one leader. Previously, delivery was fragmented through a number of leaders in the company. And part of the task of that delivery leader is ultimately to drive a much more aggressive stance in terms of how we think about automation and tooling and putting ourselves in a position that we can be what I would term fit for growth in the legacy as well as the broader company. So optimizing the cost structure, in particular, for the legacy and freeing up capital to invest in the new categories, which should be a growth driver for Cognizant going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ed Caso from Wells Fargo. Edward Caso : Can you talk a little bit about your capital deployment strategies from this space? Obviously, you deployed a lot of capital for repurchase. Where does M&A fit into the equation sort of order of magnitude? And is there more share repurchase to be done in the near term? Brian Humphries : I'll touch on this and Karen can jump in as well. Look, we saw the opportunity to accelerate share repurchases in the last quarter as an opportunistic situation for us and we took advantage of that. And I have no issues continuing to do so if needed.From an M&A point of view, I have rejected some M&A and I have approved some M&A in the last four months. So we would look at that as a means to execute our strategy. We're pleased to have acquired Zenith Technologies, which closed most recently. And obviously, we're using M&A as a means to an end. It is not a strategy, it's a means to execute a strategy. Our priority right now is continuing to refine our strategic posture and making sure, to the prior question, we get our capital allocation correct. But we will look upon M&A as something that we will use to execute our strategy going forward. My emphasis at this moment in time continues to be tuck-in acquisitions that strategically align us to even better our competitive positioning in the market that we deem most relevant to us going forward. Karen McLoughlin : And I think, Ed, it's Karen. Obviously, the guidance for the share count does not assume any more buybacks for the rest of the year. As Brian said, we will continue to look at that opportunistically. But as you know, we have far exceeded our initial expectations for this year in line with this framework we outlined last year at Investor Day where we said we expect to spend on average 25% of our global free cash flow towards buybacks, 25% towards dividends and 25% for acquisitions with the rest going to India. At this point, there are no changes to that framework. If and when there are, we will obviously update accordingly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen and Company. Bryan Bergin : Brian, can you give us a sense on just your view of the time frame of what you think it's going to take for Cognizant to address the company-specific issues that you noted in the your -- in the core verticals there? And in the transformation office work streams, has this already been set up and that's in progress? Or is this now to come in 3Q and 4Q? Brian Humphries : No. The transformation office was set up probably almost three months ago at this stage, to be honest. It consists of six work streams, as I said, each is led by one of our executive committee members. Each one has a steering committee and indeed a working committee below that. We've been very clear in outlining suppositions that I want us to backsolve to and expected outcomes, and as part of that, some short-term wins along the way.So we've been also very deliberate, Bryan, in terms of the composition of the teams, making sure we have people that are cross-functional in nature, people who understand the markets both in North America and internationally, people that understand delivery as well as the market-facing commercial teams. I really feel very, very enthused from the output of the work. We've been working extremely hard on that, but it gives me nothing but optimism that there's a huge opportunity for us to free up capital to invest in growth to simplify the organizational structure, clarify roles and responsibilities and ultimately to make us much more successful in the market by accelerating revenue growth and having better solutions to bring to our clients.So I feel great about that. It is not a new initiative. It's been well underway and frankly, I'm probably more advance in my thinking in the output of that than where I potentially consider I would be three months ago. With regards to Banking and Healthcare, we changed out the leaders of both. This will be some heavy lifting, if I'm very honest. Some of it is because of Cognizant-specific issues that are reflective of the market reality of some M&A in health care where we are heavily exposed to four firms that have merged. And some of it candidly relates to just the need for us to shift faster to digital, to have more thought leadership, to be the even more client-centric and indeed to add more sales coverage. And those are things that are underway at the moment both in Healthcare and indeed in our Financial Services practice or our Banking practice.I should clarify that our Healthcare business in Life Sciences is very strong. It continues to grow double digits. It's one of the areas of our portfolio that I feel best about. We have a strong strategy, a strong leadership team. We know the end-to-end value chain for customers and therefore, M&A is facilitated against that. We are doing a little better in insurance than we are in the core banking business. And as I said on the call, we've made some structural changes in the banking team to really put dedicated teams behind hunting new logos, behind some of our most strategic accounts that we deem platinum as well as more broadly, I believe, that in the world of digital, extra emphasis on thought leadership and an innovation agenda is required.And in my dealings with clients over the last four months, it has become very apparent that we are very established in the legacy or traditional models, but our brand attributes and perhaps our thought leadership isn't where it needs to be on the side of the house that is digital. And that is an area that we need to do better in.If you do look at the competitive market in terms of what has been announced in the last quarter, it's also clear that there is market growth out there in banking and indeed in health care. And certainly from a banking point of view, we've seen most of our competitors in financial services and insurance grow from the low to the high single digits, and indeed, some even into the double digits. So we have to accelerate quicker, get back on the attack, make sure we hone our thought leadership and get a team that are constantly in front of clients with an agenda around innovation that helps customers think about how they can accelerate or pivot to digital.I have not seen in any dialogue with customers any macro concern around their desire to spend on innovation. Invariably, the conversations were very clear. If we show up with enough thought leadership and innovation, they have budgets, and of course, the pivot we need to make is to ensure we are cost disciplined on the legacy side of our business to ensure that we can absorb those cost demands at the time of renewals whilst accelerating our investments into the new. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I wanted to ask about attrition. I thought it was up a little bit, although year-over-year, it's pretty similar. Where do you expect attrition to go? Do you expect it to stay elevated? Or do you expect it to come back down? And maybe you can just talk about if you guys have lost any key managers or personnel and just thinking about the morale of the company through all these changes. Brian Humphries : So let me start with the broader question around leadership and then Karen can jump in on the attrition question. Listen, I mean, to be very clear, in a company of 300,000 employees, we will always have leadership changes and it's pretty standard when you have a new CEO who comes onboard. We have been fortunate that at the time of my appointment and indeed before that, the Board secured certain executives to see through a CEO transition, and I'm grateful for their ability to actually get us through that first four to six months of my tenure because it's certainly allowed me the time to get deeper into the business and to make sure that I was ready to run forward.My perspective is we need a greater emphasis on our customers, greater energy, fresh perspective and candidly in dealing with clients, typically the questions I was asking were how often you've seen our teams, the thought leadership we brought to bear and how we stack up versus the competition and also who were some of the best people in the industry that they recognize and value as people when they are dealing with them. So we have made some very deliberate changes.Now, of course, we've also had some other departures and I think that's normal particularly in a company that has had a relatively stable leadership team over the best part of two decades. This is not something I will say that I am overly concerned about. The emphasis on growth is permeating through the organization. The people who are touching customers day in, day out is typically not the executive team but the client partners. And those client partners are really, in my mind, enthused with the renewed focus on growth after a few years of more focus on margin rate, if you will.And of course, don't get this wrong. I'm not taking this for granted by any means. We are paranoid that the first line of the P&L is the customer. But from my perspective, this is a very manageable transition we're going through. And we've made some strong internal promotions. The new Head of North America, DK, has been with Cognizant for over 20 years and is ultimately focused and has always been focused across multiple verticals on growth. I'm also pleased to have promoted Pradeep in Delivery, somebody who's been with Cognizant for 23 years, to enable us to get much more focused in terms of optimizing our delivery structures.And we've complemented them with some external hires, some executives who used to work with Wipro and indeed more recently Ganesh Ayyar, who was the ex-CEO of Mphasis. So my sense is we want to have the best team we can get our hands on, a team highly motivated, energized, moving with the same speed and urgency that I have and absolutely focused on their teams and on their customers. Karen McLoughlin : And Bryan, as it relates to the 23%, as you said, it is flat year-over-year. And as you know, there is some seasonality to attrition. So typically, after bonuses are paid in March, we do tend to see attrition pick up. Really no changes in terms of the attrition, in terms of where it's coming from up and down the pyramid, the only exception being the director plus attrition ticked up a little bit based on the actions that we took in June as far as the realignment program. But that was the only real, I would say, significant change in attrition both in terms of geography as well as up and down the pyramid. Now I would expect it's going to continue to be lumpy. As we have said for some time now, the job market is strong and as well as we look to optimize cost structure for the organization, that will in itself likely to create some churn. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : As you look forward to the next few quarters, sounds like you expect continued muted trends in financials and maybe some improvement in Healthcare as you get to the end of the year. I guess my question is your Q4 guidance sort of implies that things remain muted kind of across-the-board for some time. Is that just the level of conservatism relative to the outlook? Or do you actually see some headwinds in other segments that could be potentially offsetting that recovery? Karen McLoughlin : Sure. So Jim, this is Karen. Let me tackle that. So Q3 to Q4, there is actually a decline in bill days of about two days and that will cost about $47 million on a constant currency basis. So from a modeling perspective, if you were to take the middle of the range for Q3 and then the middle of the range for the full year guidance, that would actually say on a volume basis that Q4 will be flat with Q3.There will be some puts and takes. As we've talked about in our comments, we do expect to see some stabilization of Healthcare off of the Q2 numbers, not on a year-over-year basis. It will continue to show challenges but we do expect it to stabilize on a sequential basis going forward. We do expect, as I said, a little bit of slowdown in the technology practice, just given the tough year-on-year comps as we get back into the back part of the year but that was in our guidance both this quarter as well as last quarter so no real change there from that perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : I wonder if you could talk about your positioning in digital. Do you think you're competitive in that business? Or is there catch-up to be done? And I think most importantly, how does one company catch up in digital and close the gap if there is one? Brian Humphries : So this is Brian. I'll start with our position in digital. There are areas that I've been really blown away with and that have really -- I've left reviews feeling very proud about what we have and feeling that we definitely have a strong foundation to build from. I talked today about the digital engineering team. I have spent a lot of time with Cognizant's Softvision team. But more broadly within Cognizant, we had legacy digital engineering as well as the application monetization efforts that collectively, it really puts us in a position -- if you think about it, 11,000-plus resources with over $800 million of revenue. It puts us in an incredible position to increase our brand recognition and really dramatically change our position in the market vis-\u00e0-vis some of the, let's say, currently known leaders out there.IoT is a few hundred million dollars for us and we have broad offerings that are aligned by industry vertical, and I'd expect us to go accelerate that as part of our strategy. More broadly, there are organic investments we need to make. There will be some inorganic plays we need to make there, too. But as I said, I'm not working on something huge at this moment in time and it will be more tuck-ins aligned to our strategy. Of course, behind any organic and indeed inorganic acquisitions, how do you scale digital? Well, you need to have a brand, you need to have capabilities and you need to have systems and tools and the sales and marketing engine to facilitate it. That's why I explicitly called out the fact that we are going through a pivot, which requires us to do some work. It's more project-oriented work, that's good and bad. You need to sell more projects, they have lower TCV, but unlike the legacy business, we will not have the same renewal price erosion that we are faced within the legacy.We need to have a set of client partners that are capable of speaking to the right level of the organization that typically will extend well beyond the CIO, different decision-makers and buyers, right from the CMO up to the CFO and indeed the CEO and indeed, know how to speak and how to follow up on what collateral to leave and what use cases to bring in and obviously what industry expertise to bring with them into the conversation. More consultative selling and indeed all these practical things that are very often overlooked but nonetheless critical in my opinion to running a world-class operation, things like sales commission plans that need to change and therefore, we need to orient more of our commission towards aligning our sales into areas of the -- that are aligned with our strategy. So that is not something we've historically done. It is something we will do going into the new year. And indeed, the delivery capabilities from an agile delivery point of view becomes relevant as well.I do feel that as we have near, on and indeed offshore capabilities, if you think about something like digital engineering, if we are able to take the guild and pod model that we have and extend it not just from nearshore but indeed off to our offshore centers, I believe we will have a huge advantage over some of the other players that you know. So listen, this is an area that I'm pumped about, I'm excited about the possibilities we have and I've seen a lot of goodness in the operations. We, of course, now need to accelerate our investments in it and make sure that we take this strategy into execution. And rest assured we are very focused on that. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Rod Bourgeois : Brian, so I appreciate your candor in admitting that Cognizant's weak growth in Banking and Healthcare is mostly due to company-specific issues. And my question is do you have a point of view at this point on what Cognizant's growth rate would be today if it weren't for these company-specific issues that you're needing to fix? And I guess on a related note, you're making a lot of internal changes now. I'd like your perspective on whether you think these internal changes will cause additional growth disruption in the upcoming months. Brian Humphries : So Rod, it's, of course, hard to extrapolate the implication but you can do a sliding scale analysis to understand that for every 100 basis points of improvement in Healthcare or Banking, what is the implied implication on the broader Cognizant story. But given they are 63% of the business, you can clearly understand that these are meaningful shifts to our overall numbers. And every 160 basis points -- $160-or-so million of growth is 1 point of growth for us, and every $6 million of bottom line is $0.01 EPS for us. So these are important levers for us to get right.We do have a lot of balls in the air at the moment and that's why we are very, very deliberate around the transformation office. We have staffed it with people who know the company well. They have been surrounded by management consultants both internal and indeed external, and we have a huge operation cadence behind that and a broad framework of change management communication and indeed an execution layer that needs to happen.And Rod, by definition, you will always go home at night and wondering if you're going too far, too fast. But I've got to be honest, I have a great sense of urgency. I'm really proud to have this role. I really am proud to have inherited an organization that is, in my mind, full of talent and I want to lead them forward, and I believe that we are going at the right pace to catch up where we need to catch up and to extend our leadership where we think we're in front.But we're spending a lot of time around operational excellence and rigor and making sure we contextualize these changes. It's clear, certain employees will be concerned around the amount of work and the hours and the pace in the decision-making. But my belief is that my executive level, I've had a number of executive committee meetings now, we have a cadence of two days every month. We've had some really, really constructive meetings where the teams are on board and we are making the decisions, in my opinion, needed at this moment in time to put Cognizant in a position where we can unlock our true potential. Katie Royce : Right. And with that, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining and for your questions. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Katie. Katie Royce : Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Well thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us in today's call. Over the past few months we've initiated what we expect will be a multi-year evolution of our business aimed at returning or company to historical levels of performance. We view this as a systematic process of revitalizing the company and one we're pursuing with rigor and urgency.Today I want to clarify where we are in this project and where we're headed by briefly covering our Q3 performance and then reviewing how we\u2019ve begun to operationalize the conclusions of the transformation office, including our refined strategic posture, which aligns to our client's digital imperatives and our plan for resetting our cost base to facilitate investments in growth.Let's begin with our third quarter earnings. Q3 revenue grew 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.25 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $1.08. In an uncertain economic climate our year-over-year performance in North America improved modestly in the third quarter.As we've discussed in prior calls, our ability to accelerate the Company's top line growth depends on revitalizing our North America performance and in-particular our banking and financial services and healthcare businesses, both of which were under new leadership.While we have more work to do, we now have highly engaged strategic leaders running these businesses who bring a fresh perspective and huge client-centricity. Arguably, even more important than the modest year-over-year growth improvement we've seen is the new energy we have in our North America leadership team and our clients are noticing this.At a global level, in Q3 banking and financial services was up 3% year-over-year in constant currency and healthcare was down 90 basis points year-over-year in constant currency.In banking and financial services against the backdrop of growing demand for DevOps and some insourcing of skills we see cost pressure in the traditional business with growth opportunities in digital with particular interest in cloud, digital engineering, AI and analytics and interactive.Similar dynamics exist in healthcare, but here revenue growth also continues to be impacted by rate reductions and volume discounts from clients in the midst of merger integration. Our momentum continued in our other two business segments, Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology both posted double digit revenue growth in constant currency year-over-year.Later in our call Karen will take you through the details of the quarter including the business segment and markets commentary. Let's turn to my second topic, operationalizing the conclusions of the transformation office. As a reminder, upon joining Cognizant in April, we established a transformation office to identify, prioritize and put into action key initiatives aimed at accelerating our revenue growth and unlocking the full potential of Cognizant.Following six months of engagement by 250 of our leaders we have now identified amongst other things our strategic focus operating on commercial models, global delivery structure and our cost base and processes and tools required to enable us to be fit for growth.As a result, we are now in execution mode, putting into action key initiatives aimed at facilitating investments in growth, going to market with a sharper strategic focus, working more closely with our clients, continuing to evolve our skillsets and creating a leaner and simpler operating model.Let's start with our strategy. I continue to allocate significant time to face to face meetings with the C-suite of our clients. I find these meetings essential because they allow me to gain insights into the key trends by industry, customer pain points and desired business outcomes.Clients across all industries are confronted with the risk of being disrupted by next generation, nimble digital native competitors, but they are redirecting their focus in investment to digital and embracing DevOps and technologies like cloud, digital engineering, analytics, AI and automation.We spent the past few months sharpening our strategic posture to align directly with client's needs to become modern, data enabled customer centric and differentiated businesses. Our strategy has two parts. First, protecting and optimizing our core portfolio, which includes; efficiency, tooling and automation, delivery optimization, protection of renewals, strengthening our industry alignment and scaling our international footprint.And second, winning in four key digital battlegrounds; data, digital engineering, cloud and IoT. These four areas enable clients to put their data at the core of their operations, improving the experience they offer their customers, tapping into new revenue streams, defending against disruptors and reducing costs.The two parts of our strategy reinforce each other. It's our core portfolio that has built our strength in the market. For instance, our deep relationship with clients who lead their industries, a reputation for responsive and reliable delivery and our historical strength of the application there mean that we know how to help clients transition from managing their current legacy state to enabling their digital future.We are investing aggressively and are determined to win in these four digital battlegrounds and as we do so, we expect to accelerate our revenue growth. I want to offer a bit more context about these four areas starting with data which at the heart of our strategy because it's at the core of our client's competitiveness.No matter their industry clients must quickly get better at storing, managing, reporting, analyzing and reusing their data. Clients need to leverage enormous amounts of data to fuel AI based platforms that can transform customer experiences, drive automation, and provide management insight.This is causing a shift from legacy to next generation data services like data modernization, AI and machine learning. We're helping our clients make the leap from systems of record to systems of insight and engagement. It starts with data engineering including basic things like customer and product hierarchies.Turning to digital engineering to compete effectively, clients need to become software-driven enterprises and to do so they are replacing traditional application development with digital engineering to build leading edge consumer grade experiences and infuse software into their product services and customer experiences.Cloud our third digital battleground is just as critical to clients' digital journeys, given that an estimated 50% of all workloads hit on public and private clouds today, a figure set to rise to 80% in a couple of years.Our clients need help migrating their workloads as well as the entire spectrum of client management, including monitoring, notification, provisioning and orchestration, governance and security. We aim to significantly enhance our partnership with leading scale companies, hyperscale companies and SaaS vendors.Our fourth battleground is IoT, an exciting space given that 75% of businesses are expected to increase their IoT spending in the next five years, and 40 billion plus devices are expected to be IoT connected by 2025. The adoption of IoT enabled by five generation technology is sparking an explosion in distributed and edge computing. A vast array of sensors and industrial IoT devices and solutions will proliferate across businesses, cities, and environments of all kinds, significantly changing used cases and accelerating adoption.For clients, IoT offers the ability to instrument everything for constant insights, if you look back at our recent acquisitions such as soft vision, which expanded our digital engineering capabilities and Zenith Technologies, which expanded our IoT portfolio and our life sciences domain expertise, we've been methodically deepening our expertise in areas that we believe will provide the greatest value to clients while generating the best return for Cognizant.Our latest step along that path is our agreement to acquire Contino, a leading consultancy that specializes in helping global 2000 clients speed their digital transformations by leveraging enterprise DevOps methodologies and advanced data platforms.Cognizant's approach to cloud migration, core modernization and cloud security is we're shaping how enterprises build their infrastructures and these cloud capabilities will enable us to offer transformative cloud based solutions to our clients. We expect this transaction to close later this quarter.The refinement of our strategic posture also highlights a subset of our portfolio that is not in-line with our strategic vision for the company and therefore an area to exit. Within digital operations, we had a content operations business that offers a wide range of business process services to clients across all industries.Some of these projects involve ensuring proper brand and business experiences such as integrating our health care patients or determining whether online maps are accurate, but within one subset of the content operations business. Our work is largely focused on determining whether certain content violates client's standards and can involve objectionable materials.We've determined that this subset of work is not in-line with our strategic vision for the company. While we intend to exit this work, we recognize the cleansing, the web of objectionable content is a worthy cause and one in which companies have a role to play. For this reason, we have decided to allocate $5 million to fund research aimed at increasing the level of sophistication of algorithms and automation, thereby reducing users exposure to objectionable content.Over the coming quarters, we intend to comply with our contractual obligations and determine the best path forward with effective clients. Exiting this subset will impact our financial performance in the coming year and also affect approximately 6,000 roles. In the months ahead we expect to work with our partners to explore ways to transition roles to alternative vendors, thereby reducing the impact to our valued decisions.As a reminder, other Cognizant digital operations content work will continue. In recent quarters, I've discussed the importance of simplifying our organizational model to enhance role clarity, empowerment, and accountability whilst ensuring we further increase our client centricity and optimize our cost structure.Over the last few months, the transformation office and feedback has identified a series of measures to help us progress against these goals. And today, I want to give you an update on some of the decisions we have taken. These actions include returning to our simpler two-in-a-box model of client partner and delivery partner for a more seamless client experience and greater agility in front of the customer.Our previously announced consolidation of the delivery organization under one delivery leader reporting to me, significantly increasing investments in automation and tooling to enable more streamlined and efficient processes, higher productivity and lower delivery costs.Combining Cognizant digital engineering capabilities with Cognizant\u2019s Softvision, thereby creating a powerful team focused on software product development and application modernization. Extending our global brand, developing greater thought leadership by industry vertical and better positioning Cognizant in the market as a leader in digital by uniting all marketing under a recently hired CMO reporting to me. Strengthening Cognizant consulting capabilities in select geographies and verticals, plus complementing our targeted capabilities with greater partnerships with a leader again, reporting to me.Aligning our specialists sales capabilities to the service lines albeit with an industry intersection point to ensure the highest competencies and capabilities are available to our client partners.And lastly in our commercial teams, the implementation of more leveraged sales compensation programs and the development and deployment of a RAD model or retention acquisition development to optimally segment our clients and future clients, thereby allowing us to better hunt and farm.These changes for the most part will become effective January 1, 2020. Against a strategic backdrop and a set of organizational decisions aimed at ensuring strategy execution today we are also announcing a cost reduction program.In any people intensive business costs reduction always involves difficult choices. Would we deny to evolving their skillsets and freeing up capacity to invest in growth we've made the decision to remove approximately 10,000 to 12,000 mid-to-senior level associates from their current roles in the coming quarters.This gross reduction is expected to lead to a net reduction of approximately 5,000 to 7,000 roles as we aim to rescale approximately 5,000 associates, thereby lessening the impact on our associates and allowing us to reduce lateral hiring. These numbers exclude the approximately 6,000 roles impacted by our decision to exit a subset of our content operations business.But as previously stated, we expect to work with our partners to explore ways to transition these roles to alternative vendors, thereby reducing the impact on our associates and also reducing any associated charge.Establishing a healthier cost structure is but a means to an end and that's to drive revenue growth. We\u2019re free of cost. We've identified a series of investments that require funding, including the previously announced hiring of approximately 500 revenue generating associates over the coming year a combination of customer facing and sales support professionals who will help us expand existing accounts and generate new ones.Significant investments in Cognizant Academy our internal learning center and in technical skills as we aim to reskill and redeploy our talent towards digital imperatives. Accelerated investments in tooling and automation and increased investments in marketing and branding as we aim to strengthen our international operations and the DDER digital brand.Karen will provide more detail on our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan, including the expected completion date and run rate savings along with the charges we expected to incur. We will take great care to treat our associates with the dignity and respect they deserve and to minimize any internal distractions caused by our actions as we get the Company back to achieving its full potential.I've been in CEO role now for a full seven months, which has given me the opportunity to considerably deepen my knowledge of our operations, our market opportunity, and our clients. And three things are resenting the cure to me. First, we built an enviable position in a large and attractive market that's expected to continue growing at a steady rate.Most of our clients we serve are still in the early stages of their transformation. They need our expertise and a distinct set of digital technologies coupled with or intimate knowledge of their technology environments to fully digitize their businesses.Second, the significant time I've been able to spend with our top accounts convinces me that our clients love working with us and actually wants us to succeed.In fact, they want us to step up and do even more for them. It's my observation that Cognizant is one of those rare B2B organizations that is a so-called loved brand. The reservoir of clients for us, we built over the years is one of our most distinctive assets. And third, the company is brimming with talented and engaged associates around the world. Our associates are driven to grow and develop new capabilities and easy skills in our portfolio of solutions and then how to apply them to help our clients drive in a digital economy.In summary, the leadership team and I are fully aware that we have a multiyear project ahead of us. My optimism about Cognizant\u2019s future is pragmatic and comes from the winning spirit of our associates around the world who are passionate about contributing to the long-term success of our clients. Notwithstanding a backdrop of macro demand uncertainty that gives us clients for prudence. I'm convinced that much of what we need to do to increase Cognizant\u2019s competitiveness is within our own control.A relentless focus on growth has defined Cognizant's performance since its finding a quarter century ago and that determination and focus are as strong as ever. We're determined to unlock the organization's growth potential and return Cognizant to its historical position of being the bellwether in the IT services industry.With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen, who will give you an update both in our operational and financial performance as well as the view as to how we will see the fourth quarter. Karen? Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter revenue of $4.25 billion was above the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 4.2% year-over-year or 5.1% in constant currency. Digital revenue growth within the mid-20% range and represented over 35% of total revenue.Moving to the industry verticals where overall company performance continues to be impacted by Financial Services and Healthcare. Financial Services growth was up 3% in constant currency driven by the ramp up of several projects and insurance and banking performance which was consistent with last quarter.Within Banking, our performance continues to be impacted by a few of our largest customers. Consistent with the last quarter, two of our top five accounts continue to grow while three remain under pressure, a trend we expect to continue through the remainder of the year. As we had expected when we did our last earnings call, insurance in Q3 benefited from a ramp up in project based work. However, in Q4 we anticipate a continuation of trends seen over the course of this year where executive transition is underway and several of our clients slowing the decision-making process, particularly around larger deals in the pipeline.Moving onto Healthcare which declined 0.9% year-over-year in constant currency, within our Healthcare vertical, performance continues to be primarily impacted by large clients involved in mergers. The continued shift of work to a captive at a large client and the continued year-over-year impact from the completed ramp down of an account in which we were the subcontractor to a third-party.Additionally, in the quarter we were impacted by a charge related to an ongoing contract dispute with a large client. This charge impacted both revenue and margin. Life Sciences again grew double-digits year-over-year, benefiting from continued demand within digital operations. Large enterprise transformation deals, migrating from on-premise to cloud-based environments and momentum within our industry-specific platform solutions such as our shared investigator platform and smart trials.Zenith also contributed to growth in the quarter and we are pleased with the early success we have seen this acquisition. We expect similar year-over-year trends in Healthcare in the fourth quarter. Products and Resources grew 13.4% year-over-year in constant currency. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth.Growth was broad-based across verticals, as results continued to benefit from strong growth within our digital business and demand for digital engineering, cloud infrastructure, IoT and analytics solutions. You do expect to see slower growth on a year-over-year basis in the Products and Resources segment in the fourth quarter, as we lapped the ramp up of work with new logos and the contribution of acquisitions made in Q4 2018.Our Communications, Media and Technology segment grew 10.6% year-over-year in constant currency. In Technology, growth was driven by revenue from recent acquisitions and demand for our digital engineering services, partly offset by slowing demand for content services. As Brian mentioned, we have decided to exit certain types of content work within our digital operations practice but is not in line with our long-term strategic vision for the company. I will provide some more color on the impact of this to our Communications, Media and Tech practice as well as the overall company in a few minutes.Turning to geos, Europe grew 8.8% year-over-year in constant currency, reflecting weakness in the UK from macroeconomic uncertainty. In Continental Europe, we saw strength in Life Sciences, driven in part by our Zenith acquisition. While a few of our larger banking relationships in Europe remained under pressure. We did see good growth in several of our newer logos including the partnership with three finished financial institutions.The Rest of World grew 11.1% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strong growth in Products and Resources, Insurance and CMT that was partially offset by softness in banking, driven by the weakness with several of our large clients. Over the coming years, there's a significant opportunity to gain further market share within Europe as well as the Rest of World. And we intend to increase investments in these markets in the coming quarters.Turning to margins, our GAAP operating margins and diluted EPS were 15.7% and $0.90 respectfully. Adjusted operating margins which excludes realignment charges was 17.3% and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08 in the third quarter. While up by 120 basis points from Q2, our adjusted operating margin was down 120 basis points year-over-year, below our expectations primarily due to employee compensation and benefit costs outpacing revenue growth and the ongoing dispute with a large healthcare client which negatively impacted operating margins by 40 basis points.These headwinds were partially offset by the impact of lower incentive-based compensation and cost savings realized as a result of the targeted actions at the senior levels of our pyramid to simplify our org structure that we took in Q2 and Q3. The cumulative savings from actions taken in Q2 and Q3 are now expected to result in annualized savings of over $100 million with approximately $50 million realized in 2019.However, we have more work to do to right-size our cost structure and are not satisfied with the amount of cost reduction achieved in the quarter as we did not achieve our full potential around pricing levers, aligning bill rates with promotions and pyramid optimization.Also, we experienced a longer than previously anticipated timeline to align revenue and headcount growth as we continue to hire and reskill our workforce to be better positioned to capture digital demand in the market. Attracting and retaining our talent is a key factor to our long-term success. While reduction of our attrition rate currently running at 24% annualized remains a long-term goal, we do expect this rate to remain elevated for the next few quarters as we undergo this transformation.Turning to our balance sheet, our cash and short-term investment balance as of September 30, stood at $3.1 billion, up approximately $75 million from June 30, to down $1.4 billion from December 31, reflecting over $2 billion of share repurchases completed year-to-date and approximately $380 million deployed on acquisitions. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $419 million related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department.We generated $620 million of free cash flow in the quarter. DSO of 78 days was down slightly sequentially but up two days year-over-year, which negatively impacted free cash flow by approximately $100 million. This was primarily due to the customer dispute I referenced earlier. Our outstanding debt balance was $747 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver.During the third quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for approximately $219 million and our diluted share count decreased to 551 million shares for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased over 31 million shares for approximately $2 billion. As of September 30, we have 519 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.Through our cash generated from operations, remaining cash on the balance sheet and our revolving credit facility, we continue to have access to plenty of liquidity to fund both our existing capital return program as well as future acquisitions.Before I turn to guidance, let me provide an update on the outcomes of our transformation office including the 2020 Fit for Growth Plan that we announced this afternoon as well as the content work that we intend to exit. As Brian highlighted, we are moving rapidly to implement the key initiatives identified by the transformation office aimed at accelerating our revenue growth.Our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan is expected to run for two years. This program is designed to simplify the way we work, reduce our cost structure and fund investments in the business which will enable growth. As part of this plan, we expect to remove 10,000 to 12,000 mid to senior level associates from their current roles. We will make every effort to identify productive roles based on client demand and our model assumes that approximately 5,000 associates will have the opportunity to reskill for new sales or delivery roles within the company.We expect the remaining 5,000 to 7,000 associates to exit the company by mid-2020 either through attrition or role elimination. As Brian said, anytime we make decisions that impact our employees, we take it very seriously. We believe these actions are critical for the long-term health and competitiveness of the company. We expect the charges will also include charges related to optimizing our real estate portfolio. These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2020 and will result in annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in year 2021.While we will begin the execution of the plan in Q4, we do not expect the material savings impact in the fourth quarter. These cost reduction activities will be occurring at the same time that we accelerate investments in sales resources, branding, talent, reskilling and lean and automation enhancements across the company and further investments in our four key digital battlegrounds including M&A.These actions are an important step to building a strong foundation to support our future growth ambitions and success in our chosen digital battlegrounds. Our commitment to all associates during this time of transition is to ensure that we preserve the qualities, value, then culture that make Cognizant a great company for employees and clients alike.Additionally, as Brian mentioned, we have determined that certain content work within our digital operations practice is not in line with our long-term strategic vision for the company. And we intend to exit this work over the course of the next one to two years. This transition is expected to impact approximately 6,000 associates around the world. In addition to continuing to meet our contractual obligations during this period, we will ensure that our associates are treated fairly and with the respect that they deserve.In the months ahead, we will work with our partners to explore ways to transition the work and roles to alternative vendors and we'll provide impacted associates with a number of transition assistance programs including retention bonuses, severance packages and the opportunity to participate in various reskilling programs.While the exact timing for the completion of this transition is uncertain, we do expect there to be a small impact to revenue within the CMT practice in the fourth quarter. And as a result of this decision, we estimate that we may lose revenues of between $240 million to $270 million on an annualized basis within our Communications, Media and Technology segment.We anticipate revenues will ramp down over the next one to two years and therefore the impact on 2020 revenues may be lower than the expected annualized run rate. This is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted operating margin subject to the timing of the ramp down and other factors. We expect to incur a wind down charge related to the transition of these associates and any related assets such as real estate and equipment.The total expected charges associated with this Fit for Growth cost transformation plan, including the wind down of certain content work is expected to be in the range of approximately $150 million to $200 million. We will provide a more detailed update regarding the phasing of the impact when we provide our 2020 guidance on our Q4 call.I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 4.6% to 4.9% year-over-year to $16.75 billion to $16.9 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth within the range of 3.5% to 3.8% to $16.7 billion to $16.74 billion on a reported basis, reflecting our assumption of a negative 110 basis points for foreign exchange for the full year.This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for Banking and Healthcare. This implies fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 2.1% to 3.1% year-over-year to $4.21 billion to $4.25 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth in the range of 1.7% to 2.7% year-over-year to $4.2 billion to $4.24 billion on a reported basis, reflecting our assumption of a negative 40 basis points for foreign exchange in the fourth quarter.This outlook reflects our expectation for slower organic revenue growth in Q4 as a result of a more cautious macro outlook in the UK and continued headwinds in Financial Services and Healthcare and the impact of exiting certain content work. For the full year 2019, we now expect adjusted operating margins to be between 16.5% and 17%, reflecting Q3 actual and the longer than previously anticipated timeline to normalize the revenue growth and headcount trajectory and additional costs from recent acquisitions. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.95 to $3.98.This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 560 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes realignment charges, charges under our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan and other unusual items, if any; net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, clarification, if any, by the Indian government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India Defined Contribution Obligation and the tax effects of the above adjustments.In the context of the Fit for Growth Plan we announced today, we are targeting adjusted operating margins in 2020 to be in the range of 16% to 17%. While the cost program outlined today coupled with annualized savings from Q2 and Q3 will increase margin rates. This increase is being mitigated in the near future by two major things. First, our full year fiscal 2019 margin rate reflects lower incentive compensation payouts given our underperformance versus target.Our goal in 2020 is to perform at plan and therefore have target payouts to be a normalized part of our cost structure in line with company performance. This is a margin rate headwind of 120 basis points year-over-year that we plan to absorb. We are investing meaningfully in a number of areas including revenue generating resources, Cognizant Academy, tooling and automation and marketing and branding. These important investments will help us accelerate growth rates. However, in the short-term, they negatively impact margins by approximately 150 basis points.With that, we can open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good afternoon and thanks for going through all this. That's fantastic. Brian, I'd like to double click on one of the investment areas in sales and marketing, clearly, one of the most critical areas to reaccelerating top line growth. You mentioned a few things, the 500 new salespeople, the return to the two-in-a-box model. Can you provide maybe a more holistic view of the major changes you're planning to make to Cognizant's sales strategy and sales coverage and overall go-to-market model? Thank you. Brian Humphries : Yes, hi Lisa. So I'll give you four examples. First of all, it's important to clarify to roll up the client partner and returning to two-in-a-box, I think really simplifies Cognizant's go-to-market team in front of the customer. So we traditionally used to have two-in-a-box of client partner and delivery partner. A few years ago, we moved to three-in-a-box and we were returning to what we traditionally have had with greater clarity of roles and responsibilities.Therefore, between the client partner and the new role that we will term an engagement delivery partner. Second point, we will actually add more headcount in sales or the commercial function than before. I've referenced this in our prior call. We are adding approximately 500 headcounts. Not all of those are quota carrying, but some for instance will be business finance people or indeed commercial lawyers, but it's all with a view to helping us show up to more clients and have greater agility and for the clients with greater responsibility.The third major thing relates to how we want to compensate our commercial teams. As of January 1, we will move to a more leveraged sales compensation plan with at least 70% of the base fixed or at most and then 30% variable. And within the variable portion of their compensation, there will be strict parameters in terms of what they are required to sell that will enable us to ensure that people do not follow the path of least resistance, which is what they sold yesterday, but more readily embraced the things that we need them to sell, which is part of our digital strategy.And then the fourth thing we will deploy something we spend a lot of time working on the last four months, what I call a RAD model. That is a term to address how you think about sales segmentation in the purest form, how you tier customers, Tier 1, 2 and 3 based not just on what you sell them today but more readily on what you have the potential to sell them on.So potential versus current and then you tier customers between an existing customer or that you want to retain or potentially develop subject to your share of wallet or a customer that you want to acquire. And according to where a customer sits in that nine box, then the degree of sales coverage that they get or visits from somebody like myself changes.So those are four examples of what we're doing to try to ramp our commercial momentum. Obviously in addition to that, I've talked previously about greater alignment with strategic partners. I referenced in today's script the notion of going to market more readily with hyperscale players, but we have some tremendous partners in industry verticals like Temenos, Guidewire, Adobe and the like that we want to embrace further and make sure we go-to-market with together. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Edward Caso : Hi, good evening. Thank you for all the detail. Could you flesh out a little bit more of the commentary around \u2013 it sounded like an inability to get pricing and it is \u2013 is that going to take time for the sales organization to get going and the workforce to be sort of calibrated here? I mean, sort of when do you think you can get those \u2013 start to get some of the pricing for the value that you're hoping to give? Brian Humphries : That's inherently a complex topic because we have a series of activities that we have from time and materials staff augmentation through to managed services or more fixed price type bids. But let me decompose your question down and Karen, perhaps you can comment as well on this.With regards to the sales teams, their ability to ramp ultimately also depends on where they've come from before and if they know the client itself or if they know the industry. Our intent is of course to hire people who are able to sell business outcomes, who have the gravitas and the wherewithal to speak with the C-suites, understand the industry pain points and sell a business outcome.So you need to expect them to last. However, as we deploy these salespeople and for the clients, they build relationships subsequently build a pipeline, the pipeline is ultimately progress and eventually turns into TCV, which later turns into revenue. For that reason that we spoken previously around the impact of these 500 headcount that we've agreed to hire, it's more a negative impact in terms of our cost structure into short-term.However, I don't view it as a cost. I viewed as a investment that will have an appropriate return over time in the form of sales force gearing. So OpEx to gross margin dollars or indeed OpEx to revenue dollars and we are anticipating the revenue return from that to really kick in more in Q4 next year or indeed the first half of FY2021.Look, the pricing dynamics are important. Karen can comment on those. I just wanted to add one point. If the client partner is the quarterback on a deal, they need to be surrounded with world-class experts that are aligned to a key practices and have competencies in those areas, whether that is artificial intelligence or analytics or digital engineering or cloud or otherwise.We spend a great deal of time in recent months honing in on the model that we think will give us greater competency and greater technical capability to support a generalist client partner in front of the client. We do want to allocate more pricing power back to the client partner, but they will have to operate within certain bands or parameters as the deals are pricing on a quarterly basis. We will review those, that it will be some notions of checks and balances. Karen McLoughlin : Sure. And so let me talk about a couple of things in pricing. One is what I would call market bill rates and pricing for new deals and renewals and so forth. If you look at the digital business, pricing continues to be very strong there. Obviously, you have a high demand in that business and the short supply of talent. So by definition bill rates continued to be strong there, where you do continue to see pressure on deals and particularly with renewals and vendor consolidations and so forth.It's in the core part of the business, the heritage application maintenance, et cetera, part of the business where we do continue to see pricing pressure on those transactions. The other piece which we are referring to in the script is also around, what I would call contract hygiene. So the ability to get COLA increases, to get rolling changes when we promote people.As you know for several years that was something that just was not commonly done in the industry. And it's something that many firms have started to reinitiate into their portfolio over the last few years. We've made some progress this year where we have automated COLA adjustments and so forth, but I think we still have a lot of opportunity to continue to get better at that and enforcing contract terms. And in particular, when we promote people to either rotate them into new opportunities that are appropriate for their new level or to get rate adjustments within their existing clients, so both of those are opportunities that we continue to see as we move forward. Edward Caso : Thank you. The next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much and appreciate all the detail here. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the cost, the soft cost, the hard cost to attain the $500 million to $550 million in savings from Fit for Growth. How much disruption might there be on both culture and then also on the revenues, aside from the 250 that you called out from getting out of the content work? Brian Humphries : I would say, the majority of the people we're targeting through this exercise are senior to mid-level executives. They tend to be not declined partners in front of clients, but some degree of middle management that has crept into the system over the years. Of course, we're spending a huge amount of time bringing our team through these changes and making sure that they are contextualized and that people know we are investing in growth.To be honest, I feel as though there's a degree of swagger coming back in Cognizant these days. Client partners, in my opinion, will be delighted with the news today that we are returning to a two-in-a-box model. And they do appreciate the fact that we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to reinvest back into the business, including more coverage and giving the sales folks an opportunity to earn more than ever before via having a more leveraged sales compensation plan.Of course, that is not for everybody and there will be some degree of disruption. But we aim to mitigate that as best we can. And as I said, not only we are adding more people in deploying segmentation, but we're also honing in on optimization of skills via competency model that will be measured on a more thorough basis going forward. So look, it's very hard to control this. It's a people business. We're spending a huge amount of time communicating, contextualizing but we feel it's the right thing to do. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a clarification. The question, Karen, the clarification, just to be clear on the content ops is whatever we think the normalized run rate for Cognizant in 2020, we should go ahead and take an additional amount out from our revenue expectations of, I don't know, $150 million or something. As we assumed that content ops gets at least partially taken out next year.And then my question is directed to Brian. Brian, you talked about swagger in the last comment. And on the last conference call, I think you said win rates had gone up, but I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about what you see as the economic backdrop. A number of companies, the IT services side have called out some incremental weakness, but juxtapose that against what you've seen in your time there. I think frankly, putting a lot more initiative into the sales side, if you could talk about a little bit about your win rates and how those might bounce out. Thanks very much. Karen McLoughlin : So Keith, it's Karen. Let me just cover off on the content situation. First, you're right. As you think about the model for next year, it is appropriate to take some portion of our estimate of the 240 to 270. As we said, it will not \u2013 we don't expect it at this point to all go away at the beginning of the year. We think that we'll phase in throughout the year, although I would say it would be more heavily weighted to the first part of the year.The other thing I would also like to find out what that range is that it does assume that in certain of the client's situations that they may exit more than just this specific digital operations work, that they may choose to transition more work. So this is our best estimate at this time of what we think the annualized impact would be. And obviously, we'll provide as much color as we can as we understand further the transition plans. Brian Humphries : And Keith, with regards to the second question, yes, of course, it didn't go unnoticed with us as well, but we're delighted to have beaten consensus and indeed our guidance for this quarter. But bear in mind, we had set guidance prudently and we're also walking into the coming quarter having read the dynamics in the industry. So we remained somewhat I would say prudent going into this quarter as well. The backdrop is uncertain.However, I would say, if I look at the micro element within Cognizant. First of all, growth is permeating the company. We're going back to our roots, is back to basics and I think people are actually delighted with that. We found appreciation of focusing on growth as opposed to margin rate. We have very deliberately insisted on a significant uptake in executive presence with customers, I'm leading by example myself. And that permeates the organization as well. And then of course, Karen and I have been working on what we announced today for a number of months now.And so we've been trying to start looking at deals, not with today's cost structure but envisaging the economic value of deals over time with tomorrow's cost structure, which as you know, we're aiming to reduce and we know in Cognizant that once we get our foot in the door with clients, because we have confidence in our teams and confidence in our delivery, we tend to land and expand. And hence that\u2019s also the reason we're deploying the RAD model going forward to make sure we accelerate new logos and cross sell and upsell.So, those are the positives, but again, the backdrop is uncertain. Certainly in the UK it's an uncertain, I would say in North America, what we found is there is continued compression in legacy businesses and pricing pressure under renewals continues at a steady rate, but the digital imperatives remain key.I've been pleasantly surprised as I've dealt with C-suite executives throughout the world, that digital is certainly not viewed as a cost center expense. It is very much viewed as a critical enabler both on the defense as well as on the offense for these companies to disrupt or indeed to avoid being disrupted by more nimble next generation companies. And that is an area where on the contrary I do not see demand constraints. I see more supply constraints given the nature of the teams we need to fulfill those demands. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi Group. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hi Brian. Hi Karen. It's good to see the velocity on Fit for Growth initiatives. I want to start by asking if you could provide maybe a framework for how investors should think of the trajectory of growth over the next couple of years as these initiatives unfold. I mean, will we see perhaps a flattish type pace before higher growth kicks in. And that's I guess including the impact of the CMT the content ops. And then in the meantime, what are your thoughts on providing metrics to the investor community that help us if you are on the right track? Karen McLoughlin : So Ashwin in terms of growth, I think obviously, it's early to give guidance for next year although certainly we would expect that we will start to see some acceleration over versus constant currency organic growth this year. Q4 is obviously a little bit light and Q1 does tend to be a slower quarter for us. So when we give guidance in February, we'll have a little bit more color on how we see the rest of the year playing out in terms of incremental revenue from the sales hires and so forth.We I think as we had talked about this before, we do not anticipate any significant revenue next year from that investment. It really takes about 12 months for the sales teams to ramp-up and actually generate a revenue that becomes incremental to us. So I think that would be more back ended and certainly into 2021. And now all of that obviously excludes the impact of the content, moderate content work in the digital operations practice. But excluding that, that's how we would expect it to play out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Thanks. On the $500 million to $550 million of gross annualized savings, what's the net savings there? Because it sounds like there's a drag from investments on adjusted operating margins in fiscal year 2020, but can we expect a positive impact of margins there after in fiscal year 2021. I\u2019m just wondering if there might be some one-time investments in fiscal year 2020 that go away so that fiscal 2021 and beyond we'll see some net drop to the bottom line. Karen McLoughlin : Yes. So I think, obviously Bryan as we\u2019ve said, and as you heard on the call we were assuming a target range of 16% to 17% next year, roughly in-line with 2019. As we talked about on the call, there is about a 120 basis points that we have to make up given the lower incentive-based compensation this year. And then on top of that, the investments in sales and training and so forth.I think it's premature obviously to give guidance beyond 2020, but certainly, we think the investments we'll make in sales will start to pay off in 2021. I would anticipate that certainly the investments that we're making in branding and training and rescaling and so forth, and those will continue on for quite some time. I think we think that perhaps those are areas that we've under invested in recently and so those will become part of the core of the organization going forward. But certainly, this is still a relatively linear business. So as we look to accelerate revenue growth in the future, that should certainly help to stabilize and provide some margin opportunity depending year to year on the investments that we want to make in the business. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Rod Bourgeois : Hey guys. Hey, a lot of work done here in seven months. If I go back over Cognizant's history, it's had a distinctive ability to mine its large clients for additional revenues. Clearly that client mining performance has slowed in recent years. And so my question here is whether you're seeing ways to rejuvenate Cognizant's client mining ability. Are there corrective measures being made or new initiatives specifically on the front for client mining? The RAD model makes a ton of sense here, but I'm also wondering if there are practical changes beyond the RAD model to better connect with the large clients. Brian Humphries : Yes. So, hi rod. It's a good question and look, if I look back over the last four years and the data will tell you that we have been growing new logos but not really accelerating new logo revenue and really the pipeline and the TCV in the last 18 months or so, stop this year performing where we needed it to be. But the bigger issue was to your point, the install base accounts and we had stopped mining or upselling and on the contrary because of pricing erosion at the time of renewals that became a little bit of a drag on the business.So very much at the core of the RAD model is of course hearing customers, make some potential, not based on where we are today. And of course segmenting customers than between acquisition customers versus a customer that you already exist in that you want to develop or where you already exist that you're simply trying to retain.So the RAD model was key to achieving this. Sales compensation is also key because in our existing accounts, what we want to do is get much more leverage in the sales compensation program and put parameters into portion of people's compensation such that they are not just enticed but they're also obligated from their earnings point of view to cross-sell the portfolio into digital and beyond as opposed to simply selling what they sold yesterday, which has traditionally been a path of least resistance.And then the third thing of course, as we're thinking about upselling and cross selling, a lot of that leads to different decision makers. It's more project based, it's more pod cultures in digital engineering. It's line of service. So, distinctively changing out some client partners, we've done a good job on that in some of the accounts I've seen for us in the last few months.These are client partners that joined Cognizant in the last year or so, or 18 months, a different background, a different compensation model. But again, I don't think about the salary of a salesperson as a cost. I think about it as an investment and therefore I think about it in terms of sales gearing both on a gross margin level versus OpEx or indeed on revenue basis versus OpEx.And then last but not least, we were really trying to segment our own capabilities into a four box great sellers who understand the industry and understand the technology is in the top right hand quadrant. You also have a bunch of people who are very competent with technology but not really sellers. Some of those you can migrate across to more commercial skills. Some of them will simply remain presales types oriented, presales oriented people.Some people are frankly great sellers but don't really understand the industry well enough or the customer pain points. We obviously have to educate them and then the people in the bottom left that are the worst of both worlds, not particularly good commercial skills in terms of getting a PO signed but certainly not technical either. Those are the people that most likely you'll see exit the company going forward, particularly in a sales comp plan where with a higher variable portion of compensation they will not be earning as much as they have been previously.And then one of the final actions we've taken to ensure cross selling is to put all of these so-called CSE's. These are our more specialists salespeople aligned into the practice and service lines to ensure a great deal of focus on competency assessments, certifications, and then need alignment with our partners that intersect nonetheless with verticals to make sure we have the right skill sets and indeed the right go to market partnerships to do QBR with more of our partners and make sure we end up with asymmetrical accounts where clients can, our partners can bring us into their accounts and vice versa. We can bring them into ours and leverage the best of both worlds. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Thank you. First I just wanted to clarify on the content ops, is there an opportunity to sell this practice or is this more so a wind down and transfer and then within banking and healthcare, can you just give us a sense on these large clients how close you may be to seeing any inflection in the trajectory there or at what point are they just not among the top clients? Brian Humphries : So I think in banking and healthcare we have some tremendous examples actually and I've seen some of these myself have accounts that we have really turned around in the last two years through different account teams, much more focused on digital. But that's a blueprint or a qualification that we need to bring more broadly across the company. You will see some inflection points, particularly in healthcare as we get into FY20, because we will be rounding the tougher compares.As you know, many of our healthcare clients for in particular merged into two and ended up with a very different rate dynamic for Cognizant. And we will be running that once we get to Q1 next year. In banking it's less obvious in the sense there wasn't a single inflection point or ongoing trends, some captives, some insourcing, particularly in a world of DevOps.But as I said earlier, well the legacy business or traditional areas of the business have been under some pressure of price renewals. I do see opportunity for us to better participate in a digital spend that these banks have at their disposal and have been prioritizing and that's what we're setting out to achieve in the coming years, of course.So no major inflection point, but I will say I am pleased with the revised energy I'm seeing in the North America team now in particular and the new banking leader and a new healthcare leader they seem to be going down well with clients. And that's always a good positive leading indicator.With regards to the content moderation business that's something we're working with our partners on right now to understand how to best transition the work. Whether it is one of the options or reference or another, we will determine that in the coming periods. For now, we've taken a restructuring charge against it, but our intention is to work very aggressively with partners to make sure that we can transition our employees with minimal disruption. And of course, financial consequence of that is of course minimal charges as well. Katie Royce : Okay. And this is Katie. I think with that, that will end today's call. Thank you all for your questions and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Cognizant Technology Solutions third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.And I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Katie. Katie Royce : Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the Company's fourth quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody.As I stated on prior calls, Cognizant is in the midst of a multi-year project, whose aim is to re-position the Company to realize its full growth potential. And today, I'd like to briefly cover our Q4 performance and then turn our attention to 2020.After a challenging start to 2019, we're seeing higher levels of engagement from our leaders and optimism as we rally behind client centricity and revenue growth. We're making progress, but there is more work to do in the quarters ahead.Q4 revenue grew 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency, or $4.28 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.07 and we delivered strong cash flow. Macro demand remains stable, but challenging. There is a distinction between traditional work versus digital. Legacy services are subject to meaningful pricing pressure at renewals, competition and indeed in-sourcing.Meanwhile, clients continue to invest in digital to become modern, data enabled, customer centric and differentiated businesses. These trends are set to continue to our strategic posture and operational and financial initiatives are aligned to address this market reality.On a geographic basis, Q4 revenue in North America grew 3.1% year-over-year, while revenue in our growth markets region grew 7.4% in constant currency. In both geographies, we are determined to accelerate growth, but the opportunity is especially significant in our international business where we remain under-penetrated and we must do better.From an industry segment view, in Q4, our Financial Services global revenue grew 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Both banking and insurance were weak throughout 2019. Full-year insurance revenue growth slowed primarily due to a modest decline in North America, albeit with a return in the second half of the year, where we saw growth in Q3 and indeed Q4 year-over-year.In banking, we continued to see particular weakness in capital markets and commercial banking, offset by growth in payments and retail, with retail having benefited from the Samlink deal. Both global accounts and local accounts declined for the full-year.North America performance, while still declining, has been improving throughout the year, and we see that trend continuing. Europe remains weak, with some macro uncertainty and some Cognizant specific issues.In Healthcare, we reversed two quarters of decline, with constant currency growth of 1.8% year-over-year. I remain pleased with our performance in life sciences, which delivered double-digit growth.However, this was offset by ongoing declines in our Healthcare vertical, which continues to be impacted by contract renegotiations at some of our largest clients following industry consolidation and by in-sourcing at a large client.Our other two segments Products & Resources and Communications, Media & Technology, posted high-single digit revenue growth in constant currency year-over-year. Down from double-digit in prior quarters.Revenue growth in the Technology segment slowed meaningfully in the quarter following our recent announcement to exit a subset of this content services business over the coming quarters. Later in our call, Karen will take you through the details of the quarter.Let's now turn to 2020, including executing the recommendations that the transformation office as they relate to strategy, operating and commercial model, our cost base and more. We enter 2020 with a two-pronged strategy that aims to expose Cognizant to faster growing market categories.The first element is to protect and optimize our core business while scaling internationally. The second part is to invest to compete and win in four key digital battlegrounds; data, digital engineering, cloud and IoT. Our strategy leverages our technology services heritage whilst accelerating our position in digital where our brand recognition and commercial momentum can improve.The strategy resonates well with our clients who've always cited our strength in the run and operations side, who want us to further strengthen our digital portfolio to assist them in their innovation agenda.We're determined to help our clients become fully digital, data enabled, customer-centric businesses. We will continue to use M&A to execute this strategy. This week, we announced two acquisitions focused on expanding our cloud capabilities.On Monday, we announced the acquisition of Code Zero Consulting, a firm that specializes in helping companies digitally transform by providing strategy, implementation and migration capabilities to evolve legacy systems to cloud-based configure price quote and billing systems.And earlier today, we announced that we've entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire the French operations of EI Technologies, a Paris-based, privately-held digital technology consulting firm. Cloud has changed the way that IT is delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms, and both of these acquisitions are Salesforce Platinum Partners and will help us build upon one of our most strategic and fastest growing practices. In addition, in Q4, we closed our previously announced acquisition of Contino, a leading consultancy that specializes in enterprise DevOps methodologies and advanced data platforms.The transformation office also recommended changes to our operating and commercial model. After months of detailed analysis, on January 1, we implemented a series of measures to accelerate our commercial momentum as part of our sales transformation initiative.These include a new customer segmentation that prioritizes account and ensures we get the right resources, underwrite account at the right time, new sales compensation plans that reward overperformance, encourage greater up-sell and cross-sell in our existing accounts, and increase our focus on new logos, and the alignment of our specialist sales team to our service line to increase our subject matter expertise by key practices.To-date, I'm pleased with what we've seen in our sales force initiative. We have renewed energy and our win rates continue to improve. Our previously announced hiring of 500 revenue generating associates is on track, and in line with modeled assumption. In addition to these 500, we plan to double the number of associates supporting our more strategic alliances, with all three leading hyperscale companies and SaaS vendors.Complementing these commercial changes, our recently appointed Chief Marketing Officer has been working diligently to better align our marketing spend to a growth priority. This includes, strengthening our point of view by industry segments, including targeting the account-based marketing and digitizing our customer engagement strategy. Our marketing spend will increase in 2020 as we aim to support our revenue aspiration and better position Cognizant as a leader in digital.In parallel, we've also worked to simplify the organization, empowering our client partners with speed of execution and account P&L ownership, and clarifying responsibilities and decision rights for all roles across the sales lifecycle. To ensure we have the right digital skills in a supply constrained environment, we doubled our investments in Cognizant Academy in 2020 to reskill and redeploy talent towards our digital imperative. To accelerate our digital momentum, we believe we need to hire or reskill approximately 25,000 resources in 2020 alone and we started to operationalize it.Finally, as we make these investments in automation, training, marketing and sales, we've been diligently reducing our cost structure to ensure we can be fit for growth. Karen will bring you through the details of our restructuring program later in the call.Engagement and confidence are essential in a people business. Therefore, we have been energetically communicating and contextualizing the reasons for the changes we're going through and engaging the organization to rally everyone behind our goalI'm pleased to see the mood in the Company continue to pick up, both at an executive level and throughout the broader organization. Our annualized attrition rate fell 3 points sequentially to 21%. Some of this can be accounted for by normal seasonality, but the fact that voluntary attrition rates declined year-over-year is actually even more encouraging. Of course, as we execute our restructuring program, we will remain diligent and stay focused on increasing employee engagement and reducing attrition.We also recognize that we need to rally the organization behind a common purpose that goes beyond financial return. We've, therefore, spent a great deal of time in recent months defining a compelling Company purpose statement, which will serve as our North Star that guides and inspires us to make the right strategic move in the years ahead. We've also refined our Company's values and behaviors that define what will be celebrated and tolerated. We will unveil this to the broader organization in the coming months.We determine to stay true to the heart and soul of our Company. And having recently attended our Annual Global Planning Summit, one held in Dallas the other in Dubai, where the executive team and I spoke to thousands of associates about the Company's strategy and expectations for 2020, I can tell you that I came away from these summits filled with optimism about our collective ability to move the Company forward.Let me conclude by saying that after a challenging first quarter, we've become a more focused, determined and confident Company as we move through 2019. There's a great deal of urgency in Cognizant these days. It starts with me. Any distractions we've had are now behind us. Our team is energized with the clarity of our strategy, the magnitude of the market opportunity, our renewed client centricity and our increased employee value proposition focus.While our hard work in the past year will serve us well in 2020, there remains some important areas that require progress in the years ahead. Pricing in our heritage business continues to pressure gross margins. We have efforts underway to address renewal pricing strategy as well as our cost of delivery efficiency, including pyramid management, automation and other measures.Meanwhile, as more work shifts to project-based digital engagements, we are implementing refinements in our digital pricing strategy and continuing to optimize resource planning and allocation.The leadership team and I are fully aware that we have a multi-year project ahead of us, and we are united in our resolve to work with rigor and tenacity to achieve our goals and once again, make Cognizant the industry bellwether.Before I turn the call over to Karen, I want to acknowledge the Cognizant Co-founder, former CEO and long-time Director, Frank D'Souza, has let us know if his plan to resign from Cognizant Board of Directors effective March 31.Along with his remarkable track record of success as Cognizant's CEO for a dozen years, Frank has served with distinction on Cognizant's Board since 2007 and Vice Chairman since June 30, 2019. On behalf of the entire Board, I want to extend their deep gratitude to Frank for his pioneering leadership and quarter century of dedication to Cognizant.Today, we also announced that Vinita Bali will be joining our Board of Directors later this month. I look forward to her contributions and partnership.With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will give you an update on our operational and financial performance, as well as a view of how we see the year ahead. Karen? Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.For the full-year 2019, revenue increased to $16.8 billion and represented growth of 4.1% year-over-year, or 5.2% in constant currency. Fourth quarter revenue of $4.3 billion was above the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 3.8% year-over-year, or 4.2% in constant currency.The revenue out-performance versus guidance was broad-based across our industries. Digital revenue continues to grow above 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 38% of total revenues for the quarter.Moving to the industry verticals, Financial Services growth was up 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven primarily by insurance. However, the project-based work that we benefited from in Q3, did not extend in the Q4.We saw a modest slowdown in Banking sequentially, reflecting typical year end seasonality and furloughs. As Brian mentioned within Banking our performance continues to be negatively impacted by a few of our global accounts, as well as some slowness in certain regional and other clients.While macro uncertainty persists, we expect budgets within Banking to be broadly stable in 2020, with North American banks better positioned relative to UK and Continental Europe given continued Brexit uncertainty and our ongoing challenges with a few of our largest accounts.Against that backdrop, we continue to have a muted outlook for Banking. However, we are confident in the initial steps our new Head of Banking has taken to re-position us for growth. We expect this client centricity to drive deeper and more robust account planning and marketing.By partnering well with digital business to ensure we increase our relevance to banks, we have also implemented a solutions team to bring ease of repeatability, ensure we develop more compelling thought leadership and better align with key partners.Moving on to Healthcare, which returned to year-over-year growth up 1.8% in constant currency. Life sciences again grew strong double digits year-over-year benefiting from demand within digital operations and the contribution of Zenith Technologies.Additionally, we see continued momentum within our industry specific platform solutions such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials, which has users in over 80 countries across 14,000 facilities covering over 400 active trials.Within our Healthcare vertical, revenue declined mid-single-digits year-over-year as performance continues to be impacted primarily by large clients involved in mergers and the continued shift of work to the captive at a large client.We expect similar year-over-year trends in Healthcare in Q1 and improvement in the year-over-year trends in the Healthcare vertical beginning in Q2 as we lap the headwinds that impacted the business in 2019.We expect continued cautious spend with healthcare payers, as we approach the elections in the US later this year, and so we're maintaining a cautious growth outlook for the Healthcare vertical.Products & Resources grew 8.6% year-over-year in constant currency. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the expected slower growth on a year-over-year basis in Products & Resources in the fourth quarter as we lapped the ramp up of work with new logos and the contribution of acquisitions made in Q4 2018.We were pleased that the growth in the quarter continued to be broad based growth across our industries. Results reflect demand for core modernization services of enterprise applications, and for digital engineering, cloud and IoT solutions. And we expect these trends to continue in 2020.Our Communications, Media & Technology segment grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency, where we saw an acceleration in the Communications and Media vertical driven by an increase in demand for services in core modernization and cloud transformation services. We expect to continued solid performance of telecom clients as traditional telco companies look to transform into digital service providers.Additionally, we see convergence across media and communications companies driving investments in technologies and services and hyper personalized consumption and create new and engaging experiences for consumers.In Technology, growth was negatively impacted by our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. This negatively impacted the year-over-year growth of the CMT segment by approximately 200 basis points, or $11 million. I'll provide more color on the expected impact from our decision to exit certain parts of the content services business in my Q1 and full-year 2020 guidance.Now, turning to geos. We were disappointed with growth in Europe, which grew 5.3% year-over-year in constant currency, reflecting a slowdown in both the UK and Continental Europe. A more cautious macro environment continues to weigh on spend across industries in the UK, while we also have some Cognizant specific challenges in a few large banking clients.The rest of world grew 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency, the strongest performance in seven quarters. While our global banking relationships continue to pressure growth in Asia-Pacific, we have seen improved traction in countries such as Australia and Japan in insurance and life sciences.Moving on to margins, in Q4, our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 14.6% and $0.72, respectively. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring charges, was 17% and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.07.Before getting into more details on margins, I want to provide an update on the enactment of a new tax regime in India that enables domestic companies who elect to be taxed at an income tax rate of 25% compared to the current rate of 35%. The company electing into the lower rate is required to forego any tax holidays associated with the special economic zones and certain other tax incentives, including MAT credit carry-forward.Our current intent is to elect into the lower rate once our existing MAT assets are substantially utilized. As a result, we recorded a one-time net income tax expense of $21 million due to the revaluations to the lower income tax rate of our existing India net deferred income tax asset. This had a negative $0.04 impact on GAAP EPS in the quarter.Our adjusted operating margin was flat year-over-year, reflecting SG&A discipline, offset by continued pressure on gross margins, including a $25 million write-off of certain capitalized set up costs for a large healthcare customer. The write-off negatively impacted gross margins by 50 basis points and EPS by $0.04.Over the last several quarters we have taken steps to start to right size our cost structure, primarily focused on reducing overhead in the business, with those benefits evident in the year-over-year improvement in SG&A.These savings are necessary to fund the planned additional investments in areas such as sales resources, branding, talent and lean and automation enhancements across the Company.However, gross margins declined year-over-year as we continue to face pricing pressure in the legacy parts of our business that require us to take additional actions in 2020 around pyramid optimizations and pricing levers such as COLA and aligning bill rates with promotions.We expect our 2020 Fit For Growth Plan that we announced last quarter to drive improvements in these areas. I'll provide an update on the actions taken in Q4 under the 2020 Fit For Growth Plan as well as additional details on the expected execution of this plan later in the call.Turning to our balance sheet, our cash and short-term investment balance as of December 31, stood at $3.4 billion, up approximately $315 million from September 30, but down $1.1 billion from the year ago period, reflecting the over $2.2 billion of share repurchases completed in 2019 and approximately $620 million deployed on acquisitions.As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $414 million related to the ongoing dispute with the India Income Tax department.We generated $845 million of free cash flow in the quarter and DSO of 73 days improved 3 days sequentially due to strong collections. On a year-over-year basis DSO improved by 1 day. In the fourth quarter, we made a change to our accounting policy related to DSOs to better align with industry practice and better reflect the amounts due from our customers on our balance sheet.Beginning in Q4, we started to net certain amounts due to customers such as discounts and rebates with trade accounts receivable rather than reflecting those amounts as a liability on our balance sheet. This change does not have any impact on our operating results or cash flows.Our outstanding debt balance was $738 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for approximately $150 million and our diluted share count decreased to 548 million shares for the quarter. In 2019, we repurchased over 34 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion.Today, we are announcing a 10% increase to our quarterly cash dividend, the second increase since we initiated the dividend in 2017. Additionally, the Board has approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization.Before I turn to guidance, let me provide an update on the progress of the 2020 Fit For Growth Plan as well as the content work that we are in the process of exiting. Our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan is expected to run for two years. This program is designed to simplify the way we work, improve our cost structure and fund investments aimed at accelerating our revenue growth.As previously announced, we expect to remove 10,000 to 12,000 mid-to-senior level associates from their current roles. We will make every effort to identify productive roles based on client demand and continue to assume that approximately 5,000 associates will have the opportunity to reskill for new roles within the Company.In Q4, we incurred $48 million of charges, including $42 million of severance charges as part of the Fit For Growth Plan. These charges relate to approximately 550 associates, most of whom we expect will exit the Company by the end of Q1 and we expect will result in a cash impact of approximately $40 million in the first quarter, with full run rate savings not achieved until Q2 for these associates.We continue to expect the majority of the remaining associates to exit the Company by mid-2020. We are managing this process carefully and any time we make decisions that impact our employees, we take it very seriously.Additionally, we continue to review our real estate portfolio as part of the Fit For Growth Plan and expect to take further action related to real estate rationalization in 2020. These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2020 and are expected to result in 2020 in-year gross savings of over $450 million and annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in the year 2021.Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we began the exit of a subset of our Content Services business. Approximately $5 million of the $48 million Fit For Growth charges in the quarter related to retention and severance for approximately 1,100 of the expected 5,000 to 6,000 total associates to be impacted by the wind down of this work.We have updated our estimate of the number of associates to be impacted by the wind down from 6,000 to a range of 5,000 to 6,000, as we expect to retain more work with these clients in other Content and Technology services than originally estimated. We now estimate that we may lose revenues of $225 million to $255 million, down from our previous estimate of $240 million to $270 million on an annualized basis within our Communications, Media and Technology segment.We continue to anticipate revenues will ramp down over the next one to two years, with an expected impact of $20 million to $25 million of revenue in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. This is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted operating margin rate subject to the timing of the ramp down and other factors.We also continue to expect to incur wind-down charges related to the transition of these associates and any related assets such as real estate and equipment. We are working with our partners to transition this work, while continuing to meet our contractual obligations and providing impacted associates with a number of transition assistance programs, including retention bonuses, severance packages and the opportunities to participate in various reskilling programs.At the time of our Q4 earnings call, we provided an estimate of $150 million to $200 million in total expected charges associated with this Fit For Growth cost transformation plan, including the wind down of certain content work.Based on our actions to-date attrition at the senior levels of the pyramid being slightly higher than our expectations and less impact from the exit of certain content services, we now expect to be towards the low-end of that range, while maintaining the annualized gross savings estimates of $500 million to $550 million.Before turning to guidance, I want to comment on the potential change in the dividend distribution tax that was announced as part of the India budget a few days ago. We are currently analyzing this proposal, but believe it can, once enacted, significantly lower the cost of repatriating funds back to the US. The proposal is not yet law but the expected date is April 1, 2020.I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full-year 2020. For the full-year 2020, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year to $17.11 billion to $17.45 billion on a reported and constant currency basis as based on the current exchange rates we are not expecting a material impact from foreign exchange.This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 110 basis points year-over-year growth from our decision to exit certain content work within our CMT segment. This guidance continues to reflect a muted outlook for financial services and healthcare.We expect first quarter revenue growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year to $4.21 billion to $4.25 billion on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth in the range of 2.8% to 3.8% year-over-year, or $4.23 billion to $4.27 billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 30 basis points for foreign exchange for the first quarter.This includes our estimate of the negative impact of approximately 60 basis points to year-over-year growth from our decision to exit certain work within the content services business, which will be reflected in the CMT segment.Revenue guidance for both Q1 and the full-year assumes a cautious macro outlook in the UK, continued slow growth in financial services and healthcare, as well as the previously mentioned impact of exiting certain content work.For the full-year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margins to be between 16% and 17%, which is assumes incentive compensations to be at target payouts. We expect Q1 margins to be slightly below the low end of the range as we are investing in sales hiring, training, tooling and automation and marketing and branding while the timing of the savings from the actions taken under our Fit for Growth Plan and the return on our sales investments will not have reached the full quarter run rate.As a reminder, our full year 2019 margin rate reflects lower incentive compensation payouts given our underperformance versus target. Our guidance assumes that in 2020, we will perform at plan, and therefore, incentive compensation will reflect target payout rates. This is a margin rate headwind of approximately 120 basis points year-over-year that we plan to absorb. The midpoint of our 2020 margin guidance of 16% to 17%, therefore, reflects approximately 100 basis points of improvement over the 2019 margins normalized for incentive compensation.We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.97 the $4.13. Our EPS guidance anticipates a year-over-year decrease of approximately $30 million in interest income, reflecting a lower cash balance and reduced interest rates in both the US and India. This is expected to impact EPS by approximately $0.04. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 548 million shares and the tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%.Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes restructuring charges and other unusual items, if any, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, clarification if any by the Indian government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India Defined Contribution Obligation, and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes, such as immigration or tax policy.With that, operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane : Want to ask about the cadence of revenue growth in 2020. Looks like you guided 1Q 2020 revenue guidance, 3% to 4% constant currency. Full year of fiscal year 2020 growth is pretty similar at 2% to 4% constant currency. So is Cognizant expecting kind of steady revenue growth with no fluctuations or do you expect maybe a little bit of a drop in the middle of the year and a pick up in the fourth quarter?I guess another way to ask this is, do you see an inflection point in revenue growth on the horizon? Thanks so much. Karen McLoughlin : Bryan it's Karen. So the one think I would say is, nothing particularly unusual. There is no large deals there is no - nothing unusual right now from a seasonality perspective. So, I think it will be relatively a typical seasonality - that will start to ramp as we get into Q2 and then Q3. The one thing I would say, well the back half might be a little bit stronger because of the sales investments that we're making now right.So we launched that hiring program late last year. So folks are coming on board as we expected. And certainly, while we said we would expect it to take about a year for them to start to ramp, but we should start to see a little bit of that benefit as we get into the back part of the year. Brian Humphries : Yes, and maybe the only addition I'd make to that Karen, is obviously the content moderation ramp down will offset that somewhat as it grows throughout the course of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Brian I was hoping you could give more information about the sales force transformation, where do you stand on hiring? You mentioned the words on track, but a little bit more color on what on track means would be great?And on the flip side is there perhaps any heightened attrition you expect to see for the traditional sales force that was already there given maybe they new compensation schemes or any changes there, so sales force update? Brian Humphries : It's very interesting because as I said, we were at our Global Planning Summit in the last month or so. And the sales force were actually very motivated by their compensation changes because they can actually make more money than they could in prior periods. So actually on the contrary I actually feel there's a great deal of optimism in the sales force. People are - when the CEO visits clients every single day, it leads to a certain cultural demand in the organization.And I think people are motivated to get the company back to an accelerated growth rate, but I feel good about where we are. I'm not overly concerned about attrition in the legacy sales teams. We've had great look, I would say fulfilling the pipeline of opportunities. We don't break out on a quarterly basis where we are versus at hiring. We're less than halfway through the 500. I will tell you that.There is a lot of work still to do, but I track it on a monthly basis at Executive Committee and we're pretty much in line with what we anticipated in terms of costs. I've also been keeping an eye, not just on the accounts that these folks are assigned to, but also the pipeline that they are building and in some cases, I've been pleasantly surprised that the early pipeline builds have even been ahead of my expectations.So look more work to do to continue to review that, but there's a lot of energy and urgency in Cognizant in these days and I think we're all very clear what we're setting out to achieve. And I feel very good in terms of where we are to to-date. So the broader sales force update is consistent with what I said last quarter, that's not going to change. We've implemented a RAD model, which is retention, acquisition and development.That's all about trying to get the right folks on the right accounts at the right time, aligning specialist resources, which are by practice, such as big data or cloud, with a generous client partner. The client partner is the quarterback on the accounts, they have decision rights, they own the P&L for the accounts. They can move with speed and accountability within the framework of authority that we have delegated to them and they are complemented by subject matter expert solution architects and the like.We implemented that model on January 1. So far so good, and we obviously got to continue to push that out in the course of the year ahead. But I feel good about where we are. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Brian, one of the things you mentioned was that you're doubling the number of people supporting Cognizant's major strategic alliances and I know that that is also somewhere where you have been spending your own time as well. Can you just provide a little bit more richness on where your focus there, where maybe Cognizant is already strong? Where you think there is opportunity to improve and how that sort of fits into the overall updated strategy and fit for growth plan? Thank you. Brian Humphries : Yes, I will and look we have Lisa, some really strong alliance partners and partnerships by key verticals, whether that's Temenos in Financial Services, Pega, Adobe, or otherwise. But I've really spent a huge amount of time in the last nine months trying to build out and foster a business plan behind Amazon, behind Microsoft. We are now working through Google Cloud Practice as the hyperscale players and indeed really selectively aligning Cognizant to some of the leading SaaS type players as an example, such as Salesforce or ServiceNow or indeed Workday.To make sure that we go to market with the companies that are growing 20%, 30%, 40% year-over-year. Not to say we won't continue to obviously partner with others, but we are putting - allocating even more capital to the winners in today's environment. That invariably means for us just to be very clear, it doesn't mean hiring more alliance partners and having a bunch of coffee drinkers sitting around feeling good about hosting meetings.This is lot about building our business plans with solution architects and big data experts and the like. Align to each and every one of those companies I talked about. It involves putting an operational cadence together on a rolling four-quarter basis. So I know in a certain date, I'll be sitting in a room with the CEO of that company, review not just what we're setting out to achieve as a company, which has dollar targets against it, which are intersected by country and vertical.But also looking at the pipeline shape, where we are in the funnel and really operationalizing that strategic alliance vision into day-to-day reality, which includes joint customer calls, joint - in person visits to clients with the leadership of those companies, joint emails to clients, or letters to clients and the like. So it's strategic, but to be very clear, it's also very operationally inclined and pragmatic with a view to successfully driving acute cadence going forward with these clients and partners and making sure we show up better than we ever have in the past. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- tsin Huang : Everything looks in line a little bit with what we had. It was just gross margins that was a little bit different. I know you mentioned Karen the 50 bps or the $25 million healthcare write-down. Can you maybe quantify some of the pricing pressure you're seeing coming from the heritage work or anything else on delivery cost that might have surprised you?I know the fit for growth piece is coming in to. So just overall try and give some more color on the quarter and then maybe how the year is going to play out here in 2020 for gross margin? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin : I don't think in the quarter Tien-tsin I wouldn't say there was any real change in pricing trends, but as we talked about on the prepared comments, we certainly are continuing to see pressure on renewals in the heritage or for legacy IT side of the business. Right now that's being offset by higher pricing on the digital side of the business. But certainly we think we can do better on pricing in digital services and really to make sure that we are pricing to the market and for the value that we are providing to clients.So that is certainly an initiative we have underway, as well as do a far better job on things like COLA and getting adjusted bill rates and people are being promoted or rotating our staff to take effect of a more optimal pyramid. Certainly the savings that we've seen so far has been primarily in the SG&A buckets, as we've been focused on the top end of the pyramid, mostly which is done in SG&A.But as we move into Q1 and Q2 and further into the fit for growth program, we would certainly expect to see improvements in the middle to upper middle of the pyramid as well, and also be able to drive improvement in some of these revenue levers, which will hopefully start to stabilize in gross margins. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward Caso : Brian, is your team now in place? I know you had one of your execs cycle out not that long ago, but do you have the people that you need down a level or two at this point to drive the transformation? Brian Humphries : Look, I'm a big believer Ed that A players attract A players and the more we upscale and make sure we have the right team around meet those people in turn we\u2019ll make sure that they replicate that trend through the organization. I will say we have gems in Cognizant, really, really strong leaders. I talked about life sciences growing double-digits that's an internal promotion that happened in the last year.So it's always going to be a combination of complementing excellent internal talent with excellent additions from the outside and putting a system of meritocracy and a performance culture in place. So everybody knows what we celebrate and what we condone versus what we don't tolerate.So of course, in the years ahead, there will always be refinements. I want to drive a performance culture, and we're getting there, but of course, there will be, even in the foreseeable future, ongoing refinements as we continue to attract better people from the outside to complement internal talent.I will say one thing that's very pleasing to me, there is no shortage of people reaching out to Cognizant at this moment in time, feeling both from clients and otherwise that there is a new vigor in the Company, a new urgency in the Company and a confidence that we can get back to been the great Company that we have been in the past. So it's very encouraging to me to know that we can still attract great talent from the outside.And in the same vein, with a new Chief People Officer, Becky Schmitt, who joined this Monday, who almost had two decades in Accenture, and most recently had been in Walmart. We have a very strong people agenda program lined up in the coming years to attract, motivate, develop, retain and put very sophisticated talent management programs in place internally. And I believe that will not just make us a very appealing place to come and develop your career, but it will also have intrinsically a direct impact on our attrition rate, which as I said in the call, I'm pleased with, but we can always do better. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with question. Keith Bachman : Karen, just for clarification, could you tease out the guidance from a revenue perspective in terms of isolating what M&A contribution is expected to be? And particularly the M&A contribution, does that include some of the very, very recent deals? And then, Brian, for you, if you could just revisit on healthcare and how we should be thinking about healthcare cadence, both this year and frankly exiting this year? As the deals we anniversary in earnest in the June quarter in particular, has the price activities of the M&A client, has that already played out or will that continue to play out for the year, but just more broadly talk a little bit about healthcare, both this year and kind of exiting the year? How you see the opportunity there for Cognizant? Thank you. Brian Humphries : I'll start with the healthcare question Keith, because actually ironically I have been on the phone with the leadership team of - as it happens, both of those combined companies as recently as this morning. So I'm pretty current in terms of where we are on the accounts, and indeed the opportunity.And I will say. I continue to be pleased that we show up a little bit better than we have. And both executives and companies reassured me that the merger integration work is still there and as they think about consolidating to preferred vendors we are firmly and squarely in a go-forward strategy as well.So I do feel there's lots of opportunity for us, even in those larger accounts, where we've seen consolidation from four to two in the last year and we have seen some pressure on rates as part of that, but we do want to get back once we anniversary that into a stronger growth trajectory in healthcare.In the same vein, I just want to caution the amount of work that needs to be done. We've also had our healthcare team today here in New York, about 20 people in a room reviewing last year, reviewing revenue, pipeline, win rate, margin trends, a very strong call to action in terms of what we need to do in the coming year.So we're not out the other side on that yet, but I choose to be glass half full here in terms of a lot of the actions we are doing are not specific to one vertical. Better aligning marketing spend, making sure we have the right customer segmentation strategy in place, up-skilling our client partners, making sure we have the best specialists in the world to complement them, going to market with some of the hyperscale players in financial services or healthcare, et cetera, et cetera, because that will bear fruits in each and every one of our industries healthcare included.We do expect still some, I would say, modest - we still have modest expectations for healthcare in the coming year, but as we go through the course of the year, I'd like to think that we will start to make some progress. Karen McLoughlin : And Keith, it's Karen. Let me just comment on the guidance. So for the first quarter, there is about 120 basis points of inorganic revenue baked into the guidance. That includes only the transactions that have already been completed. So that would include Code Zero, but not the EI Technologies transaction. As that has not closed yet. And then on a full-year basis, the guidance similarly, only for deal closed, is about a 100 basis points of revenue growth year-over-year. And that's down from, if you recall in 2019, the impact was about 200 basis points. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Please proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : So on the last earnings call, you talked about a set of growth investments that would cost you about 150 basis points on margin. So I'm just looking at the further needs to build into the digital era. And besides the growth investments you've already articulated, are there additional growth related investments that you'd like to start making in 2020, such that if you had more room in your margin plan, are there additional investments that you would like to make besides the ones you've talked about? Brian Humphries : It's Brian. So listen, the way I think about this, this year, if you normalize for, let's say, target bonuses as Karen has articulated in this call and prior calls, margins would have been roughly mid-15%. We've guided 16% to 17% for next year. So call the midpoint 16.5%. And we're assuming, by the way, next year that our bonus structure is a normalized part of our cost base. So hence organically, if you will, a 100 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year.Now, to your point, we've made reference before of $250 million plus of investment back into the business, a lot of that we called out explicitly like 500 headcount related to this revenue generation. We're doing more on sales and marketing, we're doing more on training, et cetera. So that's approximately 1.5%. So had we not done that, margins naturally would have been higher.But I'm not here to try to operationalize Cognizant from $17 billion to $20 billion. We're trying to make this a $25 billion, $30 billion, $35 billion company in the years ahead. And as part of that, I think, it's always wrong to look at one element on a continuum and trying to spotlight there and think, well, Brian had you not made those investments, could you deliver higher margin rates. And Rod, I know your investment thesis on the stock.I certainly know that's not your intent either behind your question. What I want to do is continue to reinvest into the business. So if we can prove a strong return on these investments we're making, including the sales force hiring, we get win rates higher. If we get a good pipeline that we convert to TCV and revenue, my inclination will be to continue to deliver and apply more of the upside back into the business and get us back into the Cognizant that was tried and tested for many, many years that made this company a great success story over the years.So that's the intention that we're setting out to deliver here in the next five years to 10 years. I'm confident we're doing the right thing. I will tell you, I'm really pleased and I spent a lot of my time with clients and partners. Our strategy is resonating. They see the renewed energy in the company. We have lots of work to do, but I'm very pleased and optimistic with the progress we're making and nonetheless that we still have more work to do in the year ahead. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jason Kupferberg : Just a two-pronged question on M&A. First, I know that EI Technologies you just said is not in the guide at this point, but assuming that closes in line with the timing you're expecting, roughly how much revenue would that add this year? And then can you just comment more broadly on your M&A strategy? It feels like the frequency and intensity of M&A is picking up a little bit, Brian, under your watch over the past years. Is that an accurate assessment in terms of where you intend to take that strategy as well? Obviously these kind of tuck-in size digital assets really stand out. Brian Humphries : Yes. So listen, a good question. I wouldn't say to-date that the frequency has picked up that much. February 6, last year I was announced as the new CEO, so I started in April 1, and since then, we've done until this week two acquisitions, Contino and then prior to that Zenith Technologies. It just so happens that we were diligently working to review our strategy and finalize that and only with that behind us, that we absolutely go - now, let's go and put our balance sheet behind us to make sure we position ourselves strongly behind our strategic intent.And I as said earlier, that's a lot about protecting and optimizing the core including scaling internationally, but it's also about winning in key digital battlegrounds. And both acquisitions we made this week are firmly behind the cloud ambition that we have and you'll see more of the same on a go-forward basis behind each and every one of those digital battlegrounds.To be very clear, I view M&A as a means to an end to achieve the strategy. And while I'm pleased with the $2.2 billion we spent on share repurchases last year, you will see an absolute conviction to return capital to shareholders in the form of periodic dividend increases, as well as share repurchases, with a particular eye to offset dilution, but also potentially opportunistic. I will say that you will see us more towards accelerating M&A on a go-forward basis as long as it is supportive of the overall Company strategy.Share repurchases, while adding value, do not reposition the company against the strategic intent. M&A can enable us to do that. So with almost a year behind me, under my belt here in Cognizant, getting my head around the Company, the industry better, the operational rigor and control we have with the team around me, we're absolutely inclined to accelerate M&A a little more in the years ahead and make sure we use that as a means to accomplish overall Company strategy.With regards to the details of the EI Technologies, look we've entered into exclusive negotiations. Deal is not closed. It is material for France, but it's absolutely immaterial from a company perspective in terms of the dollar additions, so its basis points in terms of growth as opposed to anything else.But as I said, that with Code Zero is firmly behind our Salesforce ambition and we've been spending a lot of time. I personally have met with Salesforce CEO I think probably now five times in nine-months. And these are very symbolic moves to make sure that we strengthen our capabilities behind the Salesforce practice that we're building out. Operator : We have time for one final question today it's coming from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Moshe Katri : Brian, you spoke about the need to potentially accelerate growth in International where you feel that the company is under-penetrated. Can you talk a bit about what sort of actions you are taking to get there maybe some color there would be helpful? Thanks. Brian Humphries : Yes. It ultimately takes three portions, one is organic investments, one is partnership and another one is M&A. To be very clear is Zenith Technologies, which was at the intersection point of life sciences as one of our really strategic vertical, as well as IoT, was a perfect illustration of hitting many birds with one stone geographic expansion strengthening European footprint, aligning to our IoT digital priority and aligning to one of our strategic vertical.We also announced and closed Contino, which has got a very strong international footprint in the form of DevOp and data in Q4. So those are good illustrations, and of course, EI Technologies that we announced earlier today, will be another good illustration of strengthening our footprint in Europe, in this case in France.Organically, of course, we're strengthening our capabilities by building out more footprint, and supporting that footprint with better allocation of resources globally. As an example, we will modify our marketing mix this year to shift much more towards our international expansion. In prior years, out marketing spend was actually less in our international business than the actual current revenue mix, notwithstanding the fact that our growth opportunity was bigger there.So that seems to have been something that we wanted to rectify on a go-forward basis. And of course, part of the 500 revenue generating headcount that we've approved, a good chunk of that is in Europe and we want to continue to grow scale there to make sure we have a bigger footprint in those geographies.And then, on the partnership side, whether it's with AWS or Salesforce or otherwise, we've been building out those linkages throughout the world and Europe is no different, with a view to go to market in a digital ecosystem aligned country-by-country. I firmly view partners - Lisa asked the question earlier as an extension of our sales force. We are working on some core banking deals at this moment in time where the CEO of Terminus has actually actively in they engaged and brought us into deals and been a huge proponent of Cognizant, given our world-class capabilities behind seminars.So it's wonderful when a client here is not just for the CEO of Cognizant, but also the CEO in this case of terminals as to our capabilities and our referenceability in that regard. So we're full speed on Board full speed ahead to go scale or international capabilities. It was a little bit disappointing this last quarter, some with self-inflicted we get that right going forward, and it's certainly an area of focus for me, in the coming years. Katie Royce : Okay. With that, I think we will conclude today's call. Thank you all for your questions. Operator : Thank you, this concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.And I will now turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations at Cognizant. Please go ahead. Katie Royce : Thank you and good afternoon.By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the Company's first quarter 2020 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website cognizant.com.The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody.Today, we have several topics to discuss with you as a follow-on to our April 9th business update. These include a review of our first quarter 2020 results, an update on COVID-19, a discussion on the Maze ransomware attack and an update on the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, and how we will react to the new demand environment.Let\u2019s start with first quarter results.Revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.2 billion. This includes a 50 basis points from the exit of certain content services business. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.96, up 5% year-over-year. Karen will bring you through the details of the quarter.While today's call had a full agenda given COVID-19 and ransomware updates, I do want to start with some perspective on the commercial transformation program that we have been executing over the past year. I\u2019m pleased to state that we've been making solid progress against this initiative, and I want to illustrate this progress with some data that we do not normally share.On a trailing 12-month basis, our win rate is up hundreds of basis points. First quarter total contracts awarded grew 30%-plus year-over-year with broad-based strength across all service lines, industries and geographies. This represents our best quarterly performance since 2017. Qualified pipeline growth was strong in Q1 and especially robust in larger deals where we had solid double digit qualified pipeline growth versus the prior year period. This momentum speaks to how well clients have embraced our strategy and have responded to our renewed sense of client-centricity. It also speaks to how our teams have embraced our focus on growth. Notwithstanding its quarterly earnings backdrop that includes COVID-19 and ransomware, I do not want us to lose sight of these leading indicators that reflect Cognizant\u2019s growing competitiveness.Turning now to COVID-19, which, as you know, is having a severe humanitarian and economic impact on society across the world. As we navigate this pandemic, our top priority remains the health and safety of our own associates while maintaining continuity of service for our clients. Our perspective is that COVID-19 is affecting the IT services industry on two dimensions, fulfillment and demand. Let's start with fulfillment.After a strong start to the first quarter, our revenue slowed meaningfully in March, reflecting the fulfillment challenges are shifting rapidly to a work-from-home environment across our delivery centers. These challenges include people, IT, security and client considerations. Thanks to the professionalism and diligence of our associates and the execution of our crisis management and business continuity plans, we were able to ensure a continuity of service for the vast majority of our clients in March and early April. As a testament to this, I have received numerous notes from clients recognizing the work of our teams. While this was a gargantuan task and there were some speed bumps along the way, I want to acknowledge our teams around the world who went the extra mile in testing circumstances to make this happen.I will return to fulfillment efforts in a moment when I cover the ransomware attack on our internal IT systems and in particular its impact on our work-from-home enablement.The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on demand is more multidimensional. While we were in a period of great uncertainty, as a company, we expect the economic and human impacts will be felt by companies across the globe. While certain industries will be hit hardest, all industries will suffer. Smaller businesses and those with weak balance sheet and liquidity will be particularly impacted. The demand impact will be felt throughout 2020. And when a recovery materializes, certain markets, such as the U.S., will rebound quicker.As indicated on our April 9th update, we've seen some delays in cancellations of projects and discretionary spending and select requests for furloughs, rate concessions and extended payment terms from our clients.While our outlook for 2020 has been meaningfully altered, we are nevertheless confident that we will weather the storm, given our business mix. For example, since more than 60% of our business is in Financial Services and Healthcare, we are less exposed to some of the hardest hit industries, including travel, hospitality, retail and automotive. International markets, which tend to rebound more slowly, represent just 25% of our business. And, we are primarily exposed to global 2000 clients which we believe will be more resilient than smaller companies. We also have great confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity. While we will be prudent in this uncertain economic backdrop, this confidence allows us nonetheless to invest in M&A to accelerate our strategy and bolster our capabilities. More on that later.More broadly, the pandemic shockwaves have spurred clients to accelerate their digital transformation. Clients are looking for ways to modernize their business, accelerate innovation, become more elastic and agile in the face of business uncertainty, and generally, reimagine their businesses for the new normal. More major IT trends such as core modernization, data modernization and cloud adoption will accelerate. These secular trends play to our refined strategy and make us more relevant than ever.In short, while 2020 will be a challenging year given COVID-19, we\u2019re confident that our industry, geographic and customer segment mix, our balance sheet, our momentum in our digital imperatives and our growing competitiveness will allow us to compete well on a relative basis regardless of the macro environment.Let's turn now to the Maze ransomware attack, which we announced in April. We responded immediately by mobilizing our entire leadership team, drawing on the expertise of our IT and security teams and bringing in leading cybersecurity experts to help us investigate and respond to the attack. We also contacted appropriate law enforcement agencies. From the start, we decided to communicate forthrightly and transparently with our clients. In addition to hundreds of individual client calls conducted by our security organization, cybersecurity experts and our executive team, we held two client conference calls in April.Retaining client trust is of paramount importance. So, we erred on the side of over-communicating the details of what we knew and how we were working to contend or mitigate this incident. We proactively provided clients with Indicators of Compromise or so called IOC, namely forensic data that a company can use to identify potentially malicious activity and defend against attacks from external actors.Earlier this week, in our third conference call with clients, we confirmed the containment of the ransomware attack. While we are pleased to have reached this important milestone, the ransomware attack will nevertheless negatively impact our Q2 results for two reasons. First, the attack encrypted some of our internal systems, effectively disabling them, and we proactively took other systems offline. This disruption included both, select system supporting our work-from-home enablement such as VDI and the provisioning of laptops that have been expected to further increase our work-from-home capabilities in April.Second, in the wake of the ransomware attack, some clients opted to suspend our access to their networks. Billing was therefore impacted for a period of time, yet the cost of staffing these projects remained on our books. With the ransomware attack now contend, we\u2019ve restored VDI in automated laptop provisioning. Further, with previously ordered equipment now physically in India and distribution constraints less respective per the latest state directives, we\u2019re now substantially work-from-home enabled. In addition, following the containment of the ransomware attack, we have meaningfully progressed in addressing the concerns of clients that have suspended our access to their networks. We expect to substantially complete this by the end of the month.We expect the vast majority of revenue and margin impact from the ransomware attack to be in the second quarter. However, ongoing remediation costs will ensue through subsequent quarters. We will disclose the financial impact to you on a quarterly basis to ensure appropriate visibility.Ransomware attacks are becoming all too frequent across industries. We are using this experience as an opportunity to refresh and strengthen our approach to security. We\u2019re already applying what we\u2019ve learned to further harden and strengthen our security environments and we are further leveraging our external security experts to help inform and guide our long-term security strategy. Cybersecurity will continue to be a top priority for us in the years ahead.As you\u2019ll recall, during our COVID-19 business update on April 9th, we withdrew guidance for 2020. Before I pass the call to Karen, I want to draw your attention to the fact that we entered the year with cost assumptions built to support revenue growth acceleration. These assumptions no longer hold true in light of the fact that nobody can predict how long the current macro environment will persist. So, we are faced with a great deal of uncertainty on many levels including our own cost structure.Having come through a challenging 2019 when promotions and salary increases were delayed, as a leadership team, we decided to take a nuance approach to 2020. We aim to invest in the business by protecting and developing digital skills, continuing to build out our commercial team and continuing to correct the employee pyramid by on-boarding approximately 20,000 entry-level hires. Meanwhile, we aim to significantly decrease other costs including corporate overhead, travel, marketing relocations and non-commercial lateral hires.Services companies habitually rely on so-called bench policies to right size their associate base to reflect market demand. Against today\u2019s COVID-19 backdrop, we feel that traditional industry bench policies do not adequately address the interests of impacted employees. Consequently, any employees impacted by demand-supply imbalances may benefit from extended medical coverage and exit packages, through the end of the third quarter.Karen will now take you through the details of the quarter and provide updates on our balance sheet, liquidity and cost initiatives. After that, I\u2019ll return to provide some closing remarks before we take Q&A. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.First quarter revenue of $4.2 billion grew 2.8% year-over-year or 3.5% in constant currency, including a negative 50 basis-point impact from the exit of certain content-related services. We saw strong momentum across the business in January and February with the initial impact of COVID, particularly on the fulfillment side, starting to impact the business in the middle of March.During the first quarter, we also took a fresh look at our definition of digital revenue and have better aligned it to our digital imperatives. Substantive changes to the definition include the addition of certain platform solutions and the removal of certain content services work. Based on this new definition, digital revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, was approximately 41% for the first quarter and grew by approximately 19% year-over-year.Moving to the industry verticals where all of the growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services growth of 1.8% was driven by banking, including strong performance in Europe attributable to the Samlink deal and regional banks in North America. Weakness persisted across global accounts, particularly in capital markets and insurance.Moving on to Healthcare, which grew 2.7%, performance was led by strong double digit growth in life sciences in Europe. Within our Healthcare vertical, revenue declined low single digits as the headwinds in North America, we highlighted in 2019, continued to impact the business in Q1. However, contract signings in Healthcare were a meaningful contributor to the overall strength in bookings that Brian mentioned in his comments.Products and Resources growth of 5.3% was driven by manufacturing, logistics and retail and consumer goods, and partially offset by softness in travel and hospitality. Roughly 60% of this segment represents revenue within the travel and hospitality, and retail and consumer goods industry, which have experienced the earliest impact of COVID-19, given restrictions in travel and lack of foot traffic within retailers.Communications, Media and Technology grew 6.3%, led by strength in communications and media clients in North America, where momentum from late in 2019 continued, driven by an increase in demand for services in core modernization and the cloud transformation services. However, we expect this vertical to see a meaningful deceleration this year, particularly with entertainment clients exposed to studios, cable TV and theme parks.Although technology continued to outpace total Company performance, growth decelerated due to a negative impact of $23 million from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. This impacted our CMT segment growth by approximately 390 basis points.Moving onto margin. In Q1, our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 13.7% and $0.67, respectively. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 15.1%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.96.COVID-related charges were $6 million in the quarter, which included $5 million of the expected $25 million total related to the previously announced onetime salary adjustment in April that we gave to certain employees in India and the Philippines.Our GAAP margin improved year-over-year, given the India defined contribution accrual in Q1 of 2019. However, our adjusted operating margin, which excludes this impact in the prior year period, was down 90 basis points year-over-year as investments in sales hiring, higher incentive-based compensation as well as an approximately $30 million to $35 million COVID-related revenue impact in March, resulting from fulfillment challenges, caused by the rapid shift of our employee base to safely work from home. These increased costs were offset by savings from items such as lower T&E and the favorable movement in the rupee.During the quarter, we continued to execute against the 2020 Fit for Growth plan, which is designed to improve our cost structure and fund investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. In Q1, we incurred $35 million of charges as part of this plan. Based on the actions taken since the program inception, we have achieved over $250 million in annualized run rate savings.Additionally, as part of the Fit for Growth plan, we continued the exit of a subset of our content services business, accounting for $11 million of the $35 million of charges in the quarter. We continue to expect the ramp-down of this work to occur over the next several quarters with the majority of the work expected to be ramped down exiting 2020.In total, our estimated revenue impact of $225 million to $255 million on an annualized basis is unchanged. In Q2, we expect a negative year-over-year impact to revenue of approximately $50 million. As a reminder, the content services business is within the Communications, Media and Technology segment.Now, I would like to spend some time talking about how we are managing the business in light of an uncertain revenue trajectory and increased costs related to COVID and the ransomware incident.Entering 2020, we had certain demand and revenue assumptions to which we aligned our cost structure. The new reality of the demand environment and the anticipated costs associated with COVID-19 and remediating the ransomware attacks requires us to make further adjustments.Since the trajectory of recovery and demand remains uncertain, we must be prepared for various scenarios over the coming quarters and to manage costs accordingly. As a leadership team, we have spent the last several weeks discussing those scenarios and implementing action plans. In the near term, there will be other COVID-related costs which we will continue to identify separately, including the remaining $20 million of the $25 million related to the one-time salary adjustment in April for certain employees in India and the Philippines, cost to establish work-from-home environments for employees. Additionally, part of planning as a leadership team is to contemplate the future workplace environment and be prepared to return our employees safely to this new reality. It is likely that there will be incremental costs in the near term as we prepare to exit the lockdown periods. These costs could include not only equipping certain employees to work from home on a more permanent basis, but also retrofitting existing facilities to accommodate a lower density ratio amid new social distancing norms and other business continuity-related costs.As we think about mitigation efforts, our near-term focus is on first addressing variable costs. We are a people-based business. And employee-related costs including compensation and benefits plus subcontractors make up over 80% of our total cost structure. We are ratcheting down variable cost, both people and non-people-related costs through actions such as reduced T&E, relocation, recruiting and immigration-related costs, reduced spend on events and marketing, prudently managing our subcontractor mix, deferring certain annual wage increases and promotion cycles. We are freezing lateral hiring across all functions. However, we will continue to move forward with our sales hiring plan and other key positions and honor all outstanding accepted offers. Deferring the timing of our trainee start date in India to Q3 from Q2. However, this will continue to be dependent on lockdowns and school schedules across India.I believe managing utilization is another way that we will more closely align with a lower revenue trajectory. As you might imagine, we have seen a significant decline in voluntary attrition in recent weeks. This, when compounded by a reduction in demand, will naturally lead to utilization levels lower than what we believe is necessary to support the business in the near term. In this scenario, we will accelerate the further development of employees with skills aligned to our key digital imperatives, which we expect will align with client demand when an economic recovery emerges.At the same time, we are aware that there are likely to be employees who are or will become unutilized for whom we do not foresee those opportunities. As always, we are committed to treating these employees with fairness and dignity, which in the current environment will also include providing extended health and other financial benefits to ease their transition.Accordingly, between now and the end of the third quarter, we expect to incur additional realignment charges associated with these enhanced benefits, and we now expect net headcount to decline in 2020 versus 2019. The size and timing of these charges will unfold as the demand environment becomes clearer.It is also critical in this environment to continue to execute our Fit for Growth plan, which thus far has not experienced any material delays from COVID. We still expect the majority of the actions to be complete by the middle of this year and result in gross savings of over $450 million in 2020 and annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in 2021. We continue to expect charges to be in the $150 million to $200 million range.Now, turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of March 31st stood at $4.3 billion, up approximately $860 million from December 31st. This balance now excludes the approximately $400 million of restricted deposits related to our tax dispute in India, which has been reclassified as long-term investment on our balance sheet.We further strengthened our financial flexibility by drawing down $1.74 billion on our revolving credit facility on March 23, 2020. This brought our outstanding debt balance to $2.5 billion. Additionally, we have paused our share repurchase activity as our focus will be on targeted M&A and preserving liquidity. Overall, we feel that our balance sheet is very healthy and provides us the flexibility needed in the current environment to run the business while continuing to invest.We generated $385 million of free cash flow in the quarter. DSO of 74 days improved 2 days year-over-year, reflecting improved collections from several large accounts. On a year-over-year basis, free cash flow also benefited from lower incentive-based compensation, which was paid out in the first quarter. In addition, restructuring charges resulted in approximately a $50 million cash outflow in the quarter, although this was mostly offset by onetime items as a result of certain favorable contract negotiations.We do anticipate an increase in DSO for the remainder of 2020 as we have granted certain clients, in significantly impacted industries, extended payment terms for a short defined period. As we have seen in prior downturns, standing by our clients in times of trouble serves us well in protecting the overall partnership. At the same time, we are also reviewing our own vendor relationship and will continue to pursue opportunities to drive both, cost and cash flow efficiencies.As we discussed during our business update call on April 9th, given the limited visibility in our markets, we do not feel it is appropriate to offer either Q2 or full year 2020 guidance. While we are not able to predict with any certainty the length of disruption or depth of the economic impacts from COVID-19, we are operating the business with the following assumptions.First that the demand environment remains highly volatile and uncertain in the near term. We expect client focus in the near term to be on critical systems and infrastructure to enable their core operations. Discretionary projects or those without a quick payback we expect will be delayed. We see this significantly challenging the second quarter but also the remainder of the year.We are currently planning for a slow transition back to normalcy and expect year-over-year challenges to continue, at least through Q1 2021. We expect the demand will be most impacted in travel, hospitality, retail, automotive, energy and media and entertainment, which are collectively just over 20% of total revenue, but we do also anticipate a broad slowdown across our other industries.As Brian mentioned, the ransomware attack in April negatively impacted our work-from-home enablement schedule. As a result of this ransomware attack, our Q2 revenue and margins will both be negatively impacted. While we anticipate that the revenue impact related to this issue will be largely resolved by the middle of the quarter, we do anticipate the revenue and corresponding margin impact to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million for the quarter. Additionally, we expect to incur certain legal, consulting and other costs associated with the investigation, service restoration and remediation of the breach.While we have restored the majority of our services and we are moving quickly to complete the investigation, it is likely that costs related to the ransomware attack will continue to negatively impact our financial results beyond Q2. While we have already begun taking action to address costs across the Company, there is a lag on the timing of any savings from these actions. Therefore, we expect adjusted margins to decline sequentially and remain below the 16% to 17% range provided in our February guidance, which we have since withdrawn on a full-year basis. We anticipate that our Q2 adjusted operating margin will be the lowest quarter of the year, given the combined impact of COVID-19 and the ransomware attack.So, to wrap up, while COVID-19 and the ransomware attack will negatively impact our 2020 financial performance, we are very-pleased with the progress we are making, not just for the cost alignment part of our Fit for Growth program but also the continued progress we have made with hiring new sales resources and the traction we have seen in win rates and first quarter total contract signings. We look forward to providing you with further updates as the year progresses.With that, I will turn the call back over to Brian to further discuss our recovery plan in a post-COVID world. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Karen.Let me wrap up by saying that Cognizant is built on financial strength and flexibility, unwavering client-centricity that has earned the enduring trust of clients and 290,000 talented associates who once again proved a great selflessness and determination in recent weeks. While 2020 will be a challenging year given COVID-19, we are confident that our industry, geographic and customer segment mix and our balance sheet, our momentum in a digital imperatives and our growing competitiveness will enable us to compete well on a relative basis, regardless of the macro environment.The post-COVID world will create new norms and hasting trends to highly mobile, virtual and personal world. We won't just be talking about teleworking but rather remote everything from digital workflow, to design, to e-commerce, e-banking, education and telemedicine.Against this backdrop, our strategy to win in the digital battleground with AI and analytics, digital engineering, cloud and IoT become more relevant than ever. We will continue to use M&A to accelerate the execution of our strategy. On Tuesday, we announced an agreement to acquire Collaborative Solutions, one of the world's largest workday consultancies. With its rich expertise and leading position in the workday ecosystem, Collaborative Solutions will expand our opportunity in cloud by establishing a neat practice in this large, fast-growing market.The acquisition brings key skills to Cognizant and differentiates us in the market, especially against Indian pure-play competitors. The acquisition also compliments the capabilities we've been building out in our sales force practice.We\u2019ve come through a lot so far this year. Through this, we\u2019ve always sustained our focus on our client-centricity and our determination to execute our strategy. Our increased commercial momentum in the first quarter affirms that our strategy, our solution portfolio, and our renewed vigor is resonating well with clients. While the COVID-19 and the recent ransomware attack have been a setback, I\u2019m confident that Cognizant will emerge strongly from these challenges.Of course, no one knows how long the pandemic will last, only that eventually will fade, certainly the business world will be quite different from what it is today. I've been here long enough at Cognizant to know that we will rise and surmount this challenge and come out the other side stronger. We'll keep our culture strong through this period, the spirit of teamwork and collaboration on the vast scale that I've seen from our associates during the crisis are I believe the direct result of our Company\u2019s deep-seated and shared sense of purpose. Come what may, it's in our DNA to help our clients succeed.And with that, operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and good to hear your voices. Brian, thanks for the visibility on some of those sales metrics in the first quarter. You highlighted the 30% increase in total contracts awarded. You've made a number of changes to Cognizant's go-to-market model since you joined Cognizant. Can you highlight what changes have been making this difference or driving this early traction you're seeing? How far along are you on this journey? And are there particular service lines or project types where you're seeing particular traction at this point? Thank you. Brian Humphries : Yes. Hi, Lisa. So, look, we made a significant amount of changes from a go-to-market point of view in the last year. But, it really kicked in Q1 of this year, because a lot of work was needed before we could actually determine how to best deploy this. And that included a different sales compensation model, which shifted more compensation to variable comp away from fixed compensation. It included a resegmentation of clients into a RAD model, which is a sophisticated methodology to deploy resources against accounts that you are currently in or you're trying to farm versus hunt, new logos. It also required us to build out extensive new relationships with partners, who need to become very much part of our ecosystem. And on top of that, of course, we have been in the process of hiring 500-revenue-generating resources and/or supporting resources, which could include commercial pricers, lawyers, et cetera. We're about 60% through that.But, let's not overlook the fact as well. Just the notion of getting the Company back focused on growth, focused on client-centricity and getting the vigor back into the Company to tap into something that fundamentally is in our core D&A is very, very important. We've been doing that for a period of time now. We've also made some leadership changes. We've really tried to hone in on client-centricity in the leadership team, starting with myself. And that's what I believe has led to the significant momentum we've had in the first quarter. And I would say, even for some of our larger industries like insurance, banking, healthcare, that momentum was actually continued into the month of April, albeit not at the really robust strength that we saw in the first quarter. But, the 33% growth in the first quarter is our strongest bookings since 2017. It was actually very broad-based across all industry segments, across North America as well as our international markets, which we term global growth markets.And then, from a service line point of view, our digital business was up in excess of 50% and digital operations. And our third service line, systems and technology also had robust growth.And I really feel good by the way about our digital offerings. We have really strong capabilities now in cloud. You've seen us build out capabilities with a series of acquisitions in the last year, three sales force platinum partners, and more recently this week, Collaborative Solutions, which is the establishment of a workday practice in Cognizant. Sales force and the workday tend to go hand and glove in clients that have embraced cloud. And we feel that a strong alignment behind companies that are growing 20%, 30% year-over-year is obviously very important for Cognizant's growth rate into the future as well.So, I feel very, very good about the commercial momentum and the progress we're making. Now, of course, then we're hit with COVID-19, which fundamentally changed the growth trajectory in the month of March. But, we're going to deal with that. And as I said on the call, we are -- from my perspective as well-positioned as anybody could deal with it, given our business mix and will come out stronger on the other side. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed you\u2019re your question. Edward Caso : Hi. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the ransomware attack. So, when did it first appear? Was the takedown of the credit line related to that? And what sort of -- you talked about great awards in Q1. Has this slowed down that favorable TCV momentum? Thanks. Brian Humphries : Yes. This is Brian. So, the ransomware attack hit us prior to the work-from-home enablement. We saw what was happening, and as we were trying to shut it down, we were faced with therefore a ransomware attack. And we had three calls with clients, two in the month of April and then one last week and where we acknowledged containment. The credit line or the line of credits drawdown had nothing to do with this. This simply gives us optionality. We already have a very-strong balance sheet, as you know, strong collections as Karen\u2019s indicated, in the quarter. So, frankly, it's nothing to do with ransomware.The TCV growth in Q1 was independent of ransomware. I don't believe ransomware had any meaningful impact on our business momentum. Certainly, we had an impact in the month of -- the latter part of April and early May as the ransomware attack had effectively disabled some of our internal systems that have been encrypted, which impacted some of our work-from-home enablement and indeed certain clients had opted, just as an abundance of caution to isolate themselves from our network. But, given we have contained the virus by working night and day candidly internally as well as working with leading cybersecurity partners, including Mandiant and of course the federal authorities. We are now in a better position than clients on a daily basis, are again cleaning this up. So, I think that will be felt from a revenue and margin point of view. For the most part, the vast majority will be felt in Q2. Thereafter, I imagine where we will be half [ph] that.That said, we will continue to spend money in Q3, Q4 and beyond to further strengthen our security framework. So revenue margin impact is more in Q2, cost impact will continue a little bit through the rest of the year.But, Ed, I think we handled the ransomware attack as well as one can in these circumstances. We chose to be very deliberately client-centric by having three clients conference calls, by doing hundreds of client calls with the executive team and our security team and indeed Mandiant, and this [ph] throughout this period by being as forthright and as transparent as we possibly could. And nobody wants to be dealt with a ransomware attack. I personally don't believe anybody is truly impervious to it, but the difference is how you manage it. And we tried to manage it professionally and maturely. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Good afternoon. Thank you. I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to ask on client behavior. Really, just what you're seeing over the last two weeks versus the spending appetite in early and mid-April? And any semblance of stabilization in any verticals yet? And can you just comment on the types of programs that are moving forward? Brian Humphries : Hey, Bryan. I don't think there's any stabilization per se. Budgets, from my perspective, wear being revised downwards throughout all industries. Certainly, some industries will be hit more than others. I think, digital remains a priority. Virtual work, virtual healthcare, education, banking, e-commerce, you name it, remains of course top of mind for people in today's environment. The shift to SaaS continues. Digital engineering continues, by definition, to fuel some of those capabilities. But, I would say, projects, the short-term paybacks continue. But anything that is deemed discretionary is being delayed. We have seen some requests for furloughs, rate concessions, et cetera, but not a meaningful amount.I would say, in the same vein, we are still seeing some pretty substantial opportunities there, including captive opportunities. And as I referenced in my prepared remarks, pipeline shape on a qualified basis actually looked reasonably healthy as we exited Q1, and even now after the month of March.So, we are being very opportunistic here. We are making sure we fine tune our offerings to take advantage of the new norm that we're in today. We have work streams lined up behind that. And of course, we continue to push our digital imperatives, which are from my perspective firmly and squarely into the area of the market where growth will continue, if not accelerate into the foreseeable future. And that includes data modernization, cloud, applications generally including SaaS and indeed, core modernization. So, we feel well positioned. But, it's particularly difficult environment call at this moment in time. There's not a lot of visibility and clients are, I think obviously being cautious. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- tsin Huang : I have a follow-up and then a question. A follow-up to Lisa\u2019s question, just on the sales signing success. Are you seeing an uptick in sole source deals given your investments in sales? Obviously, the win share is up against the bigger pipeline, but it sounds like maybe the sole sourced piece could be up. Just curious on that. And then just, it sounds like, Brian, your M&A appetite is still there. Should we expect a pause, given everything going on or are you still pretty active with the M&A? Thank you. Brian Humphries : I don't think we see a lot of sole source per se, but I will say we have seen some renewals where we've had the opportunity to renew without those contracts being up for a bid or tender. And that's been on the basis of very strong deliveries and strong client satisfaction, and frankly a very-strong executive engagement, which has been quite intentional over the last year. But, as ever, clients are always looking to extract value for money and of course they also wants to sleep well at night. So, they want to work with partners who honor their commitments and deliver well.I\u2019m feeling good generally, however, about our momentum in the field and our competitive positioning. Our win rates are improving, as I said. Our contracts bookings speak for themselves. If it was one vertical or one service line, I wouldn't quite be so adamant about this. But, I genuinely feel as that we've made tremendous progress in the last year.From an M&A perspective, I\u2019m fortunate to be backed by a Board who are very supportive of the project we're undergoing. We have a clearly defined strategy. The M&A transactions that we have made in the last year have been against a defined strategy that was blessed by the Board last September. We will continue to obviously monitor collections and monitor our liquidity as well as our balance sheet. But, we feel very comfortable in our current position. And I will say, we will continue to conduct M&A transactions, albeit in a prudent manner. We want to conduct transactions that solely fit and are squarely aligned to our strategy and that we have confidence that we have the right leadership team in place to integrate them successfully. Operator : The next question is from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you very much. And, Brian, congratulations on a good March. It seems pretty clear in the absence of COVID that Cognizant was on a very good path for 2020. My question is, I want to dig a little bit in at least around some context associated with margins over the next couple of quarters, and what the puts and takes are. You mentioned that Cognizant is on a journey to invest, including the sales reps that you mentioned. Karen listed a number of things that were incremental -- sounds like incremental cost savings. And I just wondered is the way to think about the dollar amount of incremental cost savings associated with those new areas since the advent of COVID, just so if we can at least try to think about where the margins might be in turn? Part B of that is, as you think about the malware situation, will those costs for remediation, will those be non-GAAP item? In other words, would those be GAAP charges but would be taken out of the non-GAAP results? And that's it. I mean, just any other comments, Brian, on how we should be thinking about margins for the next two quarters in particular? Brian Humphries : So, Keith, I'll kick it off and then maybe Karen can jump in, if it\u2019s okay, Karen. We're obviously not in the same location today. Keith, thank you. First of all, I do feel that we did have momentum that was building as we exited Q4. January and February were particularly strong. I felt we were on track to have a very strong quarter relative to Wall Street expectations. And then, of course, March arrived with COVID.As Karen will attest, the change in dynamics was relatively abrupt. Obviously because first and foremost because of fulfillment where in countries like India, we had four hours. We had obviously triggered a business continuity plan weeks ahead. But the ultimate decision to lockdown India came with a four-hour notice. So, we -- like many services companies, I imagine we're scrambling to fulfill work-from-home capabilities via encrypted desktops or laptops or remote VDI, et cetera. So that hurt us from a fulfillment point of view. And as such you have costs, but add the revenue. Similarly, that's compounded itself in the first few weeks of May and the last few weeks of April yet again, not only were we dealing with COVID, but then we had a ransomware attack that encrypted servers, which actually took out some of the work-from-home capabilities that we had enabled in the prior weeks, and also slowed our ability to enable further work-from-home because of some of the systems and tools we would have used to automate and provision laptops were no longer functioning.So, we had the perfect storm in which we still had costs without revenue. And on top of that when you have clients who disconnect you from their network for a period of time until such time as you're contained the malware, yet again, you want to keep those skillets ready to reengage as soon as the clients permit you to reengage.So, I think, what you'll find in Q2, we had the perfect storm of cost without revenue, and of course then you have to adjust to reflect the demand-supply imbalance. And that is ultimately I think what will hurt our margins in the foreseeable future. And then, as Karen will tell you, of course, we want to protect skills like digital skills, and of course therefore we want to take out any so-called no-regrets costs to try to mitigate that. But Karen will give you a little bit more details. Karen McLoughlin : Sure. Thanks, Brian, and thanks, Keith. In terms of the ransomware question that you asked, we will not be adjusting that out of our non-GAAP. Those costs will stay both in our GAAP and our non-GAAP margins as they continue through the rest of the year. We will, however, as we've done in the past with some other large unusual transactions, try to call those out on a quarterly basis, if they're meaningful, so that investors will see what that cost looks like.And as Brian said on the margin side, obviously, there are a number of things that happened very quickly and where we can move to take cost or cost gets eliminated or doesn't happen such as T&E and so forth, which like others, we started to see the benefits of in late March. Obviously, because people aren't physically at work at clients' sites, they're not relocating and we don't have to worry about immigration and other things as people are moving around the country and so forth.And then, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, while we will continue to honor all of the outstanding offers that have been accepted, we have, for the most part, shut down much of our hiring. And so, recruiting costs obviously go away along with that. But, I think, as we've talked about, in this business, obviously, when there is a revenue slowdown, it depends what the cause of that revenue is as to what happens to your resources and your utilization rates.As Brian talked about, with things that we think are short-term, such as we had with the fulfillment, challenges with COVID late-March, early-April and then more recently with the ransomware, clearly we want to hold onto those resources, so that they can continue to deliver services to clients as that work comes back up. And we certainly want to make sure through this time that we protect our digital skills and use this opportunity to continue to enhance and develop digital skills across the Company. But certainly, it is not unlikely that utilization will hit levels below where we think they should be to run the business for the foreseeable future. And then, obviously, we'll have to make some adjustments and modify the headcounts accordingly for the organization.As we said, we don't expect to be in the margin range that we had previously guided to back in February. We do think margins will be below the 16% to 17% range for the year and for each of the quarters throughout the year. And we would expect the Q2 because of the issues with ransomware will be the lowest quarter of the year. But, we will remain on track with our Fit for Growth plan. We have made good progress through the first quarter and have generated between Q4 and the first quarter this year over $250 million of annual savings already, and we'll be on track for the $450 million as we go through the rest of the year to begin to set ourselves up as we move into 2021. Brian Humphries : Just to conclude at this point, I felt as though very much the story was on track. The commercial momentum started to build, the Fit for Growth was well on track. And I would say, then we suffered a micro event, which is our ransomware attack, which we have dealt with since. And then, of course we're faced with a macro environment because of COVID-19. In the absence of those, I would say, the story remains very much consistent with what we've been saying for the last year, which is differentiating between a cost versus an investment, trying to pivot the Company back towards a growth story and making sure we have a refined strategy that we can invest on and execute well to unlock more shareholder value creation. And that certainly will be the playbook we will go back to. And I'd like to think we\u2019ll come out of this storm well, given the business mix, given our balance sheet, given our liquidity and with even a leaner cost structure, given the environment we're going through in the meantime. Hopefully, we can continue the commercial momentum, at least on a relative basis and then, come out of this strongly. Operator : The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : So, the payers subsegment of your Healthcare vertical has been weak for a good while, while the life sciences subsegment has been strong. We actually entered 2020 thinking this is the first time in a while that you could be in a better place to grow the payer subsegment of your Healthcare vertical. So, my question is, looking beyond the immediate crisis on a more secular basis, are you starting to see opportunities for better relative growth in the payer subsegment or maybe you were seeing better opportunities and now COVID is making that murky. But, I'd like to ask for any color on that if you can. Thanks. Brian Humphries : Look, we had an outstanding first quarter in Healthcare from a bookings point of view, triple-digit growth. By the way, we also had growth into the month of April on a year-over-year basis as well. And I've been particularly pleased to see the direct wins we have seen in the payer area, but also frankly even in the provider area. So, it feels to me that we were starting to turn a corner in Healthcare. And as you know, once we hit Q2, we will anniversary the tougher compares that we hit last year because of some of the consolidation in the industry. So, we still have work to do, of course, to continue to sharpen our pencils on our strategy. But, I feel as though we have made very good progress. We have a leadership team that's very engaged, and we seem to have growing momentum with our major clients. Rod Bourgeois : Thank you. Brian Humphries : Okay. I think with that we will take one more question. Operator : Thank you, Brian. That is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : Hey. This is Jonathan on for James. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I want to ask about what you're seeing on the work that's being canceled versus the type of work that's being deferred. Are you seeing a difference in that type of work? I know discretionary work is off the table. But, can you help dimensionalize relative to your service lines, what's being considered discretionary now? Brian Humphries : Look, it\u2019s highly nuanced; it\u2019s client by client, but I would say things that have a long payback, tend to be pushed out at this moment in time, some change requests or anything that's so called discretionary that's not being critical is certainly being pushed. But, we have seen good momentum, as I said in our digital engineering business, we feel very good about our cloud momentum. And actually we've had great receptivity to this week's announced acquisition of Collaborative Solutions. So, I think that the fact that the core elements of the secular trends that have been in the market from my perspective, will accelerate as clients strikes, you have a much more agile, modern infrastructure, and ultimately try to take advantage of the data that they have accumulated over the years to really try to have a much more modern perspective in terms of how to think about individuals. And I truly believe we're moving to a mobile, a virtual, and a truly personal world on a go forward basis.Okay. I think with that we\u2019re at the top of the hour. So, I'd just like to thank you for joining. I know it was a complex earnings call, because not only did we talk about the Q1 results, we also touched upon the COVID-19 implications, the ransomware attack and how we've dealt with that and a little lens into the future.I would just want to wrap up by saying the following things. I truly feel as though we're more competitive than we have been as evidenced by win rates, as evidenced by our pipeline growth, as evidenced by 33% bookings, our highest momentum since 2017. Yes, it is true that COVID brings a great deal of uncertainty, but I believe our business mix and indeed our growing competitiveness will help us on a relative basis come what may. Ransomware attack is regrettable. It is contained. I believe we've managed it well. We've had good client feedback. We've been transparent. We were forthright. The impact is on revenue and margin primarily in Q2. There will be some residual costs that we will incur in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to harden and strengthen our security position, and that is an absolute no-regret spend. Fundamentally, our strategy is sound, it resonates with clients and you're seeing that show up now in our numbers. And last but not least, we're 100% focused on executing that strategy. And our client-centricity is greater than ever and we expect to accelerate out of the corner once we got through COVID-19.So, with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody. Today I'd like to cover four topics with you including, a summary of our second quarter performance, an update on our purpose, vision and strategy, some thought on the macro demand environments and evolving client needs and an update on our efforts to ensure the highest levels of resiliency to our clients. Before I proceed with our second quarter earnings call, I would like to add some commentary to today's announcement that Karen McLoughlin has decided to retire from Cognizant after more than eight years as Chief Financial Officer and an incredibly successful career in the company spanning almost 70 years. During this time Karen's role in helping Cognizant become one of the world's leading professional services companies cannot be overstated. It's been a privilege to work with Karen over the past 16 months and I am forever indebted for her assistance and leadership. Karen, on behalf of the entire Cognizant family, I'd like to thank you for your many contributions to Cognizant. You\u2019ve done a fantastic job and can be proud of your accomplishments. We wish you nothing, but success in your future endeavors. We are excited to welcome Jan Siegmund to Cognizant. Jan has been accomplished executive with a wealth of experience in finance, strategy and general management. Jan will join us in the CFO role on September 01, 2020. Karen will continue in her capacity as CFO through August 31st and then remain with us in an advisory role through December 31, 2020, thereby ensuring a smooth CFO transition. Most recent Jan served as Chief Financial Officer of ADP, a role which he held for seven years. It follow that many of you will recognize his name and will experiencing engaging with Jan in the past. You'll understand therefore why is the right choice to be our next CFO and why I look forward to working alongside him. Now let's go back to our earnings, I'm pleased with our second quarter performance. Faced with the unprecedented challenges of global pandemic and the ransomware attack that impacted our operations, we executed well. We stay true to our digital strategy and fulfilled the responsibilities to our multiple stakeholders, including our associates, our clients, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate. Second quarter revenue was $4 million, a decline of 2.5% year-over-year in constant currency. And this included a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain nonstrategic content services business, which we announced in Q3 2019. We have now fully exited this subset of services. Our associates are the true heroes of the quarter not just in my eyes, but also the eyes of our clients who are at the center of everything we do. Associates around the world quickly adopted to work from home conditions, staying productive and help our client successfully navigate the initial shock of the pandemic and when we became the victim of a ransomware attack in April, their instinctive client-centricity kicked in. We intentionally ensured that we were highly visible, transparent and cooperative with clients who recognize our perseverance and professionalism and how hard we work to ensure their mission-critical services were uninterrupted. Therefore, I want to thank our leadership team and all our associates throughout the world for their dedication to our clients and their contribution to our performance in the quarter. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates. We communicate regularly and transparently with them and have equipped them for virtual working and rewarded a large portion of our associate base with a 25% salary increase payment for the month of April to recognize their extraordinary continuity of services efforts. People are the heart of our business, so employee engagement is therefore critical and I'm pleased to report that our recent annual companywide people engagement survey shows that our engagement scores are up across all major categories. Karen will bring you through the details of the quarter, but I wanted to emphasize two salient points. First, we are gaining commercial momentum. This is illustrated by our bookings trends, which grew 40% year-over-year in the first half of 2020 notwithstanding the challenges we face in the quarter. North America, which grew 25% plus in the first half is particularly strong. This was offset by declines in global growth markets given the signature of the Samlink agreement in Q2 2019. Excluding the impact of Samlink, total company booking grew 25% plus in the first half 2020 and global growth market bookings grew in the mid teens. Our bookings momentum is broad-based across our service lines and industries. Bookings accelerated through Q2 with June being an exceptional month. Moreover leading indicators are strong with qualified pipeline up double digits year-over-year and win rates continue to be solid. Second, we are making noteworthy progress in digital. In the second quarter, revenue in digital grew 14% year-over-year and now represents 42% of our digital -- of our company revenue mix. First half 2020 digital bookings growth of almost 50% was fueled by digital engineering, AI and analytics, interactive and software as a service. I'm confident that our digital momentum will continue given the strength of leading indicators. Clients are also highly receptive to Cognizant's digital capabilities given not just our strong portfolio and strong customer satisfaction, but also their desire to see us challenge digital incumbents, importantly, it's becomes the virtual circle as the greater our digital mix, the greater our overall company growth prospects. This takes me to second topic, which is about purpose and vision and their connection to engagement values and our strategy. The executive leadership team and I have given a great deal of thought to how we optimize the engagement we get from our 280,000 person knowledge business, which spans multigenerational and a diverse workforce. In recent months, we set out to develop and communicate a purpose and vision statement, as well as reviewing the values that establish how we work. We believe this is an important and it's part of our long-term success and we will be rolling out what we're calling the Cognizant agenda to the entire company in August. It's worth taking a moment to run through the key elements of this. We define Cognizant's purpose this way. We engineer modern businesses to improve everyday life. This statement explains why we're in business and serves as our inspirational North Star and driving force. Our purpose also conveyed that while we are B2B company, the work we do with and for our clients helps improve the lives of billions of people. Most important, it rings true with our culture as evidenced by how well we dealt with the unprecedented challenges of recent months. To measure how well we're living our purpose and clarify what we aspire to achieve, we set out a vision to become the preeminent technology services partner to the global 2000 C-suite. This is where our strategy comes into play as we aim to execute a series of bold moves to realize our vision and these actions call for us to accelerate digital, optimize our core business, transform our commercial model, supercharge our talents and enhance our reputation. Accelerating digital is at the heart of our strategy and I have two fundamental beliefs on this topic. First, we are still in the early stages of digital and the COVID-19 pandemic is single-handedly significantly accelerating the shift to digital and second, Cognizant is a global scale portfolio and strategic client relationships to be one of the single biggest beneficiaries of the shift in the coming years. Put simply, digital creates an enormous opportunity for Cognizant and we intend to capture this. While the industry has been talking about digital transformation for years, many companies have yet make the transition to a fully digital operating model instead digitizing only select operations. In a matter of months, COVID-19 has exposed the extent of the digital divide between digital natives and traditional companies. Migrating infrastructure application and data states to a more flexible resilient and cost-effective cloud architecture to the start with in itself insufficient. Clients are increasingly shifting their focus to modernizing their core processes to be truly agile so that they can continually improve the value proposition and experience the offer to their customers and employees and our strategy is built on our ability to leverage our strength in the applications and data management service layers. To enable agile workflows to our clients, can deliver customer and business value simultaneously. We fully execute this strategy. We withdrawn our broad portfolio and a rich heritage of delivery excellence, partly with our clients to deliver business outcomes with innovative solutions that leverage our internal capabilities and those of our partner ecosystem. Winning in digital requires a broad ecosystem of partners and therefore, as cloud computing has changed the way IT has delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms. We have meaningfully increased our partnership focus and investments with all three leading hyperscale companies and our most strategic software as a service partners. We've complemented organic investments with a targeted M&A strategy focused 100% on digital. Earlier in the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Collaborative Solutions, one of the world's largest workday consultancies. With its leading position in the workday ecosystem, Collaborative Solutions expands our opportunity in cloud by establishing a new practice in its large fast growing market. It also differentiates us in particular against offshore competitors. Yesterday we announced our fifth cloud-related acquisition of the past year, New Signature, one of the world's largest independent Microsoft public cloud transformation specialist that serves all three Microsoft clouds. This will provide a foundation for a dedicated Microsoft business group within Cognizant. Underscoring our success in executing our strategy, we were recently named the 2020 Microsoft Partner of the Year for SAP on Azure as well as the leader in Gartner's 2020 magic quadrant portfolio infrastructure professional and managed services worldwide. Let's turn now to the demand environment and I'll start with some positive news. First, micro demand although still uncertain in better that we anticipated in April. Second, revenue growth in bookings momentum improved through the second quarter. Third, we remain confident that our digital, clients, industry and geographic revenue mix positions us favorably and fourth, clients are consolidating vendors as they seek more strategic partners to help them through the implications of COVID-19. This is favorable for Cognizant. In fact, we are increasingly seen as a strategic partner, not just in the run-off rate but also in digital. We are nonetheless cautious about macro demand environment, while the fiscal stimulus has helped, higher unemployment rates remain a concern, COVID-19 cases were on the rise in many states and countries and many of the seats with executives I speak with, are breaking for a period of prolonged economic disruption. Therefore, the footpath forward may be one of continued caution. This means continued rigor on discretionary spending, the protection of key skills and targeted investments for growth. So what does the future hold? We believe the implications of the pandemic will be broad and lasting. The nature of work in our society will change across many dimensions, including how we interact, communicate, embrace technology and think about risk. The practical limitations of business are consequential and go well beyond the return to office timelines, business continuity planning, the question of the shift to virtual agile or questions about the future of business travel or commercial real estate policies, both of which I believe will be changed forever. I think of clients and prospects every single day and many seems to be moving through three broad stages. First, the commitments to keep their employees safe and their business is running without interruption. Second, an adoption phase to the new normal, which includes the considerable technological and human implications of working from anywhere and third, the need to truly embrace digital to stay competitive. This requires them to fully modernized their businesses across infrastructure, data and applications. There is an increasing recognition that we were in a mobile virtual and personal era for clients and employees expect always on an ubiquitous consumer grade software experiences with rich visualization tools, data integration and data protection. These needs are reflected in changing client needs and buying behavior. We see clients embrace agile development and platforms of micro services that foster innovation, unlock the power of data and offer efficiency, security, scalability and agility. This requirement aligns directly with our strategy to win in digital including cloud, AI and analytics, digital engineering and IoT. To help clients grapple with the changes brought by COVID-19, we've also developed capabilities to help them prosper in the post-COVID world. These offerings which span our portfolio includes the following. Virtual workplace an enterprise-level solution that helps companies achieve resilience and maintain productivity even in massive disruption. Data modernization, which helps clients fix how they source, interpret and consume information through flexible data structures and a modern data and analytics platform and Cognizant safe buildings, which combines layered prevention controls with instrumentation, data analytics and digital technologies to help make building safe for occupancy by providing robust monitoring and visualization capabilities. Recognize too that COVID-19 coincided with a period of societal turmoil amid significant questions about racial justice, globalization and corporate social responsibility to not only our clients businesses and technological requirements changing, but so too are the demands of their vendors and people underscore our intensified commitment to social responsibility. Cognizant and its foundations have a long history of contributing to the health, well-being, education and progress of the communities in which we live and work. In April, for example we announced an initial 10 million philanthropic commitment to support communities around the world in addressing COVID-19's immediate and long-term impacts. In June, the Cognizant US foundation announced a $5 million commitment to communities of color, the continuation of its long-standing work to advance education, training and career pathways for underrepresented populations across the US. And in late 2019, as we announced our decision to exit a subset of content moderation, we allocated $5 million to fund research aimed at reducing users exposure to objectionable content. We're also proud to support global work to remediate COVID-19. More than 100,000 researchers and clinicians are now using our shared investigator platform, a life sciences software-as-a-service solution and some of their work is focused on accelerating the development of COVID-19 therapies through virtual clinical trial processes. We're also providing a team of our life sciences experts to support Verily, the health and life sciences company of Alphabet, with it's baseline of COVID-19 testing program to increase individual access to scheduling. In the wake of the unprecedented clean challenges of COVID-19 and an ransomware attack, we like many of our clients are increasingly focused on improving our business resiliency, especially within our delivery and technology organizations. Let me first address delivery. While I'm extremely proud of our delivery team, and how well they enable the safety of our associates and continuity of mission-critical services for our clients, the pandemic highlighted the need to increase the robustness and resiliency of our delivery operations. We are taking a fresh look at our delivery organization and defining a next-generation delivery model that will extend the work we've done in recent years to further globalize our network of delivery centers across the globe, which will complement our India hub. This will ensure greater resiliency, enable us to better service our client's needs for scrum teams nearshore and onshore and give us greater access to global talent. Automation will of course be pervasive to grab. And on the point of technology, I've appointed a new head of technology and strategy who will report directly to me and focus on informing our strategy, digitizing our business and strengthening our IT and security capabilities. Their first priority when they start next week on August 3, will be to complete our IT and securities remediation efforts. We've devoted substantial time and resources toward remediation and as a result have made significant progress in recent months. Not only have we essentially completely contained and eradicated ransomware, we've also begun what we expect will be a multi-quarter initiative to refresh and strengthen our approach to security. A subcommittee of the Board of Directors will help me provide oversight of these efforts, which is being conducted in conjunction with external security experts. In closing for several quarters I've been speaking with you about our multiyear effort to reposition Cognizant to achieve its full growth potential, as we execute the initiatives of the transformation office. We've not let COVID-19 or ransomware distract us from his work and we've made steady progress across many dimensions, including accelerating our digital strategy, globalizing Cognizant and increasing our relevance to clients. These teams require ongoing investments including our portfolio of brands, our talent and our partnerships. While more work is needed in the quarters ahead, I am confident about Cognizant's growing stature and our competitive position. We're controlling what we can control, making progress in our competitiveness relative to peers and positioning ourselves for commercial momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen and will now take you through the details of the quarter and our outlook before going to questions and answers. Karen, over to you. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start with my prepared remarks I'd like to take a moment to say that my 17 years at Cognizant have been more rewarding than I could have ever imagined. During my eight years as CFO, we have grown from 138,000 associate and about $6.1 billion in annual revenue to over 280,000 associate and over $16 billion in annual revenue today and I'm very proud of our achievements along the way. I've been honored and privileged to work alongside our associates around the world with passion and commitment to our client, our colleagues and our community never ceases to amaze me. This is a very special company with a wonderful future. I am so pleased to pass the baton to Jan Siegmund, who, as many of you know is a very accomplished executive. I am confident Jan will do a wonderful job working alongside Brian and the rest of the Cognizant team to lead the company forward. In the meantime, I look forward to working with Jan, Brian and the rest of the Cognizant team through the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition. Now let me turn to our results. Second quarter revenue of $4 billion declined 3.4% year-over-year or 2.5% in constant currency including a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain content related services and a negative 90 basis points from the ransomware attack impact on fulfillment, the latter which was skewed towards our financial services and healthcare segment. After working through COVID-19 related fulfillment challenges early in the quarter, we saw improved momentum in May and June driven by double-digit growth in our digital service offerings, particularly in areas such as cloud and enterprise application services, IT modernization and digital engineering. Moving to the industry verticals, we're all of the growth rate provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services declined 4.3% with softness in both banking and insurance. We continue to see weakness across global banking accounts. Capital markets which is roughly 40% of total banking revenue continues to be under the most pressure and additionally, the macro backdrop has negatively impacted client in the payment sector, particularly those with significant exposure to travel and hospitality volume. Healthcare grew 2.2% led by strong double-digit growth in life sciences in Europe primarily driven by the Zenith Technologies acquisition. Within our healthcare vertical, revenue declined low single digit. I want to highlight that the leading indicators of our healthcare business including software license sales, new logos, qualified pipeline and booking are significantly better than one year ago. Products and resources declined 5% with double digit growth in manufacturing, logic logistics, energy and utilities offset by double-digit declines in travel and hospitality and retail and consumer goods where we expect continued pressure in the second half of the year as a result of the ongoing pandemic. In manufacturing and logistics, we are expanding our wallet share with our largest accounts and saw an uptick in deal wins leveraging our strengthened partnerships with both cloud and SaaS providers. Communications, media and technology declined 3.2% including the approximately negative $48 million impact of technology from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business where the vast majority of our work has now ramped down. Excluding this negative 790 basis points impact, we saw approximately 5% growth in communications, media and technology. Performance was flat in communications and media as growth of certain communications client was offset by a weakness with entertainment clients exposed to studios, cable TV and theme parks. We expect continued pressure in media and entertainment in the second half of the year. Overall the demand environment in the second half remains uncertain, but we believe that we are gaining competitiveness across industries. As Brian mentioned, booking and pipeline are solid and we've made progress strengthening our partnerships. Here are a few examples of how we are working with our strategic technology partners. A client in the tollroad operator business had legacy systems located in primary and backup data centers just a mile apart from each other jeopardizing resiliency. The client was also experiencing the liability and performance issues with its commercial back office and CRM business applications. We migrated there on-prim back office, external website and all databases to AWS in just two months, streamlining all customer interactions. We are now building the new back office on an open source serverless architecture, enabling annual savings of up to 40% in infrastructure operational costs. And with Verizon's ThingSpace IoT platform now integrated with Microsoft Azure, Cognizant is the first company to leverage the combined solution platform to develop its own IoT-enabled application on cold chain to support pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries impacted by the pandemic. Temperature sensitive products can now be monitored to ensure product integrity from shipping through to the consumer and Cognizant and Google Cloud are already working with financial services organizations to modernize legacy platforms and digitally transform core banking. For multiple banks we're running core banking solutions based on Temenos technology with Google Cloud. Moving on to margins, in Q2 our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 11.7% and $0.67 respectively. Adjusted operating margins, which excludes restructuring and COVID related charges of 14.1% and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.82. COVID-related charges were $25 million in the quarter primarily related to the previously announced one-time salary adjustment in April that we gave to certain employees in India and the Philippines. Adjusted operating margin was down 200 basis points year-over-year, due to a 140 basis points impact from ransomware, including both the revenue and the cost impact, which together with higher incentive based compensation and lower revenue offset savings from items such as lower C&E and the favorable movement in the rupee. Margins were also negatively impacted by the downtime incurred by employees during the transition to working from home, the sudden reduction in demand late in the first quarter and the time it set us to reduce headcount and other costs accordingly. Additionally, during the quarter, we continue to execute against the 2020 Fit for Growth plan, which is designed to improve our cost structure and fund investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. In Q2 we incurred $59 million of charges as part of this plan, including $8 million related to the exit of a subset of our content services business. The majority of the remaining charges were related to the previously announced actions to correct our pyramid structure. Net headcount declined approximately 2.5% year-over-year including the roughly 7,000 associates exited under the Fit for Growth plan. These cost actions as well as increased rigor in our performance management process are reflected in our elevated annualized attrition rate of 24%. Voluntary attrition continue the downward trend we've seen over the last four quarters to approximately 11% in Q2. Exiting Q2, the majority of the actions under Fit for Growth are complete and we have achieved over $425 million in annualized gross run rate savings. We still expect annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in 2021 and charge to be in the $170 million to $200 million range. And as we've said previously, we will continue to adjust our cost structure in accordance with the macro environment while we continue to invest in areas that further our digital positioning. Savings achieved from the Fit for Growth plan are funding investments to help accelerate growth in key areas such as sales and sales-support hiring, investments in accelerating the growth of our digital portfolio, marketing and branding, investments to further digitize Cognizant, enhancing the resiliency and robustness of our delivery network to increase automation and additional nearshore and onshore capabilities to further diversify our delivery footprint and provide greater access to talent and recruiting and rescaling the top talent. In the first half of 2020, we saw total learning hours consumed grow by double-digits. And we are among the first companies globally to clock 1 million learning hours on key virtual learning platforms. Now turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of June 30 stood at $4.6 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Our outstanding net balances include the approximate $1.7 million drawn on our revolving credit facility in the first quarter of 2020. In the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Collaborative Solutions and yesterday announced that we have signed an agreement to acquire New Signature. And today, we announced that our board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share. In this environment, we continue to prioritize using our balance sheet for targeted acquisitions, and at this point, have not resumed our share repurchase program. Year-to-date we have deployed $550 million on share buybacks, repurchasing over 9 million shares at an average price of $59 per share. We will continue to reevaluate the appropriate time to restart that program, which still has approximately $1.8 billion of remaining authorization. Overall, we feel that our balance sheet is very healthy and provides us the flexibility needed in the current environment to run the business, while continuing to invest. We had a strong cash flow quarter, generating $886 million of free cash flow. This included the benefit of approximately $380 million in government-offered deferrals of certain tax payments in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, which will now be paid in the second half of 2020 through 2022. Excluding these benefits, free cash flow was approximately 140% of net income. DSO of 77 days was flat year-over-year. Now turning to guidance. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, and the pace of recovery complicated by the evolving nature of the coronavirus pandemic. So there continues to be a number of factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. Additionally, while we are pleased with the solid bookings and pipeline numbers we have seen in the business year-to-date, how that pipeline converts to revenue will likely correspond to the pace of economic recovery, and thus client confidence and spend. That said, we do believe we have better visibility in the business today than when we reported our Q1 earnings in May, and therefore, are providing full year 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we expect revenue to decline in the range of 2% to down 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to a decline of 2.2% to down 0.7% or $16.41 billion to $16.66 billion on a reported basis, reflecting our assumption of a negative 20 basis point foreign exchange impact for the full year. This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 130 basis points to revenue year-over-year in both Q3 and Q4 from our decision to exit certain work within our content services business, which will be reflected in our CMP segment. This guidance continues to reflect a muted outlook for Financial Services and the retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality portion of our Products and Resources segment. For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 15%, which assumes incremental cost associated with the remediation of the ransomware attack, wage increases and promotions for certain of our associates effective October 1 and incentive compensation above 2019 levels. Following the typical seasonality of the business, we expect Q3 revenue and adjusted operating margin to be higher than Q4. Our current guidance assumes that Q4 revenue will be negatively impacted by lower bill days versus Q3 and a typical cycle of furloughs. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.48 to $3.58. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 543 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27% in the second half of the year. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes restructuring charges and other unusual items, if any, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to immigration or tax policies. With that, operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Karen, I wanted to wish you good luck. Karen McLoughlin : Thank you, Bryan. Bryan Bergin : So first question here. Within your outlook, are you assuming 2Q was a trough from a growth perspective across each industry segment? So any sub-verticals that may weaken further before improving? And I heard your comment here at the end, Karen, as far as bill days for 4Q. But really my question is more so from a demand standpoint. Karen McLoughlin : Yeah. So I think -- and so I'll ask Brian to also chime in. But I think from a demand perspective, we're predicting relatively consistent trends as we move into the back part of the year as we saw in Q2. Certainly, as we said on the call, in our prepared remarks, travel and hospitality, retail and consumer goods, we expect will continue to be under significant pressure in the back part of the year. Similarly, we are not expecting any significant recovery in Financial Services, whether that be either banking or insurance. But I do think Healthcare, certainly, we continue to expect some improvement in Healthcare as we get into the back part of the year. We had talked earlier in Q1, obviously, that in Q2, barring what happened with COVID and the ransomware that the Healthcare payer business would have started to get stronger, and certainly we've seen strengthening in their pipeline. And then we would expect to see continued good growth from our manlog sort of manufacturing, energy and utilities business as well as life sciences and the tech business once you back out the content services business. So I think really generally speaking, the same trends that we've seen in recent months. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just on the bookings number. Can you give us a sense on how much of this is new versus renewals? And Brian, can you clarify the 25% figure you noted, I thought I heard it was ex-Samlink? Is that accurate? And is this an area as you think about bookings to something you intend to provide more disclosure on going forward? Brian Humphries : Hi, Bryan. So yes, we grew bookings 14% in the first half, with particular strength in the digital, which grew almost 50% in the first half and then a few industries, like Healthcare, also grew very strong so too did insurance. And the reference we made to Samlink related to our global growth markets bookings, North America grew 25% plus in the first half, global growth markets was down. But in Q2, in the prior year period, we had our biggest deal in a long, long time. And I hate to normalize for bookings, and that's not how you should expect me to talk about very often, but were you to exclude that, global growth markets also grew 15% plus in the first half of the year and the total company grew 25%. Look, to be honest, when we start thinking about then the RAD model and then hunting versus farming, we actually feel very good about our momentum both in renewals as well as in new business. We've also clearly tracked the new hires of the 500 plus people, of which about two-thirds were quota-bearing and the rest were some ports. We see those to have been self-funding in the first half of this year and they're bringing through good TCV and decent margins, which more than covers the costs of those resources. So it gives us food for thought in terms of continuing to invest for growth on a go forward basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward Caso : Hi, good evening. All the best, Karen. Can you talk a little bit about the contribution from the acquisitions. I'm thinking that Collaborative was on the $150 million per year range and Signature in the sort of the $50 million to $60 million range. Can you sort of -- what's baked in the guidance? And then my second question is, give us an update sort of how much M&A are you looking for as part of your plan to sort of grow from here? Thank you. Karen McLoughlin : So I can take that, Ed, and then Brian can chime in about the future. But first of all, thank you for the nice comment. Inorganic revenue in the quarter was about two points, but Collaborative, as you know, didn't close until late in the quarter, so very small contribution in the quarter. We have not broken out the full year revenue from Collaborative, but obviously, that is baked into our guidance for the remainder of the year. And New Signature, again, we've signed it, but we have not closed and do not expect to close until later this quarter. So in terms of the back half of the year, we'll will have a very small immaterial impact on revenue. But Brian, perhaps, you want to talk about acquisitions going forward. Brian Humphries : Yeah. So hi, Ed. So first of all, I don't really wake up in the morning and think about how many points of growth I want to achieve next year from M&A. I think about the portfolio and our strategy and where we have gaps and where there are logical plays that can complement what we're setting out to achieve. And as you know, first and foremost, our strategy is all about accelerating digital. And therefore, the five or so deals we've done have always been 100% aligned to digital, which is why I think we've been able to feel good about deploying capital, and the board obviously have been very supportive of us in that regard as well. I will continue to use M&A as a means to support the strategy. We will do it thoughtfully, of course. I don't want anybody feel as though we take anything for granted. But in the same vein, we are organically investing behind our strategic priorities. So while we've done a series of cloud acquisitions in the last year, we have also set aside tens of millions of dollars to invest in hyperscale partners and SaaS vendors with a view to accelerating or cloud practices. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. First, congratulations, Karen. Of course, we will miss you. Brian, can you just comment based on what you're seeing with clients in the sales pipeline? How confident you are that the IT spending will remain strong as we sort of transition out of pandemic mode into recession mode? I mean, so far it's been just remarkably strong, but obviously, typically in a recession, it dips. So how -- what's your sort of confidence or how would you handicap that as you're looking out to the rest of the year? Thank you. Brian Humphries : Yeah. Look, it's a broad question, Lisa, but macro demand for the services sector, as you know, came in stronger than expected in this earnings cycle. And I actually believe that within that, we as a company, are becoming much more competitive. And hopefully, our bookings trends and our win rates and qualified pipeline illustrate that's as indeed as our digital growth and our digital mix, which augurs well for our future. I'm seeing trends of substantial acceleration through the second quarter, both in terms of bookings and indeed in terms of revenue. I'm also seeing trends amongst clients where budgets are certainly being reduced in the run-off rate space, and therefore, pricing pressure follow. So of course, automation and efficiencies and industrialization is important as is knowing what to build yourself versus what to partner on. So clearly digital is accelerating and I actually believe that COVID will single-handedly meaningfully accelerate digital. And clients will realize that digital transformation is not one or two outliers in the portfolio, they fundamentally have to get through use cases and workflows and make sure that they digitize all of that for the benefit of their clients and indeed their employees. Digital for us grew, from a bookings point of view, 50% in the first half of the year. And what was very interesting for me, as you go through the data and interrogate it is that about 75% of our digital bookings in the quarter entered the pipeline since Q1, i.e., in the first six months of the year with about 50% of the bookings being created and closed in the same quarter. So there is tremendous velocity through the channel as well. I also think clients are looking at opportunities to consolidate vendors, certainly as they're looking for commercial constructs or financial constructs that are appealing to them. They are looking at companies with strong balance sheets, companies that are willing to invest. And Lisa, I think these trends are favorable to Cognizant. If I've heard it once, I've heard it 20 times in the last month or two that Cognizant showing up more favorably is ultimately illustrative of the fact that we are unquestionably strong in run-off rate would increasingly accept it as a viable challenger brand in digital. And therefore, in any consolidation play, we will naturally in my opinion figure amongst the down-select. So I feel very, very good about our competitive position, our relative strength. We're closing the gap with the competitors, as you've seen, and I'm confident that clients will continue to spend in the second half, but along the lines of what I articulated. Last but not least, there are some large opportunities in the pipeline. Certainly, the industry or the competitors have also talked about those. In some cases, people are looking at reviewing their captive strategies, etc. I am absolutely focused on digital acceleration. We will continue to look at run-off rate and taking over some captives, but we always look about the notion of whether those businesses are accretive to our growth CAGR or dilutive. And while one can get a year-over-year quick apples-to-orange compare and the benefits, we're ultimately trying to build a book of business that is allowing us to have a faster CAGR your growth profile into the future, as is the case with the companies we have been acquiring. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you very much. Brian or Karen, I'll direct this towards you. And I want to try to understand the puts and takes associated with the targeted operating margin of 15% for this year. And what I meant is just falling into three buckets. One is, are there still cost that's benefits are going to flow through from the 14% that you reported to get to that 15% number versus the second force, I think about as revenue variances that obviously benefit the bottom line versus the third dynamic, Brian, that you mentioned repeatedly was investing for the business. And so I'm just wondering what are the drivers? And part of the reason why I want to understand the second half dynamics, but also as a jumping-off point as we begin to think about calendar year '21? Thank you. Brian Humphries : So I'll pitch upon Karen, if you will, the notion of investments. And Karen, if you want to touch upon then the dynamics in the second half guidance. Keith, we're not really thinking about '21 at this moment in time. Of course, we're doing a lot of work on it internally, but it's very hard to understand what's coming in the next six months, never mind the next 18 months. That being said, as ever, we will always focus on what we can control and inherent to that is our cost structure and making sure from a margin rate point of view, if the market is not volatile on the top-line, we should obviously do our best to optimize our margin rate. Specific to investments, yeah, listen, we are committed to winning and becoming preeminent in technical consulting and to be one of the leading professional services firms in the world. In order to do so, we have a series of transitions we have to make, scaling international markets, getting much more commercial coverage out there, continue to industrialize our delivery capabilities and globalizing the company as well as changing some of the brand attributes and a lot of that requires capabilities and skills. And then none of that is arguably more important than ensuring we accelerate our digital capabilities, which requires personalities, skills, talent, brand attributes, partnership ecosystem, coverage, not just from a general sales point of view, but also a specialist sales point of view. So we are committed to investing for the medium and long-term. As you know, I take my quarters very seriously. So we like to manage, I guess, our commitments in the short-term. But the fundamental principle we're setting out to achieve here is to accelerate on the medium term, the growth profile of the company to get back to what we've always been good at and inherent to that will be continued investments of the company. That's what we did and set out to achieve in 2020. Notwithstanding COVID and ransomware, we had still stayed true to our strategy of investing in digital, investing in sales coverage and so too, will you see us take the same principles into 2021. Karen, over to you for the second half guidance. Karen McLoughlin : Sure. Thanks, Brian, and hi, Keith. So I think in terms of how we thought about the second half margin guidance, we said approximately 15% for the full year, which puts the second half at about 15.2%. And if you think about what happened in the first half of the year, Q2 margins came in at 14.1%, and then for the first half we were at 15.2%. As we look forward, and I think about this more sequentially as we get into the back part of the year, obviously the COVID -- any COVID fulfillment issues and the revenue impact from Maze are behind us, but we will continue to have remediation cost as we get into the back part of the year. We have wages and promotions, that as we said, will take place in as effective as of October, so that will certainly put pressure on the Q4 margins. And then obviously, we're not expecting a significant acceleration in revenue based on the guidance that we've provided on a sequential basis. So those are really the biggest pieces of this. And then additionally, obviously, we've got the acquisitions. So anytime we close an acquisition, there are obviously deal costs and integration costs and so forth, which while not individually material, certainly as we look forward sequentially into the back part of the year, just given the timing of the acquisitions, both when Collaborative closed late in Q2 as well as the New Signature deal in the back half of the year will put a little bit of pressure on those margins as we get into the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Moshe Katri : Thanks. Great working with you, Karen, and best of luck. A couple of things. First, maybe to Brian. Are you comfortable that you're done with some of the actions that you wanted to take, I guess, on the sales front, on the executive team front? And maybe can you give us some color on where we are in terms of attrition more on the senior side of the headcount? Thanks. Brian Humphries : Yeah. From an executive committee point of view, there are few more changes that are happening that we've spoken about previously. We are -- we've upgraded the profile of the managing director role in India to be a direct report to the executive committee, to me. And therefore, we have a search underway and that will ensure we have somebody based in India who will represent our 200,000 employees in India. We'd expect to fill that in the coming months. We also have a global growth markets interim leader at the moment who is doing a fantastic job for us. And we actually have signed somebody who will join the company in the foreseeable future. However, I am not today at liberty to announce who that person is. But that being said, the executive committee now is my team. We're fully onboard, fully committed, driving in the same direction. And I actually feel now I have a A Team, a world-class organization around me to bring this company forward. And I know, Jan has big shoes to fill from Karen, but he will step in and I think culturally will be a great fit for us. With regards to the rest of the organization, voluntary attrition has declined now to about 10.5%. And this is the fourth quarter in a row that we've had voluntary attrition declines. But in the same vein, what we have been doing very intentionally has been to continue to deploy much more of a performance orientation in the company, which means that we are now removing the underperformers on an annual basis. And then on top of that, given the volatility we've seen in the top-line, in the early part of this year, notably because of COVID, it goes without saying that we have responsibilities vis-a-vis, our shareholders, yes, to protect digital skills. But in the same vein, we also have to protect the bottom line by optimizing our team and our bench around the revenue curve. And that's why you've seen in recent quarters a disparity between total attrition levels versus voluntary attrition levels or involuntary levels. And if you look in the supplementary slides, we've actually now started breaking that item on a quarterly basis. So you will see a four quarter trend emerge. I feel very good about the direction we're taking the company. We have just completed actually, earlier this year, what we call Cognizant's People Engagement Survey. And actually, the survey results show that our results are very often better than industry across major categories and up in almost every category in the last two years. So I think morale is actually picking up. I think when we execute well, and I believe our employees were the heroes of this quarter, despite an extremely challenging environments, we executed well and delivered against our commitments, and I think success breeds success. So I'm feeling very good about our ability to continue to engage and motivate and attract world-class talent to Cognizant. Moshe Katri : That's helpful. And then given the fact that digital is going to be one of those main drivers down the road, and you've indicated that you've had a pretty significant uptick in digital bookings here, I guess, for the first half of the year. Are you -- maybe we can get some more color on some of those wins. Are you kind of going head-to-head against some of the pure plays? Are you actually going back and getting some of these deals from existing customers? How does that -- how it's actually working? Brian Humphries : Look, I've got to be honest. I feel really ecstatic about our momentum in digital. We're doing a tremendous job. I mean, first half bookings growth was fueled by digital engineering, AI and analytics, interactive, and indeed, our software-as-a-service offerings. And we are going head-to-head with the incumbents, be they integrated or portfolio companies or pure plays and winning more than our fair share. And if anything, what I'm finding is clients are highly receptive to our capabilities and to our portfolio, not all of them knew about that portfolio historically. And so, we're being much more aggressive in getting out there, marketing our digital capabilities and going to market with a broad partnership system. And of course, all of that leads to a wonderful outcome that the faster we grow digital, the bigger it becomes as a percentage of our revenue. And therefore, that pays dividends in terms of the overall future company CAGR prospects. So I truly feel we're in a wonderful position. And I feel very confident about our competitive dynamics. And we're happy to get in the boxing ring with any competitor. And I think we'll win more than our fair share. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you so much. And Karen, wish you all the best. Thanks for the partnership after all these years. My question builds on what Moshe just asked. I'm just -- I'm curious with voluntary attrition trending better -- and thanks for the data, by the way. It sounds like you're mostly done with the headcount cuts. Can we say that the culture is in a good place here, Brian? And it's a hard question to answer, I know, but what I'm getting at is just this concept of transitioning to growth with the culture and we're seeing this growing divide across a lot of tech firms now where the culture between legacy and digital firms is quite stark. So where do you fall in that spectrum versus where you want to be? Is there a way to address that here on the call? Thanks. Brian Humphries : Well, I think it goes without saying that if there ever is a growth culture and the company with a growth culture, it is Cognizant. And maybe in recent years we had lost our mojo a little bit, but this company is full of people who pride themselves in serving clients and actually outgunning the competition. And that's certainly how I feel we will continue to be focus in the years ahead. So I feel very good about our capabilities and very good about the culture, not just an aggressive culture, but also a culture of focus on client centricity and a culture of focus on continuous learning and making sure we have look wherewithal to go out and outcompete the competition. Again, I'm not at all concerned about that. I actually think the place where we have sharpened our pencils a little bit in the last year has been much more around partnering with the hyperscalers and making sure that as the world shifts to platform and micro services and open APIs, etc. that we are fully in ensconced with those characters and making sure that we are showing up to clients together. But generally, I feel as our culture is a winning culture, it's a growth culture and it's a culture that's always been about being a challenger and beating the competition. We certainly have strong credentials. I see that every single day when I talk to clients and I see a tremendous amount of receptivity to Cognizant's ambition to win in digital. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : Hey, Brian. So my question is simply, you're definitely feeling much better about bookings and competitiveness now than it appears you were a year ago. Can you just articulate what's the main change that's happened that's giving you this added confidence? How much of the change is the market turning maybe more in your favor vertically and with certain parts of digital? And how much of it is -- you talked about client centricity changing the culture and so on. Can you articulate what the main thing that's recently changed that's making your outlook on competitiveness sounds so much better? Brian Humphries : Well, I think first of all, the quality of the dialog that we're having as an executive committee, the level of engagement, level of harmony at the executive team is now truly what I would term world-class. We are all in this together. We're all partnering and teaming and we've got the whole organization I think motivated to win. And I don't want to underestimate the benefit of having a focus on growth and a reinvigorated focus on client centricity. I think at the client partner level, we've had that over the years. But perhaps in more recent years, we had a number of distractions on the outside, and perhaps even some financial model changes that didn't allow us to do what I think we need to do. So I feel very good about the harmony of the team, the level of energy. And frankly, that is permeating throughout the entire organization. And there's just, again, once again somewhat of a feel good factor happening in Cognizant these days. I think also, we have better instrumentation in the business. I think we have got much more data now at our fingertips than we had a year ago and we've got a stronger partnerships than we had perhaps a year ago. And generally, I think this has not been an easy 15 months or 16 months, there's been a lot of work. And these last few months have been particularly challenging, as everybody can imagine given macro as well as micro elements that are at play, vis-a-vis, Cognizant. But -- and the other thing, digital is a bigger portion of the mix. And let's face it, that's where the growth is in the market. My board have been extremely supportive of our ambitions to scale there. The organic investments are for me and my leadership team to work through, but when it comes to deploying the balance sheet, we obviously have close communication and coordination with the board of directors. And we have been aggressively moving. And in turn, we have scaled out our capabilities meaningfully. And acquisitions like Collaborative Solutions work wonders because our pipeline immediately builds in some of our existing accounts. New signature, similarly, I think you'll see our ability to scale the Microsoft business practice rapidly. So I just think the portfolio is broader. The leadership team are more harmonious. There's more energy. And we're completely focused on winning again. And any external distractions over the last few years are 100% behind us at this moment in time. Katie Royce : Hi. This is Katie. I just want to say thank you all for joining and for your questions. I think that's all the time that we have for tonight. Operator : Once again, thank you for joining us on today conference call.

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Katie. Katie Royce : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's third quarter 2020 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com.  The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everybody, and a warm welcome to Jan, who many of you know, in what is his first Cognizant earnings call. Today, I'd like to address 4 topics with you, namely, a brief summary of the third quarter; an update on our employee engagement; observations on the demand environment and clients' evolving needs; and our strategic focus areas as we aim to revitalize revenue growth.  Let's start with the third quarter. Third quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year in constant currency. Excluding the negative 130 basis points impact from the exit of certain nonstrategic content services business, revenue grew 60 basis points year-over-year. We executed well in what remains a challenging environment. Highlights of the quarter include : continued commercial momentum with bookings growth in excess of 25% year-over-year; ongoing momentum in digital with revenue growth up 13% year-over-year and continued strength in digital bookings and qualified pipeline; gross margin and cash flow strength, enabling us to continually invest in the business; and significantly increased and sustained financial flexibility on India earnings and cash. Jan will provide more insights on the quarter in his prepared remarks.  Moving to our second topic, I would like to briefly address our talented associates. I'm grateful to each of them for their professionalism and perseverance in serving our clients during this protracted pandemic, which has put a tremendous strain on families and compressed their lives to screens and homes. We could not have executed against our commitments in 2020 without their client centricity, work ethic and engagement.  Given our financial performance and in recognition of the contributions of our associates, we are creating 2020 bonuses at higher levels than 2019. We are also implementing targeted merit increases and promotions in the fourth quarter. Both will hurt our cost structure in 2020 versus the prior year, but are an essential and normalized part of the cost structure in the services business.  In stressful times like these, we are especially attentive to employee engagement, a measure of how committed and connected people are to our company. Our recent Cognizant people engagement survey showed scores consistently above industry benchmarks. And our overall engagement score meaningfully increased versus prior surveys.  In an external endorsement of sorts, Forbes Magazine just ranked Cognizant #19 out of 750 companies across 45 countries in its World's Best Employers list. These high levels of employee engagement, coupled with current economic environment, contributed to our fifth consecutive quarter of reductions in voluntary attrition. We anticipate some sequential increases in voluntary attrition in the coming quarters after the forthcoming merit-based promotions and salary increase cycle. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of all our associates, and remain in a work from home and restricted travel posture with only limited exceptions.  Now I'd like to turn to clients, and in particular, the trends we are seeing. These trends fall into 2 categories, 1 cyclical and 1 secular. First, on the cyclical side and set against a protracted pandemic, clients are increasingly decisive on their technology priorities. They are focused on cost savings, CapEx reductions, resiliency and agility. This is slowing large project deployments with extended paybacks, but creating other opportunities. We are seeing accelerated vendor consolidation trends, which we stand to benefit from given our deep strategic relationships and client references in buildup rate, and our enhanced portfolio and growing reputation in digital, where more and more clients want to see us challenge digital incumbents.  Client focus on innovation and cost savings is also creating opportunities for incumbent vendor displacement as larger deals. We plan to be disciplined and selective in our pursuit of larger deals, including captives, as these transactions, if not well conceived, can bring diluted compound annual growth rates, margin pressure and unfavorable terms.  I want to focus my comments on the more consequential secular trend, digital transformation. This is our top priority. It goes to the heart of client business model innovation, transformation and experiences. COVID-19 has widened the digital divide between the digital natives and legacy economy companies, which have struggled to shift to a fully digital operating model. These industrial era companies have focused on upgrading their tech stack at the infrastructure, data and application layers. They have migrated their apps and data to the cloud, and improved the agility of their underlying technology. These improvements, however important, all short of delivering the full power of digital transformation as they optimize the technology foundation rather than the business process or operating model. I believe the industry is at an inflection point in digital adoption.  We see growing client interest in realizing more immediate customer and business value by identifying use cases to shift to agile digital workflows. That means transforming processes to become agile, data-driven and automated. So workflows can be industry-specific such as claims and policy management or pharmacovigilance, or horizontal such as close to cash or digital marketing. In such cases, how we engineered an agile digital workflow for a leading app pro company that needed a return to work and to store strategy. We offered our safe workforce solution, built on the Salesforce work -- platform. This comprehensive employee safety solution provides management with information about public health conditions, office capacity employee health and shift schedules. We can stagger arrival times to minimize contract, encourage hygiene through automated reminders and when connected with IoT centers, help enforce social distancing and occupancy limits.  As more clients implement agile digital workflows, the digital services market is evolving into a third phase. In Phase 1 of digital, clients sought to understand what digital really meant to their industries. In Phase 2, the implemented digital experiments and projects at the edge of their enterprises. In Phase 3, clients realize they must be software-driven enterprises and digital to their core.  So what does this shift to agile digital workflows mean for services companies, and who will be the winners? The first and perhaps most obvious thing to say is that there will be more than one winner. That being said, everything we are doing as a company, from our strategy, solution portfolio, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions, branding and marketing and talent is focused on being one of the biggest beneficiaries of this new phase in digital. To become modern businesses and create business value, companies need to embrace a digital technology stack that consists of : personalized and engaging customer and employee experiences, enabled by software engineering, powered by customer and operational intelligence, driven by data and run on a modern cloud business platform. We haven't always done a great job marketing this, but we are one of the few firms in the world with solutions and partnerships across every layer of this stack.  Inorganic investments have strengthened our SaaS partnerships with both Salesforce and Workday, complementing long-standing relationships with SAP, Oracle and ServiceNow to offer clients the full suite of enterprise application services they require to modernize their core processes and enable agile digital workflows. In the last 6 months, we have further strengthened our partnership commitment to all 3 leading hyperscale providers, announcing the formation of dedicated business groups for both Microsoft and AWS, and investing to enhance our Google Cloud credentials. Whatever approach a client wants to take to become a modern business, our portfolio adds multiple overlaps. Let's say a client wants to start at the bottom of the digital technology stack by accelerating cloud migration. We can do this for them, driving efficiencies that can subsequently be invested in innovation. And that's exactly what we're doing for a global automotive manufacturer that came to us for help to bring agility, innovation and efficiency to their business processes. We started by executing an agile delivery model for core modernization. We then deployed our one DevOps model across the clients, dealers, supply chain, accessories, parts and incentives, improving speed, flexibility and user experience. In another example, we're engaged in partnership with Snowflake in a digital transformation project for a leading financial services firm. We're building a cloud-based intelligent data platform that facilitates multiple analytical and machine-based use cases. This platform unlocks innovation opportunities and value-added use cases, including real-time intelligence for fraud detection, a better user experience for opening and reactivating accounts, a reduction in loan dispute processing time and improved field agent selling effectiveness.  More and more clients are, however, starting at the top of the digital technology stack, by focusing on the customer and employee experience. Such experiences can be continuously improved through the magic of human-centric insights, software product engineering, automation and applied AI. And hyper personalization, all of which ultimately requires clients to embark on a core and data modernization journey.  That's what we did for a large global insurance company -- Cognizant to design, implement and run a new direct-to-consumer business that will provide a compelling AI-enabled interactive experience to consumers and agents. Recognizing this needed to be integrated with existing core systems and data architectures, we then worked with AWS to host this in a scalable modern digital platform.  In these examples, you will see the opportunity to create a flywheel effect, a virtuous cycle, which Cognizant and our clients stand well positioned to benefit from. In a world of vendor consolidation, Cognizant is one of the few firms that can capture this opportunity. I'd now like to turn to the company's future, and our goal to increase our relative commercial momentum and revitalized revenue growth.  In the knowledge-based business, investing for growth starts with attracting, developing and retaining talent. In the last 6 months, we have overhauled our talent management and annual performance evaluation processes, which allow us to develop a diverse, inclusive and high-performance team, where talent is identified and nurtured for promotions. Meanwhile, we have invested in growth by strengthening our country leadership with senior hires in Germany, the Nordics, Australia and Asia Pacific Japan. Earlier this week, we also announced the completion of our Executive Committee with the announcement of our new President for Global Growth Markets, and the newly created role of Executive Vice President and Chairman for Cognizant India. We've also rallied the organization behind what we call the Cognizant Agenda, which articulates our purpose, vision and values. Our vision is to become the preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite. To achieve this, we are aligned behind a series of both moves that require investments.  First, we will meaningfully increase investments in branding and marketing including launching a breakthrough global brand campaign in the coming months. This campaign will reposition the Cognizant brand, and will reach beyond our familiar technology audience to the entire C-suite as well as the next generation of talent. Second, we will continue to accelerate digital. Our priority areas of digital engineering, AI and analytics, cloud and IoT are more relevant than ever to clients. We aim to lead in the third phase of digital, which will require continued investment in M&A, our commercial and delivery capabilities, offer management, talent and branding.  Third, we will continue to globalize Cognizant by investing for growth in targeted countries, strengthening our regional capabilities, scaling our brand internationally and executing a global delivery network that will ensure greater resiliency in our delivery capabilities.  And fourth, we will continue to make investments that increase our relevance to clients by strengthening our industry expertise and technology consulting capabilities, investing in our talent and extending our solution integrator and designer competency. As we invest for growth, we will also continue to leverage our balance sheet to accelerate our strategy. Our M&A strategy continues to be focused on advancing our digital priorities across the globe. Last month, we closed the acquisition of Tin Roof Software, a custom software and digital product development services company that expands our software product engineering footprint in the United States.  And earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of 10th Magnitude, one of Microsoft's longest-standing Azure-centric partners. This deal expands the Microsoft Azure expertise within our new Microsoft business group and adds development on managed services hubs throughout the United States. And last week, we agreed to acquire Bright Wolf, a technology services provider that specializes in custom industrial IoT solutions for Fortune 1000 companies, which will expand our smart products and Industry 4.08 expertise.  In short, we are committed to growth, and we'll continue to make meaningful investments to ensure we increase our relevance to clients and enhance our competitiveness. While the macro and political backdrop remain uncertain, come what may, our goal is to ensure we outgrow the market, just like we did in the third quarter, whilst remaining commercially disciplined.  In closing, I would remind you that 18 months ago, when we set Cognizant's transformation in motion aimed at returning the company to be the IT services industry bellwether, we knew this would be a multiyear endeavor, and our view has not changed. While we continue to have a lot of work ahead of us, we are encouraged by our progress. Our employees are energized united by our shared purpose and vision. We're excited about our strengthening competitive position, the opportunity to expand internationally and the opportunity presented by the third phase of digital.  There will be several big winners in this attractive market, and we aim to be one of them. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the details of the third quarter and our fiscal year outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very happy to be part of the Cognizant team and look forward to connecting with all of you going forward. From the onset, I was intrigued by Cognizant's meaningful growth opportunity, and my first weeks in the job have more than confirmed my initial assessment. I will work hard to fill Karen's shoes and wanted to say a big thank you to her for making my onboard so smooth and seamless.  Moving on to Q3 results. Third quarter revenue of $4.2 billion was flat year-over-year or a decline of 70 basis points at constant currency. Compared to the prior year period, this includes a positive 250 basis points contribution from inorganic growth and a negative 130 basis points impact from the exit of certain content-related services. Sequentially, we saw a broad-based improvement in the business, particularly in areas such as cloud and enterprise application services, IoT and software engineering.  Moving to the industry verticals where all of the growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services declined 2.2% with similar performance in both banking and insurance. Retail banking improved in the quarter, driven by regional banks, while capital markets returned to growth after several quarters of softness. However, we continue to see weakness across global banking accounts and with clients in the payment sector. We continue to expect below company average performance in the Financial Services segment for the next several quarters.  Healthcare grew 4.2% led by double-digit growth in life sciences, driven by strong growth in the biopharma clients, and included the contribution of the Zenith acquisition which we lapped mid quarter. Growth was partially offset by continued weakness in the medical device clients. Within our health care vertical, revenue saw modest growth. After 6 quarters of decline, we are pleased with early signs of improvements in the health care business, we see improvement in the payer segment across key accounts which is offsetting the decline in the provider market that continues to be negatively impacted by COVID.  Products and Resources declined 4.6%, with double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, offset by double-digit declines in travel and hospitality and high single-digit declines in retail and consumer goods. While we saw strength in bookings in retail and consumer goods, we expect continued pressure in 2021 as a result of the ongoing pandemic.  Communications, Media and Technology was flat, including the approximately negative $57 million year-over-year impact to technology from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. Excluding this negative 920 basis point impact, growth in Communications, Media and Technology was approximately 9%. Communications and media grew mid-single digits as growth in communications and education clients offset continued weakness in media and entertainment. We expect pressure in media and entertainment into 2021.  While overall, we saw improved momentum across the business, the demand environment remains uncertain. But we believe we are gaining traction across industries as reflected in the strong bookings and pipeline numbers Brian referenced earlier. Moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP operating margins and diluted EPS were 14.2% and $0.64, respectively. GAAP EPS reflects $140 million or $0.20 -- $0.26 per share income tax expense related to the reversal of our indefinite reinvestment assertion on accumulated India earnings. I'll comment more on that decision later in my prepared remarks.  Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 15.9%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.97. Adjusted operating margin was down 140 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by higher incentive-based compensation and the dilutive impact of our recently completed acquisitions, which more than offset savings from our Fit for Growth program, lower T&E expense and the favorable movement in the rupee. Additionally, during the quarter, we incurred $43 million of charges related to the Fit for Growth Plan. The actions drove continued cost discipline, which allowed us to further invest into our growth initiatives. The majority of the actions under Fit for Growth are complete, and we have achieved our savings targets. We expect charges to be approximately $200 million in annualized gross run rate savings of $520 million to $550 million in 2021. While we don't anticipate charges under Fit for Growth to continue in 2021, we will continue to invest savings achieved to help accelerated growth aligned behind the 4 strategic areas Brian outlined : repositioning the Cognizant brand, accelerating digital, globalizing the company, increasing our relevance with clients.  Now turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of September 30, stood at $4.6 billion or a net cash of $2.1 billion. Our outstanding net debt balances include the approximate $1.7 billion drawn on our revolving credit facilities in the first quarter 2020. We had a strong cash flow quarter generating $821 million of free cash flow, largely driven by improved collections of our receivables. DSO improved 5 days year-over-year to 72 days.  Before turning to guidance, I will provide additional details on our decision to reverse our indefinite reinvestment assertion on accumulated India earnings totaling $5.2 billion. The decision was made based on our strategic priorities to accelerate growth in international markets, and to expand our global delivery footprint, changes to the India budget enacted in April, and changes to the U.S. tax regulations that became effective in September. This reversal resulted in a onetime GAAP-only tax cost of approximately $140 million, and makes those earnings available globally. In October, we distributed $2.1 billion from our subsidiary in India, which resulted in a net $2 billion cash transfer from India after payment of India withholding tax.  Importantly, on a go-forward basis, we can now more efficiently utilize 100% of free cash flow globally, which gives us greater flexibility in our ongoing capital allocation program. While we are reviewing our capital allocation plan, we initiated our share repurchase program, and intend to repay our credit facilities by the end of this month. The share repurchase activity will offset a portion of the EPS impact from the lost interest income historically generated from cash balances held in India. While interest rates in India have steadily declined in the last several quarters, year-to-date, that cash had earned roughly 5%. This generated approximately $95 million of interest income or $0.13 per share. Since September, we have deployed over $700 million on share buybacks, repurchasing approximately 10 million shares.  Now turning to guidance. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and the pace of recovery complicated by the evolving nature of the coronavirus pandemic. While we are pleased with the solid bookings and pipeline of the business year-to-date, how that pipeline converts to revenue will likely be impacted by the pace of economic recovery and thus, clients' confidence and spend. We are reaffirming revenue guidance at the high end of our previously guided range.  Specifically, for the full year 2020, we expect revenue to decline approximately 0.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Based on current exchange rate, this translates to a decline of 0.5% up to approximately $16.7 billion on a reported basis.  Our revenue guidance includes our estimate of the negative impact of approximately 110 basis points to the full year revenue from our decision to exit certain work within our content services business that will be reflected in our CMT segment and a positive contribution of approximately 200 basis points from closed acquisitions.  This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for Financial Services, and the retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality portions of our Products and Resources segment. For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15%, which assumes incremental costs associated with the remediation of the ransomware attack, wage increases and promotions for certain of our associates effective October 1, and incentive compensation above 2019 levels.  Our current guidance also assumes that Q4 revenue will be negatively impacted by lower bill days versus Q3 and the typical cycle of furloughs.  We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.63 to $3.67. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliations in the 8-K we filed today for a full definition. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 541 million shares and GAAP tax rate of approximately 32%, which implies a Q4 tax rate of approximately 27%. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies. With that, operator, we can open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe I'll just ask 2 quick ones upfront in the interest of time. First off, in light of what's happened recently with SAP, we've been getting a lot of questions just around the size of the practice that you guys may still have in that area. So any sizing you can give us there would be helpful.  And then can you just comment on -- with the digital bookings growth being strong as it has been, I think you're up 40% year-to-date. When does that start translating to faster digital revenue growth? I know we've been hovering in kind of the almost the mid-teens range here the last couple of quarters.  And then that kind of dovetails with a related question of do you think revenue growth could actually turn positive in Q1? I know previously, you said that we may still see negative growth through the first quarter of next year, but obviously, you're on a better trajectory now. Brian Humphries : Jason, it's Brian. So let me take a shot at this. These may be for Jan. By all means feel free to jump in if you see incremental details to add. So SAP as a practice, it's multiple hundred millions of dollars for us. It's sub-$1 billion. It is actually a very healthy business for us, and I have been in touch with the SAP leadership team in recent periods to see what we can do to accelerate our momentum there. It's pretty intuitive, what they're doing. But in the same way, it's also interesting for us given our ambition to scale much more internationally and given the installed base of SAP. So it's a partner that really is strategic to us, and we will continue to work closely with. Digital bookings. Look, more broadly, if I stand back from this. Bookings are strong overall, and it's broad-based by geography, by industry, by new and expansion versus renewals, and digital bookings are continuing to be strong as well. So what's been very pleasing to me is in the course of the last year, we have consistently shown strong bookings growth year-over-year. That has enabled us to actually build a stronger backlog through the year. And now we're in a very healthy position, healthier than we've been before. And of course, the pipeline, as Jan suggested earlier, is strong as well. Not just strong overall, but also strong in visual, in particular, and strong in the strategic accounts that we focused on as part of our customer segmentation exercise in the -- model. So I feel really good about our momentum there.  The timing of all of this to revenue can vary by quarter, of course, and in the face of economic environment, which is unsettled to say the very least, including announcements made tonight across Europe. But we're pleased with what we've done. And if this continues, it all goes very well for our future.  We're not going to make commentary around Q1 or indeed, fiscal year '21 at this moment in time. The only thing I'll say is we will continue to try to outgrow the industry. That's what we did this quarter. We think we're more competitive than we've been before. And we're absolutely committed to growth and to make -- investments to grow. If that means compromising some margins in the short term to achieve, we will absolutely do that. But I'm expecting performance to improve in 2021, but we'll share more details of that, of course, Q4 earnings. But the big caveat around this is what we're going through this some on time, which is a very uncertain macroeconomic environment. Operator : Our next question is coming from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Dejong Ellis : Congratulations. All right. So with the election, inevitably causes and triggers some discussions and questions related to H1B visas and L1 visas. Can you just remind us what fraction of Cognizant's U.S. labor force is currently on visas? What sort of your level of dependence and focuses on that program, and maybe kind of a little bit of the movie of how your labor force structure has evolved over the last few years and how that's evolving going forward.  Maybe I'll just dovetail that into my other kind of observation was just that you actually had head count increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter and that utilization is way up. Attrition is way down. Are you kind of at where you want to be with your labor force at this point going forward? Brian Humphries : Lisa, Brian here. So let's start first with the headcount situation. I think our utilization levels are now quite high. We tightened our belt earlier in the year as I think every company in the world did, but we've seen somewhat of a V-shaped recovery, particularly in the digital side of our business. And as such, we're at the stage now that our bench is light, and we're committed as a leadership team to build that out. And we've already started that over the last month or so. But it takes time, of course, to get that built out. Obviously, we want to continue to drive more operational rigor around forecasting, which triggers enterprise resource management and all of that to make sure we have the right resources in the right place at the right time. So you will see us continue to build out our capabilities with evergreen skills or hot skills, as we would call them, and build upon our capabilities such that we can reduce utilization, which is a little bit higher at this moment in time.  I am pleased with the employee engagement. I am pleased that voluntary attrition is down for the fifth quarter in a row. Notwithstanding that we're really pushing meritocracy and a performance culture these days. So you have seen a big bifurcation between voluntary versus involuntary attrition. And we do expect voluntary attrition to pick up a little bit in the coming quarters as we go through the merit-based promotion and salary cycle we're going through. And I underscore the word merit-based.  With regards to H1B visas, look, it's quite topical, but perhaps I could stand hand back here a little bit and talk because the administrative rule changes with regards to skilled integration leases that have been quite topical in recent weeks. Some of those have been enjoyed through litigation already. And for other elements, there are challenges pending at this moment in time. So whether the rules, survive or not remains to be seen.  All that being said, I actually think all roads are leading this direction anyway. So we will always intend to comply with the letter of the law to use these applications and any extensions we intend to pursue.  We are a H1B visa, I would say, dependent organization. You used the word evolution, and I think that's the right word. Over the years, we have reduced our dependency in visas, and we've also acquired companies that enable us to be more global in nature. But in the same vein, some of the strategic decisions we took, which were in the right decisions, including exiting a portion of content moderation, has put us back a little bit. That being said, the rule is solely triggered by new applications and extensions. And H1B visas are currently under a 3-year visa. So this will roll in gradually. And I would say, I don't want to reassure everybody, our intention is to globalize Cognizant. And so you'll see us build out much more of a global-based workforce to meet client expectations, whilst, of course, stay focused on quality of delivery.  And that will include a whole host of things that we will do, including U.S. college campus recruiting, upskilling and just a broader effort around a local employee base in the U.S. and indeed globally. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : My question is on the health care vertical, and it's good to see the improvement. Question is with regards to the sustainability of that and the investments that you're making in various health care capabilities, including, but not limited to TriZetto? And on the topic of TriZetto with the Atos settlement, was that included in the cash forecast that you have? What does it mean from an operational perspective in terms of your client relationships, if you could address those questions. Brian Humphries : So Jan, I'll touch on the health care business. If you want to touch upon then the cash flow and the cash balance and the Syntel settlement, which we were pleased to see yesterday. So Ashwin, first of all, health care is really important to us. It's almost 30% of the total company, and it consists of 2 major portions. One is life sciences. We're doing really well there. We have been for a long time. It's highly strategic to us. You are seeing the lapping of Zenith technology, which happened in Q3 of 2020. So that will impact growth rates a little bit. But I'm very optimistic around the opportunities in life sciences at the intersection point of biopharma medical devices. Right through to industry 4.0 health care, retail and indeed health tech. And I spent a number of hours on that with the team over the weekend. So we're really pumped around what we can do there, and you will see us continue to invest in it.  The majority of the businesses, however, the U.S. health care business, which is split between payer and providers. The payer business accelerated meaningfully this quarter, which strengthened services and indeed in products. We have a new leader who took over the Healthcare business earlier this year, an internal promotion, who has done a fantastic job, and this entire team are doing great for us. Bookings are very strong. Product growth is strong. We're getting new logos. Margins are improving. And we're just generally feeling very good, a better payer business.  The provider business, which is much smaller than our payer business, saw significant erosion year-over-year in the third quarter as did the industry. As you know, the provider business is suffering from transaction volumes that are decreasing because the pandemic is obviously reducing elective procedures. And I would say that's an area that we would expect to come back but more holistically, the momentum we're seeing in payers, which is 3/4 of the business, and life sciences will give us confidence that we can continue to pull strong health care results going forward. We're improving. Jan, over to you. Jan Siegmund : Yes. Let me add a few comments to the Syntel lawsuit. You may have seen this morning that we won a jury verdict of $854 million. This lawsuit has a long history for Cognizant. And at the core is our claim that Syntel misappropriated TriZetto's intellectual property related to some software products during that time and -- while Syntel was a TriZetto subcontractor. And the jury verdict, which found no liability for TriZetto or Cognizant, basically speaks for itself. We're gratified with the results. But at Atos, the owner of Syntel, has already indicated that they're planning to appeal the verdict. So it will be quite a bit out, I think, until we have the final results of this trial coming, too. So way too early to take that cash into account for any actions. Nevertheless, I think it was satisfying to see the jury decide with Cognizant's position. Relative to the cash repatriation, it might be worthwhile just spending an extra minute on it, too. So we had about a cash balance in India of $2.1 billion. And we -- at the end of September, reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion and decided to repatriate that cash from India. And as part of that decision, we could make that decision for 2 reasons. The most important one is strategically driven actually because we are executing well on our strategy to globalize the enterprise, and we'll continue to invest into international markets. And for that, capital will be needed. But number two, also, the '21 -- fiscal year '21 India budget enacted in April and some changes in U.S. tax regulations allowed us to remediate this cash on a cost-effective basis, and we did so actually in October.  The cash balances in India historically have earned some interest on the cash balances -- on the cash that we have there. And approximately, I think, as I said in the script, about 5%. And the -- we offsetting -- we used some of the cash that we returned from India and cash at hand to repurchase shares during the month of September and October. And the accretion created to the share buybacks is actually approximately offsetting the contribution that our interest income would have generated in India. So the outlook is quite balanced as a starting point. And obviously, we're excited about the go-forward benefit of this transaction because we, going forward, have now full flexibility and full access to our free cash flow on a global basis. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bryan Bergin from Cowen & Company. Bryan Bergin : Just thinking about your largest verticals here. So you've turned the corner on health care. I wanted to ask on Financial Services. I hear the commentary on lower-than-average growth for the next few quarters. I'm curious what you're seeing in the areas of the clients. And whether it's still limited to only a handful of the former large banking accounts. Really, how close are you to the end of the tunnel on stabilizing those? And what do you think you need to do in those areas to really turn the corner in Financial Services, too? Brian Humphries : Bryan, so I would say, yes, it remains challenged. Look, first of all, just like health care, financial services, so the greatest impact from ransomware. But the Financial Services results, I'd almost cut them into 2 portions of discussion. First of all, insurance -- and as you know, the insurance industry has really been pressured, to say the very late in the last year, both at a pandemic level, insurance rebates and automobiles, SMB businesses, interrupted failures. That's impacting the property as of the insurance entry. And of course, mortality rates of life carriers. And then on top of that to make matters worse, catastrophic events and low interest rates. So that sector is under pressure.  Our business is, let's say, 80% of our insurance business is in North America, so a little bit more than the average company. It's one of our strongest franchises, but it will decline in this year, in 2020. So we need to turn it around. We need to improve the pipeline. To be very honest, booking have been strong, but the pipeline isn't strong enough. Our leader has retired in the last month or so, so we have some new energy in there. And hopefully, we can get that back on track.  Banking. Look, if I paint the macro picture first. As we've implied in the prepared remarks, capital markets, retail and commercial banking grew year-over-year. Cards or payments were down. With regards to some of the larger global banking clients that you referenced, it's more of a handful. Some of that, to be very honest, relates to ransomware we were turning some around. Some is self-inflicted wounds related to a lack of appropriate senior origin in the client partners we had. And some of it relates to secular pressure towards in-sourcing that we're seeing at those banks.  Now what do we do to turn all around this entire situation. I'm confident we'll get insurance back on track. I think we'll also continue to make progress in the North America regional banks. And we've even brought some accounts into platinum account status this quarter, i.e., they surpassed $100 million. But in the same vein, we have a lot of work to do in our current accounts, and that includes scaling more into digital in those banks. The good news is our digital bookings in those banks are up in excess of 50%. So we are starting to get our foot in the door. We continue to upgrade our client partners, and we're continuing to try to do a much more sophisticated job in terms of account planning. In the same vein, right up to the executive committee, me included, we are trying to break into some of the other large banks. And I think we're making progress actually on 2 in particular. So hopefully, we'll have some good news on that in the foreseeable future.  Europe and banking just remains weak. We lost an account there in the last year, and we have some transformation project issues and 1 large account over there. It is fixable, but I just don't see the momentum turning around there as quickly in banking overall, as I have seen in health care. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Rod Bourgeois : Okay. Great. Nice progress by Cognizant in these results. I want to ask a high-level question. Recognizing that the COVID pandemic is continuing here. Do you see Cognizant as still somewhat in a crisis response and basic blocking-and-tackling mode? Or have you transitioned now into a more forward-moving strategic attack mode? I guess the main part of the question here is, assuming you are in a transition, what are the next set of metrics you're most focused on to gauge Cognizant's progress moving forward here. Brian Humphries : Thanks, Rod. Brian here. So look there's a short answer and there's a long answer, so I'm going to give you something in between. First of all, I really feel good about the progress we've made in the last 18 months. We've actually done a lot, probably more than people realize. Clarified our strategy. We executed the nonstrategic portion of the business. We executed a restructuring program. We used some of the proceeds from that to reinvest back in the business. We meaningfully improved our digital portfolio competencies and partnerships. We've built a strong professional, mature, client-centric leadership team. We've begun a pretty significant commercial transformation that is showing positive leading indicators and pipeline win rates, bookings. And we put, I would say, a better business management system in place to ensure optimal financial and operational rigor. And we did all of that, to be very honest, in a period that I was not expecting. We managed through global pandemics that impacted both demand as well as fulfillment. We navigated a ransomware attack well, and I want to say that humbly. But we did as best as we could, and we've actually received good client feedback on that. We've improved employee engagement to levels not seen for a few years, and that reduced voluntary attrition at 5 quarters in a row. And we've managed to put ourselves in a position that we built a multiyear plan that incorporates sustained investments.  So I'd characterize all of that as pleased, but not satisfied, to be very honest. We're not in finish product yet. We're in the middle of a multiyear project. And we must continue to, of course, as we've said, reposition the brand, execute our strategy, globalize the company, take advantage of the opportunity overseas, globalize our delivery, build on our growing momentum in health care, and fix financial services and, of course, accelerate our position in digital, which just simply exposes us to higher categories of growth and makes us more relevant to clients.  If we do all of this, our bookings momentum will continue, and ultimately, this will translate to revenue growth. And so Rod, everything else at some stage becomes a leading indicator : pipeline, win rates, the leadership team, the bookings. Our goal here is to invest in the business to get back to growth. If we do that, growth accelerates and we will show margin expansion but in a very calculated manner that allows us to sustainably reinvest back into the business. I say all of this with a great deal of caveats given the uncertain macroeconomic situation we're in at this moment in time. That being said, I'll just wrap up by saying, I'm really proud of our team and of our associates around the world. I'm confident of the unity of our leadership team, the absolute support of our Board of Directors who've been tremendously supportive of what we're doing, and our growing execution rigor. And honestly, I think we're on track. We're increasingly competitive, and you've seen that, hopefully, in this quarter's results. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Keith Bachman from BMO. Keith Bachman : Brian, I wanted to actually try to get to and I'll ask them concurrently. The first is I wanted to return to bookings. And your bookings growth has been really strong. It sound like it's 15% year-to-date, and it sounded like it was 25% for the quarter, so accelerating bookings growth. And I'm trying to understand the translation of revenue, broadly speaking, for Cognizant. While bookings has been strong, is there something else that we should be thinking about on the other side on attrition, specifically of revenues outside of Facebook. And so normally, you would expect that to start to show up next year, but just want to make sure we understand the other side. Has there been a greater level of attrition, again, outside of Facebook, that would cause revenue growth to perhaps not show up as quickly as we might think over the course of the next year or so? And then the second question, Brian, is I wonder to see if you could just touch on philosophical margins. And what you mean by that, you outlined your 4 investment areas, and also the benefit associated with how the savings plan is going to manifest itself during '21. But just philosophically, is there any words that you can give, without providing specific guidance, on how investors should be thinking about margins given those puts and takes associated with '21. Brian Humphries : So look, let me start on the revenue question and the bookings question. There's no big story here, to be honest, outside of the exit of the nonstrategic portion of the content moderation business, which is in our operations business. Frankly, I think we're executing well, both in our -- most of our verticals, we've got more work to do in Financial Services, but even Products and Resources. We're doing well in the areas that are not consumer goods, and travel and hospitality. And so I just feel we have growing momentum, Keith, but I'm very cautious to commit anything because of the macro environment. The bookings is real, when I look at bookings by renewal versus expansion versus new. I just feel as though we had in the last 1.5, 2 years maybe lost a buildup of backlog and we had eroded that. And now we started replenishing what I would call them late. And now we're in a position where I'm feeling better about the future. So there's no major story there. And the more we can keep up this bookings momentum, the better because it's inevitable, then it will show up in the revenue. So we just need to keep executing.  With regards to margins and, in some ways, revenue versus margin trade-offs, I guess, comes into mind. Look, I think about this always in 2 ways. First of all, it's important to differentiate between a cost and an investment. And secondly, growth investments will be prioritized versus short-term margin optimization. And our goal is ultimately to increase our wealth and commercial momentum and to revitalize revenue growth. And we will make some short-term margin trade-offs to achieve this. We're investing meaningfully in the business, probably even more than I anticipated a year ago. Because the more I'm here, the more I see opportunities. In talent overall, in our management -- talent management system, we're accruing bonuses at higher levels. We're getting back to merit-based promotions and raises.  In digital, we're attracting talent, which is a constrained asset and, therefore, an expense asset. We're upgrading our client partners to be better able to represent Cognizant beyond the traditional CIO, CTO organization. The targeted M&A that we're doing, which I'm very pleased with, comes with integration costs. And while gross margins are reasonable, we do have some margin dilution on the operating income level because of the SG&A nature -- intensive nature of those businesses that we're scaling.  And then, of course, we're continuing to build our commercial hiring. We're building our bench, which will hit our delivery costs. Investing in automation, branding, marketing. We got overall our internal systems and tools. Remediate and modernize our IT and security, and globalize our delivery network. So I've got plenty on my mind to find a way to continue to show margin expansion and as I said, 2020 was, in my perspective, a very challenging year from a margin perspective because of ransomware, because of COVID. I'd like to think that as we go through our restructuring program as we got more operational rigor, as we continue to work on pricing and renewals, up selling and cross-selling in our existing accounts, optimizing our pyramid, our near and offshore mix versus on our automation agenda, I'd like to think we can do what's needed in investments and yet continue to show margin expansion at a pace that is appropriate for us to continue to invest in the business.  And for investors who are interested in that story, I think there's very 2 more compelling investments in Cognizant at this moment in time. Operator : In the interest of time, we have time for 1 more question from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. James Friedman : I was wondering, Brian, do you have any view at this point on '21 budgets? And if that's too hard, just more generally how important do you think your client budgets are in terms of impacting Cognizant's fortunes? Brian Humphries : Well, it's an interesting question, James. There's many moving parts, I would say, a macro demand and on client buying behavior. So on one hand, I really feel good about our momentum today. Bookings momentum, up 15% year-to-date. I'm behind every one of those bookings, either a renewal or expansion or a new logo as a client win.  So the first thing I'll say is macro demand is better maybe than the most pessimistic analyst suggested back in April, which is good for the entire industry. But of course, in a world of vendor consolidation, some like Cognizant will do better than others.  Second thing is maybe against this protracted pandemic clients become increasingly decisive with their technology priorities and indeed their spend decisions, which is also good because uncertainty is the real enemy.  Third, we are less exposed to some troubled verticals or customer segments than others. Travel and hospitality, retail and consumer goods is less than 15% of our mix. We really focus on the global 2000 customer segmentation, so SMB issues are less of a concern for us.  And fourth, we have momentum in digital. We strengthened our portfolio, and it can be a winner and will determine the next phase of digital. And I think that inflection point is real, by the way. On the other hand, this week's growing COVID-19 numbers and the latest restrictions, including lockdowns that were announced across Europe today, are a major cause for concern for us. And it's unclear whether this will really impact the decision-making and indeed budgets, so what has looked more promising at least in months may turn against us. So that leaves us in a situation that is challenging going into the months ahead because we have to figure out how to optimize our bench and how to reduce utilization a little and make sure we continue to get the right skills into Cognizant, but at the same time, watch demand signals and customer buying behavior like a hawk.  With regards to customer buying behavior, look, I would say they're more decisive, as I said. They are speaking -- seeking more strategic or trusted partners to help them through the pandemic. There's some very short term or cyclical priorities. They would include all the things you would expect : remote working enablement, e-commerce, AI and analytics with a view to doing hyper-personalization activity. There's a whole set of initiatives clients are looking at to provide cost relief, CapEx reductions. And I see more and more clients look towards enhanced resiliency, security, agility and scalability. So the whole notion of cloud acceleration will continue. The implications of this, for sure, there's some freed-up opportunities in the short term around e-commerce and working remotely. Certainly, some larger, I would call, longer payback projects like ERP are slower, but there are some larger opportunities that have been freed up, including captives that we will look at carefully because unlike the book of business we've been acquiring through M&A, captives can be revenue catered dilutive. There are lots of vendor consolidation opportunities, which is good for us in legacy. And by the way, I would say increasingly good for us in digital because I am seeing some key -- certain suppliers or so-called digital incumbents who are perhaps less malleable or flexible than Cognizant on Ts and Cs and pricing.  And look, there's other things happening in parallel. The pandemic is truly forcing companies to look at virtual agile and perhaps a greater consideration as to when they partner versus what they're working at. So those things are real, and I think that's impacting budgets for the coming year. As long as the situation doesn't get materially worse, the most important thing is clients are making decisions faster and they're more decisive leading into a budget cycle. If things get worse, then I think we may end up as an industry, not just in services, but beyond back in the world of pain again.  The real trend that I'm 100% focused on, and we will put all our resources and effort behind this, relates to digital. That's a secular trend. It's strong. Our bookings are strong. Our pipeline is strong. We've got an improving brand. We see strength in digital engineering, where we're showing up very well these days. Software as a Service, AI and analytics, interactive. And like I said, clients, I think, are now hitting a point where they've almost reached the epiphany that they've upgraded their tech stack, but at the same time they're wondering if they're getting adequate returns from this based on everything they've spent. And so if you think about Phase 3 of digital, and think of COVID as a very, very low tide that exposes everything before the enormous tsunami wave comes in and follows, we're seeing clients realize that our platforms, our e-commerce capabilities are concrete or inadequate. Their marketing is actually more analog than digital. They kind of hyperpersonalize because of poor data hierarchies for engineering. Their processes are so people-intended that they're unscalable. And so in essence, even though we've gone through multiple phases of digital, what we've really been doing around the edge has been upgrading the tech stack and the infrastructure data and application layer for nondigital-native companies. And that fundamentally doesn't solve all of their problems. And clients, I think, going to this budget cycle and beyond in the years ahead, we'll become much more savvy with the fact that they need to become much more software and data-driven, they must embrace user experiences, and they ultimately must shift use cases to agile digital workflows. That's what we're focused on. That's where we're pointing our guns. And we'll participate elsewhere, but we will definitely focus on digital, and we're committed to that. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Katie Royce : This is Katie. Thank you all for joining and for your questions, and we'll speak to you again later in the next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I would now like to turn this conference over to Ms. Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations at Cognizant. Please go ahead. Katie Royce : Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today\u2019s call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon everybody. Today, I'd like to address three topics with you; namely, a brief summary of the fourth quarter, our continuing progress executing our strategy, and our confidence about the future. Let me start with Q4. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, a decline of 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This included a negative 120 basis point impact from the exit of content moderation services and a negative 250 basis points impact related to the anticipated exit from a large financial services engagement. This relates to a complex ambitious project that was scoped in late 2018. Over time, both parties realized that the transformation aspect of the project as initially conceived was unlikely to achieve our shared expectations. I'm confident that it is in everyone's interest to manage to an exit. Jan will provide more details on the financial implications of this exit in his remarks. However, I want to underscore that I'm confident in both our client portfolio and our deal review and solutioning processes, many aspects of which we've overhauled in the last year. Excluding the impact from the anticipated exits from this engagement, we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations and our guidance. Gross margins increased, cash flow is strong, and we continue to invest significantly to fuel our growth priorities. We maintained our momentum in the quarter with full year 2020 bookings growth in the mid-teens. With over one year of data, assumption tweaks and refinements behind us, our analytics have been improved on going to bookings, bookings growth, including renewals and new business, and bookings to revenue. We entered 2021 with growing confidence in our strategic, operational and commercial progress and a strengthening demand environment. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. I'm delighted to be with you on my second earnings call and to be reporting another good quarter, excluding the one-time impact I'll discuss more later. The business performed well, modestly exceeding our expectations during the quarter, driven by solid performance across the board, excluding financial services, and the industry's most directly impacted by COVID, notably retail, consumer goods, and travel and hospitality. For the full year, revenue was $16.7 billion, representing a decline of 0.8% compared to 2019 and a decline of 0.7% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year, this includes a negative 110 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services, a negative 70 basis point impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment and a positive approximately 210 basis points of contribution from our acquired businesses. For the full year, digital grew over 13%, it represented approximately 42% of total revenue, an increase of five points as a percentage of total revenue from 2019. Our Q4 revenue was $4.2 billion, representing a decline of 2.3% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year period, this includes a negative 250 basis points impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services and a positive 270 basis points of contribution from our acquisitions. Before moving on, I will provide some additional details relating to the anticipated exit from the previously mentioned large engagement. In discussions, the parties agreed that a clean separation would be to our mutual benefit. As a result of those discussions, in the fourth quarter, we made an offer that includes among other terms, a proposed payment and the forgiveness of certain receivables. As a result of this offer, we recorded a $140 million charge in the fourth quarter, which included a reduction to Q4 revenue of $107 million and additional expenses of $33 million, which impacted SG&A primarily related to the impairment of long lived assets. The charge exclusively impacts our Financial Services segment. We are in active discussions and hope to have a finalized agreement in the near future. Now, moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 11.4% and including a negative 730 basis points impact from the anticipated contract exit. Excluding this impact, banking and insurance both declined mid-single digits, in banking, growth in regional and retail banking in North America was more than offset by weakness in cards and payments clients. Insurance also performed below our expectations, driven primarily by weakness in North America. Health care grew 3.3%, which included similar performance in both in the US payer business and life sciences. Life sciences revenue was strong among our pharmaceutical clients, further enhanced by the expansion of our portfolio of services as a result of our acquisitions of Zenith Technologies. Growth was partially offset by the continued weakness in medical device clients, which have been impacted by reduced elective procedures volumes. Our Healthcare payer business had the best performance in seven quarters, with strength in software license sales from the addition of several new logos. Products and Resources declined 2.4% as low double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities was offset by double-digit declines in the travel and hospitality industry, and a high single-digit decline in retail and consumer goods, while still challenged on a year-over-year basis, we have witnessed some stabilization in the last two quarters, particularly within retail and consumer goods, which grew modestly on a sequential basis. Communications, media and technology grew 3.4%, which included a negative 790 basis points impact from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. Outside of this impact, we remain very pleased with the business momentum within technology. Communications and media growth accelerated sequentially and grew low double-digit growth year-over-year, helped in part by several of our acquisitions. Now, moving on to margins. In 0Q4, our GAAP operating margin was 11.1% and adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 12.3%. Both our GAAP and adjusted operating margin included a negative 300 basis points impact related to the anticipated contract exit, which includes an approximately 160 basis points impact to gross margin. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.59, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, which both included a negative $0.25 per share impact from the anticipated contract exit. Our adjusted tax rate was 32.9% in the quarter, reflecting the change -- the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, which generated losses that are not tax deductible. Adjusted operating margin declined approximately 470 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, high incentive compensation, annual merit increases and investments in organic and inorganic revenue growth. Savings from our Fit for Growth program, lower T&E and favorable movement in the rupee partially offset this pressure. During the quarter, we completed our Fit for Growth program, achieving $530 million in gross annualized savings through continued cost discipline, which has allowed us to accelerate our growth investments. The majority of savings achieved under this program benefits our gross margin, while the accelerated pace of investments is primarily being captured in SG&A. These investments include an accelerated pace of acquisitions which we believe are key to our business transformation, additional sales hiring, repositioning the Cognizant brand and hiring more senior talent in international markets to drive growth. We manage the business at the operating margin level and therefore, believe it is a better metric to judge the profitability of the business. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or $2 billion net of debt. As a reminder, at the end of October, we fully repaid our outstanding revolving credit facility of $1.7 billion. Cash flow in Q4 was again strong, with free cash flow of $809 million. This brought our full year free cash flow to $2.9 billion. DSO ended the year at 70 days, representing a year-over-year improvement of 3 days. In '21, we expect to see our free cash flow decline from 2020 levels as a result of several benefits we experienced this year, which will not repeat in 2021. These include government offered deferrals of certain tax payments and a lower cash payment related to our 2019 annual incentive compensation, which was paid in Q1 2020. Our outlook for '21 assumes free cash flow conversion will return to more normalized levels around 100% of net income as we focus on building upon the DSO improvements achieved this year. We opportunistically utilized our strong free cash flow in 2020 and continue to achieve capital deployment strategy, utilizing over 110% of annual free cash flow. In 2020, we spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions, representing approximately 40% of our full year free cash flow. We returned approximately 70% of our free $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $480 million in dividends. As I mentioned last quarter, we have reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on India earnings. This decision allows us to more efficiently utilize 100% of free cash flow globally, giving us greater flexibility in our ongoing capital allocation program. Over the next several years, we plan to deploy 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. We intend to allocate 50% of free cash flow towards M&A in areas aligned with our strategic priorities. The remaining 50% will be allocated to dividends and share repurchases, targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% and repurchases to offset dilution annually. While these are a set of guiding principles, we will continue to be opportunistic in our allocation of capital, as well as leverage our strong balance sheet. In support of this strategy, during the fourth quarter, the Board approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, and today we are announcing a 9% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. The second consecutive year of increase since initiated the dividend in 2017. Turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.34 billion to $4.38 billion, representing 2.8% to 3.8% growth, or 1% to 2% in constant currency based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 180 basis points impact. This outlook assumes an improving yet still cautious start to the year with continued macro uncertainty. We expect stabilization in financial services and continued pressure across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality and communications and media, Q1 also still includes an approximately 85 basis points of headwind from the exit of certain content services. For the full year, we expect revenue of $17.6 billion to $18.1 billion, representing 5.5% to 8.5% growth, or 4% to 7% in constant currency, based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 150 basis points impact. This outlook includes approximately 300 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue and assumes improving revenue momentum from Q1 levels. Our full year outlook assumes an approximately 30 basis point headwind from the exit of content services. To put the full year guidance and better perspective, there are several factors impacting the quarterly guidance to highlight. First, keep in mind, our Q2 2020 actuals included a combined impact of COVID and the ransomware attack, which will lead to easier year-over-year comparison Q2 2021 and growth levels above our full year outlook. Second, the charge recognized in Q4 related to the anticipated exit from the customer engagement will create challenging year-over-year compares through Q3 and then an easy compare in Q4. However, this does not impact full year revenue comparisons. Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. We expect margins in Q1 to be at the low end of that range and to operate within the range each quarterly period for the full year. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.90 to $4.02. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $20 million to $30 million versus $119 million in 2020. As a result, of the $1.2 billion cash repatriation in the fourth quarter, which moved cash from India to other jurisdictions with lower yields. Our outlook soon average shares outstanding of approximately $530 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session  Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted a number of areas of progress in the Cognizant transformation, both strategic and operational. Just can you take a step back here now almost two years in, how would you characterize where you are in the transformation journey at Cognizant, kind of still in the beginning, middle innings near the end? And what aspects would you say are mostly completed versus what are the big steps still remaining? Thank you. Brian Humphries : Hi Lisa. Yes, thanks for the question. I'd say we're in the middle. And I think we still have a few years of work ahead of us, but we've made huge progress, and I'm very proud of the team and grateful for everything that they've helped us to do. If you go back two years ago, we talked about a transformation office that started with our strategic direction and refinements, which naturally led to refinements of our company portfolio, both exiting non-strategic elements. Such as content moderation as well as strengthening our digital capabilities with an intensive targeted set of M&A transactions. We're now much more in the strategic execution mode and there are four elements to that. Core to this is globalizing and repositioning the brand. You've seen some recent announcements. We'll have more to go through in the coming weeks and months. That will actually help us with our second goal, that of globalizing Cognizant, which involves really getting after underpenetrated markets internationally, which today still represent approximately a quarter of our revenue as well as giving clients around the world, greater assurance that we have a robust and resilient delivery network. The third goal will be around accelerating digital, and we made good progress there, and we will continue to invest behind this strategic goal and I should point out that clients are very pleased that we are actually showing up with a broader portfolio, giving them optionality and alternatives. And then the fourth point that you'll see us continue to invest in as part of our transformation is increasing our relevance to clients. That has involved us changing out some of our commercial teams, refreshing them bringing in people with much deeper industry knowledge, and indeed, sub industry knowledge and making sure we have client-facing teams who can interface across the entire C-suite of Global 2000 companies. So, we've accomplished a great deal. Some would say against the odds, particularly given COVID and ransomware in the last year. But the team are energized, we're in this together, and we're all committed to do something incredible in the coming years. But that's why, to be very honest, we've also left room in our financial plan in the coming years to continue to invest behind the transformation because we're not done yet. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. You may proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask around bookings performance. Any color you can give as it relates to the overall company and digital bookings in 4Q? And then as you think about your growth here over the last, let's say, two quarters or so, can you give us a sense of whether that's been from stronger competitive wins and better positioning of Cognizant due to the investments you've been making versus just the rising tide in the recovery of overall demand and spend? Just curious if you can give us a sense of how you see the mix of contributing factors to your booking performance here? Jan Siegmund : Yes. I'll jump in and kick us off on the bookings side, because I think I mentioned in my last call, I had to do some formal training to dive in and deeper understand our bookings number. And I did so. Our full year bookings growth for this year was in the mid-teens. But as I learned, of course, bookings numbers -- we offer this bookings number for illustrative purposes to convey basically, the distribution momentum and self momentum and success we have with our clients, and you should see it as that. Brian mentioned in his in his notes that we continually improve review and understanding of this bookings number, and we made good progress in the fourth quarter. So I'm delighted that, the momentum continues basically in the mid-teens. We did make some adjustments to our bookings number as we shifted a little bit the bookings between the quarters. But the full year number is similar to what we've reported in the third quarter 15 -- round the mid-teens. And then, Brian, do you want to give some more detail on digital bookings and distribution up bookings? Brian Humphries : Yes. So look, I think, first of all, it's fair to say, I believe we are more competitive than we have been. I believe we're more client-facing than we have been in recent years. That starts with a tone from the top, but we've also added significant coverage in the course of the last year. In some regards, that's positive, but it should be more positive on a go-forward basis as well because these people that we brought into the company will ultimately become more productive as time goes on. And some of the goodness from that, which will ramp over time, will also be complemented by the fact we've had some disruption this year, because we've been upgrading our client-facing teams. Because we wanted to have a set of client-facing teams who are better capable of conversing across the entire C-suite. So I think we're stronger. We're more energized. We're more client centric. Frankly, we also have a stronger portfolio. We have been aggressive in our M&A stance in the past year. We got a lot of momentum behind the assets we've acquired, and that puts us in a position where we can show up well beyond the CIO, CTO organization and now engage much more broadly at the C-suite. Similarly, I think it is fair to say that the -- there is growing optimism in the market. If I think about client behavior, clients are certainly making investment decisions. It's somewhat of an uncertain background because of where we are with vaccine rollout spread to world. But clients are being decisive. And in decision is the enemy of CEOs of Services Company. So I'm happy to see them making decisions. What are they putting their money behind? Ultimately, growth acceleration, efficiency, agility, scalability, business continuity, of course, this leads to investment decisions, if you will, around Customer 360, customer experience, cloud acceleration, automation, hyper personalization, of course, which brings you with the core and data modernization, AI analytics and machine learning. So this is all happening in a period where we're working in a different manner. And clients have gotten used to working via distributed agile, which I think will fuel different ways of working going forward. I believe it's also giving rise to questions around who strategic partners are, which is why we're really committed to continuing to invest behind industry thought leadership, industry solutions, partnerships, technology consulting and vendor consolidation is real, and I'm delighted to say Cognizant can truly play across build, operate and indeed into transformation innovation with our extended brand. So I feel very good about our position. The market is getting stronger. If anything, right now, what we have is a disconnect between demand supply economics. And I'm worried about skill shortages across the industry. Bryan Bergin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. You may proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi thank you very much. Good afternoon, good evening. I wanted to ask about guidance, and thank you for the information, 4% to 7% includes 3 points of M&A. But I wanted to get some additional clarifications surrounding the events of Q4. And how should we be thinking about financial services within the context of that 4% to 7% constant currency growth? Given that, I assume this is an ongoing headwind associated with, as you said, the first couple of quarters. But could you give us a little parameters on how we should be thinking about financial services in particular? And then the second part, is there any incremental impact that we should be contemplating to the adjusted operating margin, 15.2% to 16.2%, is there any additional charges related to the -- what happened in Q4 with the financial services organization? Thank you. Jan Siegmund : Yes. This -- I can add a little bit more color around the exit from this financial services engagement. It's really contained in the fourth quarter. So we put the charge in revenues and -- on the bottom line. And what we -- and that impact on financial services in the fourth quarter had a growth impact of 7 -- a little bit more than 7%, I think I said. Keith Bachman : Yes. Jan Siegmund : And with that, financial services performance continue to be declining in the fourth quarter and has been a weak spot in our performance. So I anticipate that we're -- as Brian and I indicated that we're going to be stabilizing financial services performance throughout the fiscal year and end up in a stabilized way for Financial Services. Keith Bachman : Okay. And the margins, is there incremental -- any incremental charges associated with that? Or is that all taken in Q4? Jan Siegmund : They\u2019re all taken in Q4. There should be no more impact in '21. Keith Bachman : Okay. Brian Humphries : Keith, it's Brian here. That's behind us. Maybe just a little bit of flavor for quarters where Jan wasn't here last year. Q1, as you know, is a tougher compare than the rest of the year because COVID really started being talked more about in the mainstream media and beyond in the month of March. So the last month of Q1 so the compare and financial services and as we think about the shape of the year, we'll still be, let's say, more challenging there as the turnaround efforts continue to take hold against a tougher backdrop. Q2 should be an easier compare for us. And frankly, the easiest compare for us in FSI should be in Q4, given, as Jan said, we've taken financial entries this quarter related to the anticipated exit of this contract. But I'm fully aligned to Jan's point of view, we'd expect a gradual recovery in 2021 with the quarterly I've just given you against the quarters within that. Keith Bachman : Okay. All right. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. You may proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : Hey guys. Hey, I just want to ask about the growth versus margin topic as you look forward? Specifically in 2021, does your margin guidance leave you with enough room to invest in building digital capabilities and driving share gains. And then I think even looking beyond 2021, it'd be great to get a sense, do you feel like your growth investments would taper after this year as you make further progress in the turnaround? Or would your growth investments be prone to continue at a similar clip as you look beyond maybe this year? If you can give us some outlook there on the growth versus margin trajectory. Jan Siegmund : Yes. Maybe I'll jump in with setting the framework. Our guidance includes the impact of acquisitions that we have announced and closed as of today, and is anticipated. These acquisitions will create margin pressure for us in 2021, approximately 100 basis points or so, roughly. And that is built into as well as our continued investment of building out our organic growth capabilities, our investments into marketing, et cetera. So the guidance includes the substantive continuation of our strategic initiatives into 2021. That was very important for Brian and me as we devised our budget process that we continue committed to executing that strategy, which is a multi-year strategy. Future acquisitions, as I indicated, we're planning to continue on our M&A strategy, where I illustrated our capital allocation outlook and plan. So if we were to spend another $1 billion on acquisitions. That would be incremental margin pressure that is now built could be incremental margin pressure. That's not built into our guidance as always will be incremental. But I think the plan as it is provides full support of the strategic direction that Brian illustrated earlier. Brian Humphries : Yes. Maybe if I could just embellish those comments that we made. Hello, Rod. First of all, yes, we feel good about our guidance for 2021. It sees us accelerate revenue, show margin expansion, whilst ultimately investing materially into the future. But I always want to be crystal clear on these calls that our goal is to drive shareholder value creation by positioning Cognizant for medium and long-term success and sustained earnings growth, and I think the best way for us to get about doing that is to get after the revenue opportunities. Look, we're in the middle of a -- what we're calling a multi-year project to reposition the company. I\u2019m genuinely pleased with how the team has come together. We're united. We're ambitious. We're eager to prove our potential. In 2020, I asked the team to pull together to operationalize the transformation agenda. That included strategic, organizational, cultural and indeed financial elements, and some of it was uncomfortable for certain segments of the employee base. But we executed an aggressive M&A strategy to complement our portfolio. We executed a restructuring program. The savings of which allowed us to start reinvesting in the business, including hiring those commercial resources we referenced earlier. And with bookings now up in the mid-teens, the P&L can start to work again. And that was the secret sauce of Cognizant over the years. It was always a growth company fueling investments in our clients with delivery excellence, which afforded us to continue to drive that on a sustainable basis. That's the direction we're taking the company forward. We've got so much more work to do, but I think so much more optimism about the future. And I definitely feel a lot better about our position, because a lot of the heavy lifting of the initial portion of the transformation is behind us. We'll continue to invest in delivery excellence, commercial coverage, our talent, our systems and tools, which were not in my mind fit-for-purpose for a Fortune 200 company. That's why we announced today our intent to go forward with Workday and HCM. You know we're investing heavily between IT and security remediation and modernization. We'll continue to invest in our portfolio and in our brand, and we're feeling pretty comfortable in terms of where we are. Rod Bourgeois : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. You may proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. So, I guess the question for me is with regards to the underlying sort of economic and operating assumptions for the lower and upper part of both the revenue and margin outlook? And given the confidence implied in post 1Q acceleration. I guess the follow-on to that is the supply side question because when I look at high utilization and sequentially higher attrition, can you provide some comfort on the ability to meet delivery objectives of that implied acceleration of demand? Brian Humphries : So, let me start a little bit with some order questions, Jan, feel free to jump in at any moment here as well. So, first of all, with regards to the delivery organization of where we stand on that, look, we have a demand/supply imbalance, if you will. The market has snapped back aggressively, as evidenced in our strong bookings momentum. I would say that the competition for digital talent is extremely competitive. All major digital domain skills are in high demand across cloud, digital engineering, data, AI and we are, therefore, very much focused on recruitment and attrition. For those of you who track media, you'll see us be much more aggressive in terms of social platforms for hiring. We're doing a luck with our employee base around making sure they see the potential of the company, making sure they understand the growth ambitions of the company, their career opportunities. And so we look forward to trying to optimize that as best we can. But you guys know as much as we do that in a high demand environment, where you have an imbalance, it can lead to certain outcomes. Now, we've got to understand what that means in terms of pricing environment as well to be very, very clear. With regards to utilization, there's a few things happening simultaneously from my perspective. First of all, clients are embracing new ways of working, including distributed agile, and that has been somewhat forced upon them in 2020. But actually, I think it's worked well. And now many clients are looking at real estate consolidation policies and understanding that we can work for them nearshore, onshore or indeed, offshore. The higher the offshore mix can actually help margin rate, but it's not necessarily helpful to margin dollars or indeed revenue dollars. So, we're seeing a trend certainly towards offshore leverage which is pushing the short-term offshore utilization higher as we consume the bench. But I don't know that that's likely to be sustained over the longer term because we plan to increase our hiring, rebuild our benches, and though we are, as I said earlier, in a high demand environment at this moment in time. We're also doing some tactical things internally. We've recently moved our India-based workforce onto a nine-hour Workday, which is in line, I should add, with industry practice which will result in a reduction of utilization in India, in theory, in the next quarter or so by one to two points. But we'll continue to look at utilization and track it and understand how these dynamics play in. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey. Thanks so much. I know you've covered a lot already, but I want to ask about the customer engagement again and what makes this unique hear in terms of what happened and why the exit occurred? I'm just trying to get a better sense of if this was one off? Or are there some other accounts that you're tracking as well? Brian Humphries : Yes. Let me get off. And then Jan, if you've any of the financial elements, please embellished this as well. So first of all, we have a delivery excellent organization. That insurers were aligned to a, a sophisticated set of delivery methods for want of a better words, you could think about these as methodologies, principles, programs, tools. As a Global Fortune 200 company, at any time, we probably have between 20,000 and 25,000 projects or programs underway in our delivery organization. And these projects are constantly reviewed and mapped. It goes without saying. For Cognizant then I bet every other services company out there in the world that at any one-time for a company of our size, there are certain projects that are classified amber, some red. These projects are monitored constantly actions and frankly, senior management right up to me get involved in client discussions as needed. I will say we're on top of this. I've reviewed our entire portfolio over the last few years. I know where we stand. We have enhanced rigor in our dealer review and solutioning processes. Many of those aspects, by the way, have been changed in the past year. And just as a reminder, we have a new CFO, who's pretty hands on. We have a new global delivery leader who came into last year, who's We've been new Chief Admin Officer who's charged, amongst other things, with contract management and pricing. Each of these executives bring their own experience and value on complex deal pursuits, steel solution and pricing, which puts me in a position where I feel confidence where we stand. Tien- Tsin Huang : Trust rigorous there. Then I think Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Matt O'Neill: Hey. Hi, gentlemen. Good evening. Thanks for talking my question, a lot of good questions asked and answered already. I was hoping I could ask a little bit more around the sort of hiring dynamics, and as well as the kind of international dynamics as well as far as, Brian, you mentioned hiring a lot of MDs internationally. And what is the kind of sort of expected ramp or lag from kind of higher to accelerating the actual business in some of the international markets as well as going back to the broader discussion on hiring as far as the -- the relative scarcity of talent and challenges there as far as finding the right people with the right skill sets? Thank you. Brian Humphries : Look, from the international perspective, we called it global growth markets, which is about 25% of our business. We were quite intentional in the last year that as we're globalizing the company, so too, that we want to localize the company to a certain extent. So that means, as an example, we've recently changed that our Head of Japan. We've hired a Japanese local previously was the Head of Microsoft Japan, prior experience in Oracle, HP, IBM Japan. So somebody with followership amongst clients, somebody would followership with talent and a roster of C-suite networks in the country. That's important to me, but we also need the people who can fit in with Cognizant culture are extremely energetic and really want to do something incredible in the years ahead. I've got to say, it's been an absolute pleasure. We've been able to attract incredible talent to Cognizant across upgrades we've made in the U.K., Ireland, in the Nordics, in Germany, in Australia, New Zealand, in Japan and indeed the new Head of Global Growth Markets, Ursula, who joined us in the month of December as well. And I'm very optimistic that they will ramp rapidly because there are a Class A type personalities, very senior, quick studies. We've helped them already with multiyear business plans to see how we can drive exponential growth in these geographies. Of course, I want to give them time to settle in, but they know that they've been hired with great expectations. And of course, they're charged not just with delivering commercially and from a delivery point of view locally and spending for the principles of the company, but also we are pivoting, transforming the company, the classic, very heavy leverage of application outsourcing, labor arbitrage, India model is being complemented, of course, with much more local selling, solutioning and delivery as we're driving across the entire C-suite to sell projects. So I'm very optimistic. I'm very excited about the potential we have overseas. And I think it's an area that we haven't adequately mined internationally, and it's an area that, frankly should enable us to drive nice growth. The broader talent question ultimately goes back to the market dynamics, which are stronger. If you look at the industry analysts these days, many of them are thinking about growth rate in the 3% to 6% for the entire industry going forward. Digital skills are particularly in demand. And that's something I think the entire industry is facing into. We can control what we will. So we are 100% focused as the management team around recruitment and around attrition and making sure we can fulfill against our bookings momentum. In the same vein, I'm proud to say we promoted tens of thousands of associates recently and rewarded the majority of our employees with a merit-based salary increase and indeed, this year we accrued and we will pay bonuses at higher levels than last year, notwithstanding COVID-19 and a ransomware attack. So we have a more rigorous approach to talent. You will see that process continue. We will probably be faced with still sequential pressure in involuntary attrition simply because we're going through end of year cycles. And after bonuses are paid, we'll see what happens. But we're 100% focused on attrition and recruiting and a 100% focused on ensuring that our employee value proposition and employee brand is world-class. Matt O'Neill: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. You may proceed with your question. Maggie Nolan : Thank you. Brian, you spoke positively about the building strength of the portfolio and your positioning in-light of substantial M&A activity. Can you comment on the competitive environment in the digital engineering space? Do you hope to take up market share with new or existing clients? And do you have to disrupt competitors to do this? Brian Humphries : This is one of the hidden jewels, Maggie, in the entire corporation. Obviously, we have a rich heritage in application development and application maintenance, but that gives us a tremendous opportunity then to move much more forward, leveraging the strong skill-sets and the talent that we acquired with Softvision back in 2018. In fact, we've done 2 digital engineering acquisitions in the last probably 4 months, Tin Roof in the United States, as well as Magenic and that most recently as well in this week that we closed. And you'll see us continue to complement those across the globe. We already have a very strong footprint across North America, and you'll see us continue to embellish Western Europe with that skill set as well. Of course, we think we're entering a new phase of digital, and this brings with it different dynamics. Clients aren't thinking of digital necessarily anymore simply as the classic tech stack at the bottom where they think about applications or infrastructure or data. Our vision is ultimately that clients will recognize its power of digital is unlocked not in those silos investments, but more across business processes and operating models. And that ultimately involves selling value, delivering value. It involves intelligence in consumer-grade applications from a CX point of view with security grade features, ultimately driven by intelligence that's fueled by massive data modern architecture sitting on cloud platforms. And our digital engineering play truly bitter interactive and experienced capabilities makes us one of the only companies in the world that can scale from the bottom of the tech stack right up to the top. There are certain pure-play digital companies that play in certain arenas. There are certain IPPs that play more at the bottom of the stack. But we're one of, I think, the two companies in the world\u2019s can truly scale top to bottom in that regard. And core to this belief as well, by the way, is the notion that processes will ultimately become more agile, data-driven and automated with a huge focus on CX. We've got some great examples already, by the way, in the portfolio, both vertically as well as horizontally. ATG is a company we acquired in 2018. It's a leader in advisory, implementation and managed services in quote to cash. And that's one example or Lev another Salesforce Platinum Partner that we acquired in 2020 helps business is simplify and modernize marketing campaigns, leveraging Salesforce\u2019s marketing cloud and that really helps them provide data insight and personalization across their customer journey. This, in my mind, is where digital is going. It's not about silo tech stacks. I personally have collapsed our organization to really get at the intersection point of cloud and digital. This is happening when certain other companies are actually doubling down in cloud silos, but I actually think the true value is that intersection point. And I feel we can truly get after new customers, but we're also dislodging certain companies from accounts that they've long held. Some of these companies are private companies, some are public, but we feel we got one of the biggest digital engineering companies in the world, and you'll see us continue to double that in that regard. Maggie Nolan : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Katie Royce : This is Katie. I'd just like to thank you all for taking the time and joining the call, and we look forward to speaking with you in the coming days. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Q4 2020 earnings conference call. You may all disconnect your lines at this time, and enjoy the rest of your evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Cognizant Technology Solutions Q1 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  Thank you. I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you. You may begin. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's first quarter 2021 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to start today's call by addressing the humanitarian crisis in India. As many of you know, India is the heart of Cognizant, and home to more than 200,000 of our associates. I would like to express my support and solidarity for our Indian associates wherever they are in the world. My sympathy for any who have suffered a loss during the pandemic. In addition to the ongoing support of our associates, which includes homecare and hospitalization assistance, vaccination cost reimbursement for our associates and their families, and making vaccine availability easier for those with disabilities. Cognizant is making a multi million dollar investment to assist India through the crisis. This is focused on covering operational expenses at hospitals throughout India that are caring for COVID-19 patients. Funding the efforts of UNICEF in India to deploy oxygen generation plants, COVID diagnostic testing and medical supplies and partnering with one of India's leading hospital chains to set up vaccination centers in locations across the country, including some of Cognizant's own facilities. The impact of the pandemic on industry attrition rates, absenteeism and client delivery remains somewhat uncertain. We monitor our situation daily, and we'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates while serving our clients who've been particularly supportive in recent weeks. As the COVID situation differs throughout the world, our return to office strategy remains country driven. Currently, almost all of our associates are working from home, and business travel remains on an exception only basis. Let's turn now to the first quarter. First quarter revenue was $4.4 billion representing growth of 2.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Although, we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations, revenue upside was limited by elevated attrition, reflecting the intensely competitive market for digital talent that we spoke about in our last earnings call. This put some pressure on salaries as rows were filled by lateral hires or contingent workforce. And in some cases, commercial opportunities were forgone due to an inability to source talent. To address retention challenges, we've been executing a multi part plan that includes stepping up our internal engagement efforts and increasing investments in our people through training and job rotations to provide opportunities for career growth. Shifting to a quarterly promotion cycle for billable associates, and implementing further salary increases and promotions for high demand skills and critical positions and ramping our hiring capacity by adding hundreds of recruiters and making 28,000 plus offers to new graduates in India. A new record. Daily resignations increased through the first quarter peaking in March. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q1 revenue was $4.4 billion, representing growth of 4.2% year-over-year, or 2.4% in constant currency, compared with the prior year period. This includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our acquisitions, and 90 basis points of negative impact from the exit of certain content services. Digital revenue in Q1 grew approximately 15% and represented 44% of total revenue versus 39% in the prior year period. We were pleased with this growth acceleration compared to Q4 particularly in light of a competitive hiring environment for digital talent. Now moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 1.7% reflecting more moderate declines in both banking and insurance, in line with our expectations, we are seeing early signs that the investments and repositioning of both businesses are resonating with our clients. This includes financial services bookings growth, outpacing total company bookings growth in Q1 and a solid pipeline growth. We continue to expect a phased recovery for this segment over the next several quarters and anticipate that we will see positive momentum throughout the year. Healthcare growth was 7% and accelerated from last quarter, driven by strong performance in both our healthcare payer and life sciences businesses. Following strong performance in last quarter in Q1, our healthcare business had its best year-over-year growth quarter since 2018 benefiting from increased demand for our integrated payer software solutions, and improving fundamentals in our provider business. Life sciences revenue continued to benefit from strong demand for our digital services among both pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Products and resources increased 2.4% driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. This growth was partially offset by mid single digit declines in retail consumer goods and double digit declines in travel and hospitality. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. BryanBergin: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the situation in India. Can you just frame how you're thinking about the potential impact this may have on the business in the near term? And I wanted to confirm is there -- there's nothing built into the outlook right now on a potential revenue disruption? And on the margin front same kind of question. Is there anything built in as far as those incremental costs that you may have framed here to support the workforce in the broader population? Thanks. BrianHumphries: Hey, Bryan, it's Brian here. So let me just touch upon this. First of all, I think it's really important for us to acknowledge it is a humanitarian crisis. And we've been prioritizing the health and safety of our associates and of course, their dependents and hoping that they stay safe as they work essentially from home at this moment in time. And as I said, in my script, we're doing a series of things to help in terms of medical expense support, pre vaccinations, covering the expenses in hospitals, working with UNICEF, et cetera. To the question around in terms of how I think about the impact on the business, I think about the humanitarian side as being relevant. But candidly, the business side of the hot market is in some regard more meaningful in the sense that most of our attrition, and the resignations we talked about were happening in prior months, which are leading indicators of Q2 attrition, and the end of Q1 attrition. And all of that was happening in a period when the COVID situation in India was substantially less severe than it is at this moment in time. So we're working through obviously, our business operations working with our teams who are working remotely. It's a challenging environment. Of course, it's a stressful and emotional time for associates and their families. The impact Bryan on attrition rates and absenteeism, and client delivery remain somewhat uncertain. We look at it on a daily basis, we have a crisis management teams involved. We've created a COVID delivery risk management process which allows us to initiate remediation actions. We're required to review the status of our delivery portfolio project by project where possible to ship work between offshore or nearshore and on site teams. But I will say clients have been incredibly supportive as we go through this. I've received a series of emails from clients who are wishing us the best of luck and certainly not putting a lot of pressure in the system at this moment in time. The financial impact of our actions is assumed in our guidance. And that is assumed off of what we know today, which is today's rates of absenteeism and today's resignations that we've seen, it is unclear whether attrition will actually slow because of this, or whether attrition will go up or stay stable but it will potentially go up because of -- because of absenteeism. But to date in our guidance includes what we know today. To date, we feel as though our guidance is appropriate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. RodBourgeois: Okay, great. So, Brian, you're a very full two years into your leadership role at Cognizant. When you started at Cognizant there were some meaningful management challenges there waiting for you? You're now navigating a pandemic with multiple ways across regions. So it's definitely been an eventful two years. In that context, I'd like to ask if you can grade Cognizant's underlying progress, the progress that you've made over the last couple years. And if there's a way to decipher between internal progress, market progress, financial progress I'm assuming those dimensions may be progressing at a different stages. But overall, it would be helpful to hear how you grade Cognizant's last two years and its progress. BrianHumphries: Thank you, Rod. It's a comprehensive question in nature. But yes, I would echo the word an eventful first two years, given the transformation agenda, the leadership changes required as part of that. Global pandemics and ransomware attack, of course, and now, a war on talent that is happening in the midst of the humanitarian crisis in India. And I would say, first of all, it's a team sport. This is about 300,000 associates pulling in one direction. I'm truly pleased with the executives I've got around me these days, we're all eager to show what we can do, and hopefully, I believe can become an iconic leadership team together in the years ahead. And I've also been supported by a terrific board who've been 100% behind our vision and our strategy of the company. As I'm answering your question, I will start by saying I inherited a great company and a company of great pedigree, and a company with a growth DNA and a company with pride, proud employees. But it is clear that the company had not been hitting its stride in recent years. So I asked our organization to pull together to help me operationalize a broad transformation agenda, which included strategy structure, commercial transformation, delivery, optimization, cultural elements. I also asked the company to help me with a restructuring program that we weren't used to. But it would allow us to free up capacity to make investments in growth in our systems and in our people. And this is a growth company, and we needed to restart the engine. And of course, as part of that, you have to go through the corporate strategy. Who are we? Who do we want to be? That leads to portfolio adjustments, both exits, such as content moderation, as well as meaningful M&A aligned to the corporate strategy. And of course, within that vein, we've also doubled down on partnerships, including hyper scalars. And all of this was just a means to an end, to set out to build a pipeline to accelerate bookings. And ultimately, to get the company back to the industry leading growth. Because I think growth will ultimately make the P&L work again. So we're certainly in the middle of a lot of this. I will say I'm more confident now than ever, that we can do this. And I believe we're on track. We made great progress internally, to go to your framework. Look, we've got a clear purpose vision, a set of values, we got a clear strategy, and we've got a more competitive portfolio that is aligned to our strategy. We've got a better talent philosophy, including DNI which is critical in a knowledge based business. We progress on important things like sustainability, cybersecurity; I think we're getting our belief back. And test them to that is the notion of employee engagement, it multi year highs in 2020. Although, we are fully aware that we got more work to do on our employee value proposition, and indeed, of course on attrition. Commercially and when I'm answering your question on markets, I'm not talking about Wall Street, I'm going to talk about commercial markets as in our clients, we've overhauled our commercial team, we've increased the sophistication of the team, I think we went back to our tuna box model where we got tight alignment between commercial and delivery, we've refined our customer segmentation strategy. So we know who are the clients that we need to partner with deeply, we've implemented a more refined variable compensation program, we've refreshed our talent to ensure we can represent the entire portfolio and address client pain points beyond the CTO or CIO. And I'm excited as to how we're now being seen by clients, Rod, to be honest, where we're no longer necessarily just being viewed and to build or operate space. We got growing reputation and recognition in digital and cloud following our M&A strategy. And that is now showing up in sustained book-to-bill ratios in excess of 1.1, which I feel is critical to drive the revenue growth rate that I'm aspiring to drive and our qualified pipeline and win rates are as healthy as they have ever been. Now all of that leads ultimately to financial outcomes. And I don't think the true benefits of this are yet visible. We have seen the margin dilution of the investments, commercial hiring, IT security, modernization, M&A dilutions, and some brand investments we are making. Of course, we continue to review the trade offs between revenue growth and margin expansion. But I will say we expect to see revenue benefits on the back of the bookings, momentum, and margin should improve each year for the foreseeable future, albeit with a balanced approach to trade offs between revenue growth, and further investments to drive a sustained outperformance versus the competition. So in short, a lot of work and I look was a great years ahead. RodBourgeois: Great. And just a quick follow up that kind of dovetails with some of the things you mentioned. It seems attrition is a top of the list of things to address at this stage. Can you just speak to what you see as the root factors causing the attrition and your confidence in being able to fix that? BrianHumphries: Look, it's a two edged sword. We've seen a V shaped recovery as an industry and Cognizant is certainly as after a weak March and April last year, we snapped back immediately. And that leads with a skill shortage. So it's an industry problem. I think you've seen that in the earning cycle to date. Of course, I caution people to compare attrition rates between various competitors, we include BPO. And our calculation is current quarter annualized, which is the worst of all worlds at this moment in time versus some peers exclude BPO. And look at attrition on a rolling on the last 12 months, which includes some lower levels of attrition because of COVID. But Rod, I think about our attrition, which went up 200 basis points sequentially, against two parameters, one is macro considerations. The market is extremely competitive at this moment in time. There are supply demand imbalances across cloud, across digital engineering, across data. I sense that the work from home environment has given people let's say less sense of community. And I also see obviously, the build out of captives which tend to pressurize salaries. And then on top of that macro backdrop, I think we have some Cognizant considerations as we continue to transform the company. We're driving towards a culture of meritocracy and a performance culture. And we're evolving more towards a global or sometimes local workforce, which is in line with client expectations, but also in line with regulatory policy around the world. And in some regards, we're late to some of those elements. And so we're dealing with some of the pain that others have dealt with previously. I will say I'm 100% confident we're actively managing attrition as best we can. I'm pleased to say that attrition peaked in March, slowed in April and continues to slow in May, albeit early days in May.  We got a lot of work streams around employee engagements, training, job rotations, we've taken the decision to invest more in targeted salary increases and promotions and shifting to quarterly promotion cycles for billable associates. And we've added hundreds of recruiters in the last four months. And we're making a record number of 28,000 offers to new graduates in India, which is up from 17,000 hired in 2020. I think in 2018, we may have actually not even hired any Gen Z graduates into Cognizant and so we're doing the right thing to address attrition. And of course, in the meantime, we're working to manage the salary inflationary elements of this as Jan pointed out, P&A expectations in the second half of the year are lower than previously anticipated. So that will temper some of the downsides. But in the same vein, these are investments that I think will help stem attrition which will give us more productive hours and our employees. And in the same vein, of course, we got other levers at our disposal to manage salary inflation, be that on offshore or nearshore mix pyramid optimization, delivery industrialization, including automation methodologies, templates and the like. Procurement leverage for subcontractors, we get a new chief procurement officer coming on board soon. And of course, everything else we're doing as we evolve the company against the line of work that we actually sell and deliver as we shift from staff augmentation towards managed services and project based delivery transformation. That brings different considerations as well. So we know what we need to do and we're honest. And as I said, I think we'll see sequential increases in attrition based on the resignations in the last few months because there is a two month notice period in India. So we have a strong understanding as to what attrition will be in Q2. But that's been factored into our model and into our guidance. And in the meantime, we've been hiring at record pace, given the extra recruiters we put to work. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Hi, Brian. Hi, Jan. So a couple of things I guess. I might have missed this. But can you quantify the revenue growth you were not able to get solely because of the talent shortage? And then when I think of headcount growth, in spite of the hiring, headcount growth still at relatively low sequential levels, is it a question of these folks have not yet joined or is that the net number because of the attrition and could you separate out what is digital headcount growth versus overall headcount growth? Brian Humphries : Well, headcount grew about 5,000 people year-over-year, but Ashwin that excludes subcontractors and contingent labor, and they have been increased sequentially and year-over-year materially, it's not a number we disclose. But we have turned to, obviously, external sources, both lateral hires on subcontractors and contingent labor as we've been working through the attrition situation internally, nor do we break out digital versus non digital headcount. I mean to be very clear, you can have somebody working in a test with testing capabilities, and they can work on what could be viewed as legacy projects. But in the same vein, as part of an agile squad, they could be working on something around something as familiar as a frequent flyer website, which some of the work we do around experience and software product engineering there, it's not viewed as legacy, it's certainly viewed as digital. So it's very hard to classify workforce between legacy and digital. With regards to the opportunity cost, look, we're not quantifying that. But certainly it's material enough that talked about when I review countries there's hundreds of basis points of growth, in some cases that we could have had, in other cases less. But it's been a pain point for us throughout the quarter, we talked about attrition being a worry in our last quarter, because we could see resignation rates, and we can see what's happening in the industry as people are doing their best to put in counter offers to stop resignation. And I'm glad we anticipated instead and we set appropriate guidance. And we're doing the same this time around. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Could you comment also on the potential for greater use of technology to decouple revenue and headcount growth? Brian Humphries : Well, that's the holy grail, of course, in some regards, but a lot depends on the way you're running your business and the businesses you're winning, whether you're in a BPO type business or a tech services centric project, we have a huge effort underway around automation, not just in delivery, but also some very exciting IP that we have been developing, that hopefully we'll be able to talk about in the next quarter or so that I think will completely set us apart in the industry. So it is a holy grail. Of course, you've also got to think about the pyramids. I told earlier about adding 28,000 offers for fresher into the bottom of the pyramid this year, the bill rates of those will be very different than the rates of onshore delivery. So it's very difficult in a succinct way to decouple revenue growth from headcount growth, because there are so many factors at play. But rest assured that the industrialization of delivery including automation is top of mind for use Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Keith Bachman : Hi, guys, Brian, I wanted to direct this to you if I could; I want to understand how you're thinking about growth. You've obviously given guidance for the year, but I wanted to see if you could put some context and maybe even some philosophical views on longer term, you're guiding to basically 3% to 4% organic constant currency growth, maybe a little bit closer to the 4% we take out or normalize for the Facebook business. And how should investors be thinking about that growth potential longer term and a, if you could talk a little bit about how the pipeline growth looks now. What are some metrics that you can provide us also in terms of, b, the capacity that you see for incremental M&A from here, whether it's the ability to the financial resources and or the management resources to keep driving M&A? And then finally, c, I was hoping you could touch on financial, it's still candidly serving as an anchor to your growth rate, not in a positive way, but limiting your consolidated growth. And so if you could just, again, touch on how you're thinking about growth pipeline, M&A capacity, and then financial, thank you. Brian Humphries : Okay, so M&A, first of all, I think let's go back to the Capital Framework we've set forth in recent quarters. We plan to deploy approximately 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. I will say these are our guiding principles and we will continue to be opportunistic, approximately 50% towards M&A in areas wholly aligned to our strategic priorities and of course of the remaining 50% towards dividend and share repurchases targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio in the range of about of -- at about -- sorry 25% on that, the rest for repurchases. So M&A will continue to be a priority for us. And as I said earlier, we announced three acquisitions in the first quarter, and indeed signed an agreement to acquire ESG Mobility. And it's not that -- it's not that M&A is something we wake up every morning and feel we have to do. It's just; it's an enabler for us to achieve our strategy. Now, our strategy is built around accelerating digital which are our higher growth categories. And our strategy is also built around globalizing the company, both from a global Delivery Network, but also getting after exponential growth overseas. And digital as well as our overseas opportunity, I think puts us in a position to have ambitions, well in excess of the 3% to 4% organic growth rate Keith that you mentioned. However, I will refrain from getting into long-term financial statements here. But I would be very, very disappointed in the years ahead if we do not significantly exceed those growth rates. And I would say we have been doing what was needed in the last year, to start replenishing our backlog to consistently drive a book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.1.  That puts us in a position that organically coupled with the accretive nature of the acquisitions we've done, we should have continued upward pressure on revenue and a go forward basis. Now, that being said, I will caution everybody, we're in somewhat of an unpredictable world at this moment in time with the humanitarian crisis in India. So that's how I think about organic possibilities, as well as the fact that we have an M&A lever that is exposing us to higher growth categories. And all of this, of course, is against the context where, from my perspective, we are substantially more operationally inclined and more sophisticated in terms of how we think about delivery and commercial leverage going forward.  On financial services, look, it is critical, we turn around financial services, I'm proud with the progress we made in healthcare, which is catching up on financial services as almost being our single biggest industry sector. The financial services are 1/3 of our revenue and in dollar terms, it modestly grew, but in the constant currency terms it declined 1.7%. And Keith within that we ultimately have two groups, we have banking and financial services business that is more than half of the business and we have insurance, which is kind of less than the half. And it's a tale of two cities in insurance North America was weaker than the international business with North American insurance is the vast majority of the insurance business. So that weakness hurt us in banking and financial services. Actually, North America was modestly up, but our international business was down. Within banking and financial services, there are relatively consistent trends, what we talked about previously, capital markets declined, retail banking grew modestly, but it was offset by declines in commercial banks and cards and payments. And if I think about things differently, the global banks, as we call them, have continued to in-source. And that business continues to decline for us, offset somewhat by good momentum we have with some of the regional banks. Now all of this comes back to what are we doing about it? I would say we have a plan of attack. We have had healthy bookings, throughout financial services, both banking and insurance in 2020. We've added extra commercial coverage, we've actually changed out and refreshed a significant amount of our commercial teams, we've been embracing digital, and we've had strong digital bookings in those areas in 2020. And we've been working more with our partners who are very interested in our strength in healthcare, and indeed financial services. So as Jan pointed out it is a business that is under repair. And we expect to see gradual recovery in 2021. We should see strong, stronger growth in Q2, obviously, for easy compare reasons as well as COVID and ransomware attack. But I'd like to think in the course of the year we can get this thing shaped up to be in better shape than it is today. Keith Bachman : Thanks. And any comments on pipeline, Brian. Brian Humphries : Look, pipelines are very healthy overall. It's as healthy as I have seen it and pipeline, candidly for Financial Services is also healthy. So from my perspective, Keith, we don't have a demand issue in an industry. I'm actually quite bullish on the industry for 2020 and indeed for 2021. And that's based on client conversations and I speak with clients every day, as well as obviously we keep an eye on what industry analysts are saying, I think talent shortages and attrition are a greater concern for the entire industry. But clients are making investments, they are decisive. And indecision is the enemy of people like myself. So, clients being decisive are good. They are talking about more strategic partners; we are in the mix more than ever in that vendor consolidation. So I'm quite excited about that. And fundamentally, the things we see driving the pipeline, a lot around business model innovation, customer experience, technology, modernization, risk mitigation, and efficiency initiatives. And kind of the one of the reasons I was so adamant in doubling down with the hyper scalars, two years ago is because these companies I don't think you should underestimate the sheer power and scale of hyper scale companies, and that they are investing massively by commercial teams, commercial terms, aligning with companies like Cognizant around industries, massively accelerating cloud migrations. And if you believe in platform economics, which opens up the possibilities of micro services and APIs, I think this is going to be the future. So we stood up to business groups or business groups are in the hyperscalers in the last few years, and I think we're reaping the benefits of that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this is Kathy for Jason. So I mean the spring time frame is when enterprises typically make decisions on ramping up and moving forward with some of the discretionary projects. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on that front? Is there any hesitancy or are there any challenges in terms of meeting demand in that regard? Brian Humphries : Well, it's very consistent with my last answer, Kathy, to be honest; I am expecting a robust environment. Clients are being decisive, discretionary projects are being funded. I think we've all grown used to the new world. And kind of we're getting at bats more often than ever before. Beyond bill, run, and more in the innovation and transformation agenda. So I feel very good and optimistic about the macro demand picture. But as I said earlier, talent shortages and attrition are a much bigger concern for me at this moment in time than macro demand. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. The first one just on M&A just to follow up there. Your Cognizant pace of M&A has increased quite a bit in the last few quarters. Can you just comment a bit on how you're building that muscle? So that it's becomes more of a strategic differentiator for Cognizant like what changes have you made to how you're doing sourcing or integration of these companies? Thank you. Brian Humphries : Jan do you want to address that? Jan Siegmund : Yes, look, the M&A activity had been healthy in the first quarter. So we spent approximately $300 million and announced four acquisitions. But I wouldn't read too much to it as an accelerated pace, I think we're executing against the plan and trying to spend in the framework of the capital that we strategically want to allocate towards M&A and we are executing that. The team has done really a fantastic job in aligning our deal sourcing across industries and across the globe. So you see this, for example. We talked in the last quarter about a slight shift towards more geographic expansion. And we have two deals, this and Australian deal, and, of course, very close to my heart of German deal, also part of the transactions that we could announce and some of them closed. So we executing really, in a classic manner, the team is very focused partnering with our markets and with our service lines on identifying the strategic areas of growth that we want to do. And it's been very diligent and creative of identifying acquisition opportunities. It has really worked really well. And I think the natural spacing of these things will lead us to kind of execute against our allocated capital against it. Now it's what we have been lumpy in and out, but a consistent way to do so.  The focus in the company is clearly on integration, because the synergies that these companies deliver are at the heart of the viability of all M&A strategy. And we are pleased with the ability to generate synergies. Our business plans are generally pretty close to the reality on the revenue synergies, and as we now have a larger portfolios of companies that we have acquired, we have increased our focus, like naturally on integration and efficiencies so that these companies can fit into the fabric of Cognizant and benefit from the scale that we can bring to the table. You see, we have still dilution from acquisitions, putting pressure on our margin. And so you'll see us continuing working on driving integration and reaping also some of the cost efficiencies that might be available to us in the future. Lisa Ellis : Terrific, thank you. And then just a quick follow up. I know, Brian, you mentioned that now you've had a 1.1, or greater book-to-bill for, I think, more than a year now on a very sustained basis. Can you just kind of comment on how you're feeling about the backlog at this point, your confidence level, whether it's improved in kind of your visibility into the sales pipeline and sales forecasting? Thanks. Brian Humphries : Yes, actually, I should thank Jan for this when he came in, he did a tremendous job, really decomposing down prior bookings, and tracing them to follow the breadcrumbs into revenue. And so at this moment in time, we have much better visibility into that than we had this time last year. I really feel good about our bookings momentum, to your point, really, since the last, if you think about it, throughout 2020, we had an exceptionally strong Q1. And then through the course of the year, we had strength with mid teams for the course of the year. But really, in 2019, it starts you don't get bookings until you start building a pipeline. So we really put a lot of efforts in the second half of 2022 to pipeline build that started showing up in terms of bookings momentum in 2020. And then, of course, into 2021. We don't have the same easy compares now as we had last year, which is why I want you to really contextualize Q1 bookings growth of 5%. I actually am delighted with that, because our December was really outstanding. It was an excellent month for us. And April has been an excellent month. So the Q1 period has been sandwiched between that. And it's really important to me that people think about bookings on a on a rolling four quarter basis, because something stepping from the Friday to a Monday, or vice versa, could take a deal from Q1 to Q2, or Q1 to Q4. So it's important to contextualize that. So book-to-bill is the right way to also think about it. I think once you're north of 1.1x, it creates a backlog of opportunity to go execute against and hopefully accelerate revenue on from here. So we're confident of in our numbers. And we're also confident we'll have a very strong Q2 bookings number on the back not just of excellent April results, but also let's face it the compare wasn't exactly stellar in May, this time last year for many other reasons. Operator : Our last question comes from a line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien Huang : Hey, thanks so much. I know you're at the bottom of the hour here. I just want to get a clarification here on the margin side and just ask it at a high level is just a cost of doing business is going up? I mean, I see your gross margin in the first quarter was pretty good. But I know you move into the lower end on the margins side, you said to Lisa, that some of the M&A integration costs are going up. I understand that. But is the rest of it just people and again, is the cost of doing business overall, just maybe gone higher than you expected 90 days ago. Brian Humphries : Tien-Tsin, thank you for the question. I was wondering if it wouldn't come actually so appreciate it as well, because there's a lot of momentum and movement in our margins that I think is important to put our eyes on. When you compare our margins, overall operating margin, we kind of roughly flat slightly improved year-over-year and on the gross margin side you see the benefits of our Fit for Growth. And you can see also the benefits of the lower T&E that helped us to expand the growth margins. Utilization helped a little bit and also we had obviously a little bit help in the rupee that all help on the margin side. But then we had on the SG&A side, you see an accelerated growth, but we're really laser focused on directing that SG&A growth to our strategic initiatives that we think will yield.  We view them as investments will yield accelerating revenue growth rates, and you pointed out the two biggest items M&A is and its dilutive element in its initial years, as well as our investments into sales and account management and growth, in essence, those are two offsetting factors that we have seen in the past quarters, but also, this quarter, when we now outlook, you're pointing out, we are basically down taking our margin guidance a tiny bit. I think that is reflective of a balance that we're trying to strike here, reflecting what we anticipate could be some increase in our compensation costs due to the measures in order to lower attrition attract and retain our talent. And we're planning to offset that partially with some changes assumptions, I think the crisis in India illustrates that maybe T&E is not coming back as fast as we had anticipated. And we'll also carefully and surgically monitoring our future SG&A growth to tie it all so that we keep the overall margin equation together for the full year. But the second quarter will be kind of in line or similar to our first quarter margin expectation, and particularly since we're anticipating the SG&A moderation to accelerate basically in the third and fourth quarter, but some of the compensation measures will be probably visible already in the second quarter. Tien Huang : Thank you for going through that. That was very clear, Jan, so maybe it's a quick follow up. Just you didn't mention contract execution and performance. So I'm assuming things are going well there any update on contract execution? And risk management has identified any changes since last quarter on the portfolio? Jan Siegmund : Yes. I presume you refer to our management of escalations, deals, et cetera. I think we have had a very usual quarter; we made progress on our implementation of improvements for deal reviews and deal acceptance and pricing. As we rolled out, those initiatives are gaining momentum. And on the delivery side, I think the issues that we're hearing the most and Brian mentioned it is obviously our ability to fulfill and to have talent available is a primary concern of our clients. But overall, I would say it's a -- was a very solid quarter relative to execution. Brian Humphries : All right. I think with that, we'll end today's call. Thank you all for the questions and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your evening.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Thank you. I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's second quarter 2021 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Against a challenging labor market backdrop and the recent humanitarian crisis in India, we executed well in the second quarter, allowing us to deliver significant upside to our revenue guidance. Second quarter revenue of $4.6 billion represented growth of 15% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. I'm grateful to our teams across the world for their unflagging dedication to consistently meeting our promises to clients. Thanks to the professionalism of all our associates with no major disruption to client service delivery from the second wave of the pandemic in India. We continue to execute against our previously announced Operation C3, which includes our vaccination drive across the 11 cities where Cognizant has operations in India. To date, we've administered or re-endorsed over 160,000 vaccines to associates or their families and dependents. I'm pleased with the strength of key commercial metrics. Bookings growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our book-to-bill ratio is now 1.2 on a trailing 12-month basis. Qualified pipeline is significantly up, and our win rates are also up year-to-date, positioning us well for continued bookings momentum. Digital revenue growth accelerated to 20% year-over-year in the quarter. Moving to industry segments. We posted strong double-digit year-over-year constant currency growth in Communications, Media and Technology, Products and Resources and Healthcare. We've achieved a double-digit CAGR over the past 4 years in Communications, Media and Technology and remain optimistic on our growth prospects. This industry is now home to some of our largest clients. Within Products and Resources we continue to post excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Meanwhile, both retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality posted their 4th successive quarter of sequential revenue increases and are now close to prepandemic revenue levels. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q2 revenue was $4.6 billion, representing growth of approximately 15% or 12% in constant currency. Revenue was $125 million above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued demand for digital, which grew 20% and represented 44% of total revenues. Year-over-year revenue growth also includes approximately  of growth from our recent acquisitions and benefited from an easier compare to Q2 2020, where our revenues were impacted in the early months of the pandemic and by the ransomware attack in April 2020. Moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 5%, in line with our expectations. We continue to make progress as we reposition this business and observed a strong improvement in the pipeline. We still expect the paced recovery through the remainder of the year. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 13%. Again, driven by strong performance in both our health care payer and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and we continue to see strong demand for our integrated payer software solutions and improving fundamentals in our provider business. As Brian mentioned, we remain very pleased with the growth in our life sciences business. Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 18%, driven by the 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Segment growth included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue. As Brian mentioned, we also experienced growth in retail consumer goods and travel and hospitality, driven in part by the lapping of the prepandemic conveyors. There are early signs of stabilization within these sectors most impacted by the pandemic, but we continue to monitor closely. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 18%, of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by a negative 190 basis point impact from our exit of certain portions to our content services business. Overall, we are very pleased with the growth of our core portfolio. Now moving on to margins. In Q2, our GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 15.2%. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved approximately 110 basis points, primarily reflecting the savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and the impact from the pandemic and ransomware attack in Q2 2020. This year-over-year benefit was offset in part by SG&A investments, including those intended to drive and support organic revenue growth as well as the negative impact on margin on our recently completed acquisitions and costs related to the modernization of our IT core and security infrastructure. In addition, we anticipate continued cost pressure from our elevated attrition, which includes higher recruiting costs, lateral higher wages and subcontractor costs. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26.5% and our adjusted tax rate was 25.4%, in line with our expectations. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.97 and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.99. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.9 billion or $1.2 billion net of debt. Free cash flow in Q2 was $466 million. This included a payment from the settlement with 2 of the 3 customers that were part of the proposed customer engagement exit we announced in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings. Excluding this onetime payment, free cash flow would have been approximately 100% of net income. The payments made this quarter were in line with our prior expectations and resulted in no impact to our earnings in Q2. Overall, we were pleased with the outcome of the settlement, which includes a continued commercial relationship with both customers. Negotiations with the third client are ongoing and constructive. DSO of 71 days increased by 1 day sequentially and has improved from 77 days in the prior year period. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $296 million at a weighted average price of approximately $74 per share. At the end of June, we had $2.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We also spent cash of approximately $350 million on acquisitions and $127 million for our regular quarterly dividend. Turning to guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.69 billion to $4.74 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10.6% to 11.6% or 10% to 11% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 60 basis points impact and inorganic contribution of approximately 320 basis points. For the full year, we now expect revenue of $18.4 billion to $18.5 billion, representing 10.2% to 11.2% growth or 9% to 10% in constant currency. This compares to our prior guidance of 7% to 9% growth as reported or 5.5% to 7.5% in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 120 basis points impact and includes approximately 320 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. Our outlook assumes continued momentum across Healthcare, CMT and Products and Resources, while we continue to expect a paced recovery in Financial Services over the next couple of quarters. Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15.4%, the midpoint of our prior guidance of 15.2% to 15.7%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas. We are also continuing to fund investments in our people, including compensation, quarterly promotions, retention and training. We expect these costs will weigh on our results for the next several quarters as management remains keenly focused on addressing our high attrition levels through a comprehensive set of initiatives. We continue to expect SG&A growth for the remainder of the year, driven in part by the impact from our M&A activity. However, we are slowing the pace of growth in some areas not directly related to our strategic initiatives to mitigate some of this cost pressure. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance which is $4 to $4.06 compared to $3.90 to $4.02 previously. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million to $30 million compared to $20 million to $30 million previously. Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 528 million compared to 530 million previously and a tax rate of 25% to 26%, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy and returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before opening the call for questions, I wanted to let you know that we are planning to hold an investor briefing in the fall during which Brian and I will provide a review of our strategy and an update on our progress over the last 2 years. We will also provide our multiyear financial framework. Please keep an eye out and save the date in the coming weeks. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : . Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : A follow-up question, as I'm sure you'll get 20 of them related to the attrition and headcount dynamics. One, maybe, Jan, can you just elaborate on what gives you confidence in your ability to expand margins in the second half of the year while you're still sort of battling through this attrition environment? Like -- so for example, are you -- given the high demand environment, are you able to take price, et cetera? Just a little bit more color there. And then I'll just ask my second one kind of related is just around employee health. I'm just wondering like how employee satisfaction is faring at Cognizant? I know that's something that you watch pretty closely. So what's your confidence level in being able to bring attrition down over the next couple of quarters? Jan Siegmund : Yes. Thank you, Lisa, and somehow I anticipated questions around our margin guidance being of interest. It's a complex situation, Lisa, in that we have actually quite a few dynamics going on that impact the margin dynamic for the second half. And so you're rightly concluded that for the second half, we are expecting really, on average, margin development around 15.6% to meet our midpoint of our guidance. And as you're also aware, we have a little bit of a quarterly dynamic towards the year-end. So margins in the third quarter, we're thinking, are going to be slightly higher than towards the fourth quarter due to typical end-of-season dynamics, including the merit increase when we administer and implement the merit thing. So that's kind of all the general margin dynamic. What we have seen, I want to point out a few other elements of the margin dynamic. We have seen, in this quarter, a fairly healthy margin dynamic on the gross margin side, and we reported a shift in our digital revenue mix, which comes actually with higher gross margin than our traditional business, which is part of the strategic rationale of why we are, of course, engaging in the transformation of the business. And that margin effect was accelerated actually, we shifted share, but we also improved that relative margin in our second quarter. So we anticipate to continue to have some benefit from that mix shift also in the second half. And then, of course, we see pressure from the compensation measures coming into our P&L. And we're offsetting that by controlling the growth of certain SG&A components that have been growing kind of likely, I would say, to and bring that more to a controlled or flattish outcome towards the end of the year. And so it's a number of factors that we have to keenly execute in order to keep, of course, the overall structure of our P&L in place, but that's the principal dynamic that we are following. And I hand over the employee engagement question to Brian. Brian Humphries : Thanks, Jan. Hi, Lisa. Look, it's very much top of mind. As you can imagine, voluntary attrition in the quarter was 29%. But on a trailing 12-month basis, which is more how the industry tends to look at it, it was 18%. And we've seen primarily the attrition in the more junior levels of the organization or mid-levels in India, but it's also a global phenomenon. It's really one of the hottest markets we've seen or our team has seen over the last 10-plus years. So we're all dealing with it. As it happens in the last month, we had the results of our annual engagement survey. We're actually very pleased with our results. They're at or above, in many cases, industry benchmarks. I'm really pleased to see the delivery organization, engagement scores are actually above the company average, and they're very much as a total company in the same range as where we've been from 2016 and beyond. Last year, we actually had a particularly strong year, as many companies did, because of the pandemic when people were pleased when they had secure jobs or whatnot. So from one perspective, I feel very, very good about it. But in the same vein, of course, I don't feel very good about the attrition. And so that's top of mind, and it's got a lot of management focus. I'm pleased that we executed well in the quarter. We exceeded our revenue guidance despite elevated attrition, but my great hope is, over time, we can reduce attrition and yet continue to hire at the pace we have been hiring at, which is something we're very pleased with. The throughput of our recruitment team has been terrific. So what are we doing to reduce attrition and to continue to drive employee engagement is the next obvious question. Well, look, annual merit-based increases have been announced here in the last few weeks. They're effective October 1. That's on top of a whole host of ad hoc measures we played through in the course of the last year : out-of-cycle increases, promotion, retention dollars. We've announced a shift in the last few months to quarterly promotion cycles for billable resources. We've really fast-tracked job rotations and reskilling initiatives across the company, then a host of things with Cognizant Academy, which is our training capability, as well as higher education programs for select employees as well. And we've put an enormous effort behind our employee value proposition, celebrating delivery success, big wins, et cetera. So more work to be done, but I'm confident we're doing the right things. And as I said, while I'm pleased we executed through at this quarter, the reality is 15% revenue growth this quarter also gives the organization a little bit of energy that, look, growth is coming back and with growth comes good things in terms of career path opportunities, rotations and promotions and whatnot. So I'm sure today's top line story will help a lot of employees feel better, and we'll keep doing all the other things we're doing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Good quarter, guys. I wanted to follow up also on attrition. Could you talk a little bit more about what you expect for 3Q, 4Q attrition? And what's been the client feedback in the face of the situation? Brian Humphries : So look, from my perspective, the first thing I would think about our associates and our clients, and you can't be client-centric unless you're associate-centric. And so as we start thinking about this, of course, it gets into how we engage our clients and how we think about the demand signal that will help us facilitate the right resources at the right time. Communication is important in a time like this, setting appropriate expectations regarding resource availability time lines. Entity prioritization, Ashwin, as you can imagine, getting the right resources on our most strategic accounts is very much top of mind and part of our execution rigor we do now on a day in, day out basis. Regrettably, we just -- despite growing 15% in the quarter, we're yet unable to meet the full expectations of our own potential and what is out there in the market. So we're working through that as best we can and doing our best, as I said, to minimize attrition, whilst at the same time to maximize employee engagement and to maximize onboarding. As I said in my remarks, we'll bring on about 100,000 lateral hires this year alone. We'll train about 100,000 people, and we'll onboard about 30,000 freshers and we'll make offers to 45,000 freshers. Regardless of our attrition rate, we will still go through with those numbers because there is enough market demand for us to get after that opportunity. And that's what we're quite excited about. I think the portfolio is more compelling than ever before, and we've made huge progress in the last year to get after that market opportunity. So we're feeling pretty good about that. But it's a hot market, and I think you've heard that through the earnings cycle. So we're all dealing with the same problem. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : I'll just ask 2 upfront here. So as it relates to bookings and the growing commercial momentum you called out, can you comment on how well distributed the bookings contribution has been across the sales force? So how much of your sales force would you say is optimized and converting versus those that are still building pipeline and will convert over the balance of this year into next? And then just to clarify on attrition, have you continued to see the trend of declining resignations month-to-month? Brian Humphries : Well, I'll deal with that first. Look, we look at net resignations. It went through -- actually, at the end of last quarter, we thought we'd hit an apex and then it went up modestly, but it's -- we're expecting, and it's inherent in our guidance, elevated attritions to remain in the coming quarter, and we'll see what happens thereafter. It's a very -- as you can imagine, a hot market out there, and so it's very difficult to call. I think we're doing the right things to mitigate that. But rest assured, these levels of attrition and slightly beyond our inner guidance. With regards to bookings, look, I feel really good about our bookings, to be very honest. It's important to look at bookings not just on a weekly or a quarterly basis, but really on a trailing 12-month basis. And now we have rounded that 1-year period, so we have a good book-to-bill ratio over the last 12 months of 1.2x, which I think is very, very healthy. We look at it in terms of geographic. We look at it in terms of business mix. We look at it in terms of new and expansion versus renewals. And it's pretty solid across the board. And the pipeline is solid across the board as well. So I feel good about the market opportunity. Candidly, I don't think demand is the problem for this industry. I think it's a great time to be in services. It's more of a supply constraint at this moment in time. With regard to the sales, our commercial teams we brought on board. Look, they're ramping. I don't think we have full productivity. At this stage, we've got a lot of exercises underway to make sure we get true gearing ratios. But in the same vein, I feel as though we've got a client-facing team now that is better able to walk the corridors if and when we get back from COVID, virtually for now, and to cross-sell the entire portfolio. And if you think about our installed base, it's a huge asset for us and the opportunity is real. About 4 out of 10, or 40%, of our accounts, we only sell 1 of our practices into those, and we have 10-plus practices. So think about cross-sell as a huge opportunity for us. And of course, the M&A that we have conducted in the last 2 years, which is 100% aligned to our digital strategy, enables that cross-sell more than ever before. And indeed, cross-sell is core to the business case of those acquisitions. So we're pretty excited about what we can do there, both in terms of our installed base, which, of course, is a big priority for us. But we also have opportunity through this extended portfolio to get after new logos. And the Qualcomm example I cited in my script is a good example of that, where we're leading with digital. And accordingly, we'll try and cross-sell the non-digital business as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Rod Bourgeois : Hey, Brian, so when you consider your pipeline and your inorganic growth plan going forward, are you in a position to further substantially increase your digital mix over the next year? I'd love any color to help dimension the remaining mix shift potential over the next year or so, that would be really helpful. Brian Humphries : Yes. Hey, Rob. So as you know very well, one of our biggest priorities when I joined the company was to accelerate our digital mix. It was 28% or less than 30%, certainly at the end of 2018 for the year. And it's been very much part and parcel of what we're setting out to achieve. It's 44% of our mix today. Candidly, a numerator denominator comes into play. We actually had very good success this quarter, driving growth as well in our non-digital business, which has declined in 2019 and 2020. So candidly, that has slowed the digital mix ramping further, the share growth of non-digital this quarter. But overall, the digital business will continue to grow. I'd like to think as we get to the latter part of this year, we'll be up closer to 50%, and it will start becoming a bigger portion of our overall business over time. That's important for us because : a, it helps us be exposed to higher growth categories; but b, it increases our intimacy with the broader C-suite in our installed base of accounts, and that enables us to sell beyond the CTO organization into the CMO into the line of service leader, et cetera. Of the accounts that we have added in the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, the vast majority of the bookings exactly in what we would term digital. So Rod, that mix shift to digital will continue, and I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to see a nice ramp there. That is not just good for revenue or client intimacy, it's actually also very good for our margin rate as a company as well. So we feel as though we're doing the right things. Our M&A strategy is 100% behind this, and it puts us in a position to actually get after our installed base to cross-sell and upsell and actually get new logos and really become a challenger in the digital arena. Jan Siegmund : Rod, if I add one comment on the dynamic of the digital organic revenue growth, we very carefully monitor the organic growth that our M&A is generating within itself, but also, of course, as a cross-sell into our client base, and we have seen a very robust organic growth from that portfolio that is kind of, in most cases, meeting our business case assumptions. So we're very pleased that actually, the shift is not only of M&A, it's not only adding the incremental acquired revenues to the portfolio, but that portfolio also is accelerating and growing faster than the average in its growth trajectory. Brian Humphries : And Rod, I meant to -- you explicitly asked around the pipeline. Look, the digital pipeline has grown at multiples of the non-digital pipeline. And actually, our win rates in digital are higher than our win rates in non-digital. So there's a lot of good leading indicators. Rod Bourgeois : Great. And Jan, you kind of read my mind. My follow-up was related to the acquisitions. And looking for an update on your progress in being able to cross-sell the newly acquired offerings into your existing accounts, that's a muscle that tends to take time to develop. So maybe just give us some thinking on where you are in that journey? Are you well into that journey? Or is there still some juice left on the cross-selling into existing accounts with these newly acquired capabilities that you have? Jan Siegmund : I would say we're still in the early and mid-parts of our journey. We made really good outcomes happen for acquisitions that have examples where we haven't even closed the acquisition. We started to think about cross-selling the product already prior to the close, so there's plenty of excitement in our sales force to bring these solutions to our clients. And as we now focus to fully integrate this acquired portfolio of digital capabilities into the fold of Cognizant, many other benefits of pipeline management will become easier, the learning for the acquired companies will grow, so I'm optimistic that we will continue to reap really good benefits out of the M&A regarding to the organic growth that they are generating, which is what I'm really keenly focused on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Bradley Clark : This is Brad Clark on for Keith. I would like to ask if there was any way to quantify either the impact or size of the planned wage increases for employees. And then secondly, given ongoing employee and market pressure on margin throughout the remainder of the year, how do you view future M&A strategy compared to the past 12 to 18 months? Is the pace of M&A sustainable? What are your views on that going forward? Brian Humphries : Jan? Jan Siegmund : Yes, thank you for your question. We don't disclose really the elements of our compensation moves externally, so I can't help you with that. It is clearly reflecting the market dynamics. We are orienting our compensation, obviously, on market data and reflect -- our compensation moves really reflect an assessment about keeping Cognizant a competitive employer and recruiter in the marketplace. And we are very pleased actually with that. The ability to attract associates into the Cognizant family is great. We've been ranked in a variety of publications as really employer of choice, and particularly, in the critical market of India for us. So it will feather through country-specific and market-oriented based on wage developments in those countries. On the M&A program, we just talked about, I think, at the end of last year, about a capital allocation framework for the company, which about -- dedicates 50% of our cash flow to M&A for a reminder, about 25% used to offset the dilution of our equity compensation and 25% for dividends. And we use this framework not to position, but as a really good framework for us to execute our strategy. So going forward, I'm anticipating to spend within the range of that capital allocation framework to support the execution of our strategy. We remain focused in that M&A program on our strategic objectives and focus on our digital battlegrounds. You have seen in some of the acquisitions in the beginning of this year, that we may have, and it's with few transactions, hard to describe the trend, but there is a keen focus on executing and using the strategy also to help the globalization of Cognizant. And so you have seen with Servian earlier in the year, an acquisition in the Australian marketplace. We acquired ESG Mobility in the fatherland, my home country, which I was very happy about, really a leading provider on the Internet of Things, IoT, with keen leadership positions in the automotive sector. So there is more geographic diversion still needed for us. And so we'll adapt as we make progress on the positioning of our practices and our industry groups to the needs of the strategy. And so this is a long answer for you, but yes, we anticipate to continue our acquisition-driven strategy execution. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : I'll mix it up and ask about TriZetto. I think I heard that your repositioning is driving better growth, double digits. I was a little surprised by that. I'm curious, can you elaborate on that? What are you doing differently? And could this kind of change be extended or apply it to other areas as well? Brian Humphries : So our product business in Healthcare, Tien-Tsin, is something that we inherited through the TriZetto acquisition at the end of 2014. To be very honest, I think we didn't execute the integration of that optimally. And in the last few years, we've really tried to get after that opportunity because I think it's a crown jewel that I felt we could do a better job on. And so starting with that, we got off to the road map that we had, tried to understand, solicit customer feedback to make sure we had something that in the eyes of clients was in line with their needs that the user interface and the code was appropriate and fit for purpose. And in the meantime, we had some competitors that had emerged that frankly, I didn't think had the right to beat us given our heritage in this space. Fortunately, now, we've had 3 quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the product business. And as I said, our growth in 2020 versus 2019 doubled, and we're on track to double growth rate year-over-year again and we're getting some fantastic logos. And this is a great business in itself. It's software-centric, higher margins. But of course, the stickiness of that enables us to pull through a rich services suite thereafter. So the team has done a fantastic job. I view it as highly strategic for us, and we're 100% committed to that business, and you'll see us scale in that over time. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. No, it's encouraging to hear. I'll ask quickly, if you don't mind, just on the supply side, just with more lateral hires. Can we just infer that's indicative of more digital work, so you need to go out there and grab some of the lateral hires? Or is it just purely out of necessity, given what you said about demand and the timing of university hiring or maybe more work needs to be done on the training side to meet the type of work that needs to be done? I'm just trying to understand what's structural versus cyclical there. Brian Humphries : If you think about the lateral hires, it's really with a view to doing 2 things. One is addressing the attrition that we have and also getting after the market potential that we see. And so you go back to where is attrition greatest, it's at the mid-junior levels of the pyramid, particularly in India. But it's also in hot skills. And if you think about hot skills, think about hyperscalers, think about leading SaaS players, think about digital engineering, full stack engineers or across data, AI and ML. And so you find yourself in a situation where you've got a demand-supply imbalance, and that's an area as well where we're also going after lateral skills and trying to get them in as quickly as we can, whilst also trying to train and promote our internal employees as well. So it's a race for talent in a red hot market. And I anticipate, given how bullish I am in the market, and my sense is we'll have a resilient services, the main feature for the foreseeable future, I anticipate elevated attrition across the industry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG. Unidentified Analyst : This is Mike on for Jamie. So my first one, can you guys talk a little bit about your updated perspective on 5G? And this quarter with CMT growing so well, has 5G offered any tailwinds there? Brian Humphries : Look, from my perspective, 5G is still in its very early days, both in terms of asset -- handset proliferation and the use cases that probably, given the need for latency security and other considerations, will be more B2B or B2B2B rather than B2C. I don't think B2C is a huge inflection point for the telco industry, albeit many people will talk about it to justify CapEx outlays. With regards to our CMT industry vertical, it has not been a major driver of the business to date. We're very intrigued around autonomous driving. As Jan said, we acquired ESG Mobility in Germany. We've got a big emphasis on the automotive vertical and indeed on the CMT vertical, but 5G has not been a massive factor to date. I think IoT will be unlocked by the benefits of 5G and different cellular technologies, but it's premature at this stage. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Great. I wanted to ask on pricing. I mean you touched a bit on that earlier. But how has pricing trended in the quarter, particularly given some of the pure commentary around pricing stability? And I guess what we're really trying to get at is are you able to pass on some of the wage costs? And how are clients responding to that? Jan Siegmund : Yes. We have observed pricing trends by segment. And I implied in my comments that we have been expanding our gross margins on the digital business, and we have seen an ability to the tight labor market, allowing us to get good pricing for our services. We see also continued pricing pressure in the more traditional services that we have been talking about in past quarters, where clients are seeking additional cost benefit, and that pricing pressure in those more traditional type of services haven't changed at this point in time. James Faucette : And just on digital quickly. We're big believers in your acquisition strategy, and I appreciate the early color around digital battlegrounds. But are there any digital battlegrounds where you're currently under-indexed relative to the demand that you're seeing that you could take a better advantage of? Brian Humphries : Hey, James, this is Brian, I'll address that. Look, the digital arena more holistically for us, it goes well beyond the 4 digital battlegrounds that I focused on when we joined, which were notably around cloud, around digital engineering, around applications and IoT and data and analytics, rather. The -- if you think about other areas that are not included in those so-called battlegrounds, things like digital experience continue to grow rapidly for us, and I'm very optimistic that, that becomes a core part of the sale, the whole user experience as you think about digital workflows. So it's broad-based. Digital engineering is something we prioritize. It's growing rapidly. As I said, it's one of our biggest growth potential units in the years ahead. Something that has scaled meaningfully in the last 2 years, and we're now one of the largest digital engineering companies in the world. We've complemented our capabilities with the acquisition of Softvision in 2018, and then in more recent years, Magenic and Tin Roof. I just feel very good about our potential there, but more broadly, there's just a lot of demand in this arena, and I just feel good about our potential because we're scaling, it's still a smaller portion of our mix. The more we scale, the higher company average CAGR. And as Jan has implied, it's good for our margin rate as well. So we're full speed ahead after the digital opportunity. Tyler Scott : All right. I think with that, we'll wrap it up. Thank you, everybody, for joining, and look forward to speaking with everyone next quarter. Brian Humphries : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Thank you. I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin your presentation. Tyler Scott : Thank you, Operator. And good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the Company's Third Quarter of 2021 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.  Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering revenue of $4.7 billion up 11.8% year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Bookings growth, a key leading indicator, accelerated to 24% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times revenue and a trailing 12-month basis underscores our commercial momentum. I'm grateful to our teams around the world for their resourcefulness in meeting our client commitments despite a challenging labor market. We delivered solid sequential adjusted operating margin expansion in the third quarter as we offset the cost of increased hiring with cost discipline elsewhere. I'm also pleased with our progress against our key strategic initiatives.  For example, third quarter digital revenue grew 18% year-over-year. Digital represents 44% of our overall revenue mix. We expect this percentage to grow in future periods, positioning Cognizant for both top-line momentum and margin expansion. Moreover, the intimacy of our C-suite engagement increases as we serve clients in their digital transformations. Better-than-expected growth in our non-digital business impacted our digital mix progression, but is nonetheless a welcome outcome. During the third quarter, we saw continued strong top-line momentum in our digital business operations practice, reflecting our differentiated offerings for digital natives, our BPaaS leadership position in healthcare, and our strength in intelligence process automation solutions.  We recently announced Cognizant Neuro, a simpler and more effective way for clients to achieve the full potential of intelligent process automation and speed time to results. Everest Group, a leading industry analyst firm, recently recognized Cognizant Neuro as an exciting development to enable automation at scale.  Moving to industry segments. Financial services ongoing recovery continued, with growth of 4.3% year-over-year in constant currency in line with our expectations. We posted strong double-digit growth year-over-year in constant currency in products and resources and in communications, media, and technology.  Within products and resources, we continued to deliver excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities, as well as across retail, consumer goods, and travel and hospitality, which have recovered to pre -pandemic levels. In communications, media, and technology, we continue to lead with our digital engineering capability to win transformation deals, while leveraging our alliances to be a premier cloud transformation partner.  In healthcare, we had another solid quarter, achieving 9.8% constant-currency growth. Momentum in life sciences continued, demand across payers remain strong, and we're beginning to see an uptick in demand across providers as they look to digital technologies to help reduce operating costs and strengthened new channels for delivering care. Our products business saw a continued double-digit growth in Q3.  We're expanding our footprint in the healthcare market and adding new growth members on our platforms. We're also well underway with our digital transformation of our products, including the launch of our connected interoperability solutions to help clients provide secure, real-time data access, and meet compliance deadlines.  We're proud of the work we're doing in partnership with clients like Parkland Community Health Plan. Parkland was looking for better ways to meet the growing needs of its medically underserved populations in Texas.  As a better managers health insurance claims, member transactions, and network of physicians and hospitals, our TriZetto QNXT Core Administration platform, delivered in a BPaaS model is enabling delivery of care management, claims processing, member services, provider services, and quality on a single platform, thereby enhancing care coordination and member experiences.  Our healthcare business is a hugely strategic asset. I'm pleased with the progress we've made accelerating growth in healthcare, and I'm optimistic in our future prospects as healthcare companies modernize their business to address the need for enhanced client experiences, including virtual care solutions. Let's turn now to Strategy, including our digital ambitions.  I remain bullish on both the macro demand environment and Cognizant's growing momentum in Digital. Clients continue to accelerate their investment in digital operating models to improve their customer and employee experiences, and modernize their operations through data automation and cloud.  While most companies have launched digital initiatives, few have made the shift to a fully-digital operating model. Cognizant is now one of the few global firms that can serve clients across all stages of their digital transformation, from modernizing their technology foundation to implementing agile workflows.  This is in part a result of investing approximately $3 billion in mergers and acquisitions over the past few years to broaden our portfolio, while strengthening our relationships with hyperscalers and key partners. Good client example is Cabot Corporation, a global leader in specialty chemicals and performance materials, who recently engaged us to help transform their digital operating model.  We'll be providing application development and maintenance, as well as infrastructure and operation services. And enabling Cabot to create an enhanced digital experience that drives value for its customers and employees. Gaining our international operations is another strategic priority.  And during the Third Quarter, we grew bookings and revenue solidly in both Europe and rest of world, with the highlight being 19% constant-currency revenue growth in the United Kingdom. We remain optimistic on our international market prospects and aim to accelerate growth as we invest in our talents, brand, partnerships, and operations.  Global Biopharma leader Sanofi has selected Cognizant as a strategic partner to deploy an omnichannel customer engagement model; the solution will enable their customer-facing teams to engage with healthcare professionals for the new digital channels, provide them more personalized content, and also suggest next best actions.  Cognizant deployed the cloud-based CRN, integrated marketing automation and Intelligent Data Platform to the first 18 markets in just eight months. And for Her Majesties revenue and customs, the UK government's tax authority, we're providing broad technology expertise across its Pega technology SPAC, and enabling Pega application development and operational support that will facilitate case management and customer service applications.  Moving on now to the intensifying competition for talent across multiple industries. The demand-supply imbalance in our ore industry remains particularly acute. Third quarter voluntary attrition reached 33% on an annualized basis, or 24% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, when we measure attrition, we count the entire Company, including trainees and corporate across IT services and BPO. Despite elevated attrition, we increased our net headcount in Q3 by over 17,000 sequentially, which speaks to the tremendous work and effectiveness of our recruitment team. Given our focus in recent years on accelerating pressure hiring in India, we've made meaningful progress on addressing our pyramid. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make offers to 45,000 new graduates in India for on-boarding and 2022. Retention and recruitment have our leadership\u2019s full attention.  We are continuing our comprehensive program to support our associates career growth and engagement to a range of initiatives that include : committed annual increases and evolved approach to promotions, job board, so associates can easily explore open leadership roles Company-wide, abundant new training and development programs, sustained communication with our commitment to belonging and inclusion across our Company and to society more broadly, And the continuing pursuit an ESG agenda which shows special meeting for our associates. To this point earlier this year, we published our first the issue reports and set out on a path to reduce our emissions and increase our energy efficiency. Last week we announced Cognizant's commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We plan to achieve this net zero goal through ongoing investments in renewable energy.  Building on our initial success in India, where a quarter of our energy has come from renewable sources since 2020. We will also be investing in new energy efficient technologies across our officers and data centers globally. In addition, we will extend our expertise in Cloud IoT and AI to help clients meet their sustainability goals.  In closing, while the industry faces an unprecedented competition for talent, during the third quarter, we attracted a record number of employees to Cognizant and stayed focus on delivering against our client commitments and our strategic repositioning. We're bullish on the industry and on an all-growing commercial momentum.  Jan and I look forward to discussing Cognizant's future with you at our November 18th investor briefing. With that, I will turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan over to you. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Our Q3 revenue was $4.7 billion representing growth of approximately 12% or 11% at constant -currency. Revenue growth was led by digital, which grew 18% and represented 44% of total revenue for the quarter. As Brian mentioned earlier, our digital business operations practice area is also growing strongly.  Year-over-year growth includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. Moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services revenue increased approximately 4% in line with our expectations. We continue to make steady progress as we reposition this business and have seen recent improvement in bookings and pipeline. We continue to expect modest growth for this segment for the full year. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 10%, again, driven by strong performance in both our healthcare and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and demand for our integrated software solutions remains strong.  We also remain very pleased with our life sciences business, which grew double-digits organically year-over-year. Products and resources revenue increased approximately 18% driven by the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit grow in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities. Retail and consumer goods, and travel and hospitality also grew double-digits year-over-year, with the both sectors experiencing  demand for digital services as they recovery from the impact of the pandemic in 2020. Segment growth also included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue.  Communications, Media, and Technology revenue grew 19%, of which approximately 500 basis points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was led by our Technology business, where our work with digital native clients has continued to drive growth in our core portfolio.  From a geographic perspective, North America grew approximately 10% year-over-year, driven by demand from healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, and technology. Growth in North America also included the benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments.  Revenue outside of North America grew approximately 16% year-over-year in constant-currency, led by growth in the U.K. We also experience strong growth in Germany and Australia driven impact. Recently completed acquisitions of ESG, mobility and Serbian, respectively. Now, moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP operating margin was 15.4%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact from the legal settlement, which if approved by the court, we'll resolve the previously disclosed 2016 securities class action lawsuit. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin declined approximately 10 basis points. Continued elevated attrition resulted in higher subcontractor recruiting, and other delivery costs.  Additionally, our recently completed acquisitions negatively impacted our margin, and we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth and modernize our core IT and securities infrastructure. These headwinds were partially offset by savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and 2021.  Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 25.6% and our adjusted tax rate was 26% towards the high end of our full-year guidance. Diluted GAAP EPS was $1.03 and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.06. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, or net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow of -- in Q3 was $897 million, representing approximately 165% of net income and in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.5 billion represents over 90% of net income. DSO of 72 days increased by one day sequentially, and is flat with the prior year period.  Management remains keenly focused on this metric as it is a key lever for free cash flow conversion in the future. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for $100 million under our share repurchase program and returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in line with our previously disclosed capital allocation framework.  During the quarter, we also spend cash of $57 million on acquisitions, bringing the year-to-date spend on acquisitions to over $700 million. Turning to guidance, for Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.79 billion representing year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 14.5%, or 13.3% to 14.3% in constant currency.  Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 20 basis points impact, and inorganic contribution of approximately 310 basis points. As a reminder, Q4 2020 revenue was negatively impacted by the $107 million charge related to our proposed financial services contract exit, which is expected to benefit Q4, 2021 year-over-year growth, compared by approximately 250 basis points. At the midpoint of our Q4 revenue outlook, we expect full-year revenue of $18.5 billion, representing 11.1% growth or 9.8% growth in constant currency. With that, we're guiding towards the high-end of our prior full-year guidance. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 130 basis points impact, and includes 330 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue.  Our guidance also assumes continued momentum across healthcare, CMT, and products and resources, and a modest growth in financial services for the full year. Moving on to margins. Our full-year adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged at approximately 15.4%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas, including recruiting and subcontractor costs, in addition to higher wages for lateral hires.  We also continue to invest significantly in our people through increased compensation, rolling quarterly promotions for billable associates and training. As a reminder, our annual merit increase for the majority of our associates is effective October 1. This will impact our Q4 margin and implies a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin from Q3. To partially offset these headwinds, we continue to moderate the pace of non-strategic SG & A spends. This leads to our full-year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.2 to $4.6 compared to the $4 to $4.06 previously. Our full-year outlook assumes interest income of approximately 30 million compared to $25 million to $30 million previously.  Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 5 million, 28 million, and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Both share count and tax rate are unchanged from our prior outlook. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Tien - Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question. Tien Tsin Huang : Thank you so much. I want to ask on the attrition and the gross margin lines and what to think about here, going into the fourth quarter gross margin, this quarter was actually pretty healthy despite this step-up in attrition that you had signaled to us. So look looking ahead, what should we think about there with attrition and gross margin specifically and are you able to pass along price increases? Have you seen any delivery execution issues that kind of thing? Thank you. Brian Humphries : Hi, Tien - Tsin. It's Brian. And I'll possibly Jan maybe directly after this. Look, first of all, attrition is elevated when you're going into the quarter, it would remain elevated. We expect going into the fourth quarter it will also remain elevated. However, we do expect some modest declines in attrition rate and that is healthy, we look naturally at resignations on a daily basis.  We think as we hopefully shown in the course of the year, we understand what's going on, what to expect from an attrition point of view. Clearly while the headline number is high, when you apply the rate of attrition to more industry standard definitions, such as a  12-month basis, but we think we are more in line with the industry in the low twenties.  As I think about this, we spent a tremendous amount of effort to try to address that both hearts and minds as well as compensation hearts and minds has less of an impact on margin compensation does. So just -- and when we think about hearts and minds, we're thinking about a sense of belonging, newness, celebrating success, career path discussions, training and development. And making sure that we have processes in place for people can actually get promoted more readily internally and so we've made a serious of adjustments to internal processes to facilitate that.  We've also really embraced the bottom of the pyramid after a few slower years at between 2017 and 19 or what we call GenC or fresher intake has increased meaningfully and that is also helping our pyramid and our ability to have good promotion capabilities this year. As we said in our prepared remarks, we'll add 45,000 offers.  So I feel pretty good about what we're doing from an attrition point-of-view. The reality is however, we're in an industry that is facing unprecedented competition for talent. And we continue to see attrition in the same areas as we told. I previously, name we have skills as well as the bottom of the pyramid. On pricing and on margin implications, I will pass through to Jan. Jan Siegmund : Maybe I'll start with the gross margin in the third quarter, which was relatively consistent to prior year. And obviously, a lot of in and out and clearly, we observed the impact of increased compensation onto the thing. But we had also positive effects like, for example, a modest shift in our digital revenues is helping us, overall acceleration of revenue growth has been a factor of helping our gross margin.  And a lot of ins and outs, and compare year-over-year because of the COVID situation. So you should expect, in the fourth quarter, pressure on our gross margins because we're implementing our compensation increase for the vast majority of our associates of having implemented October 1st.  So you do see some pressure on the gross margin in the fourth quarter. And clearly, we're working on all elements of curtailing that. But I think you will see net pressure. Pricing, I wanted to do two comments before I pass it back to Brian.  You know, of course, that the pricing takes some time to implement since clients have longer-term contracts, but when we -- when I will observe in particular, our digital business, I think I can say that our clients start to really see the value that Cognizant is delivering and understand the value that we can bring too.  So we're pleasantly satisfied, we are really happy with the situation that our core thesis about our strategy to shift to digital driving higher gross margin, is holding in helping us over the medium-term on the gross margin side. Back to you, Brian. Brian Humphries : Actually you've largely touch upon what I was going to say. I think the implications of digital is of course important from our pricing point of view, but also the competitors against which we're going up, enables us to be a very strong challenger brand; and so we have pricing, I would say, accretion as opposed to dilution.  And then just one other important point. Over the last few years, many people have asked me how I think about structured deals or captive takeout\u2019s. We've naturally, heavily embraced Digital, and our growth rate in Digital has been twice that of the industry over the last two years.  One of the benefit of Digital is, of course, the smaller contract durations you get, given the nature of the work you're performing, which ensures we haven't actually been locked into multiyear pricing dimensions as part of a 5 or an 8-year contract. That's actually, in a strange way, or that's to be quite favorable for us going forward. But all of this is heavy lifting. We have to get right in the quarters ahead, but we feel that we're on the right track. Tien Tsin Huang : Great. Thank you for the complete answers, guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi, thank you very much. Good evening. I wanted to ask a similar question, Brian. But I'm going to go at a different direction. You used the word unprecedented and I agree, it does seem to be unprecedented attrition. But I'm wondering what slows it. You've talked about specific steps that Cognizant's taking, but it's clearly an industry problem. And the other side is, does it require a slowdown in revenues across Cognizant its competitors in order for attrition to come down? But I'm just wondering, what are some of the industry forces that might help alleviate some of this pressure? And then Brian, I will just go ahead and ask my second question since they're related. As you're facing such unprecedented attrition, how do you think about the trade-offs that you need to make related to gross versus margins, as you look out over the next couple of quarters, or even the next year? Brian Humphries : Hey, Keith. Let me start with the second question, given it's fresh in mind. Look we've already started making some of those trade-offs, some growth versus margins. I think the reality is, I'm delighted with our team and our recruitment engine was really executing extremely well in the last few quarters and we'll continue to execute well going forward and hence, we've had a headcount increase sequentially of 17,000 by the way, which excludes subcontractors, which also grew.  But the reality is we don't have enough headcount to fulfill our potential. And therefore we've been faced with choice points, which clients to serve, which deals to chase, where we walk away, where we're willing to make pricing stances that may put a deal at risk, but it's the appropriate thing to do given to the demand, supply and balance.  So that is already underway, Keith. I will say in the same vein, we're really delighted with the commercial momentum, we have bookings growth of 24% in the quarter, which brings year-to-date up to mid-teens -- on the back of mid-teens bookings growth last year, tells me that we have actually really turned a corner in terms of commercial momentum. So those trade-offs are underway.  I'd like nothing more to accelerate hiring from current levels so that we can really fulfill against our true potential, but it is  time despite all the net ads and they were record levels in the quarter, we have enough attrition as does the rest of the industry to mitigate that. With regards to the first question around the industry forces that will alleviate attrition. Look, it's a very difficult question to answer it. The reality is, I don't see immediate line-of-sight to this. I foresee elevated attrition in the industry in the coming quarters. I think the only winner in times like this is actual individual employee because companies like us don't win from this, clients don't win from this. And as such, hopefully, this will right itself over time.  And hence, our focus both much on a compensation were extreme. We stood up a war room from a retention point of view, about 9 months ago at this stage, and we spent an extraordinary amount of time on the hearts and minds angle. And I personally now spend 1 hour per day with 5 -- groups of 5 or 6 employees that are deep into the organization to make sure we're hearing demand, understanding what's on your mind, validating that they understand what we're up to.  I will say I like the fact that we're back to double-digit growth more sustainably, because that helps us get a little bit more swagger back in Cognizant. And, obviously, it demonstrates ability for us to benefit our clients as much of our clients are employees, and talk about the fact that they will have career advancement opportunities and we will have gross margin opportunities to invest in their careers and training and development, et cetera.  So time will tell what's going to happen overtime, but we've really -- we're doing what we can do. And core to that is also via, let's say, the re-invigoration of our fresher program, which had stalled, but I think at this stage we're starting to get our pyramid back into the right shape after a few years of being off kilter. Keith Bachman : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. You may proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : Okay. Great. Thank you. Brian, when you started your turnaround effort, you made international revenues a big priority, which had been actually something Cognizant had somewhat struggled with over the years. Your international growth is outperforming in these latest results.  So I wanted to see if you could speak to the levers that you're pulling to help with the international revenue progress. And I love to get your sense of whether you're sort of sustainably on a path to increase the international revenue mix at this point going forward. Brian Humphries : It's a great question, Rod, because we're very often spend a lot of time on one of our other strategic postures, which is around accelerating our digital footprint, which isn't relevant, just on a total corporation level, but also internationally. So scaling our international capabilities is something I'm 100% focused on. Today is just 26% of our revenue. And so if you think about our footprint internationally, our brand internationally, and our operations, they are in need of scaling. And it's not just revenue scaling, but it's also our delivery capabilities overseas, both in terms of near-shore and onshore, that will enable our shift to digital, but also, I would say its very core to our desire to build a global delivery network where we can provide greater business continuity capabilities for clients as well.  We're executing well against those initiatives, we've hired largely refreshed a lot of the international leadership team. Very senior hires in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Japan, the Nordics; the people we've targeted are well-connected into local industry, they understand the local markets.  And I would say the impact of that is now becoming more and more evident, not just in strong revenue growth in the third quarter, but also in year-to-date this year, across Australia, U.K., Germany in particular. But also as I think about the bookings momentum we have internationally, the year-to-date in Q3 bookings on our international businesses is well above the Company average. Now those people are bringing followership both from a client point-of-view, as well as from an employee point-of-view, our ability to attract talent is relevant there, but they also give me confidence that I'm investing M&A dollars behind senior leaders, who will take post-merger integration activities seriously.  And as you've seen in the last -- earlier part of this year, we acquired Serbian in Australia, New Zealand, and ESG mobility in Germany. So it goes back to having confidence in the team and having a team who take their responsibility seriously, and a team that's fundamentally connected into partnership ecosystem as well as the client network.  While we are different internationally, but Rod, I expect we will continue to double down in that arena too. In the notion of industry alignment, we're very strong from an industry perspective in North America. Healthcare is obviously a great example of that in the payer provider space.  But as we scale into Europe and Asia, our largest countries, the UK where we are aligned by industry. But actually some of the country leaders that we've hired now are embracing more of an industry alignment in those countries as well, perhaps not across all industries in every country. But there are major industries that we are aligning behind.  And I think that is the way to go to get after these market opportunities internationally. So not just my expecting, Rod, to maintain this level of growth, my hope is to accelerate our growth internationally in the years ahead. And we'll certainly talk more about that on November 18th at the Investor Summit. Rod Bourgeois : Very helpful. Hey, I want to ask across the pipeline, particularly about large deals. And I guess I'm wondering, are you significantly pursuing extra-large deals in your sales pipeline, or are you focusing more on mid-sized and smaller deals?  And I'm really asking to see if you are somewhat biased away from the mega deals given some times the risks that they entail, and given that there's a lot of other deals out there right now, given the breadth of demand that exists? Brian Humphries : Look, I've made no qualms about the fact that my priority was to expose Cognizant to higher-growth categories, notably digital and international markets. So if I focus on digital, the nature of the work we do ends up positioning us against smaller contract .  And from my perspective, I agree with the inference in your question, this is a resource constrained environment and putting valuable resources against digital is much more interesting for me than putting them against captive or structured deals where you may have an  compare for one year or two, but thereafter you're in a book of business that you have to work very hard to grow.  I will say, when I think about our booking, our win rates on our pipelines, I have nothing but good thoughts. Bookings were balanced by industry, by geography. If I think about even within the digital work we are doing, we have actually seen a little more momentum in the 50 million plus category on a year-over-year basis, and I expect that to continue into fourth quarter as well. And that's different from $500 million or $1 billion deals, but these are very healthy digital type deals for us. And all of this has led us to be in a position now with bookings  24% year-over-year in Q3 to have a book-to-bill ratio that has now solidly in the 1.2 range. So I feel good about that, I will say the CEO, the enemy is when you have clients that are indecisive, and that is not the case at this moment in time.  Pipeline velocity is strong, it's fast. That's why I feel very good about our position. I think the strategic choices we made a number of years ago were the right choices we're executing against that. I think will bear the fruit of that labor in the coming years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks a lot, guys. Good stuff here. Brian, I can really break from talking and ask Jan a one-year in kind of question, you've been in your seat as CFO now, at Cognizant for a little over a year. Can you just give a quick look back from the CFO seat, what you feel like has been going well in the last year and then what your personal priorities are for the CFO organization going forward? Thanks. Jan Siegmund : That's an unexpected question. Actually the -- Lisa, obviously, Lisa Ellis : Well I can go back to asking about attrition if you'd like. Jan Siegmund : No, I actually I do appreciate, I do appreciate the question. The translation of our 4 strategic priorities into operational measures and controlled processes is obviously a big endeavor for a multinational organization like Cognizant, and the finance organization was really laser-focused in supporting those four strategic priorities that Brian has been talking about.  I'll give you example from when you scale and expand your sales force and distribution capabilities, more effective measures on the effectiveness and results of that sales force are required, and I think you have seen this with improving disclosure and our bookings club. So you just see the surface of the effort behind that to drive -- improve transparency not only for us, but also for the street. Similar initiatives have been underway for supporting our pricing and analytics capability relative to driving relevance to clients and ensuring that we deliver value to our clients, etc. Throughout the fourth, I wanted  trough all -- explain through all four initiatives, so what we're doing.  But that has been really the primary focus of the work and I have to say, I'm pleased because in the outcome, you have kind of experienced Cognizant as an organization that has made good in the last couple of quarters on our promises.  And that's how I measure ourselves really in the end, can we fulfill the financial commitments that we make to our shareholders And in terms of fulfilling our expectations, that has worked out with a lot of work pretty well, I think, particularly in the last half year where we have faced that really -- that changed industry with high attrition rates.  I remain personally excited about that opportunity. It's a Company that is changing, that is winning in the marketplace and you can feel that the energy is visibly accelerating over time. And that's part to -- it's fun to be part of that team. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then my follow-up is on the technology partnerships side. I think Brian; you've mentioned the Hyperscalers as a priority a number of times. Can you just give us sense for some of the other priority areas that you guys are focused on in terms of building technology partnerships? Jan Siegmund : Yeah. Lisa, look. Some of the hyperscalers are obviously omnipresent, extremely powerful, and the platform scales into various different technologies. Cloud migration immediately gets you into data modernization, AI, machine learning, IoT, etc.  But then beyond that, we have some of the traditional partners we've had for years, some of which were stronger than others, the Oracle, DSA P, ISVs of the world, but we've certainly been a huge focus as well on what I would call next-generation leaders, companies like ServiceNow, companies like Salesforce, Workday. As a reminder, in the last year-and-a-half, we acquired collaborative solutions to scale a Workday practice.  We've also done 3 acquisitions in Salesforce. We have meaningfully changed our position with Salesforce. I was in a recent  with the Salesforce leadership team and they were singing our phrases in terms of how our position in Salesforce has exponentially grown. And then we will continue to do acquisitions in those areas as well that are aligned to our higher-growth categories. Voltus set up 3 business groups behind the hyperscalers, though it's not lip service, it is true organization, we take it very seriously. I actually see the hyperscalers now focusing more and more towards industry alignment, and Cognizant, since it's our strength, particularly in healthcare and financial services, is naturally of interest to those.  Now, there are individual cases where you have industry-specific plays. It could be Pega Guidewire, Temenos, Duck Creek, etc. Naturally, they are relevant to individual industries within Cognizant, but on a more horizontal nature, is to companies I've referenced. And then of course in our operations business, which I'm very proud of, we've done a fantastic job over the last two years as we exited content moderation.  And frankly got the business back to meet the high-teams growth. And they have very strong partnerships across some of the high PA players in particular. Automation anywhere  in present etc. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. You may proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. On Margin, can you give us a sense of the magnitude associated with some of the larger strategic investments that you've had a step up in 2021? And specifically, I'm referring to things like the incremental recruiting of the structure, increased S&M campaigns, the M&A dilution pressure because trying to frame the level of catch-up investment in the business this year that may not require such an uptick as we think forward. Brian Humphries : I want to be careful in giving you too much detail that it was going to be hard to interpret over time. But off the margin pressure that we have seen to the growth in the SG&A approximately 50% or so, is due to M&A activity. This could be upfront deal costs, this could be deal-related expenses, and the higher SG &A load that some of the M&A transactions carry with them.  So that has been a meaningful pressure for us, let's say maybe in the range of a 100 -- around 100 basis points or so. And then the rest of the pressure that we have seen is kind of split evenly between three major areas, I would say. Area number one is our IT modernization. That's clear it's starting to stabilize and that has put pressure on it. We had investments into our HR and recruiting organization in order to scale our hiring activity. And thirdly, our investments into our sales force and marketing capabilities. Those would be roughly in even , I think it's a fair amount to say, and some of those are now starting to , that's kind of what we are starting to anticipate and plateau. We do not want to reduce those expenses obviously because they are important to us; but we have found, I think levels that are allowing us to have a more moderated SG&A development going forward. You will see more detail around that, obviously in our November meeting. But the third quarter is a little bit of an indication on what's happening here basically. Because we had still growth in these strategic investment areas, but we have started to curtail that growth in more traditional SG&A areas to offset that. And you can see that the  has started to bend a little bit, more work to be done. But it really developed as I would have expected in the third quarter. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Thank you for that. That's good detail. And then just follow-up on the better non-digital business performance. Can you just dig in on what you're seeing as a reason for that, and is it sustainable? Jan Siegmund : Bryan, there are multiple elements at play there. One of the bigger ones from a weighted impact is actually our business operation -- digital business operations business, which has been growing into strong teams within that we have elements that we classify as digital and are in our digital mix and there are elements that we don't classify digital. We have tended to be quite disciplined. We changed the definition of digital over two years ago at this stage and we've maintained that ever since. But there are other areas including a non-digital element of our AI and analytics portfolio. Again, we're being disciplined. They're elements that we view as digital, and elements that we view as more traditional business intelligence, etc. And then on top of that, we have elements within some of our enterprise applications business, and CIS business that have grown as well. Our goal, to be very honest, in a multiyear basis, is to mitigate the risk of declines in the non-digital business and hopefully maintain some growth in the non-digital business.  If we manage to do that, which requires us to be very disciplined from a pricing, from a renewal point-of-view; that will frankly complement what we expect to be very strong growth in digital, and therefore its goodness for the entire corporation. But at this moment in time, that is something that I think you've seen in competitive earnings as well. If you extrapolate the digital growth they have versus the total Company growth, particularly for those who suggest have a very large portion of their revenue that is digital, you will be able to truly extrapolate that they are seeing declines in their legacy businesses. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. James Faucette : That's great, and thanks for all the detail today. And certainly pleased to see the control on margins, etc., in spite of a very odd environment. So I'm wondering on the control around SG&A. And I know you've kind of addressed this but, I'm wondering, is there a point at which, you know, trying to control for those margins, etc., starts to cut into the proverbial muscle?  And I think, Jan, you mentioned a few areas where you've shown improvement, but are you all the way where you want to be in areas like recruiting, etc., so that you really can continue to march forward even if you're controlling a little bit more judiciously expenses? Jan Siegmund : Look, I think Brian explained it earlier in the call and we iterate it. We keenly focus on accelerating our growth rate. So we see momentum organically as we see -- we want to continue with our capital allocation program as we have announced it. So the acceleration of revenue growth is front and center in our view. We have ample of opportunity. And as such, we have made decisions to; of course, support the opportunities that we promised to our clients with staffing.  So HR will be funded as needed and we're actually very proud about the amount of scaling that we achieved and the amount of change in policy of accelerating the hiring of fresher\u2019s, optimizing our permit, scaling training programs; at our size it's a really important and complicated effort that that team executed well, and I will of course, or the Company will provide the funding for that as it's part of our growth engine. But there are other elements that need themselves more natural to scale in certain IT components, certain marketing components, certain finance and classic support functions in the SG&A to  themselves for scaling. And we're going to continue to fund obviously, our sales force in the distribution area, I'm actually pretty pleased we have a good combination of growth and resources, but also of improvement in productivity in those sales forces.  And we have been busy at work to optimize our go-to market strategies, and I think we have more opportunities in that space, but also we will be funding organic growth appropriately to capture those opportunities. So I'm not too religious here relative to what the exact percentage growth of SG&A is, but you get the philosophy enough in my answer. James Faucette : Yeah, I know, for sure. And then as we're trying to model things out, and I realize it's a super dynamic world, but how are you planning for things like timing and impact of return of T&E, what that will look like? I'm just trying to make sure that at least we understand what your planning assumptions may be, like, going into the next couple of quarters. Jan Siegmund : Yeah. I'd be excited about talking about the next year in the next quarter and -- but -- and I'm not expecting any meaningful increase in my travel expense for this quarter, but to be a little bit more forthcoming. Obviously, the decisions of the return to work are going to be affected by really a myriad of factors : our client\u2019s need, our associate\u2019s preferences, the health situation by country, and it is really dynamic.  So we're evaluating this basically on a monthly basis and at the current point, we are still, as all competitors are, largely in a virtual environment which has worked actually pretty well for us. So we are planning to think about that as a strategic opportunity that meets the needs of all those stakeholders going forward.  And I have to say that is an -- it's a work in progress, that we really evaluating and there will be a gradual decision to the new business model that will be different than the historic business model. James Faucette : Thanks for those comments, Jan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. You may proceed with your question. Moshe Katri : Hey, thanks for asking -- for letting me ask a question here. And congrats on very strong key numbers. Two questions. One, Digital was up 18%, I think you said. It's still kind of trailing some of the pure-play digital mains. Brian, what do you need to do to get to those growth levels of some of your peers? And then on the attrition side, are we at a point where we're feeling comfortable that the employees that we're losing are not at the senior level because we just had some -- in the past, as you know, you've had some high-caliber kind of departures from the Company? Thanks a lot. Brian Humphries : Listen, I think we've got a great senior leadership team these days. Most of the senior changes are , as I would view as to be very much in business as usual these days, retirements, internal promotions, some performance orientation, but this is kind of classic Fortune 200 Company land at this stage. I got to say, I'm delighted with the Leadership team we have around us these days.  We're getting back into a growth trajectory after a few years where our backlog and our pipeline haven\u2019t been -- on bookings hasn't been as strong as it needed to be. And I think you've seen united leadership team here orienting the Company towards a evolve business model, both geographically as well as the offerings that we ultimately solutions and deliver.  So that's not a concern to mind anymore. And of course, we'll always be press article at the individuals with a Company with 320,000 employees. Please don't get distracted by that on not. And with regards to digital, of course, it all depends on the portion of the portfolio you would look at, our digital growth with 18% within our portfolio. If I look at our digital engineering business, our growth rate is equivalent to the pure plays that are announcing their results. If I look at our IoT business, the digital growth is as fast as the pure plays out there, same for our cloud business or digital experience business. So as I said, we tried to be extremely disciplined in the definition of digital, and in many ways we penalized ourselves.  But as a broader Company within the categories we look at, and I'll talk a little bit of this in the November 18th Investor Summit, we have some gems in our portfolio that are growing at significant rates, and ultimately that will continue to drive the growth rate of the Company forward.  A little bit that the mix shift this last few quarters, that has been hanging around in the mid-40s is somewhat reflective of numerator -denominator, where the non-digital business has actually had some better growth than anticipated. Moshe Katri : Thanks, good job. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. You may proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hey, Brian. Hi, Jan. I just wanted to get a little bit deeper into, sort of, the Digital business. You've mentioned, for example, that you're doing very well with digital engineering, digital experience. Speaking with some of your competitors, they often bring up more so application modernization as an area.  So from your perspective in the areas that you are not quite growing as fast in the digital arena, is that choice? Or is that the modernization deals you just necessarily have to go after large carve-out type stuff and that's not what you want? I mean, could you talk a little bit about the strategy versus availability of talent versus where you are? Brian Humphries : Well, I just think, again, it goes back to the definitions that companies have for digital. We've been quite intentional on being restrictive on what is digital, including our digital businesses, our TriZetto platform business, which is growing at a very healthy double-digit pace these days, significantly up from prior years. But it's not growing at the rate of maybe a digital engineering Company pure-play because it's not at all the same business or business models.  So it's important to recognize that everybody's definition of digital and what is within that differs. I would say I'm very pleased with our momentum in digital, we can always do better. We strive to do better. But our exposure to Digital exposes us to higher growth categories as a corporation, ultimately, higher margin categories as a corporation. It puts us up against a different set of competitors where we have pricing dynamics that will be favorable for Cognizant's pricing.  And ultimately most importantly for me, it makes us much more relevant to clients because we are becoming much more intimate with them as we become part of their transformation journey.  And as I go around and speak to clients around the world when we articulate our strategy and what we're doing, and start sharing some of the references we have,  clients are very open to proceeding with the next meeting to better understand what we have, today have optionality versus some of the incumbent. So I feel ultimately that we're in the right spaces. We will continue to double down, of course, there are certain industry where digital is a higher portion of our mix than others. And there are certain geographies where I want to accelerate our digital capabilities, not just back to Rod's question earlier, the international markets where our digital mix is lower than it needs to be, because historically we spent a lot more of our focus on structured deals in those geographies, but also the delivery capabilities both near shore and onshore to fulfill any demand that we create in our commercial teams internationally, we need to further extend our capabilities there.  And we're working on a number of things that hopefully we can announce in the foreseeable future that will hopefully give you confidence that we're doing the right thing in that regard as well. Jan Siegmund : Maybe I add numbers for illustration that could be helpful. As you know, of course, our digital revenue is exceeding our overall Company growth and we are gaining share in digital revenues. But for me, a good example of the value of strategic focuses. Also, our focus on the four digital battlegrounds that we have really identified; and those are the data monetization, the Cloud business, our IoT and digital engineering businesses, and those priority -- prioritized areas within digital actually also meaningfully outgrowing our overall digital revenue growth.  So I think for a Company to establish that focus and then executing in those focus areas in a thoughtful way is a good sign, and as ample opportunities to expand those things for the long run, but at least we're seeing in our numbers really, the results of exactly what we wanted that strategy to be. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Very good to know, maybe a little bit of a symmetrical end to the call. Attrition question. Any details you could provide, I think in the past you have indicated for example the geographic lit was high in India, Eastern Europe is fine, any details by either level or vertical or geography that you could provide to kind of help understand attrition? Thank you. Jan Siegmund : Look, it's -- I would say if I think about where it is voluntary attrition is highest, the mid-junior levels of the permit primarily in India, it's not just in one location in India, it's broad-based, but also against certain skills, whether it's cloud. Here we're talking Hyperscalers are leading SaaS players like Salesforce, digital engineering, full-stack engineers, job at Dot Netangular or just across data, AI and ML technologies. We're seeing significant attrition in those areas. And it's just a hot labor market. It is extremely consistent, I think in the country you've seen from our peers in the industry. And as I said earlier, we're working very hard to mitigate that. We do expect attrition to fall, sequentially on a year-over-year basis from where it is in Q3, based on the net resignations we've seen, and based on what we're seeing following the efforts we've had around hearts and minds on compensation.  But at this moment in time, we're still anticipating elevated attrition in the coming years, and to the question that we received earlier, we're funding in our P&L, what it takes to mitigate that. Those compensation measures as well as our recruitment team have been doing an incredible job for us and frankly, we expect to meaningfully scale our headcount in the coming year. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks. Look forward to connecting with everyone on November 18th.

Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Throughout 2021, clients have meaningfully accelerated spend on digital transformation initiatives, accelerating the demand for IT services. Elevated attrition in key digital skills is however a direct consequence of this, creating revenue fulfillment challenges and cost pressure that need to be carefully navigated. I am therefore pleased that we had another quarter of solid execution, delivering against our commitments to clients and to you, our shareholders. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency, above the high end of our guidance. Growth was led by digital, which grew 20% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 15.3% and full year adjusted operating margin was 15.4% in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we also progressed against our key strategic initiatives, including scaling our digital capabilities, globalizing the company, helping our clients be successful by leading with greater industry insights and solutions and repositioning the Cognizant brand. Turning now to industry segments, our recovery in Financial Services continued with fourth quarter growth of 19% year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an approximate 9 percentage point benefit from the impact of the prior year charge related to Samlink. As you know, we have been rebuilding our strength in Financial Services by refreshing our leadership in client-facing teams, strengthening our partner engagement, shifting our portfolio of services to more attractive market segments, and sharpening our focus on priority industry solutions and clients. We expect to build further on this progress in 2022. As we reposition Cognizant as a digital transformation provider in larger banking clients, we have complemented this with sustained momentum in regional banks. KeyBank, where we have just renewed our engagement as their primary digital partner, is a great example of this. We will further enable their digital transformation by digitizing their products to increase their digitally active customers to approximately 85%, by driving remote self-service growth by more than 40%, by automating front-to-back processes, and by migrating more than half of their application portfolio to the cloud. In insurance, we see continued demand for core modernization and digital transformation, including cloud and analytics. Unum, a global leader in disability insurance and group benefits, is partnering with us to pursue their digital transformation focus on agent and customer experiences and associated analytics. These digital solutions enhance our existing application development and maintenance services relationship with Unum. And for a long-time client, Royal London, the UK\u2019s largest mutual life, pensions and investment firm, we are now extending our partnership to reimagine their customer engagement through personalized seamless connected customer journeys enabled by cloud, data and customer-centric principles. In healthcare, revenue grew 8.2% year-over-year in constant currency. We have substantially increased our competitiveness in healthcare by investing in digital solutions, domain expertise and partnerships, and by modernizing our core platforms. We have seen continuing momentum in our TriZetto product business, which grew 13% in 2021. We continue to add new footprints and in 2021, increased the number of overall members supported by our platforms to approximately 210 million. We see solid commercial momentum across our healthcare payer and provider business. For instance, Humana, a large national payer is modernizing and moving their legacy ecosystem to the cloud and has chosen Cognizant as a partner for agency, marketing and clinical transformation. These initiatives will help improve Humana\u2019s customer and employee satisfaction, reduce cost, and enhance the delivery of integrated personalized experiences to their members. We also have momentum with next-generation healthcare companies like Reliq Health Technologies, a rapidly growing global telemedicine firm, which turned to us to expand their care management capabilities. Reliq will leverage Cognizant care management services to support the deployment of their care platform across managed care organizations, hospital networks and health insurance providers. In life sciences, we partnered with AbbVie, a leading global biopharma company, to help advance their digital transformation in safety and risk management, which will improve patient care and outcomes. Through our digital health consulting services augmented by capabilities in human-centered design and digital product engineering, AbbVie can understand the needs of patients and care providers, design fit-for-purpose solutions that support the patient journey, and incorporate feedback for ongoing innovation. These improvements will help AbbVie better support patients and care providers across a broad range of therapeutic areas and products. Within products and resources, we continued to deliver excellent growth in client success across travel and hospitality and in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Drawing on our extensive experience helping automakers streamlined their operational tasks, Volvo Cars chose us to help harmonize their finance and accounting and procurement processes and implement intelligent process automation to support their digital transformation. This is a great example of our growing momentum in digital business operations, which significantly outpaced the BPO industry in 2021 and is set to continue to gain share. Top line growth has been fueled by momentum in intelligent process automation and strength in our digital-native client portfolio. Our work at Grundfos, a global leader in water technology and the world\u2019s largest pump manufacturer, perfectly illustrates our growing digital credentials. Grundfos initially selected Cognizant to establish an IoT-based intelligent platform to gather real-time pump data from the sensors and perform analytics to prevent, predict and respond to issues caused by leakages. Based on this success, we have since been selected to build a modern enterprise system based on SAP S/4HANA. Finally, in communications, media and technology, we saw continued strength in technology, in particular, where we have sustained strong double-digit growth over the past three quarters. Turning now to bookings, which grew 22% year-over-year in the fourth quarter our second consecutive quarter of 20% plus growth. Full year 2021 bookings growth was in the mid-teens. We entered 2022 with a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.2. Throughout the year, our bookings strength, which has been fueled by digital, has been broad-based across industries and geographies. Moving to the macro demand environment, industry demand remains robust and I expect it to continue throughout 2022. Clients are embracing digital operating models to become more efficient, agile, automated, scalable, innovative, and indeed, secure, whilst also responding to the expectations of their customers and employees for hyper personalized experiences. Continuing to scale our digital capabilities is at the heart of our company strategy. Digital represented 45% of our revenue mix in Q4. As we noted during our recent investor briefing, we believe digital can become 55% to 60% of revenue in the coming years. Reflecting our strength in digital credentials, during the fourth quarter, we were named an industry leader in 70 new industry analyst reports. They highlighted the company\u2019s client partnerships, scalability, digital capabilities and expertise as factors in recognizing our leadership. Accelerating digital is not only a driver of double-digit revenue growth and improved margins it also fosters greater client intimacy and higher levels of employee engagement as we partner on strategic transformation projects that leverage advanced skills. Moving on now to an industry phenomenon you are accustomed to hearing about, the unprecedented competition for talent, reflective of the industry-wide demand/supply imbalance in key digital skills. Fourth quarter voluntary attrition moderated a little to 31% on an annualized basis or 28% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, when we measure attrition, we count the entire company, including trainees and corporate across IT services and BPO. We have been working aggressively to mitigate attrition levels, whilst intensifying our efforts and focus on employee training, promotion cycles, professional development and total rewards. During 2021, we also facilitated more than 14,000 job moves across 40 countries, continue to revitalize our campus recruitment program in India, establish new compensation measures and a revised promotion cycle to retain employees and invested heavily in upskilling. In fact, our associates completed 23 million hours of learning and consumed 130,000 courses in 2021. Given that we compete on our knowledge and skills, we are proud to have won 42 awards for excellence in learning and development from the Brandon Hall Group, often considered the leading independent HCM research analyst firm. We more than offset elevated attrition levels in 2021 by accelerating our hiring allowing us to increase company headcount by 14%. I am pleased to say that in recent years we have made meaningful progress in correcting our delivery pyramid by significantly increasing the number of college graduate hires onboarded in India. In 2021, we added a record 33,000 college graduate hires in India, up from 17,000 in 2020. In 2022, we plan to add approximately 50,000 in India. Digital acquisitions have also brought incredible talent to Cognizant. During 2021, we completed 7 acquisitions that extend our digital leadership, the most recent being our fourth quarter acquisition of Devbridge. This software consultancy and product development firm expands our software product engineering capabilities and global delivery footprint by adding more than 600 engineers, designers and product managers in Lithuania, Poland, the UK and North America. This extension of our global delivery network complements recent announcements in the United Kingdom, Australia, and indeed, Canada. In closing, I am proud of our execution against our strategy in 2021. We have reestablished commercial momentum and have a healthy book-to-bill ratio. Our delivery teams executed against our commitments despite challenging labor market conditions. Our performance in our two largest industries, Financial Services and Healthcare, has strengthened. Growth in key international markets such as the UK has meaningfully accelerated. Our digital portfolio has been extended and has never been stronger and we have made significant progress in our people strategy, our internal digitization agenda, and indeed, our brand repositioning. For several quarters now, I have been holding our long open-ended virtual sessions with small groups of employees. What I have learned from these intimate sessions as well as from our large virtual townhall meetings is that employee pride in the company is building. Employees see not only how far we have come, but also a clear path to an exciting future. Our employees also recognize the consistent execution of our strategy, our commercial momentum and a commitment to our purpose, vision and values. This purpose has kept us focused on executing our ESG agenda despite distress of a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. Our ESG-focused commitment is evident in our Cognizant Combat COVID-19 initiative in India, in our intensified efforts to drive a culture of belonging throughout Cognizant, in our $250 million philanthropic initiative to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, along with health and well-being in communities around the world and in many other areas covered in our 2021 ESG report. In summary, our broad-based progress allows us to approach the new fiscal year with confidence in our ability to execute against the multiyear financial outlook we presented at our November investor briefing. So with that, I will turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. We finished the year with solid momentum, driven by digital projects and entered 2022 with bookings momentum and strong customer demand. For the full year, revenue was $18.5 billion, representing an increase of 11% or 10% at constant currency. This includes 320 basis points contribution from our acquisitions. The charge in Q4 2020 related to the proposed exit from the customer engagement of our Samlink subsidiary contributed 70 basis points of growth. I will refer to this as the Samlink impact for the remainder of my remarks. For the full year, digital revenue grew over 19% and represented approximately 44% of total revenue. Q4 revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year or 14.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes 280 basis points of the Samlink impact and also 280 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. In Q4, digital revenue grew over 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 45% of total revenue. As Brian mentioned, we were pleased with our bookings performance in the quarter and for the full year. In Q4, we have begun providing trailing 12-month bookings, which can be found in the supplemental presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. We took the opportunity to enhance our bookings definition, modifying it to exclude overlap from early renewals and to include bookings from unintegrated acquired entities. As of Q4 2021, trailing 12-month bookings based on our revised definition, were $23.1 billion, representing a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2. Moving on to segment results for the fourth quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 19%, which includes a positive 900 basis points of Samlink impact. During the quarter, we saw positive trends in our North American banking business, where revenue grew high single-digits and internationally within insurance. Across banking and insurance, we are continuing to invest into our talent and digital capabilities, while focusing on broadening our client base and driving improved profitable growth. In 2022, we expect our recovery to continue. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 8%, driven by double-digit organic growth in life sciences. Our healthcare payer and provider business grew in the mid single-digits, driven by our integrated software solutions. As we discussed during our investor briefing in November, we see a large and growing market opportunity in the healthcare space and our capabilities across healthcare payer, provider and life sciences provide us a unique industry perspective and client intimacy that we believe provides ample opportunity to support sustainable growth in the years ahead. Products and resources revenue momentum continued, with revenue increasing 18%, the third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. Revenue was again driven by strong performance in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, which grew double-digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue in 2021. Retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality also grew double digits year-over-year, with quarterly revenue now back above pre-pandemic levels. Revenue growth also included 550 basis points from our recent acquisitions. Communications, media and technology revenue grew 13%, of which approximately 300 basis points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was again led by our technology business, where our work with digital-native clients has continued to drive growth in our core portfolio. From a geographic perspective, in Q4, North American revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by banking, life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and technology. Growth in North America also included the benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments. Revenue outside of North America grew approximately 33% year-over-year in constant currency, including 13 points of Samlink impact. Growth was led by the UK, where we saw strong double-digit growth within financial services, products and resources, and communications, media and technology segments. We also continued to experience strong growth in Australia and Germany, driven in part by our acquisitions of Servian and ESG Mobility, respectively. Now, moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15.3% as there were no non-GAAP charges in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved by approximately 300 basis points, driven primarily by the Samlink charge in the prior year period. As we discussed last quarter, merit increases for the majority of employees were effective October 1, which negatively impacted margin in the quarter. Supply chain constraints and our elevated attrition has kept subcontractor, recruiting and other delivery costs elevated, while our recently completed acquisitions have also negatively impacted our margin. While we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth, we have also moderated non-strategic spend, which has helped partially offset the labor cost pressure. Our GAAP and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22%, below the low end of full year guidance range, benefiting from discrete items which we do not expect to repeat in the future. Q4 diluted GAAP and adjusted EPS were both $1.10. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow in Q4 was $760 million, representing approximately 130% of net income. This resulted in a full year free cash flow of $2.2 billion and represented a cash flow conversion of over 100% of net income, which was in line with our prior guidance. DSO of 69 days declined by 3 days sequentially and by 1 day year-over-year. DSO will remain a key lever to support strong free cash flow conversion over the medium-term. During the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares for $66 million under our share repurchase program and returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend and spent cash of $255 million on acquisitions. In 2021, we\u2019ve returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and spent approximately $1 billion on acquisitions. This was consistent with our capital deployment framework introduced in Q4 2020 and reiterated at our November investor briefing. In support of our capital deployment framework, today, we have also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, our third consecutive annual increase and fourth since we initiated the dividend in 2017. We also expect to return at least $500 million through share repurchases in 2022, subject to market conditions and other factors. Turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.84 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 9% to 10% or 10.2% to 11.2% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 120 basis point impact and an inorganic contribution of approximately 200 basis points. For the full year, we expect revenue growth to be towards the high end of our medium-term financial framework, which is consistent with our expectations at the November 2021 investor briefing. We expect full year revenue of $20 billion to $20.5 billion, representing 7.8% to 8 point \u2013 I apologize, representing 7.8% to 10.8% growth or 8.5% to 11.5% in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a negative 70 basis points impact and includes 200 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. This inorganic assumption includes approximately 100 basis points from future acquisitions. Full year guidance also includes the negative impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary, which was completed on February 1. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Consistent with our outlook at the November 2021 investor briefing, we expect 2022 to be towards the lower end of our medium-term financial framework. For 2022, our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 15.6% to 15.7% assumes approximately 25 basis points of expansion at the midpoint from 2021. While we are not providing quarterly margin guidance, we expect typical seasonality in 2022, which includes stronger margin performance in Q2 and Q3 while Q1 and Q4 are expected to be below our full year guidance. In Q1, we expect some modest sequential pressure driven by compensation costs and seasonal factors. Our outlook for margin assumes the industry supply side constraints continue and that attrition remains elevated in 2022. In response, we will continue to invest into our talent, including through merit increases, promotions, career development opportunities and training. This will include hiring of approximately 50,000 recent college graduates, targeted lateral hires and the continued use of subcontractors. Similar to 2021, we will continue to moderate non-strategic SG&A spend to help offset some of this pressure in the near term. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.46 to $4.60. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million. Our outlook also assumes average share outstanding of approximately 522 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Finally, we expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Brian Essex : Hi, good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Maybe we start with Brian. No question, you seem well exposed to demand in this environment. But on the supply side, as we sit here, I guess, over a month into the first quarter, could you share a few thoughts on attrition and level of confidence you have that we may be on the right side of the peak in attrition trends at this point? And maybe share what initiatives seem to be resonating the most with employees? Brian Humphries : Hi, Brian. Yes, what I\u2019d add there is \u2013 we are in a robust demand environment. That\u2019s not a concern for me. I am expecting that to continue in the coming year and there is lots of mix trends that will support that statement undoubtedly, but we are circling in, my perspective an unprecedented competition for talent. We\u2019ve seen a slight moderation sequentially on an annualized basis. January has been in line with that. But to be very honest, it\u2019s too early to call this a trend for the year. There is natural seasonality one expects to see in the course of the year coming up to bonus periods, etcetera. So as Jan pointed out, we\u2019re expecting elevated attrition through the course of the year. And obviously, we\u2019re going to work very hard to try to mitigate that and try and minimize the impact on the business, the implications of attrition in our quarter across financial, commercial implications as well as employee implications. And the levers we\u2019re using against that is naturally to try and recruit as many people as we can. I\u2019m delighted we\u2019ve been able to recruit 40 \u2013 to add a net 41,000 headcount year-over-year, and compliments to our team because I think it is a core competency of Cognizant in this regard. But what we\u2019re doing in terms of employees, as Jan pointed out, as I did too in my script, a lot of efforts around hearts and minds. There is a lot of effort around compensation measures, which of course, is pretty critical. I think it\u2019s essential for us to continue to show up and post strong double-digit growth, which is helping get a degree of confidence and swagger and optimism back into the company and just continue to support our employees by celebrating success and giving them career path potential, which, of course, growth does. And on top of that, we\u2019ve revised the way we think about promotion cycles and other such things in the course of the year. So it\u2019s been a very hands-on engagement for me down through the entire leadership team. In the last 6, 9 months, we spotted this early. We\u2019ve added more recruiters, and we\u2019ve really put a lot of efforts in place to run a retention task force. But be that as it may, as you\u2019ve seen with many of our peers, attrition is elevated and we assume will stay elevated through the course of the year. Brian Essex : Great. That\u2019s super helpful, thank you for that. And maybe to follow-up with Jan, could you maybe frame out the scenarios where you might see upside to margins for the year? And is there any rule of thumb for appreciation of the dollar versus the rupee and how that might impact margins going forward as we track FX? Jan Siegmund : Yes. The \u2013 I don\u2019t want to up my guidance in my first question for the call, as you might imagine, so we have our work cut out to achieve the margin guidance that we give. We feel confident about it. But as you know, we talked about compensation measures, but other factors that are impacting our portfolio in a negative as they are positive factors. So I want to point out some of the drivers that obviously are helping us, the accelerated revenue itself is a help on margin so that helps. Our digital business continues to be slightly more profitable than our traditional business. So accelerated digital is built into our \u2013 solid digital growth is built into our plan. And we continue to make progress on our cost of delivery structure with bringing in college graduates, which will improve the overall cost structure over time. So we rely on a number of offsetting factors in order to achieve our guidance. And obviously, any over or underperformance could yield positive or negative outcomes. So I say balanced, we feel good about our 20 to 30-point outlook. Brian Essex : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks, guys. Good stuff here. I had a follow-up question on attrition, but this time more related to the senior levels of Cognizant. Can you give a sense for how your attrition levels are running in the top few levels of the organization and what steps you\u2019ve been taking to retain some of the key leaders that have been driving the transformation? Thanks. Brian Humphries : Hi, Lisa, it\u2019s Brian. So let me address that. To be very honest, I\u2019m not at all concerned about that. The majority of our attrition is at the junior levels and certain skills. And I would say at the senior levels of the organization at this moment in time, we\u2019re very much with our return business as usual. Promotions, some refreshing of talent, if deemed necessarily, based on financial results and other leadership attributes, what is essentially normal in a company of our size, some retirements, etcetera. So sometimes we intervene based on performance but this is more classic business as usual operations at this stage. We feel very good about the motivation of the team collectively. We\u2019re all in this together is certainly teams forward as we say internally, and I feel that that we\u2019re all on the same page. The leaders I brought in have certainly refreshed their teams, strengthened their teams. I will tell you right now, I feel I have better instrumentation in terms of how to run the company than at any time since I\u2019ve been here in terms of the analytical rigor that Jan and his team has put in place. The HR team have done some tremendous work in terms of where we stand there, etcetera. So we just feel or I certainly feel a lot more comfortable that we\u2019re on top of our game and we know how things are going, so not a concern. Lisa Ellis : Okay, good. And then a follow-up for you as well, Brian, just on the demand environment, can you just talk a little bit as you\u2019re engaging with clients going into 2022, what do you anticipate or you feel is sort of different about the demand environment looking forward as your clients are emerging from the pandemic and maybe trying to get a little bit back to business as usual? Brian Humphries : Yes. Look, I mean, I think to be very honest, clients are well passed, by now, the initial send hesitancy of COVID for a CEO or for anybody in a sales organization, certainly the enemy is indecision and we don\u2019t have indecision, far from it these days. People have really moved well beyond where we were approximately 2 years ago at this stage. And people are extremely focused, of course, on driving digital transformation agendas, evolving their business models, which is good for us because our portfolio is stronger than it\u2019s ever been before, and it allows us to work on a high-impact work for clients as are really driving some of the big innovation journeys that they have. Now of course, that leads to discussions around AI and analytics, consumer-centric, if you will, user experiences built on enterprise class applications, obviously, cybersecurity, digital engineering, cloud migrations. And throughout the world, as I deal with clients, it\u2019s always surprising to see how different clients are in terms of where they are on client migrations. I think the one thing that continues to go from strength to strength is, of course, the growing scale, hyperscaler cloud providers. They are, from my perspective, certainly shortening innovation cycles, throwing a lot of commercial muscle and financial muscle to accommodate or ensure accelerated cloud migrations. And of course, in more recent times, they really evolved towards industry clouds, not just the hyperscalers, but also the major SaaS vendors, which allow more integrated vertical workflows, and Cognizant strength, therefore, in areas like Healthcare and Financial Services is of interest to them. But it\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve seen before, Lisa, to be very honest, a huge push towards classic modernization initiatives towards data, analytics, cloud, digital engineering. And really, what I find, clients are certainly willing to spend for skills and innovation but certainly expect more efficiencies and a more traditional non-digital work. And we see that in our pricing dynamics, and I certainly see that in terms of client strategic intentions in the years ahead. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Darrin Peller : Thanks, guys. When looking at your outlook, your confidence level around your revenue growth, but obviously, coupled with margins in the right direction, a little more than we had initially modeled for the year ahead. I mean, it really does give us more conviction that the pricing power you have is able to offset wage inflation. So I\u2019d love to hear more color on that, if you don\u2019t mind, in terms of the environment you\u2019re in and whether or not you\u2019re able to really pass through whatever you need to on the price point side. And then maybe just as a follow-up to that, is there \u2013 are there other \u2013 have there been any like advances in decoupling the linearity on the business model at all in a greater way over the past quarter into this next couple of quarters? Brian Humphries : I\u2019ll start, Jan. By all means, jump in at any stage. So Darrin, first of all, pricing remains somewhat stable. And as I\u2019ve just mentioned to Lisa, based on her question, we see differences between the digital work and the non-digital side. Clients will pay up for skills and innovation and, frankly, availability for resources in digital. Of course, that happens to be in an industry where people tend to have MSAs and rate cards that have been agreed in advance. So it requires us to interrupt those rate cards, but certain clients see, in their own workforce as well as other vendors, a desire for companies like Cognizant to ultimately drive some pricing power, given the labor trends that we see. But of course, price increases can and have lagged talent-related cost increases. We put a lot of effort around pricing, both rate card, intelligence, big deal, pricing, and it is certainly one of the factors that\u2019s inherent in our guidance for the coming year. And as I\u2019ve said earlier as well, the fact that we have scaled our digital portfolio to approximately 45% of the business pits us into more strategic client projects, pits us against different competitors and then arguably provides us with a pricing opportunity as long as we get the gross margin right on digital skills versus the classic non-digital skills. The last thing I\u2019ll say just around pricing, of course, because it\u2019s inherent in your question, it\u2019s a margin question, and our margins can also naturally be helped by the type of work we sell solution and deliver. So we continue to focus on evolving the company towards selling and delivering client outcomes. That allows us to own more of our pyramid, to industrialize delivery, to better leverage automation and optimize our mix as well as our pyramid. Specific to your other question around decoupling of, I guess, the Holy Grail in a services company, to decouple revenue growth from headcount growth. Look, there are many factors at play there as well, including the shift to more offshore delivery. In the course of the last year, our offshore delivery has increased for us about 2 points year-over-year, about 1 point sequentially, and that can help margin, but of course, it can hurt you in terms of headcount growth versus revenue growth or the so-called average rate per employee, and it can also change dollar margins as well as dollar revenue per employee. So there are multiple things at play here. We are a services company. We\u2019re committed to being a services company. We will certainly try to optimize and industrialize delivery where we can, leveraging automation, templatization, AI, et cetera. But at the end of the day, we are in the headcount business. And as we scale our headcount, we will scale our revenue and you guys are more than familiar with that model. Jan Siegmund : Yes. Maybe, Brian, you covered it, I think, on the pricing thing, but a little bit of color on the margin expansion because we really have taken a balanced view about the sources of the margin expansion here. And pricing is a factor but it\u2019s not the dominating factor. We have other elements like the natural shift of the business towards higher margin business. We have a scaling of \u2013 you saw this in the fourth quarter. We slowed the growth of SG&A in a meaningful way, and it\u2019s now contributing to margin actually at a slower than revenue growth rate. We expect that to contribute next year as well. And we have \u2013 we hope to see impact from our initiative to refresh our delivery permit, and Brian talked about the success that we had of bringing college graduates on. He mentioned this that we\u2019re planning to onboard 50,000 college graduates this year and that will help to streamline our cost of delivery permit and is also \u2013 so there is a variety of factors that drive it. And so pricing is a factor but only one among many. Darrin Peller : Okay, alright. I mean, I have other questions, but just in interest of time, I\u2019ll let you guys turn back in the queue and thank you. Brian Humphries : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. You may proceed with your question. Keith Bachman : Hi, thank you. I had two, if I could. Brian, if you could talk a little bit about healthcare and the potential for growth during \u201822 and beyond. You mentioned TriZetto was 13%. But just what are some of the factors that would lead to healthcare continuing, if not, getting improving its growth rate to contributing presumably to Cognizant being able to break on a consolidated basis, the 10% kind of organic growth? And I think healthcare would be one of the key drivers. If you could just talk about a little bit about that and then I have a margin question ask after? Brian Humphries : Yes. Look, it\u2019s certainly our ambition to accelerate healthcare growth. In the November Analyst Meeting, we talked about market growth. But of course, within our healthcare business, we have the U.S. healthcare vertical, which is payer provider, the payer being the vast majority and then a product business, of course, coupled within that and then the less than 50% of our healthcare business is our life sciences business, which continues to grow double digits. I feel really great about that, both the nature of our capabilities, the nature of our client intimacy, the global nature of those clients and our bookings momentum in life sciences through the course of the year has been, frankly, outstanding and was very strong in Q4 as well. So candidly, as we are getting after the life sciences opportunity, it\u2019s all about continuing to scale biopharma. And then in this year, we have accelerated a little bit on medical device momentum there as well. We have also seen do some targeted acquisitions in the life sciences vertical in the last few years, including Zenith as well as TQS more recently. In the U.S. healthcare business, a lot of it is about getting the TriZetto business back on track. I think I mentioned in the November briefing, our growth rate in 2020 was twice that of 2019. And we have approximately doubled growth rate again in 2021 over 2020. And that\u2019s good in terms of client intimacy and relevance, in terms of margins and the pull-through opportunity or the stickiness of Cognizant in those accounts. So, getting payer and provider back into a higher growth trajectory, but making sure that the product-driven side of that scales as well is pretty essential to us. And then I have got to be honest, I am very motivated about where we are with TriZetto. I think it\u2019s a fantastic gem within the company. Now that we got growth back, we continue to explore possibilities in terms of where we can scale a healthcare franchise, both in terms of the market within the U.S., in terms of different applications within the ecosystem or different control points as well as exploring how we can scale our healthcare business into Canada and indeed into select international markets. I think if we do all of that right, we will drive market growth, if not more than market growth, and that\u2019s what the team is focused on. Keith Bachman : Okay. Perfect. Now Jan, for you. Thank you, Brian. On the free cash flow margins, I think you said for \u201822, you want to do kind of 1x net income. If I just do some back-of-the-envelope, that would suggest that the free cash flow margin, which is free cash flow divided by the revenue, will be down again this year, I think perhaps not meaningfully. But are there other forces at work you think, in free cash flow in \u201822 that we should be aware of that might either positively or negatively impact whether working capital, taxes, CapEx, anything else you want to call out for our free cash flow models? Jan Siegmund : The \u2013 no, I can give you a little bit the background of our thinking around the free cash flow conversion, which I think I mentioned in my script to be around 100%. We did a little bit better this year, had a very good quarter in free. I think with all these, now let\u2019s say it\u2019s basically maybe a slight increase in capital expenditures in the next year that we could see that is related to some more strategic investments internally. But nothing major. We continue to be laser focused on our sources of cash from our clients. So, we made good progress on DSO this year and that focus will remain. And to be quite honest, I am drawing a blank on cash. I think cash is going to be \u2013 on taxes. I think tax is going to be fairly similar to this year, so no major variation on the tax side. So, that\u2019s kind of how I expect the cash flow situation to evolve for us. So, nothing specific comes to mind, maybe a slight increase on capital expenditures that could drive it. Keith Bachman : Okay. Alright. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi. Great. Thanks. Hope you can hear me guys? I think I wanted to ask on financial services, safe to say that some of the money center bank headwinds that we have been seeing \u2013 you have been seeing are far behind the company. I know there is a lot of pressure to spend in general amongst the banking side. But just curious how you are feeling there, both from a competitive standpoint and from a cyclical standpoint? Brian Humphries : Look, from my perspective, we have been working on recovering in financial services for quite a time. There has been a pace of recovery candidly through the course of the year, but the 10% constant currency growth, if I exclude the 9 points benefit we got from the year-over-year compare from the accounting charge in Q4 last year\u2019s results is probably the highest level of constant currency growth we have had in quite a few years. And this has ultimately been on the back of a series of things we have been doing, sharpening our focus on our top clients, refreshing some of the commercial team as well as, by the way, some of the leadership team, both in delivery as well as in the business. And back to a question I had earlier, that\u2019s part and parcel of running a world-class company. Sometimes, you have to refresh leaders if you are not getting the results you want. We have added a lot of talent with a focus on executive engagement at a client-facing level while the collaboration with the hyperscalers committed to their industry cloud or financial cloud and of course, a partner ecosystem. And all of that has now started to bear fruit. I am cautiously optimistic around our growing competitiveness there. We are leading more with digital. We are leading more with what I would call less interviews or staff augmentation type work. We are getting better margins for that. And I think our competitiveness will continue to increase in the course of the year. Of course, with the decision that we took last year, which was closed ultimately yesterday, I believe around the Samlink sale, we have a compare sequentially and year-over-year in the first quarter and beyond, which we will have an anomaly that we can talk to in subsequent calls. But generally, I feel that the team have done great work. We expect continued improvements in 2022, will be a paced recovery. I am not suggesting we are back to our full strength yet. But we are working both well across the regional banks, but I am also optimistic around the progress that the refreshed leadership team are making with some of the larger global banks. And if we are able to crack some of those, of course, that will show up in the numbers as well. So generally, I feel as though we are on the right track and team have worked hard and deserve growing momentum in the business. Tien- tsin Huang : Understood. Thank you for that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Rayna Kumar : Good evening Brian and Jan. Thanks for taking my question. So, you have now had two consecutive quarters of 20%-plus bookings growth. Could you talk about the sustainability of that as well as book-to-bill above one? Jan Siegmund : Yes. We had that 22% bookings growth, mid-teens for the full year, and it\u2019s driven, obviously, by the strong demand that we see in the market. It\u2019s supported by the investments that we made into our market organization with incremental sales capabilities and solution capabilities. And it\u2019s aided by a broadening solution set that we are developing ourselves as well as our M&A that is contributing to this. So, we are optimistic about maintaining a book-to-bill ratio that is similar to where we are as we saw our mindset, and we have seen really a very consistent execution, very consistent pipeline development. And the bookings momentum itself has been broad-based, has been good geographically split, and it has been, in general, of course, there are ups and downs by smaller business units, but it has been, when you lean back, fairly broad-based, which is all good news basically to assume that we are going to continue on that path. Rayna Kumar : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks guys. Nice results here. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on bookings to start, anything you can tell us about the mix of new work versus renewals in that $23 billion of trailing 12-month bookings? Jan Siegmund : Yes. We don\u2019t really disclose details of the bookings number. It is a mix but the mix has been stable, and it is really not contributing one way or the other to the overall composition of the bookings number stayed basically stable, but we are not disclosing components of it. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Just as a follow-up, I know you are including 100 basis points of inorganic revenue contribution in the 2022 guide for deals that you haven\u2019t yet announced. Can you just talk about the line of sight to executing on enough deals to drive that, I guess $185 million or so of revenue that you would need? Brian Humphries : Yes, we have a very capable development team and M&A team, of course, proven over the last 2 years to execute a steady stream of these strategic acquisitions, small and medium size in nature. And we continue to see great opportunities for us to align our strategic goals with that. So, we are bringing already, approximately, as you can see from our guidance in the first quarter, we are bringing already some momentum with the acquisition of Devbridge into the momentum. So yes, we feel confident about the 100 basis points to be executing within this year. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question. David Togut : Thank you very much. Looking at Slide 13, onsite employee utilization fell to the lowest level in 3 years, which is really the history of this chart, and it looks like offshore employee utilization fell to about a six quarter low. Can you just talk through the utilization dynamics? Clearly, they are tied to the attrition numbers. And what are your expectations for both offshore and on-site utilization in your 2022 guidance? Thank you. Jan Siegmund : Yes. You are right in the observation. There is some impact in the chart by our switch to a nine-hour bill week that has lowered our utilization, so that is in the last few quarters in there. But the overall dynamic is largely driven by the acceleration of on-boarding new associates that have some utilization lack in the beginning of their tenure. So, that was really the biggest driver of a downtick in utilization that we are seeing basically. And so we are kind of happy to have a little bit bigger bench to fulfill client needs. So for us, utilization levels are really at the desired level of where we want to see it. David Togut : Understood. Just as a quick follow-up, Brian, could you expand upon your comment that you are seeing more clients ask for price efficiency in the legacy work? What \u2013 how much price efficiency, if you will, are they looking for? And are you able to offset that through lower costs? Brian Humphries : Yes. Look, we have obviously embraced automation. We have taken out double-digit thousands of people from our fixed price contracts in the last few years, so we continue to automate our agenda. I will say, the other thing you have seen is our digital mix hasn\u2019t scaled as much as we assumed previously because we have been quite successful in the non-digital part of our portfolio, arguably more successful than others scaling that and mitigating the downside. So, it\u2019s a street combat every single time you are coming up for renewal. You want to be clever as well in some of the classic areas to make sure you try and up-sell to modernization or beyond and try to get a renewal plus an expansion. But I feel as though we have handled ourselves well in that regard and we have a lot of effort underway, as I said earlier, to try to continue to evolve the company to an area where we are better able to industrialize delivery, which will help ultimately our margins and indeed, the quality of our delivery. So, I feel pretty good about where we are in that regard. Our biggest focus naturally is to scale digital, while we protect the non-digital business and mitigate the downside. And for the guidance we gave in November, we assume that will grow low to mid-single digits. Our real focus as a company, and that\u2019s core to our strategy, is our momentum in digital, which is growing 20% plus or minus. David Togut : Thank you very much. Brian Humphries : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. You may proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Within the 2022 growth outlook, can you talk about some of your expectations across the industry segments this year? And anything to be mindful about around the cadence of growth as you built the plan? Jan Siegmund : Can you repeat that? You broke up in the beginning of your question. Bryan Bergin : Yes, sure. So, the expectations across the industry segments for growth this year within the context of the consolidated plan. And then just anything around cadence we should be aware of. Jan Siegmund : On the cadence of the growth, I think we have a typical revenue number we gave you, basically our outlook for the first quarter. It\u2019s nothing really that I have to specify more, I think, on the revenue quarterly cadence. Relative to the industry growth, I would just point out that we had a one-time impact from Samlink in the financial services sector. But we \u2013 despite that grow over one-time impact, we expect continued moderate growth in the financial services group, and all other groups should continue with the momentum. So, I think it\u2019s a fairest thing if you just build a momentum case for our four big industry groups to get a good forecast. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just the international opportunity, I know this has been a big focus for you, but investments to drive more traction there. Can you talk about your expectations for growth in markets outside of the U.S. in 2022? Which ones you are most excited about and some of the initiatives that you continue to drive? Brian Humphries : Yes. So look, this is something I am particularly passionate about. Cognizant\u2019s brand internationally certainly wasn\u2019t known as much as in key industries in North America and naturally in our offshore areas, so we put a coordinated effort in place to reposition the brand. We have refreshed a lot of our country leaders across Europe and the Middle East. And I think we are seeing the fruits of that labor right now. You saw a 28% growth in the UK this quarter. Our UK momentum has been building through the course of the year. It\u2019s nicely profitable for us as well in terms of relative profitability vis-\u00e0-vis other European countries. And we also have a lot of momentum in areas like Australia and New Zealand. So, the seniority and the capability of the team we have built allows us to have confidence to deploy M&A to support their growth ambitions as well. That\u2019s what we did in Australia and that\u2019s what we are doing in Germany. You have seen the ESG acquisition we did in the last year. So generally, I feel very optimistic about our potential there. It is a year where we had strong bookings. We have to just continue to build on that in the years ahead, but I am \u2013 ultimately, if we are here 3 years, 4 years from now, looking back, I would like to think this will have been a really big success story for us. Now it\u2019s not only about capturing the revenue opportunity, that revenue opportunity which will be fueled more with digital type work more than historical levels also requires more local and a global delivery network. And that\u2019s also an area where I am pleased to see the momentum we have had. We announced most recently the build-out in Canada and Nova Scotia. But in the last few months, we announced thousands of extra roles across Adelaide and Australia as well as the UK, in Northern England and Northern Ireland. So, we are doing what is needed in terms of partnership, talent, delivery capabilities to get after the market opportunity internationally. And the fruits is very visible in our second largest country in the UK, which grew 28% this quarter. Bryan Bergin : It sounds very good. Thank you. Tyler Scott : Hi Laura, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. James Faucette : Thank you very much. And I appreciate all the detail and color that you have provided. Back on the hiring side, how should we think about what you are feeling as the appropriate level of pace of hiring in the current environment? And I guess as part of that, I am looking for kind of number of net headcount additions, etcetera, going forward. And I guess maybe more importantly, how are you feeling about your capacity or infrastructure that you have in place to be able to address that or is that an area of potential investment? Brian Humphries : We have been investing behind our recruitment engine in the course of the last six months, nine months as we have spotted attrition to be a likely industry problem, we got out in front of perhaps others and we moved fast. And you have seen a net headcount expansion of 41,000 year-over-year since Q4 prior year period and another 12,000 sequentially. Of course, within a given year, subject to when we bring in our college graduates and onboard them, you will see different peaks country-by-country. But I am more than confident that we have an engine that is a core competency. The team has done an outstanding job for us. We have processes, tools, capabilities in place. Our brand standing is stronger increasingly not just in India, but overseas and some of the brand work we have done, both externally as well as our internal branding has given us more and more confidence that we have brand ambassadors in the company to make that happen. So, we are absolutely in the mode of accelerating headcount as best we can. The lower we can keep attrition, of course, is the most productive way to do that. And in the meantime, as Jan pointed out, we have done the heavy lifting. We have made significant progress around the delivery pyramid, this year, 33,000, up from 17,000 in the prior year period and next year, we are assuming 50,000. And if needed, we will try and scale beyond that. So for me, it\u2019s about retention and it\u2019s about recruitment and getting the balance right between those. But I am certainly bullish on the industry, bullish on our position within the industry, and I would like to have more headcount in Cognizant. So, if you know people, send them our way. Jan Siegmund : Regarding capacity, as you know, we are still operating in a largely virtual environment and depending on the development of the pandemic, we will make obviously, decisions in the future. But I think the working model I said we are going to settle in a hybrid model. So, relative to capacity in the sense of bricks-and-mortar, I think we feel very well equipped to handle the growth and that shouldn\u2019t be anything unusual. The reigniting of the non-virtual component will bring some cost pressures in it, but that is reflected in our margin guidance. James Faucette : That\u2019s great. Thanks Brian. Thanks Jan. Tyler Scott : Great. Thanks, James, and thank you, everyone for joining. We appreciate your interest in Cognizant and look forward to catching up next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Cognizant Technology Solutions Q4 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir, you may begin the presentation. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's first quarter 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. Speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks to our talented employees, we delivered on our first quarter commitments in what continues to be an intensely competitive global labor market. First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year in constant currency, above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance of 10.2% to 11.2% growth. Growth was led by digital, which grew 20% year-over-year and now represents 50% of our revenue. We had another exceptional quarter in digital business operations, which continues to meaningfully outgrow the BPO market reflecting momentum in intelligent process automation and digital native clients. First quarter operating margin was 15%, down slightly sequentially as expected, reflecting seasonality. First quarter bookings growth of 4% was in line with our expectations following exceptional bookings growth in the fourth quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have a robust book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1.2x revenue reflecting bookings of over $23 billion. Given a healthy pipeline, we anticipate bookings growth acceleration in the second quarter and for the full year. Over the last 3 months, I've met employees, partners and clients across 4 continents. While the global economic environment is uncertain, based on these interactions, I remain optimistic about IT services industry demand for the foreseeable future. Clients are making the shift to digital operating models to become more agile, automated and innovative. They know that it is the only way to deliver customer-centric user experience and hyper personalization, to simplify complex workflows and to build a modern operating infrastructure that's Our strategic repositioning enables us to engage more deeply with clients, helping them to succeed and supports our growth trajectory. Our capabilities are in strong demand as digital becomes mainstream. Ultimately, I believe that our scale in India, complemented by our growing global delivery network, will differentiate us as clients seek talent and business stability. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to be attrition, demand supply imbalances and inflationary pressure. I'd like to thank our teams across the globe for their leadership, patience and engagement as we navigate these challenges and execute against our client commitments. Today, more than ever, employees demand that we invest not just in total rewards, including compensation, but also in the end-to-end employee experience, their skilling and career advancement. Cognizant has always been known for our investment in our people. And in the last year, we built in this legacy with accelerated skilling and enhancements to our promotion framework. First quarter voluntary attrition fell 5 points to 26% on an annualized basis or 29% on a trailing 12-month basis. While we made sequential progress reducing voluntary attrition for the second consecutive quarter, we anticipate attrition will remain elevated for the full year and will increase in the second quarter, reflecting seasonality. To mitigate labor cost increases and the investments we are making in our people, we continue to execute against a series of measures including our automation agenda, pyramid and shoring optimization and a deep pricing. Turning to the industry segments. In Financial Services, our ongoing recovery continue with growth of 6% year-over-year in constant currency reflecting the sale of our Samlink subsidiary in February, continue to make progress repositioning the business towards higher growth and higher value services and solutions with a more focused client set. We expect to pace recovery in banking and insurance to continue with strong demand for digital transformation. One client whose digital transformation journey we've been supporting is ABN AMRO Clearing Bank. We are transforming the bank's IT landscape into a hybrid cloud platform with a focus on security and regulatory compliance. We'll be implementing an end-to-end secure, scalable and compliant infrastructure as a service model in support of the bank's IT modernization agenda. In health care, revenue grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency, with particularly strong growth in Life Sciences. Our investments to modernize the TriZetto product portfolio, which includes the integration of AI and machine learning capabilities continued to pay off. Our clients are responding to our commitment to deliver next-generation platform solutions that help them offer patients real-time insights and personalized care. We're keeping our products cutting edge, building new solutions across the value chain and capitalizing on the opportunity at the intersection of health and digital in areas such as virtual care and telehealth. During the first quarter, we announced our collaboration with Microsoft to deliver a new digital health solution designed to improve medical care. Leveraging Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, our new solution is the first of several planned offerings that combine remote patient monitoring and virtual health using products like smart watches, blood pressure monitors and glucose meters to collect and communicate patient health data to providers. Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a leading health insurer with more than 2 million members is a great example of how we're partnering with AWS to drive digital transformation. Wellmark aims to improve the experience of their stakeholders by accelerating cloud migration and data modernization, all while strengthening their information security. In Products and Resources, we continue to see excellent growth in client success across travel and hospitality and in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Automation is top of mind for clients like Pacific Gas and Electric, which sought our help to realize their vision for a new digital productivity center of excellence that aims to reduce manual efforts, simplify their automation tools and provide agile and scalable solutions for their business and IT users. To that end, our IPA team helped deploy Microsoft Power platform and simplified our tool sets with Cognizant Neuro, our recently announced intelligent automation fabric. PG&E is now well on its way to saving 1 million hours of work through low code, no code automation. Finally, in Communications, Media and Technology, we saw continued strength in technology, where we've sustained double-digit growth over the last 4 quarters. I'd like to briefly switch gears now to the future of work, a universal topic amongst the C-Suite with enduring societal implications. Organizations around the world are deliberating how to best attract, engage and retain employees. The events of the past few years have prompted people worldwide to question their life and work choices, including how and where they work. In the meantime, executive teams are determining how to best nurture company culture and values in the face of today's labor market realities and a hybrid work environment. These socioeconomic questions also intersect with business practicalities such as real estate strategy, one of the many things we are currently reviewing. One of the prominent business themes of our time is the relationship between purpose and work. Purpose encompasses all the values that drive people's choices, actions and attitudes from wider social and environmental goals to professional and personal objectives such as a healthy work-life balance. That's 1 reason we put so much time, thought and energy into developing and activating a compelling purpose, vision and set of values for our company, which express our commitment to making a positive impact on the environment and the wider society. We continue to advance our ESG agenda, applying our knowledge, portfolio and partnerships to engineer new levels of environmental and social benefits for our company, clients and communities. In April, we announced that we will source 100% renewable energy for all our global offices and facilities by the end of 2026. Sourcing 100% renewable energy supports our goal, and as last year, to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and responds to client expectations that business transition to a low-carbon economy. We also want our employees, clients, partners and other stakeholders to better understand today's Cognizant, which is why during the first quarter, we modernized and reintroduced our brand to mirror the company we've become, the services leader with world-class digital solutions and talent. Our brand now carries the tagline, Intuition Engineered. This is our promise to engineer clients' businesses so they can anticipate and meet their customers' needs with the insight and speed of intuition. As a global company, we will always stand with the right of people to choose a path of self-determination and democracy. Wave humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine, Cognizant contributed $1 million in grants to several organizations that are delivering food, water, shelter, health care and economic assistance. We joined the international community in hoping that a path to lasting peace can be found soon. In closing, I believe we\u2019re strategically well positioned to capture a large growing addressable market and drive profitable revenue growth. A month ago, I marked my third year anniversary leading Cognizant. While we are a company in transition, our evolution has been significant across multiple dimensions. We're putting the company on a strong growth trajectory, and I'm optimistic about Cognizant's prospects as we bolster our portfolio judiciously, to not only build and run clients' technology foundations but also transform their enterprises into modern businesses. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum within our digital portfolio. While overall uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, we continue to see a healthy demand environment across our portfolio of services and offerings. Q1 revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 9.7% year-over-year or 10.9% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 220 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions partially offset by a negative 40 basis point impact from the sale of Samlink completed February 1. In Q1, Digital revenue grew 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 50% of total revenue. During the quarter, we reviewed the scope of our digital ensure alignment across digital skills, growth priorities and our pricing initiatives. This is the first time we have reviewed our definition since we updated it in 2020. Under the new definition, Q4 '21 digital revenue would have been about 49% of total revenue, approximately 4 points higher than the 45% we previously reported. For this quarter only, we are also providing some additional information to highlight the change in our digital definition. Under our previous definition, digital would have grown 18% in Q1, and represented approximately 47% of revenue. As Brian mentioned, Q1 bookings grew 4% year-over-year, which resulted in trailing 12 months bookings of $23.4 billion, representing a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 unchanged from Q4. We believe this book-to-bill provides us a healthy opportunity to support our full year growth ambitions. Moving on to segment results for the first quarter where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 6%. Trends within this segment were consistent with last quarter as positive momentum within our North American banking business and improved performance in insurance were offset by softness in our global banking portfolio. Q1 growth also included a negative 130 basis point impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary. We remain focused on investing in our talent and digital capabilities aligned to our strategy. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 9%, primarily organic, driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies within our life sciences business, around digitization of clinical trial processes and modernization of manufacturing operations. Products and resources revenue increased approximately 15%, driven by double-digit growth across all subsectors within the segment. Segment growth also benefited from recently completed acquisitions, which contributed approximately 500 basis points to growth. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 20%, primarily organic reflecting growing demand for data services and our work with leading digital native clients, which has continued to support growth in our core portfolio. From a geographic perspective, in Q1, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Growth continued to be led by life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and communications and technology clients. Our global growth markets, which include all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 17% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was led by 20-plus percent growth in the UK, where we saw strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients, Products and Resources, and Communications, Media and Technology segments. We also continue to experience strong growth in Australia and Germany, driven in part by our recent acquisitions. Now moving on to margins. In Q1, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15% as there were no non-GAAP charges in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin declined by approximately 20 basis points. The largest headwind remains increased compensation costs, including the cost of subcontractors. Partially offsetting these headwinds were delivery efficiencies, slowing growth of SG&A and depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 23.3%, and the adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%, which benefited from discrete items, which we do not expect to repeat. Q1 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.07, and Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.08. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion and net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow in Q1 was $186 million, representing approximately 33% of net income. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our softest quarter for free cash flow, primarily due to the timing of bonus payments. DSO of 72 days increased by 3 days sequentially and by 2 days year-over-year. During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $444 million on our share repurchase program and returned $143 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Turning to guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 6.8% to 7.8% or 9.3% to 10.3% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 250 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. For the full year, we are increasing the organic growth outlook assumption in our guidance, reflecting strong performance in our digital portfolio and a healthy demand backdrop. However, we are tightening our constant currency outlook at both ends of the range, which reflects our improved organic revenue growth. This is partially offset by a lower expectation of inorganic growth, which we now expect to contribute approximately 100 basis points to full year growth versus 200 basis points previously. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative 180 basis points impact from currency versus 70 points previously, which equates to roughly $200 million headwind in reported revenues. This leads to a revised reported revenue guidance range of $19.8 billion to $20.2 billion representing 4.2% to 9.2% growth or 10% to 11% in constant currency. This compares to our previous guidance of $20 billion to $20.5 billion, which represented growth of 7.8% to 10.8% or 8.5% to 11.5% in constant currency. Our capital allocation framework is unchanged. While we did not complete any acquisitions in Q1, we remain active in pursuit of acquisitions aligned with our strategy. We will stay disciplined as we analyze the acquisition pipeline, and thoughtful, as we assess the best use of capital. For the full year, we expect to return at least $600 million through share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Our adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged and we continue to expect approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion versus 2021. Our outlook for operating margin continues to assume industry supply side constraints and elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. Headwinds to operating margin include increased compensation costs, T&E and return to office costs, which we expect to offset through delivery efficiencies, digital revenue mix, pricing and SG&A leverage and discipline. We currently expect to see some gradual improvement in our operating margin in Q2. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.45 to $4.55 compared to $4.46 to $4.60 previously, which primarily reflects the FX impact on our reported revenue outlook. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million and average share outstanding of approximately 522 million, both unchanged from our prior outlook. We also continue to expect a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Finally, we are still targeting full year cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income. However, there are several moving pieces that could cause us to fall below our goal. Key factors impacting our conversion rate include the timing of certain payments, cash taxes and higher CapEx. We remain focused on our working capital initiatives to offset these headwinds for the remainder of the year. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : . First question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just I want to ask on bookings up 4%. You said that was in line. I think the math -- I guess my simple math suggests that it's a pretty solid book-to-bill in the quarter 2 in addition to the trailing 12-month figure that you shared. Is that accurate? And maybe can you give us a little bit more on why you're confident in the acceleration to close the year in bookings? Brian Humphries : Tien-Tsin, it's Brian here. So look, all in all, we actually had an exceptional Q3, Q4 in bookings, if you remember, both quarters were up in excess of 20% year-over-year. And so some of that, there's natural behavior in a commercial team to pull in bookings in the latter part of the year to maximize their variable compensation. So the compares what the compare is. But I feel very good about where we are, a book-to-bill of 1.2, the book-to-bill in the quarter is fine too and generally good momentum behind digital bookings as well. So our pipeline plus the book-to-bill ratio, which is very healthy at this moment in time, give me confidence that we continue to do the right thing. On the contrary, we don't really have what I would view a demand issue as an industry that is faced with elevated attrition. The trick is always to optimize how much you want to sell, otherwise, you end up frustrating clients if you can't deliver against it. So it's more a demand supply and balance labor cost and attrition dilemma than a top line dilemma at this moment in time. Now in the same vein, I'll be the first to say that the economic backdrop is uncertain. And therefore, we continue to monitor, as you do on a daily and weekly basis the war in Europe, the inflation or the risk of stagflation, to broader economic sentiment, of course, and how this may impact not just us, but our clients and therefore, indirectly us. But at this moment in time, despite an uncertain backdrop, I'm certainly optimistic about the IT services demand picture for the foreseeable future and our role within that. Tien- Tsin Huang : Great. Yes. No, that's encouraging and fair. So I guess my quick follow-up just on the inorganic change in the outlook. Is that a function of maybe some deals falling out of the pipeline or just a timing issue with what you've seen year-to-date? Just anything else to add there, that would be great. Brian Humphries : I would say, Jan and I are quite judicious when it comes to M&A, quite disciplined, very intentional, and we tend to step out of certain deals. If they don't make economic sense, we're here to represent shareholders. Of course, we're custodians of the company. And in some cases, it's been us stepping out. In some cases, there are deals that we weren't able to get done or we weren't able to get the counterparty to engage. There's no fundamental change to our We continue to view that as a core element of our capital allocation framework, certainly a core element of us executing against our strategy. And where we do M&A, we'll be in tune with our digital aspirations, key vertical aspirations, geographic expansion and of course, our desire to be a little bit more advisory led. In certain deals, you hit multiple birds with the 1 stone. You can have an international deal that is aligned to a digital priority that is aligned to a key industry. And so it's more of the same going forward. It can be choppy. Sometimes you get more higher return average, but we feel pretty good about our strategy and how M&A will play a role within that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : So I just wanted to follow up here on an outlook. First, just to unpack the revised revenue outlook. So you took down the inorganic by 100 bps and the FX headwind was obviously a little bit more than 2x what it was before. So collectively about $385 million of headwind versus the prior view. So I just wanted to clarify that, that was really the big piece there with obviously a little bit better organic. And then just on the M&A, just going forward, is it more fair to assume, let's say, a range, 100 bps to 200 bps a year versus a specific target, just given potential lumpiness? Jan Siegmund : Yes. It's a good comment. I'll start to tackle the M&A stuff first. I think we should expect a little bit of bumpiness in M&A just by the nature of it. And so it's fair to say we haven't really changed our capital allocation framework. So I think the general guideline that is on Brian\u2019s and my mind is still a 2% thing. I think in this case, we had a couple of deals that fell out of the pipeline for the reasons that Brian described. And as we outlook, we see a little bit more activity in the third and fourth quarter happening. So we just felt it was prudent to let you know about that. There's no change. It's just like these are discrete items and in 1 or 2 deals can make a little bit of a difference. But no change for the medium-term outlook. I think we're sticking with our 2% revenue growth and 50% of our free cash flow allocation to M&A. On the guidance, I think you got it right. We basically took the inorganic down by 100 bps, and we increased the organic constant currency at the same rate. So we are sticking with our same organic -- constant currency revenue, not organic, but all in constant currency revenue was sticking at the same midpoint. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Okay. And then just on margin, has the margin progression gone as planned as it relates to maybe the timing of investments that you had budgeted for in 2022? Curious if just the wage inflation has shifted anything around for you? And maybe help us with the cadence of how we go forward from here on operating margin. Jan Siegmund : No, I appreciate that. You're familiar that our margin profile throughout the year has a typical curve with the second and third quarter being stronger, and we anticipate this year to have a typical curvature, so to speak, on margin. Clearly, you have seen an increased pressure on compensation costs. And so, we have built into our forecast, of course, offsetting measures relative to improvement in our cost to delivery efficiencies, investment into automation. We have -- of course, pricing is rolling out throughout the 4 quarters and will gain throughout the year. So all these things have to be coming together in order for us to achieve the 20 basis points to 30 basis points of margin expansion, which is our best outlook right now that we have. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush. Moshe Katri : I have 2. Can you maybe get some more color on subcontractor use? I think you indicated that was 1 of the factors impacting margins for the quarter, maybe kind of look at that versus percentage of revenues where has it been trending? And then on top of that, maybe some color on the weakness you mentioned in your banking portfolio. Is that the same kind of issue that we've had during the past few years? Or is that anything different? Jan Siegmund : You broke up in the second question, the weakness in... Moshe Katri : In your banking portfolio? And you indicated -- and the question is, whether this was the same weakness that we've been talking about for a couple of years now in BFSI. Jan Siegmund : Oh, BFS. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Yes. So we don't really break out our subcontractor cost explicitly for you. But the biggest impact on our operating margin by far is really a merit in off-cycle and then pair that with the subcontractor hiring. So it's just a bigger factor as you would expect, higher attrition leads to some of that use. But I don't think we're breaking it out publicly, but those were the major factors on BFS continues to be on a good path. We see steady expansion. I mentioned in my call that Samlink went out of the revenue that put a little bit of pressure in the European banking and financial services revenue growth. But overall, we see a steady improvement that shows that we are on the right path here. There's actually increased digital bookings. There are core projects, as Brian mentioned in his call that are driving up. So as we -- I think Brian used on this call, the continued and steady improvement for BFS is kind of where we are. We're not at the end of our work here, but we're feeling we are on solid ground. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Sure. I'll start with the inflation question. And specifically, I know you called out you're taking some pricing actions. Can you just elaborate a bit on what components of revenue will be affected? Is this mostly in your kind of materials business that you'll be able to affect through pricing? And then also a bit of a more strategic question on inflation, how is it affecting your clients' agendas or mix of work at this point? Jan Siegmund : Yes. We have clearly -- pricing is always part of our business model, and many of our clients obviously have regular price increases built into their contracts. But I think the extraordinary situation of wage inflation and cost pressure that also our clients' experience has, I think, opened more opportunities for us to drive pricing initiatives across the entire company. And I think we are deploying really a variety of approaches. Each client a little bit individualized to it. But once we're finding basically for many clients, receptivity. So it will be still hard. We are in the business of generating benefit and value for our clients. But the discussions from what I can see have been starting and have been constructive with our clients. So I'm expecting pricing to build momentum and help us to contribute to the margin expansion throughout the next 3 quarters. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then maybe as my follow-up question just on the BPO call out. Brian, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted again now this been a couple of quarters in a row, the strengthened BPO. Can you just elaborate what service line specifically, like which verticals is that showing are you sort of leaning into that opportunity, which seems to have come out of the tight labor market in the back of the pandemic. Brian Humphries : Yes. Lisa. Look, the team has done an extraordinary job. I would say not just in this quarter or recent quarters. But in the last few years, we exited, as you know, content moderation. That has been a large driver of growth in that business, and we executed it seamlessly. We repivoted the company more towards certain categories, notably around intelligent process automation, ultimately contextualized to industry-specific use cases as well as a very strong focus on the digital native clients. But not just has that been a success story in its own right, we're also, Lisa, in every 1 of our 4 externally reportable segments, growing our BPO business in not just along the lines of digital natives. Margins have been improving, and we're obviously now using this to try to get pull through to the, let's say, tech services portion of the company. The -- if you think about our BPO business, I mean fundamentally, it's historically been about 80% aligned to verticalized plays. We continue to strengthen our hand in that regard, but we're also looking in other growth postures, including F&A and CRM and doing that in conjunction with partners and starting to see a pipeline behind that as well. So we have, I would say, very strong client references, a lot of swagger in that group that are consistently beating their forecasts and budgets. And that swagger correlates to broad-based momentum across indeed across all 4 verticals. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I guess I wanted to ask with regards to any indirect or flow-through impact you may have seen from the war in Ukraine, either clients coming to you to potentially move work away from East European clients or East European locations with other vendors or subcontractor work that might come your way or even on the supply side, any increased pricing wage pressure? Brian Humphries : Yes. Ashwin, look, generally, we don't really have any exposures to Ukraine or Russia and are now significant operations there whatsoever. And I would say, at this moment in time, we've seen no material impact of the conflict on client demand either. Of course, we'll continue to monitor that situation. One, we have had clients come our way. I mean we're clearly aware of our digital engineering strength and our ambition to scale further there. I actually think if I stand back from the here and now, I believe that the implications will be lasting and that our scale in India, which we're actually tying into our digital studios around the rest of the world, which are very much part of our digital and global delivery network, they'll ultimately help us distinguish ourselves. And ultimately, as clients are assessing their vendors and strategic partners, and in particular, as digital becomes mainstream, I suspect that scaled players like Cognizant will stand to win in the long term. And India will continue to be an asset for us. And if you just think about the last few years in the COVID period, there's been a number of points mix shift to offshore, notwithstanding the industry scaling towards digital. And I think that will stand Cognizant in good stead given the tremendous strength and talent we have across India. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. And with regards to just talking about wage inflation and pricing trends, I know there are many nuances as it relates to the ability to proactively pass price increases to clients, when you can do that, the number of times a year or the call or definitions, things like that. Could you sort of walk through what you're seeing areas? Brian Humphries : Yes. I'll start and Jan, why don't you jump in if needed. Ashwin, I think, first of all, pricing is extremely topical at this moment time, given the services companies are knowledge-based organizations and therefore, our supply chain for wanted a better word is our talent. And as costs of our people go up, by definition, we have an obligation to, in one form or another, either automate, change the pyramid, change the offshoring mix or near-shoring mix and/or find a way to pass on cost to clients, notwithstanding automation agendas or whatnot. So I think at this stage, pricing is mainstream in terms of dialogue amongst not just Cognizant, but also our peers in the industry to try to offset the compensation pressure. So the classic situation that we have grown up with historically around MSAs being signed with rate cards associated with those and rate cards coming up for renewal every 1 or 2 years, that is not necessarily as relevant anymore because people have to intersect those natural cycles. Now on top of that, I'd just point out that well, as Jan said, we have a pricing initiative underway. Clearly, the business model evolution of Cognizant, which has been quite intentional in recent years, including a much greater shift towards digital and the commitment to try to evolve from being a provider of resources to be a solution provider that enables clients to address their pain points by a selling solutioning and delivering client outcomes, that puts us in a position where we are competing with sometimes very different competitors and we may have some margin opportunity via pricing leverage as well. So both of those factors, I think, are pertinent at this moment in time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Rod Bourgeois : I just want to ask about acquisitions that you've completed in the past couple of years and how you're performing against the revenue and synergy targets on those acquisitions. And I would also ask if you could include any kind of update on TriZetto. I know that you made some good turnaround progress in that business' growth last year. And it would be helpful to hear your latest thoughts also on TriZetto's growth trajectory. Jan Siegmund : Hey, Rod, I'll take your second question first. TriZetto had actually -- interesting that you're asking -- the best product sales quarter ever in the history this quarter. So the product modernization that we had undergone with TriZetto continues to show benefit and so they are doing really well and the pull through implementation services and other services to it.  Relative to the M&A performance. We had -- our M&A portfolio is performing well against our budget, and we are generating actually revenue synergies as we had planned for. And I think we have probably a little bit more work to do to counter the margin dilution that our M&A does. But I'll give you 1 example. Our Softvision acquisition that we did now a number of years ago is now the core basis of our digital engineering business, and we're really integrating our entire engineering practice, digital engineering practice based on the Softvision model. So I would describe our M&A program is largely successful as a portfolio. Now you always have in a portfolio of companies, some that are not doing quite as well, but as a portfolio, we are very satisfied with the progress we're making on M&A. Rod Bourgeois : Great. You could have just said TriZetto's performance is so good, it can make you cough, but that's my bad analyst humor. Jan Siegmund : I'm sorry. I'm a little bit under the weather with a little bit of a cough. So sorry for that, Rod. Rod Bourgeois : Understood. Hey, just on the attrition front, is the attrition challenge starting to abate? And what levers are being pulled that give you some encouragement about where that might be going from here? Where are you getting some benefit on the efforts that you're making to attract and retain talent? Brian Humphries : Rod, it's Brian. So first of all, we're delighted. We've reduced voluntary attrition for 2 quarters in a row. This quarter, attrition fell 5 points sequentially on a voluntary basis, and we are extremely comprehensive in our disclosure of attrition perhaps the purest in the industry. That being said, I actually anticipate attrition will pick up in the second quarter. In fact, I know attrition will pick up because we look at resignations on a daily basis, and we anticipate it will be elevated for the course of the year. We have done a tremendous amount in the last year. We call this early. We substantially overspent our allocated budget last year for compensation and promotions because we wanted to invest in our talent try to mitigate attrition and make sure we capture the market opportunity. But this is above and beyond simply financial measures. It's total rewards, vacation policy, 401(k) policy, stock purchase price policy, et cetera, within total awards. And on top of that then, there's a significant amount that we've been doing around investing in our employees, whether that is skilling or indeed enabling career path advancements, Cognizant as you know very well, has always been a company that invested heavily in our people, attracted smart people, put them into accounts and really enable ourselves to ingratiate ourselves at accounts. Well, we've furthered that in the last year by doing what I would view as clever things with regards to our promotion process, really trying to make this a little bit more self-service and constant through the course of the year by tying it much greater to skilling as opposed to longevity of tenure and making sure that we try to correlate that with bill rate increases as well. And then there's a broader notion of us getting back on the front foot growing double digits, which creates career path opportunities for people and upward mobility and just a celebratory sense of winning bigger deals, winning in digital and delivering with success. Now all of that comes against the backdrop of us also in the course of the last few years taking some pain by really balancing our visa dependency in North America given the regulatory backdrop as well. But the heavy lifting of that is now essentially behind us. So we've been working very hard to mitigate attrition. But the reality is the market is red hot behind certain skills and try as we might, and we track the data when we promote people or when we give them salary increases. We know how long it mitigate attrition before it picks up again. So I just think this industry is perhaps at a different curve than it was in the last 15 to 20 years, perhaps the return to office are much more of a hybrid work will help mitigate what we've seen in the last year, but I'm still somewhat pessimistic about the industry attrition trends. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Brian Essex : Brian, I was wondering if you could address headcount growth, a number of quarters here of nice strong double-digit headcount growth in spite of attrition, although attrition has been improving. Can you maybe unpack that growth a little bit and give us a little bit of insight around have you been able to improved lateral hiring. Are you making some digital ads? Is this primarily freshers that you're bringing on board? And how that might translate into revenue related -- I guess, headcount-related revenue growth going forward? Brian Humphries : Yes. Well, the holy grail of course, in a services company is somehow to decouple headcount growth and revenue growth, but there are multiple factors at play, including accelerators and the mix of their headcount onshore versus offshore and indeed within the pyramid. Clearly, if I start with the pyramid, at the bottom of the pyramid, I felt 3 years ago, we were light. We hadn't been as aggressive on campus hiring, et cetera. And in the last few years, we have really, I would say, materially changed our hiring practices, 17,000 a few years ago, 33,000 freshers onboarded and infused in the last year. And then we're aiming for 45,000, 50,000 this coming year. And I'm assuming that will continue to grow. So that by definition, adds headcount at lower levels from a billing perspective. And clearly, as you go through rightsize that, then you bring people on board, you get them trained for a few months, you infuse them into accounts and ultimately get them into more billable type roles. So that's been 1 factor where you've seen us materially add headcount. And I think it's fundamentally so core to our success in the years ahead because with those people being skilled and with this internal job moves program that creates upward mobility in our organization, we are therefore able to promote from within more often, particularly when we have fixed bid or managed services type deals versus a more traditional deal staff augmentation or interview-based role. The second factor I'd say is our mix has shifted like many in the industry, about 2 points towards offshore in the last year, and that has different dynamics in terms of average bill rate per employee or margin dollars per employee but also margin rate per employee can be higher in offshore. But the attrition that we're experiencing, I think, as an industry and within Cognizant is broad-based. It's not just in India, it's not just in the junior levels of the organization. It's also across Western Europe and North America. So we are continuing to complement the programs we put in place with incremental campus programs in North America, nearshore programs in Mexico and Canada, which are ramping nicely for us, and of course, the need for subcontractors and laterals. Subcontractors actually fell sequentially in mid-single digits, and that's something we'd obviously like to continue to optimize in the years ahead by getting more campus programs, more upward mobility and better demand visibility such that we can avoid as much subcontractors. And then last but not least, one of our core competencies, I would argue, has been our talent acquisition group, we've done remarkable work in the last year or so. Certainly, the offer to join a ratio has eroded in the industry and Cognizant is no different. But nonetheless, we have an incredible capability to bring in tens of thousands of employees per quarter. And I'm firmly of the opinion we're not yet hitting our stride in terms of our revenue potential. So we want to continue to scale our operations to get after the market possibilities that are out there. Brian Essex : Got it. Very helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Jan. On FX, maybe any way to quantify the contribution from rupee depreciation versus the dollar and how you might be thinking about that going forward given the margin guidance you've given? Jan Siegmund : Actually the rupee movement going forward, which is largely affecting basically, of course, our cost base is, as you know, moderated by our hedging program. So we really don't make an assumption around this. In the quarter, I think I mentioned in the script that the rupee did contribute about 50 basis points in a set of ups and downs to our margin. But that may help you a little bit to extrapolate for what it is. So this is largely driven by our revenue forecast that's going to be the euro and the pound are going to be the most impactful one in that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Keith Bachman : I'll ask my 2 questions concurrently since they're related. Brian, first for you. When you last -- since you last gave guidance, based on our discussions with folks in India, in particular, it seems like wage rates have actually moved against you. In other words, wage rates have gotten more expensive even over the last 90 days. And assuming that supposition is true, I'm just -- what is going right that allows you to maintain the margin guidance even with perhaps wage rates getting more onerous. So perhaps you assumed in the previous continue to move against you. But is it as simple as pricing? Because when we do our calcs on the rupee exchange rate, it's not enough to offset the change in waste rates even over the last 90 days. So, a, what is going right that helped you maintain the guidance? And are you comfortable that, in fact, with the current wage rate structure, you're leaving enough room as you said, to strengthen your hand or invest appropriately for the longer term? Brian Humphries : Well, we have continued to invest in the company. As you know, over the last few years, our SG&A has outgrown revenue and margin dollars substantially on a year-over-year basis for a whole host of initiatives, from IT security to marketing to reinvigorating the commercial momentum story that is now few in the growth that we're seeing. Keith, by definition, it's not an easy environment. By definition, when we look at forward guidance, we anticipate not just the here and now, but month and quarter, we have more lateral layers that we're bringing in from the outside, which are coming in at rates. But I still feel in the same vein that the negatives of labor cost increases, the attrition impact on utilization, the increased costs associated with travel and entertainment and return to office, we still have possibilities to offset that with moderated SG&A growth, with revenue growth leverage, pyramid optimization, shoring optimization, automation, real estate and, of course, pricing. And arguably, pricing is the big one. We are seeing some nice green shoots there. It's a programmatic approach that Jan and I are heavily invested in with our pricing team globally and with the markets to make sure that we have the courage to talk to clients around the importance of investing in our people, which will help mitigate attrition on their accounts and the various other actions we're taking. So pricing is ultimately the factor that gives us an ability to maintain margin growth of 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the year. Keith Bachman : Right. In other words, those pricing discussions, even since the beginning of the year, those are perhaps a bit more favorable where clients are willing to listen or it's a more equitable discussion at least it sound. Brian Humphries : Yes. Look, let's face it. I mean in every C-Suite conversation that I have as I go around the world, we all end up talking about multiple things around return to offers, hybrid work, culture and also about labor and supply chain disruption. And many clients over the years, as you know, have brought certain skills in-house and they're all dealing with the same trends we are dealing with ourselves in terms of elevated attrition and labor cost increases. So it is quite topical. It's quite known for our client base, and we're not the only company in the world approaching clients outside of standard renewal dates to intersect the classic rate card work. It's heavy lifting. It's not easy. I want to call out my team globally. We've worked very hard in the last 9 months to mitigate this to navigate our way through certain icebergs. And we know we've got some heavy lifting ahead of us as well. But the team are committed to do so. And we keep, obviously, everybody current on a quarter-by-quarter basis and see how much progress we can make in this regard. Keith Bachman : Okay. Fair enough. And then, Brian, just to clarify, you did say that you've had a really nice move in quarter attrition over 2 quarters. You said it would go back up in June due to some seasonal factors. But do you think it flattens out there, even declines as you look at the back half of the calendar year? Or do you think it kind of stays at these elevated levels? Can you make progress in attrition, if you look over the horizon from the June quarter? Brian Humphries : We just don't know. It's very hard to call, Keith. The reality is that attrition slows based on a series of financial measures we've made, serious promotion measures we've made. But obviously, there are elements of seasonality at play here as bonuses are paid, which triggered an increase in attrition in the last few months. And so therefore, I know that attrition will go up in Q2, and that's factored into our guidance. Once we get past Q2, we're just going to have to keep a close eye on this and see how we're able to continue to engage employees. I actually believe that the environment we're in these days, which I think we've hit a watershed moment of people no longer necessarily wanting to work in an office environment like in the past can be detrimental to employee engagement and cultural affinity and indeed can enable people to work more remotely. And then in countries like India, the notion of moving from a large urban center to a rural environment, trying to encourage people back to an urban environment can have meaningful consequences for their disposable income at the end of the month. So there's not just a philosophical debate in terms of whether you can commit your work on remotely leveraging technology, but it's very much a financial debate as well, notwithstanding the broader inflationary pressure in the urban centers or indeed in rural. So I'm somewhat of the opinion that we're at a new norm, the labor market as we set. And with that new approach to work, industry attrition may pick up on a more sustainable basis, particularly in today's demand environment, where I still feel that digital transformation is clearly throughout multiple industries, and there's a lot more legs on this in the years ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Great. Just on -- kind of a follow-up question on pricing. Can you talk a little bit about -- well, historically, you've talked about there being a gap between your current pricing and the pricing you command in some of your acquisitions. Where are we in terms of closing the gap? And how much incremental benefit do you think can come from that this year? Jan Siegmund : I think I don't want to go into all the details of the pricing opportunity, but you're pointing out, I think, a key element of -- that is playing a little bit in our favor. The shift towards digital is on its own helping because we have a higher gross margin in our digital business. We're focusing, obviously, also on the pricing of these high-end demand resources. And so that gives a little bit more pricing opportunities. Also these projects tend to be a little bit shorter term compared to other long-term contractual things. So in that area, we're going to expect to make some progress, and I think our clients have also shown more receptivity in the area of these set of digital skills to discuss pricing with us. So I think that's helping. So you have a double effect of driving higher share using our acquisitions and pricing levels that have been established by our acquisitions as a guide to establish better pricing levels for the entire enterprise. So I think you're intuitively pointing out 1 area that gives us -- is definitely part of our overall thinking relative to revenue generation. There's also an element, if I come back to the question is really the overall margin discussion and pricing has been a focus on this call. But we do have, with our shift towards hiring of Gen Zs dramatically shifted our cost pyramid development and the internal promotions not only help, of course, generating better group happening for our associates, but also help us to mitigate the cost of lateral hires. And we hope that as we execute on our strategy of increased Gen Z hiring that -- and we plan on cost efficiencies and in our delivery model, helping in a similar way to offset the compensation pressure that we're good seeing just on wages, basically. James Faucette : Got it. Got it. And then how would you talk about -- and maybe just for you, Brian, how do you feel about the current state of your delivery organization and even outside of attrition, obviously, attrition and hiring is always going to be a challenge for delivery. But how are you feeling about that structurally and skill wise, et cetera? And any unique challenges outside of hiring and attrition that you want to make sure you try to address as we go through the rest of this year? Brian Humphries : I'm very proud of our delivery organization. At the end of the day, Cognizant is a delivery company, whatever we sell a little more than a commitment to actually go and deliver against that. And come what may in the last few years, humanitarian crisis, a cyber attack and of course, in today's elevated industry attrition. Our delivery team have gone the extra mile time and time again to satisfy client demand and juggle various balls. So I'd like to complement them. We, of course, are complementing India as well by bolstering that with a global delivery network in Europe, in North America, onshore as well as nearshore locations. So they've done a really nice job for us. As we evolve the way we show up the clients and lead with advisory capabilities to sell solutions and deliver outcomes by industry, addressing client pain points, of course, there is an evolution that's happening in our delivery organization. And that includes how we solution and project and program management, and of course, the degree of efficiencies and accelerators we're able to use within our portfolio. And that's something we're making good progress on. And at some stage in the future, we'll talk more about that externally. But our delivery organization is the heart of Cognizant. I, frankly, was in India probably 4, 5 weeks ago, I'll be back there in the coming month or 2 as well. A lot of my team have been there in more recent weeks. I actually characterized the morale and the vibe amongst the delivery organization to be perhaps the highest it's been in the last 3 years. I really feel very good about where we are, notwithstanding the pressure everybody has been under given these either self-imposed or exogenous events. Operator : We have time for 1 more question. Our last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Thanks for fitting me in. I'll keep it short here. I guess, I know focus of the company has been to do larger deals, just get an update on how that pipeline looks and if you're being able to close some of the larger deals? And then kind of the secondly, is there a bookings about? I know we started at 4%, you're talking about an acceleration. I know we've done mid-teens the last couple of years, just trying to get our models set up correctly. Brian Humphries : Yes. Look, I think fundamentally, given the revenue guidance Jan and I gave in November last year in the multiyear outlook as well as the current guidance for 2022, we've got to maintain a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1 or above. That's certainly directionally what's going to be needed for us to achieve those goals. I always think it's very important to underscore the importance of thinking about bookings across a trading 12-month basis. And to your point, Bryan, we've had some very strong years now the last 2. And from my perspective, we are in a much better position than that and we've been at any stage as I came here a few years ago. And I feel good about our win rate, and I feel good or better pipeline within that. So that's kind of my perspective in terms of bookings and our readiness to get after the market opportunity in the years ahead. The demand picture is less concerned than the attrition and labor cost concerns. Bryan Keane : And what about larger deals, Brian? Brian Humphries : Larger deals, trailing 12-month basis, we've got $23.4 billion of bookings without substantial large deals within that. And I view that as a positive because our digital momentum has really picked up. But certainly, with, I would say, strong delivery capabilities, strengthening project and program management, strengthening solution name, discipline within Cognizant. We are continuing to review the opportunity to get into some larger deals. And hopefully, we'll have some good news for you on that in the next few quarters. Some of those will be aligned to really us like FSI, where we've done some good work in portfolio. We cleaned -- refreshed our client-facing teams, both in delivery as well as in commercial, and we've got a very strong industry solutions group that needs to continue to get stronger. And we've been spending a lot of time with clients that we haven't sold to in recent years, and I think we have the opportunity to get into some of those larger accounts as well. So hopefully, you'll see something in the coming quarters in that regard. But our momentum has ultimately been carried by digital momentum, the reinvigoration of our commercial sales team and client centricity at our core, clearly, a broader portfolio that's more compelling than ever before, which has been intentionally built to exposures to higher growth categories. Our international expansion, I'll call out the UK, our second largest country after the U.S. growing consistently now. 20% plus is a really strong post-merger integration opportunity to scale into our accounts. If we can complement all of that with a few larger deals per year, that will be done opportunistically judiciously. There's a lot of potential left in this company, and I really feel good about that. Brian Humphries : Okay. With that, thank you very much for joining us today, and we look Operator : This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin your presentation. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's second quarter 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures or appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to comment on several topics today, notably our second quarter performance, the demand and pricing environment and labor market dynamics. Let's start with our second quarter performance, which was balanced. Second quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was led by digital. Second quarter operating margin was 15.5%, up 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our expectations. Financial leverage driven by sequential revenue growth, disciplined expense management, currency benefits and the optimization of pyramid, shoring and fulfillment helped offset the impact of attrition and labor cost inflationary pressure. Our industry segment performance remained largely consistent. Financial Services grew 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency, led by insurance growth. This includes a negative impact of 190 basis points from the exit of Samlink. We continue to make progress strengthening client relationships in Financial Services. Earlier in the second quarter, I visited clients in Germany and celebrated a new logo win with Zurich Insurance Germany. Cognizant will help them simplify, modernize and manage their enterprise application landscape by establishing joint DevOps teams and working to extend the insurers' AI, data, software engineering and cloud capabilities. In insurance, CCC Intelligent Solutions whose SaaS platform powers the property and casualty insurance industry, asked for our help in enabling their cloud transformation program. We led with our enterprise DevOps and cloud transformation consultancy and partnered with Microsoft to present a comprehensive solution. This prompted the client to also select us to build next-generation analytics and telematics solutions that are expected to be key to their long-term leadership. In the second quarter, we combined our Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments into a single operating segment called Health Sciences and naturally dilution, given the market conversions across these industries. Health Sciences grew 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency, with growth driven by pharmaceutical clients and sustained momentum in our TriZetto product portfolio. Commonwealth Care Alliance, an integrated care system serving over 60,000 members across numerous U.S. states, illustrates our momentum in TriZetto. Our end-to-end business process innovation powered by TriZetto solutions and a BPaaS engagement is fully integrated from enrollment and billing through claims. Through our partnership, Commonwealth Care now has the tools needed to compete in the digital health ecosystem and support value-based personalized care for its members. We've also signed a new multiyear agreement with Organon, a global women's health company to help improve the delivery of healthcare products and crucial medicinal supply chain management. We'll help Organon scale its healthcare business by delivering full stack industrial technology support for its global pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in the UK, Netherlands, Belgium and Indonesia. We continue to see excellent growth in Products and Resources, where revenue grew 11.6% year-over-year in constant currency, driven in part by strength among automotive, logistics, retail and consumer goods clients. As a strategic partner for digital, we're helping Albertsons Companies, a $70 billion grocery retailer, make their move to a cloud-based infrastructure model, enabling innovation and improved customer experiences, both in-store and across last-mile delivery. In Communications, Media and Technology, we had another quarter of excellent growth. Revenue grew 19.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven by technology clients and new client acquisition. DocuSign is an example of a new logo win. They selected Cognizant as the preferred partner for global customer support operations across all products and services from their flagship e-signature product to newer contract life cycle management products. DocuSign turned to us because of the distinctive solution proposed by our intuitive operations and automation practice, including cutting-edge omnichannel customer support and outcome-based commercial models. A quick word on our recently announced organizational evolution. In July, we announced the combination of our practice areas with delivery practices, which simplifies our model by bringing Cognizant in line with industry norms. This enables us to have end-to-end accountability across 4 integrated practices from vision, road map offerings and capabilities, including M&A and post-merger integration through to presale solutioning and delivery. I believe this will assist our industry teams to be more successful with our clients as we sell solution and deliver client outcomes. I also believe that our industry capabilities provide differentiation that we can unlock value for clients at the intersection of industry use cases and technology. Moving now to the demand and pricing environment. While we are carefully monitoring the potential impact of a worsening economy in our pipeline, to date, we've not seen any significant slowdown for IT services demand. That said, as we serve some of the largest clients in the world, we are aware that should they see slowing earnings growth, nonessential projects or those with longer ROI may be paused. I am confident that the breadth of our portfolio enables us to serve our clients' needs for higher levels of agility, innovation, resilience and indeed, efficiency. So regardless of what the coming quarters bring, our value proposition to clients remains. More generally, digital transformation has become so essential and foundational to most companies, regardless of their industry, that despite some macro demand uncertainty in the short term, I remain optimistic on IT services' growth prospects in the medium to long term. In fact, the bigger challenges we are faced with as an industry are the demand supply and balance on key digital skills, elevated attrition and labor cost inflationary pressure. I would like to thank our associates around the world who've been working hard to navigate these challenges, all whilst trying to optimize fulfillment and pricing. Achieving the perfect balance is not always easy. And in the second quarter, while I'm pleased that we drove both year-over-year and sequential margin expansion, I suspect that our focus on fulfillment optimization and pricing marginally impacted top line performance and hurt bookings momentum. Second quarter bookings declined 3% year-over-year, below our assumptions entering the quarter. While we continue to have a robust book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.2x revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, by better balancing the factors just mentioned, we aim to accelerate bookings growth in other quarters, whilst nonetheless achieving our committed margin expansion. Just a word now on pricing. Market pricing dynamics remain consistent. Clients, through their vendor exposure and their internal teams, are privy to demand supply and balances across key digital skills and labor cost inflationary pressure. This, coupled with the pent-up demand for digital transformation, means clients are more predisposed to engage in price increase discussions. Clients are willing to pay for skills and innovation, with efficiencies, including automation and optimized delivery mix, are expected to mitigate cost increases. We continue to execute against a pricing initiative to offset labor cost inflationary pressure, with benefits starting to be felt, but greater impact expected in the coming quarters, recognizing that pricing power stemming from talent shortages will lag behind talent-related cost increases. Let's move now to labor market dynamics, including attrition and inflationary pressure. Second quarter voluntary attrition rose 5 points to 31% on an annualized basis or 32% on a trailing 12-month basis. This increase was slightly above the seasonal uptick we anticipated entering the quarter, impacting second quarter revenue performance. While we have seen some signs of improvement in July resignation rates, we continue to expect elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. As I've mentioned on prior calls, attracting, retaining and rallying our talented employees is one of our top priorities. In the past year, we've invested record levels in compensation, overhauled our promotion process, invested heavily in our learning and development initiatives and introduced a series of other measures, including educational programs and returnships. Our internal job moves program, which facilitates ongoing upward mobility in the company, is one factor that enables us to mitigate the need for and deep the cost pressure of lateral hires, all whilst improving morale. We've also recognized how important flexibility is to our associates and have, therefore, communicated a hybrid model will define our approach to work. Our priority is to be a welcoming inclusive, equitable company for everyone in no matter their work location. Our clients and associate-centric company aims to strike a balance between how clients want to interact with us and the flexibility we seek, all while maintaining a focus on employee engagement, collaboration, our values and a culture of continuous learning. I'm pleased to see that our efforts on employee engagement are working. In recent weeks, we completed our annual engagement survey that showed significant increases in our engagement scores, positioning us above industry benchmarks. In closing, as we execute our strategy, we were operating with 3 clear priorities : first, execute our vision to become the preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite; second, rally and engage our associates around the world; and third, drive profitable growth. Despite some near-term macro demand uncertainty and the challenges of navigating today's labor markets, let's not forget that we are in -- at the early stages of what we expect to be a massive digital build-out. Thanks to our portfolio and our talented employees around the world, we believe that we will be a strategic beneficiary as companies embrace digital operating models. Finally, as we reposition Cognizant towards selling, solutioning and delivering industry-aligned solutions, enabled by targeted advisory capabilities, our margin potential will be strengthened in line with our brand repositioning to higher-value services. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. While our Q2 revenue growth was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, we delivered sequential margin expansion in line with our expectations, while continuing to invest into our talented people. We remain focused on profitable revenue growth. Moving on to results. Q2 revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of 7% year-over-year or 9.5% at constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed February 1. In Q2, digital revenue, as reported, grew 13% year-over-year and included FX headwinds of approximately 250 basis points, consistent with the total company. At quarter end, digital represented approximately 50% of total revenue, up 3 points from the prior year period. In addition to the FX headwinds, slowing of digital growth reflected lower inorganic contribution and elevated attrition, in particular, in North America. Despite these headwinds, we were pleased with the growth across our digital battlegrounds, which outpaced the total digital growth. As Brian mentioned, Q2 bookings declined 3% year-over-year. This resulted in trailing 12 months bookings of $23.2 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2, unchanged from Q1. Despite the softer-than-expected growth, we continue to believe this book-to-bill provides us a healthy opportunity to support our revenue growth outlook for 2022. We expect to improve bookings growth in the quarters ahead. Moving on to segment results for the second quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 5%. Q2 growth included a negative 190 basis points impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary. Our recovery within financial services remains largely in line with our expectation, driven by continued strength in our North America regional banking portfolio, growth in the UK and steady performance within insurance globally. Health Sciences revenue increased approximately 8%, driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies. Demand among healthcare clients was consistent with last quarter. Momentum continued in our integrated software solutions. Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 12%, driven by growth across all segments and included approximately 260 basis points contribution from recently completed acquisitions. This compares to the approximately 500 basis points contribution we reported in Q1 of this year. Based on the current portfolio of closed acquisitions, we expect the inorganic contribution to be immaterial to segment performance beginning in Q3. Communications, Media & Technology or CMT revenue grew approximately 20%, primarily organically, including growth from new clients. This reflects growing demand for data services and our work with leading digital native clients. We also continue to experience strong demand for our intuitive operations and automation services, which includes our BPO business. From a geographic perspective in Q2, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Growth was led by CMT and Life Sciences clients. Our global growth markets, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 12% year-over-year in constant currency, which included a negative 240 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was led again by the UK, which grew 25% and included strong double-digit growth within financial services, including public sector science, Products and Resources and CMT. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth in our GGM business and do not believe that we are hitting our full potential yet. Now moving on to margins. In Q2, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15.5%, as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin increased by approximately 30 basis points, in line with our expectations. This included improvement in gross margin, driven in part by a balanced execution and our focus on profitable revenue growth. We also experienced a benefit from the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and a modest benefit from our recent pricing initiatives. Additionally, we were pleased with the SG&A leverage we drove in the quarter. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 24.2%, and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.2%, which benefited from a discrete tax benefit related to our unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings, driven by the depreciation of the rupee. Q2 Diluted GAAP EPS was $1.11, and Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 14% and 18% year-over-year, respectively. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion or net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow in Q2 was $485 million, representing approximately 84% of net income, in line with our expectation. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $671 million. DSO of 74 days increased by 2 days sequentially, driven in part by seasonality and by 3 days year-over-year. We expect to improve DSO in the second half of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $141 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to over $1 billion through the first half of 2022. Turning to guidance. Our outlook for the remainder of the year assumes that we will continue to balance margin performance and revenue growth. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.98 billion to $5.03 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5% to 6% or 7.5% to 8.5% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 250 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 50 basis points, which reflects the lower-than-anticipated M&A activity compared with our assumptions in prior full year guidance. For the full year, we are lowering the midpoint of our constant currency revenue growth guidance by about 1 point, which reflects, in part, the impact we have had while navigating the current industry supply-demand imbalances, elevated attrition and softer-than-expected hiring, particularly in North America. However, we are maintaining our margin expansion guidance, which reflects prioritization of profitable growth, pricing initiatives and the rigor that we have put around SG&A. Our full year revenue, we still expect inorganic growth to contribute approximately 100 basis points to growth, unchanged from prior guidance. This assumes an immaterial contribution from future unannounced acquisitions in Q4. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative 220 basis points impact from currency versus 180 basis points previously. This leads to a revised reported revenue guidance in the range of $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, representing 6.3% to 7.3% growth or 8.5% to 9.5% growth in constant currency. This compares to our prior guidance of $19.8 billion to $20.2 billion, which represented growth of 7.2% to 9.2% or 9% to 11% in constant currency. Our longer-term capital allocation framework is unchanged. Today's uncertain macroeconomic backdrop has the potential to create a mismatch of valuation expectations between buyers and sellers as well as challenging synergy assumptions. Despite these dynamics, our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce deals towards the end of this year. However, these factors have led us to deploy less capital than anticipated on M&A. Therefore, we are revising our capital allocation plans for the remainder of 2022. We now expect to return at least $1.2 billion through share repurchases for the full year, up from our commitment of at least $600 million last quarter. As always, this remains subject to market conditions and other factors. Given the strength of our balance sheet and expected free cash flow generation, we do not expect liquidity will restrict our ability to execute against our M&A pipeline for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged, and we continue to expect approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion versus 2021. Our outlook for operating margin continues to assume industry supply side constraints, the elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. Headwinds to operating margins include increased compensation costs, C&E and a return to office costs, which we expect to offset through delivery efficiencies, digital revenue mix, pricing and SG&A leverage and discipline. Our guidance assumes continued sequential margin expansion in Q3 before the impact of our annual merit cycle in Q4. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $35 million versus $25 million previously, reflecting higher interest rates. Based on our increased share repurchase activity, we now expect average shares outstanding of approximately 519 million versus 522 million shares previously. We also now expect a tax rate of 24% to 25% versus 25% to 26%, reflecting lower year-to-date performance. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.51 to $4.57, up approximately 9% to 11% year-over-year. This compares to $4.45 to $4.55 previously. Finally, we are still targeting full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator :  Our first question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Rod Bourgeois : On the revenue progress and outlook, you've provided some updates here for us. How much of the revenue challenge versus the plan that you had 3 months ago and even earlier this year, how much of that is due to supply challenges? It sounds like a lot of it is supply versus macro challenges that are being faced within your client base and potential that the macro challenges are starting to ramp up. Brian Humphries : Rod, it's Brian here. Thanks for the question. Look, it's very much related to more towards the demand supply and balance that we see in the market. We gave guidance in November around the revenue target range of 8 to 11 over the coming years with about 2 points from M&A. Today, we reported 9.5 points of growth, so within that range. And even the guidance we gave is within that range. But my hope obviously, is that with better demand supply situation Cognizant would have better headcount and be better able to get after the revenue opportunity, whilst also I feel pretty good about where we are on margin these days. So really for us now is about getting -- continuing to evolve the business portfolio, if you will, to higher growth categories, making sure we get the headcount right, both in terms of increasing retention and making sure we even get better throughput in terms of our recruitment. And then, of course, targeted M&A, which tends to be accretive to our revenue CAGR, some targeted larger deals that may or may not come ultimately, in years to come. But we'll be selective on those, as I've always said. And in some regards, today's margin profile, I think, is also indicative of the fact that in recent years, we haven't made big bets that may have been wrong in terms of attrition assumptions or margin or cost assumptions. So it's really about those things, Rod. Macro, we've seen some impact in terms of pipeline progression but it's been more modest. We haven't seen anything meaningful in terms of slowdown in demand, and I'm still certainly of the opinion that's while we'll have to keep an eye on the earnings cycle of our major clients and understand how they think about larger projects or ERP rollouts or projects with ROI time lines. At the end of the day, I'm very optimistic about IT services growth prospects in the medium to long term, and we'll continue to shape the portfolio to make sure we were able to show up and add value to clients. Rod Bourgeois : Okay. Well, that's helpful. That demand is not being significantly impacted, it sounds like by macro. On pricing, you made some comments on pricing. And just to follow up on that, are you feeling that your pricing progress is consistent with the expectations that you had 3 and 6 months ago? Or is the macro factors also creating more challenges in getting prices realized? Jan Siegmund : Yes. Rod, I'll jump in. The pricing environment, we would still overall characterize as consistent, and we feel we do have pricing opportunities for us that we are realizing and working hard to achieve. We see better opportunities in our digital opportunities where the demand is really difficult to supply and value is high, our new digital type services as we see better opportunities we talked in last quarter about our initiatives to drive pricing across our entire client portfolio. And we're making progress. We always anticipated that this would be a multi-quarter endeavor. Some of these negotiations are ongoing, but we do see early results, and that's why I mentioned in my commentary that we do see some modest contribution from pricing, not only to margin, but obviously, to our overall margin development. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Just wanted to switch over to bookings. I know you mentioned they were below your expectations for the quarter. Wondering if you can quantify the shortfall there? And maybe just talk about what you think some of the root causes might have been. Obviously, they can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but I'm guessing that the bookings are kind of less affected by the supply-demand imbalances that you just talked about as it relates to revenue. So I would just like to get a little bit more color there? And do we start to see improvement in the bookings growth trajectory in Q3? Brian Humphries : Jason, it's Brian. So you said it right, bookings can be choppy, which is why I've always been an advocate of looking at bookings on a rolling 12-month basis. So on a trailing 12-month basis, our bookings are still quite strong with a book-to-bill of 1.2. But within any given quarter, you'll have dynamics at play. And this was a quarter where we knew we had to go focus on resource fulfillment, given where we were from an attrition and resource point of view, but also we wanted to make sure, given labor inflationary trends, we were able to address pricing discussions with clients. And that may have had even a psychological impact on our commercial team as they are focused on fulfillment and focus on pricing discussions, and perhaps concerned about selling the next thing if they're worried about being able to fulfill against it. So it's not quite as clean as you suggested. But fundamentally, we'd expect this to pick up in Q3 and Q4. Demand is there to the question that Rod asked earlier. We feel pretty good about our portfolio these days. We are repositioning the brand and repositioning how Cognizant shows up to clients and the kind of work we want to engage in. So it's maybe a question of balance. That's perhaps the word of this quarter's earnings. We're very proud that we're an outlier in the industry in the sense that we were able to drive margin expansion year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We obviously want to accompany that with revenue growth and bookings momentum, and that's what we're setting out to achieve, obviously, on a go-forward basis. Jason Kupferberg : And then just on the supply side, is attrition or is hiring the bigger challenge right now? And do you think Q2 will, more or less, be the peak on attrition? I know you said you expect it to remain elevated, but just wondering what other actions the company might take to improve that metric? Brian Humphries : We've taken significant actions from an attrition point of view, both in terms of compensation, significant investments in career path and overall our promotion process, significant investments in learning and development, and then in a whole host of other activities around education, returnships and whatnot. I will say there are some opportunities here that we have. This is seasonally in line with, I guess, expectations, although it was a little above what we had assumed going into the quarter. But we are somewhat confident that the actions we're taking are really kicking in. Employee engagement, as I suggested in my prepared remarks showed increases year-over-year across all 8 categories that we measured and were above industry benchmarks by the way. We have seen progress in terms of the actions we've been taking in the last 18 months. It has really improved our relative compensation position across key markets, including India. And while it's only 1 month of the quarter, the resignation trends we've seen in July, which isn't just about Q3, it's also about Q4, have been improving. And we have good success on this internal job moves program, which is creating a much more dynamic promotion process. So those are good leading indicators, I'd say, in terms of retention. On the recruitment side, I think it's fair to say the industry has been faced with almost its musical chair situation, where people show up with multiple job offers. The macro dynamics may actually start becoming more favorable. Early indications are that offer to join, our ratios have recovered a little bit in recent weeks, and I dare say, for us, perhaps for others as well. So we're looking forward to hopefully being able to build our headcount more aggressively on a go-forward basis and therefore, be able to achieve our true top line potential on the back of increased operational rigor and margin discipline that we' ve Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien-Tsin Huang : I know Jason asked about your confidence or visibility on bookings improving. But just thinking about your headcount changes a little bit here, it did slow down quite a bit sequentially after a period of strength. So just trying to read into that as I'm assuming you're just going to focus a little bit more on utilization here at this point of the cycle? Just trying to reconcile those two things. Jan Siegmund : Yes. Maybe just as a quick reminder, our second quarter is typically a higher attrition quarter that has to do with some of the bonus payments that we issue in the end of March. So we knew that we would have increased attrition that we don't expect to continue throughout the year. So that's number one. It does -- it did turn out to be a little bit higher, maybe also for the revenue impact that we identified, it had -- it did tick up a little bit higher and a little bit more impact in North America than the core of our operation in India. So from a medium-term perspective, I would think we still have elevated attrition levels, although not at the level that we have seen in the second quarter. Brian Humphries : The other thing I'd just add to that as well is, of course, all headcount is not the same. We've seen a shift of our delivery to offshore in the last few years. And I think where we have to put a little bit more effort in place is to continue to build our onshore headcount, particularly in North America. We've gone through a pretty extensive effort in the last 3 years to reduce visa dependency in North America. But hand in glove with that, we have to continue to scale campus hiring, lateral hires, -- and obviously, headcounts in North America, well, maybe having a lower margin rate can actually give us more dollars per head on both revenue and indeed gross margin. So that's an important factor as well. But yes, we're all over this, and you can imagine it's got our full attention, both in terms of the recruitment throughput, offer-joiner ratios that we track as well as what we're doing from a retention point of view. Obviously, the employee satisfaction and employee engagement survey results were very pleasing to see. So it's good to see the progress we're making. Tien-Tsin Huang : Just quickly on -- for my follow-up, the 1.2 book-to-bill being stable. I heard that. But is there a way to look at annualized backlog as well or some other metric thinking about that trend, assuming that there's some short-term project work and maybe some of the bookings have converted? Just on duration or ACV is another metric. I know you don't give it, but any interesting calculations there. Brian Humphries : We don't really get into those details, but our average contract duration actually increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Some of that is because we had a little bit more momentum in larger deals, and some of it is because of the situation that in a resource-constrained environment, we were quite selective in terms of the deals that we get after with a view to ultimately aligning our resources in line with our business model evolution. And that business model evolution is around aligning resources to our targeted customer segments, aligned to selling solutioning and delivering client outcomes as opposed to simply being a provider of resources for clients. And if you're simply a provider of resources for clients, you can skew to lower-end deals and being in the mode of staff augmentation. So our strategy informs our actions. And this quarter, obviously, with the cards we had, which was a resource-constrained environment, we obviously had the luxury of being able to make choice points that were both beneficial to our strategic direction as well as beneficial to our margins. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I wanted to ask quickly on the competitive environment. It seems like your strategy that you've characterized as balance seems different or at least to diverge from what we've seen from some of your peers in their early reporting, especially as it relates to share and margin dynamics. Can you just give a little bit more color on how you're thinking about that balance strategy? What's driving that is what -- how you view that to be -- or why you view that to be the appropriate and how you think it plays out from here? Brian Humphries : Yes, I'll start. Jan, by all means, jump in if you want to embellish this as well. I think at the end of the day, James, we go back to the multiyear framework we laid out in November, not that long ago at the Analyst Day, when we talked about a revenue CAGR aspiration coupled with margin expansion over multiple years. And I would argue that's still the right way to think about Cognizant. Nothing has fundamentally changed. The results we announced this quarter, 9.5% constant currency growth with significant margin expansion year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, unlike the rest of the industry, I think fits within that mode and so too does our guidance. Clearly, the more resources we have, the more we'll be able to go on the attack more from a top line perspective. But what we've been really focused on is making sure we put a good operational discipline in place in terms of how we think about pricing, how we think about mix, delivery pyramid, et cetera, that's been a multiyear effort. We've also made investments, by the way, in the company that are starting to the bear fruit now. And of course, we get financial leverage the more we grow sequentially. So it's no -- not really fundamentally different from what we outlined back in November, and that's how you should think about us going forward as well. As we are better able to make progress on our retention trends, we'll have the luxury to be able to hopefully accelerate growth and get the balance a little bit better than this quarter. Jan Siegmund : Yes. And maybe I'll add the component of the business mix that we have been adding in our growth. We have gotten these questions in past calls. We have been absent from large and mega deals in the past and in the last couple of years. And arguably, that had slow our revenue growth, but it allowed us to much better control our balanced portfolio of the revenue growth within the corridors that we outlined, plus the margin expansion, which is just our fundamental belief will build the compounding, the most quality type business over time. James Faucette : And then can I just ask a follow-up, as you've formulated the outlook, obviously, a lot of moving parts between pricing, attrition, wage inflation as well as the macro itself. Can you give a little bit of color in terms of -- as you formulated that outlook, what of those key components are you expecting to improve as we go through the second half of the year versus steady versus any that -- versus steady that -- or versus any that may you -- you may be looking to do for deterioration? Jan Siegmund : Yes. Look, I think we are really to -- year-to-date quite close to the path that we had anticipated for the year. So I would point out the trajectory that we definitely look forward to improve is our bookings growth. And obviously, on a relative basis, also our employee attrition because that combination will allow us to drive a revenue growth acceleration basically, within the framework that we have outlined and deliver against our bottom line commitments. So the -- I think those would be the two factors that we'll be working hard. I tried to outline the opportunity that we see is not enterprise-wide unfocused. We can with, focused actions, drive improvements. For example, in my script, I mentioned the North American situation, I think we're going to pay extra attention to drive our North American staffing that will have good revenue impact and will strengthen us. That would be good action. We'll be very careful, encouraging our overall, a lot for revenue growth and bookings throughout our distribution and sales capabilities. And then the rest feels to me is in relatively good shape. We have our SG&A now as we have committed to in a good and controlled environment and we are able to drive that margin balance through this combination. And it is a number of factors that come too, by shifting towards our digital mix, which is accretive to our overall gross margin by making continued progress on our pricing action that will help to drive top line growth and the sustainability of our margin profile. So it's kind of a balance of -- we have kind of the foundations and innovative from my perspective in good shape so that we're now addressing selective areas of improvement for the rest of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : With financial services being your largest vertical, you drilled down into demand trends in financial services in the second quarter across your range of services, digital versus legacy and how you expect demand to evolve in this industry segment in the balance of the year? Brian Humphries : Yes. David, it's Brian. Look, I would say no major concerns in terms of demand curves in the financial services sector generally and within banking. We certainly had a good quarter, I would say, in commercial banking, which was stronger than retail and cards and payments and indeed, stronger than capital markets. So what we see there is, frankly, some more of a selective approach from Cognizant as we have repositioned ourselves with some of the larger banks, a shift away from staff augmentation with their transformation programs and really their innovation agenda. So it's been an evolution of how we -- the teams we have in front of clients and what they are about to sell and hopefully solution and deliver, but also educating clients to think about Cognizant differently. But I don't see any fundamental issues in terms of macro concerns in the banking space. Insurance, we seem to have done well in the quarter as well. Generally, most of the vast majority is in the United States. And we had a, I would say, a reasonably strong quarter there, too. And no major concerns either from a macro perspective there. Jan Siegmund : Maybe I'll just add some obvious things. Keep in mind that the reported results still reflect the impact of our disposition of Samlink, that is about 200 basis points impact on the growth rate. In substantiation of Brian's comments, we do see, for example, digital revenue and revenue shares catching up to our company average and making progress on that mix. Brian gave you the cut by our sectors, we have also regional success, our regional banking portfolio, for example, continues to perform really and nice growth rates. And from that perspective, we see that continued what we call it a moderated improvement throughout the year to continue. David Togut : Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up, what action steps do you need to take to win more transformation business from the bigger banks? Do you need to add more in the way of management consulting capability? What are the key pieces you're focused on? Brian Humphries : Yes, we've definitely been strengthening our consultancy business, but also, I would say more broadly than Cognizant Consulting, we've been trying to make sure that our client-facing teams holistically are more consultative. And that's a separate point, but nonetheless, similar in terms of the end product. And in parallel, I've personally been spending a lot of time on the road in the last 3 months in front of the C-suite of some of the larger banks, many of whom we haven't been able to serve in recent years and trying to make sure we have the opportunity to show up and be on their preferred vendor lists and evidencing to them the progress we've made with our portfolio and our strategic direction and how we think we can help them be successful in their own rights. So a little bit has been hunting. And then for those that we currently have, it's obviously been farming and making sure we have the right engagement teams, more advisory capacity, to your point, and then obviously educating clients who think of us differently as well. We're making progress. I think it's a paced recovery. It's ongoing, and we've continued to articulate that this business will likely grow slower than the company average rate, but yet we are confident we're doing the right things to get it in the right space. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffetNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. First one, I was just hoping that you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on in the M&A environment that's caused the slowdown in your pipeline there that you've seen sort of throughout this year, given the tightening macro environment and some -- the private markets tightening up a little bit. I would have thought it might get a little bit more fertile actually. So can you just give us a sense for sort of what you're seeing out there and why that has dried up a little bit? Jan Siegmund : Yes, Lisa, I'll jump in. Thank you for that question because it's important for us to reiterate that really, our overall strategic framework of capital allocation is unchanged. We still believe M&A is an important tool that we have to enhance the competitiveness of our company to add and augment for us. So what we see here is really purely an operational and time delay basic -- a timing delay of M&A that happens when you develop pipelines and when you pursue deals to do so. It's also a little bit a consequence of a disciplined approach, which we're trying to signal in our prepared remarks. We are thoughtful about how we want to allocate that that capital in this uncertain environment, coming off very lofty valuation expectations, I think it is fairly typical that you have sellers having higher expectations than buyers are willing to do as we see the world through different lenses. And so we observed that a little bit as we also think about how do we justify the expense of M&A in a rational way. We are optimistic overall that we will continue with some M&A in the second half of the year. So we have an active pipeline, but there are always the vagaries of closing those transactions coming out to a mutual agreement. But the -- it would be really purely due to the, I think, the practical situation that we are faced with at this point in time of economy and buyer expectations, outlooks, et cetera. Lisa Ellis : Got it. Okay. And then for my follow-up, I apologize for asking yet another question about this topic. But just a clarification on the supply fulfillment challenges that you mentioned have affected your revenue outlook for the year. You're just looking at your utilization numbers, they're pretty running fairly steady, I guess, not seeing that they're running really hot. So can you just clarify, like is this like a skills issue? Or just maybe give a little bit more elaboration on what causes that sort of supply-demand imbalance, given that the utilization numbers are still kind of running at more normal levels? Jan Siegmund : Yes, Lisa, it is -- keep in mind that number one, for clarification, our revenue performance was really to a very small amount of our expectations. So we are now in the fine-tuning of the sausage-making a little bit around what happened in the quarter. And observation is correct that we have a consistent utilization performance over the last couple of quarters. But we have overlapping impact. For example, our utilization is negatively impacted by our increased intake of college grads. They tend to have warm up times till they become fully productive, and it weighs on our utilization metrics in a simplified way were where we have other tight skill sets that have led to high utilization and lost revenue opportunities. This is in particular the case in North America, where we had higher revenue carrying gaps in our capacity for delivery. And so this localized effect basically, is balancing out and created basically some missed revenue opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : First one I got is on bookings. So I'm just trying to understand, are you experiencing pricing pushback and resourcing challenges that are causing more so delays or missed opportunities entirely? So I'm trying to get out really whether this is deal cycle extension or competitive loss and cancellation entirely there? And just how are you expecting fiscal '22 bookings growth to land now? Brian Humphries : Bryan, it's Brian. We'd expect an acceleration in the second half of the year. The book-to-bill ratio remains healthy, as I said, at 1.2, really on the back of Q3 and Q4 last year, where bookings growth of 20% plus in both quarters. Look, some of this is frankly us in a resource-constrained environment given our headcount opted out of certain lower-end or less strategic opportunities. And so that's business that we decided not to partake in because we chose to prioritize our resources for elements of our portfolio that are more strategic to our future direction. And clients that are more strategic from a customer segmentation point of view. So that's the first point. The second point I would say is we did see during the course of the quarter, I would say, pipeline progression be a little slower than prior quarters and some pushouts into outer quarter periods, higher levels than traditional. I don't think it's enough to signify by any means and concern from a macro demand point of view because bluntly, the biggest single factor we have is just making sure we get fulfillment, right, as opposed to worrying about the macro environment. We see plenty of opportunity for the clients I see. And frankly, I've probably visited a few hundred clients in the last quarter alone. So it's much more around our fulfillment capabilities and about the choice points we are faced with and that we take in a resource-constrained environment. As I said earlier, the average contract duration is a little bigger because we stepped away from some lower-end staff augmentation deals, and we've had a little bit more success in $50 million-plus category. So that's the dynamics I would articulate. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just on margin. Maybe can you quantify or just talk about some of the larger underlying swing factors in the second half assumptions that you have? And I see in 2Q absolute dollar level of SG&A spend was roughly flat year-over-year despite the higher revenue base. So maybe can you talk about where exactly you're leveraging this? And to the tune of are you cutting more so around corporate? Or are you also throttling sales and marketing-related spend as well? Jan Siegmund : Yes. I guess that comes to me. The margin performance in the first half has been driven by multi-factors, by a balanced set of contributors and I'm anticipating that to continue throughout the year. So pricing had a modest contribution, and we expect our pricing initiative to build on this and will increase in a slightly increase in importance for it. We had really seen good contributions from the strategic measures that Brian talked about, delivery permit optimization. All these factors have a higher intake of college grads, the careful use of subcontractors the shifting actually and could offset a large chunk of the compensation pressure that we're still facing and we anticipate to face throughout the year. So -- and I would say we had actually a slight growth, I think, by 3% SG&A growth in quarter-over-quarter. So there is -- we will be funding the growth that we need for our company, that is a priority. So SGA will now be in the way, our cost controls on SGA won't be limiting our investments into growth, but we are seeing also good progress in other corporate functions to drive efficiencies and simplify our operation, I think that you would expect us to do. So it's the multitude of these factors, and it's kind of a little bit of an art of how react to actual results in the -- within the quarter and emphasize one more than the other to drive the results. Maybe on the reminder is in -- the third quarter is traditionally our highest margin quarter. So we expect actually a sequential increase in margin in the third quarter. And then as you know, in the fourth quarter, our large compensation measure for the broad delivery organization takes place. So we expect some pressure in the fourth quarter and then deliver our guidance for the full year. Brian Humphries : I just want to touch upon the other question around the commercial team. Now we're absolutely committed to the commercial team. The multiyear guidance that we gave in our November Analyst Day, that became part of the 2022 revenue guidance is really about participating in growth markets, orienting the portfolio to our higher-growth categories and making sure we have world-class client-facing teams that are consultative in nature and that are productive in nature. And as many of you know, we've really built out a strong sales operations function here in recent years. We started showcasing to you the bookings position we have. We changed our variable compensation program for our commercial team and with a few years of data that we continue to hone in on opportunities around commercial productivity. But I would say the sales roster or the commercial roster is fundamentally similar to where it was in recent months and quarters, and we continue to want to invest in our commercial team and will invest in our commercial team in the years to come. Bryan Bergin : Okay. I've just got one follow-up, apologies here. Just how much of the business mix is typically comprised of shorter-term deals or maybe project-based work that would have experienced the miss opportunities with the choices you made due to the supply tightness? Jan Siegmund : I don't think we really give much detail on this. But as Brian mentioned on the bookings performance, where we saw the softness in bookings was disproportionate on what we call shorter-term deals, which makes exactly sense, as Brian had explained. So that portion was affected. But again, our variation from expectation is really a relatively small percentage numbers. So -- but we did see a little bit more pressure on the shorter-end deals compared to the longer-term deals. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS. Rayna Kumar : I just want to dig in a little more to your 3Q revenue guide. So it assumes a slowdown, right, in revenue growth from 2Q to 3Q. Are there any specific verticals or geography that you would call out that would cause that deceleration? And then second, your CMT revenue was very strong at 20% in the quarter. Any onetime items there? And how should we think of that growth going forward for the remainder of the year? Jan Siegmund : Yes. I would not really narrow in on specific drivers by industry. Some of our industry groups have a little bit more difficult compares year-over-year. And you can kind of see that when you look at your -- our tables. But, overall, I think in the short term for the third quarter revenue guidance, is impacted by our year-to-date booking performance to some degree. And then our gradual improvement of our attrition rates kind of lead us to a certain revenue forecast that we have given you in our guidance. Rayna Kumar : Understood. And just on the growth in CMT in the quarter, any call out on... Jan Siegmund : I wanted to leave that to Brian, because it's a great story. And so Brian can take it. Brian Humphries : Yes. Look, it's -- as you'll see in the SEC filings, the Communications, Media and Technology business for us is actually our most profitable industry segment externally. We have tremendous momentum there, a strong team who've been driving good momentum with digital native companies, fully leveraging our intuitive operations and automation business group as well. But we have strong client relationships. We've been executing well. Delivery excellence is very strong. I know a lot of these clients personally, they speak to our differentiated offerings and differentiated delivery. So this has been a business we've been investing in for many years as we've made the portfolio a little bit more diverse beyond healthcare and FSI. Products and Resources and CMT have been growing double digits for many, many years. And CMT is one of the showcases, I think, of our success in that regard, both in the United States as well as internationally. So nothing fundamentally that concerns me in terms of underlying currents there. We just have good momentum and a strong team. Brian Humphries : All right. With that, thank you, everybody, for joining our call. Look forward to catching up next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's third quarter 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com.  The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.  Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.  With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Humphries : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 5.6% year-over-year in constant currency, short of our expectations. Adjusted operating margin grew 90 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points year-over-year to 16.4% of revenue. While a non-certain macroeconomic backdrop impacted bookings and revenue, the primary driver of the revenue shortfall relates to a reduction in U.S. onshore billable resources in recent quarters, following a period of elevated attrition, a reduction in visa travel and a COVID-induced shift in the near and offshore delivery centers. Financial impact of this headcount reduction is magnified given this is our highest revenue and margin dollar per head population.  To reverse this trend, we have already initiated a series of action that are intended to increase U.S. onshore billable resources, including enhanced focus on lateral hires and subcontractors, accelerated visa travel and targeted compensation programs. While these actions are gaining traction, it is somewhat slower than previously anticipated. We, therefore, expect these headwinds to continue in the fourth quarter, ahead of clear progress in Q1.  Let me now turn your attention to global third quarter voluntary attrition, which was a little higher than expected in the quarter. Voluntary attrition fell 2 points sequentially to 29% on an annualized basis and fell 3 points sequentially on a trailing 12-month basis.  We've taken extensive actions to increase employee engagement and reduce attrition over the past year. These initiatives, coupled with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, have led to reduced daily resignations, a leading indicator of voluntary attrition across the globe in the last 4 months. We expect sequential reductions in voluntary attrition to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter.  To maintain positive momentum on resignations, we are continuing our comprehensive effort to attract, retain and rally employees. We remain focused on our people strategy, which includes our refined promotion initiative, learning and development, and enhanced compensation and benefits programs. For instance, we recently communicated to our associates that we will accelerate next year's merit to the second quarter of 2023, meaning we will have 2 more cycles in the space of 6 months from most of our associates. I would like to now discuss the macroeconomic environment, which Jan will also address in our fourth quarter guidance. We see clients closely scrutinizing and slowing their investment decisions for the backdrop of uncertain economic conditions. [indiscernible] has been reduced on lower-priority projects or those with a longer return on investment. We're seeing some early signs of slowing in discretionary digital projects.  Industry-wise, we've seen weakness in banking, especially in the mortgage segment, Health sciences and retail. In our international business, the U.K. remains solid, but deal cycles are slowing, while Continental Europe is showing signs of weakness.  From a commercial point of view, despite a strategy to sell solution and deliver client outcomes, we remain exposed to time and material engagement across all industries. We've seen clients curtailing this spending, and we expect furloughs to impact the fourth quarter. These factors contributed to a decline in bookings of 2% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing an in-period book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x on a trailing 12-month basis. Turning now to our industry segment performance. Financial Services grew 1.6% year-over-year in constant currency, led by growth in our insurance business. This includes a negative impact of 180 basis points from the exit of Samlink. In insurance, carriers of all lines of business are enhancing their digital capabilities driven by demand for new insurance products and improved user experience. For example, Resolution Life US turned to us to execute several digital transformation initiatives that include large-scale data and application core modernization and cloud migrations. We're also helping them develop and scale advanced capabilities in data and analytics to drive significant operational efficiencies in our closed book portfolio.  We were selected by AXA U.K. in Ireland as a technology partner to help consolidate, modernize and manage partners their IT operations. AXA is transforming its technology ecosystem to create a more digitally enabled modern and agile environment that's data-rich, secure and sustainable.  Health Sciences revenue grew 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by digital services among pharmaceutical and health care payer clients. I'm pleased to note that our shared investigator platform, a SaaS solution for pharmaceutical companies that streamlines clinical trials to improve the speed of drug discovery, has surpassed 250,000 users across 100 countries worldwide. [indiscernible], a Japanese pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, has signed a multiyear agreement with Cognizant to provide global [indiscernible] and help improve patient health through the analysis of adverse reactions across its products.  In Products and Resources, revenue grew 8.2% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our digital services among logistics, automotive, consumer goods and travel and hospitality clients. During the quarter, we extended our long-standing relationship with Centrica, the U.K.'s largest supplier of energy and energy services, deliver business-critical services encompassing application testing, client infrastructure support and IT infrastructure management. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 10.4% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strength among digital native clients. We're expanding our collaboration with Qualcomm to accelerate digital transformation through a new 5G experience center in Atlanta. The collaboration combines our deep expertise in 5G, IoT, cloud and data analytics with Qualcomm's intelligent edge devices, AI and 5G connectivity solutions.  We've also had our first substantial win in the legal sector, which has traditionally been a latecomer to outsourcing and digital services. Freshfields selected us to manage their global IT operations and support their ambitious global expansion plans. We'll be providing 24/7 managed service of the firmed IT infrastructure applications as well as managing its service desk. Cognizant will also help define Freshfields technology transformation road map.  As I mentioned in our last earnings call, targeted M&A remains an important tool for enhancing our competitiveness. We have several M&A targets in the pipeline in line with our strategy and capital allocation framework. As always, we continue to focus on opportunities, which are value-accretive among its shareholders and align with our strategy. Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire the professional services and application management practices of OneSource Virtual, a Workday partner based in Dallas. These practices will complement our existing finance and HR advisory services on the Workday Cloud Platform. The acquisition is anticipated to close by year-end 2022, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. At which stage, we expect to welcome nearly 400 new employees to our strategic Workday practice.  Importantly, we continue to strengthen our leadership team. Last month, [indiscernible] Ravi Kumar, President of Cognizant Americas. He will join us in mid-January from [indiscernible], where he served as President for the past 6 years. Ravi brings client centricity and a growth mindset that we believe will help improve our U.S. revenue trajectory.  We also announced Prasad Sankaran as the new Head of our Software and Platform Engineering Practice. Prasad joined us yesterday from Bain, where he was a Senior Vice President in the firm's Enterprise Technology Global Practice. Prior to that, he spent 25 years in senior leadership roles with Accenture. Both announcements speak highly of our ability to attract world-class talent and support 2 key strategic areas for Cognizant, the Americas region and leading enterprise technology transformation.  Before passing the call to Jan, I would like to stress that while we're in a period of economic uncertainty, the entire leadership team knows we must execute better on things that we can control, including optimizing our resources globally and getting the right mix on and offshore in a dynamic demand environment.  We will continue to focus on and hone our operational discipline, which is intended to enable us to adapt quickly to demand changes. While we're in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we remain highly optimistic on the key services market and our opportunity within it.  Finally, following sustained progress in reducing voluntary resignation rates, we expect sequential reductions in voluntary attrition to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter, allowing us to repivot client conversations from fulfillment to innovation, strategic transformation and growth.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of our quarter and our fourth quarter financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Q3 revenue was below our guidance range, driven primarily by lower billable headcount in North America. Higher-than-expected attrition, coupled with strong competition for talent in North America, made it challenging for us to maintain required staffing levels to meet our revenue forecast. An uncertain macroeconomic backdrop led to pockets of bookings and revenue weaknesses in certain industries.  The weaker-than-expected revenue performance was offset by commercial discipline, the benefit from the depreciation of the Indian rupee and SG&A leverage, which resulted in sequential and year-over-year operating margin expansion.  Now moving on to the details for the quarter. Q3 revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of 2.4% year-over-year or 5.6% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 40 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed at the beginning of this year.  In Q3, digital revenue as reported grew 7% year-over-year or 11% at constant currency. Digital represented approximately 51% of total revenue for the quarter, up 2 points from the prior year period. Our slower digital revenue growth reflected the expected lower inorganic contribution we discussed last quarter and the lower billable headcount in North America mentioned earlier.  These factors and softening demand environment also contributed to a bookings performance below our expectations. Q3 bookings declined 2% year-over-year and represented an in-period book-to-bill of approximately 1x. This resulted in a trailing 12-month bookings of $23.1 million and a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2x, unchanged from Q2.  Brian has already taken us through the segment performance, but I will spend a minute discussing several trends we are seeing emerge across our 2 largest segments. Within Financial Services, banking revenue growth slowed this quarter. This portfolio has a higher mix of time and material business, which we believe is more vulnerable to changes in the economic outlook of our clients. Additionally, mortgage clients have been impacted by rising interest rates, which has a negative impact on our results. These headwinds were offset by continued growth within insurance, particularly within property and casualty, where we are seeing good traction in both middle market and large global carriers.  We're continuing to invest and strengthen our banking and financial services portfolio to improve the revenue trajectory over the medium term. Within Health Science, our growth was again driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies. Health care payer growth was consistent with last quarter, and we have seen the ramp-up of integration-related services following the software product growth earlier this year. However, the health care industry has not been immune to pressures driven by the macro uncertainty as we have seen softer demand both across health care payer and life sciences.  Clients are slowing discretionary spending as they await greater clarity on the economy and navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment. Continuing with the year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, from a geographic perspective in Q3, North America revenue grew 4%. Growth was led by CMT and Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which consists of all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 10%, including a negative 220 basis point impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was again led by the U.K., up 19%, which had a strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients.  Now moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 16.4% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP operating margin increased by 100 basis points, and adjusted operating margin increased by basis points. Year-over-year, margin expansion was primarily driven by SG&A leverage, while gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs was partially offset by delivering efficiencies and disciplined pricing. We also experienced a meaningful tailwind from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, delivering an approximate 80 basis points of benefit, net of hedges year-over-year.  Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%, which included the benefit from a discrete tax item in the quarter. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.2%. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.22, and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.17, up 18% and 10% year-over-year, respectively.  Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow in Q3 was $953 million, representing approximately 150% of net income, in line with our expectation. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $1.6 billion or 92% of net income. DSO of 74 days was flat sequentially and increased by 2 days year-over-year.  During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $141 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to approximately $1.5 billion through the first 9 months of 2022.  Turning to our forward outlook. We are revising our full year guidance downward, which reflects headwinds from currency, lower North America billable headcount, which we expect to take several quarters to improve, and softer-than-expected bookings growth. Offsetting these factors are several tailwinds, including sustained reductions in resignations globally and our expectation for lower attrition in the fourth quarter.  For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.72 billion to $4.77 billion, representing year-over-year decline of 0.2% to 1.2% or growth of 2% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 320 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 30 basis points.  Together, these factors contribute to our revised full year revenue guidance of approximately $19.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 4.5% or 7% in constant currency. This assumes approximately 100 basis points of inorganic contribution. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative basis points of impact from currency versus 220 basis points previously. This compares to our prior full year revenue guidance of $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, which represented growth of 6.3% to 7.3% or 8.5% to 9.5% in constant currency. We expect our full year operating margin to be approximately 15.6% at the low end of our prior range. This implies Q4 adjusted operating margin of around 15.3% at the midpoint of our EPS range, reflecting the reduced revenue outlook and the annual merit cycle for most employees that is effective October 1.  Our full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $50 million versus $35 million previously, reflecting higher interest rates. We still expect average shares outstanding of approximately $519 million, unchanged. Our tax guidance of 24% to 25% is unchanged. Finally, our revised full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.43 to $4.46 represents growth of approximately 7% to 8%. This compares to prior guidance of $4.51 to $4.57. Our longer-term capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We are pleased to announce our agreement to acquire the professional services and application management practices of OneSource Virtual yesterday, and we expect our acquisition pipelines to remain active. Our share repurchase assumption for the full year is unchanged at $1.2 billion. As always, this remains subject to market conditions and other factors.  In support of our balanced capital deployment strategy, the Board has also approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, which brings our total remaining authorization to over $3 billion as of today. We are also still targeting full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income.  Before opening the call for questions, I want to reinforce that the leadership team is focused on addressing the operational challenges impacting our recent results. We are also closely monitoring macroeconomic factors to help enable us to quickly respond to changes in the demand environment. Longer term, we remain confident in our market opportunity.  With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : I'll start on the attrition point that you've raised that seems to, I guess, be at the root cause of some of the challenges you're having both on revenue and on bookings. In the past, you've focused a lot on the initiatives you're undertaking in India related to attrition and haven't spent as much time on the dynamics of what's going on in North America. Can you just elaborate a bit on what exactly is happening in North America? Is this recent? Have you pinpointed like specifically what's causing the elevated attrition and maybe elaborate a bit on the time frame and the steps you're taking to address it? Brian Humphries : Lisa, it's Brian. So look, at a global level, I would say we're doing similar things in North America as we're doing in India. Clearly, on a weighted basis, India had the biggest impact on our attrition historically. So we put inordinate efforts and war rooms in place over there. And frankly, in India as well as in North America and our international business in Europe and Asia, we have seen resignations come down pretty much for 4 to 5 months in a row now. So those efforts are kicking in, and those efforts are broad-based, including the obvious compensation elements. And as we announced, we just announced our second merit increase in 6 months. But on top of comp, there's merit, there is a career path progression, promotion process overall, learning and development initiatives, et cetera. And so the North America efforts are somewhat similar to what we're doing globally. I think in North America, we've gone through a pretty material visa, I would say, a process in the last 3 years as we reduce our visa dependency. But obviously, in a tough market environment where digital scales are at a premium, we've been suffering attrition in North America, and by definition, obviously going out as fast as we can to recruit talent simultaneously. And those factors, coupled with what's effectively happened across the industry and ours, was no different. A shift to nearshore and offshore during COVID has led us to have a, I would say, suboptimal level of onshore billable resources in North America, and it catches up quickly with you because of the order of magnitude of the difference in terms of revenue and margin dollar per head in North America versus in India. So it's a question of rebalancing that. We have major initiatives underway, operational rigor behind it. We had hoped to make more progress in the quarter. It's a little slower than we anticipated, but we're putting a lot of effort behind that to correct it. And it's all of the factors we mentioned above.  At a global level, we're expecting, I would say, significant voluntary attrition reductions now going into the fourth quarter. The goodness of the last 4 months will kick in, in Q4. Lisa Ellis : Got it. Okay. Okay. And then I know last quarter, you had commented on kind of the relationship between the attrition challenges and bookings, and you were taking some actions to sort of address the bookings issues or kind of that linkage. I think you're having challenges that some of your salespeople perhaps were concerned they wouldn't be able to staff a project or something. And so we're delaying it or -- right? So -- but then I guess it persisted into this quarter. So can you just also -- yes. Brian Humphries : Yes. Look, I mean, let me start with the facts first on bookings. They were down 2% year-over-year, a little below what we had hoped for the quarter, to be honest. It is important, I'd say, to recognize the tough comparison in the second half of last year with 20% plus bookings growth. So that leads to even an in-quarter bookings book-to-bill of 1.0, and on a trailing 12-month basis, still at 1.2. So healthy enough, although, frankly, we lost some deals in the quarter that slipped out quarters. And that's, I think, somewhat indicative of an uncertain macroeconomic demand environment. We've seen lengthening purchase cycles and clients being a little bit more judicious in their approval of expenses.  But Lisa, specific then to the impact of attrition, by definition, as people were dialoguing with clients around price increases, which has been one of our success stories, helping margin as well as addressing fulfillment challenges, it's made the commercial team somewhat hesitant, I think, to go to full mild to get the commercial momentum as strong as it needs to be in terms of increasing pipeline and accelerating bookings.  The good news now is we're quite vocal with our team in terms of what we're seeing from a resignation point of view, and therefore, what they should be anticipating in Q4 in terms of attrition levels, which, as I said, will be meaningfully down from Q3 voluntary attrition levels. So I think we're starting now to get confidence in the commercial team that the effort we put in place around attrition and resignations will kick in. Of course, this is happening in a period where, as I said on the call, we're a little more concerned now than we were 3 months ago in terms of the macro demand environment. So that's probably been a bigger impact on bookings this quarter than previously, the whole concern amongst the C-suite as they're scrutinizing their spends, and it's not clear to me that we'll see a budget flush at the end of this year, and we'll certainly anticipate furloughs at the end of this year relative to last year. So it remains to be seen, and we factor that into our guidance. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Rod Bourgeois : Yes, guys. So you have 4% constant currency growth in North America and essentially 10% outside of North America. So I wanted to ask how you feel about your progress and outlook in ramping your international revenue presence and also ask if your efforts in doing that are detracting from your efforts in North America or perhaps it's just that your talent challenges are more pronounced in North America, but some color on that would be really helpful. Brian Humphries : No. I'll start with the international business, which we expect very good things in the coming years there. We've refreshed some leadership over there. We've added with the senior [indiscernible] of the people we've recruited, we've added M&A to complement their capabilities. And examples of that include the U.K., Germany and Australia. And I've spent a large part of the last year going around the world, and I'm pretty optimistic around our potential internationally. So we're optimistic, but I don't think it's really taken away from the North America focus.  In North America, Canada there has been a shift more to offshore and nearshore. We're building out capabilities in Canada. But candidly, a shiftwards India has happened -- our net headcount has materially increased in India on a year-over-year basis, and we have to -- we get the balance right.  Three years ago, we were over visa-dependent in North America. We've been pretty disciplined around that as we are trying to land that at the right level. Candidly, what's been happening in the COVID world is that consulates internationally are just not functioning at the same capacity as before. So we've gone a little bit too far in that. That's actually a good news, by the way, in terms of reversing that for our attrition because that has hurt our attrition in the last 2, 3 years as people saw that opportunity be less available than previously, but now that we're turning that tap on a little bit to rebalance subject to the capacity of consulates that will not only help onshore headcount, but actually help morale and I believe attrition in India as well.  So I think the U.S. onshore situation is independent of the international positivity that I have, and I'm very optimistic around our potential there in the years to come. Rod Bourgeois : Great. And let me ask a follow-up about the cloud services market. We definitely see some changes happening in that market. So I just wanted to ask about what you're seeing in that market, particularly your competitive position there, and to what extent some of the recent macro challenges are having an impact in cloud or maybe not so much. It'd be great to hear some thoughts on the cloud market. Brian Humphries : Well, first of all, I'll actually call out Prasad Sankaran, who joined us yesterday. He's got a very strong background in cloud as well. So he and I spent a great deal of time talking about where that market is going. And ironically, in the client Advisory Board last week, it was a great topic of discussion amongst [indiscernible] clients, too. . I would say our position with some of the packaged application players like Salesforce, Workday is stronger than it's been for many, many years. And so we feel good about the progress there. And yesterday's announcements of OneSource Virtual, we'll continue to strengthen our Workday practice. Vis-a-vis the hyperscalers, it's kind of interesting. I'm seeing clients clearly accelerate their path to the cloud. Within the same vein, Rod, I see a growing dialogue amongst clients around how to optimize your position in the cloud as in lifting and shifting your current suite of applications [indiscernible] refactoring or another way transforming ahead of the transition. It doesn't necessarily always give them the efficiencies that they would have anticipated. So there's more dialogue around how to optimize your cloud journey.  And so what you'll see us do and continue to do is stand up capabilities and resources behind that, both in the cloud practice as well as in our consulting business as we anticipate cloud modernization journeys or tech more generally, you'll see us add more advisory capabilities there as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Could you talk about what you're seeing in digital especially since you mentioned slowing discretionary spend? Is that more of a company-specific positional thing because other companies have spoken to have not yet mentioned anything specific with regards to digital specifically slowing down? Brian Humphries : So look, the first thing on a broader macroeconomic environment, I'd say it's difficult to be conclusive or dogmatic at this moment in time. It's certainly what we determine uncertain macroeconomic environment. And the outlook is a little more concerning now than it was 3 months ago if you go back to my comments back then. We are seeing spend being reduced in lower priority projects or those with longer ROI periods. And even discretionary cloud projects, as I referenced in my prepared remarks, are selectively being reduced. So we still have a lot of confidence in our digital capabilities. Our portfolio is now 51%, digital up 2 points year-over-year. But some of the challenges we talked about, the macro demand picture as well as the U.S. onshore situation are equally applicable to this. And then as you know, yesterday's announcement of acquisition -- the first acquisition we've done this year. So we haven't had the tailwind in our digital momentum that we had last year from the series of acquisitions that we did. That being said, as Jan pointed out, we are committed to our framework of extending our portfolio in line with our digital strategy, and we have a series of deals in the pipeline as we speak. So I'd expect that ultimately over time to get back in a more normal course for us. But I don't believe that all digital projects will be immune from the current economic climate. Jan Siegmund : And maybe in addition, Ashwin, to give you a little bit more the framework on the M&A side, our full year guidance assumes approximately 100 basis points of contribution from M&A, approximately half of what we typically see. So if you multiply that types of share of digital revenues, you'll see there is an impact on just mathematically on the lack of M&A fueling digital growth.  And then aside from the demand -- market demand that Brian mentioned, obviously, in North America, we are also affected by our fulfillment challenges that we experienced in the quarter, which proportionately affected our non-digital business as well as our digital business. So it's a combination of all these factors together. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Got it. And what does this lower exit growth rate for the year means in terms of achieving sort of your medium-term targets? And I completely appreciate the high level of macro uncertainty that we have, but any granular thoughts how you're planning for next year would be greatly helpful. Jan Siegmund : Yes. So that somehow I thought the question would come up. So number one is we feel our growth framework that we discussed with you in basically pretty much a year ago -- a little bit more than a year ago, it's still intact overall.  Maybe a few pointers, the growth framework sees our revenue growth, which you're referring to, really in light of a CAGR over the 3-year time horizon. So it's a compounding growth. And obviously, we didn't quite anticipate at that point the economic uncertainty that we're facing today, but we think the framework from our perspective is intact. And then we will give guidance, obviously, for next year in our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Just on the fulfillment challenges. I know that kind of was an issue last quarter, and it seems like it got pushed into this quarter. And then it's caused you to miss the guidance, that and maybe the economy a little bit. Just trying to figure out, is the fourth quarter -- how comfortable are you with those numbers? Or could we still have some of these fulfillment issues lingering that could push us into lowering expectations again? Jan Siegmund : Yes. Maybe I'll start with it, and then I'll let Brian jump on top of it. If we think about the mix, as Brian mentioned and as we talked on our call, had a number of factors in it in fulfillment as fairly logical. So we misjudged or we had a little bit -- a faster improvement in the third quarter of our attrition anticipated. And so about that, that miss attrition improvement made about 1/3 of our miss relative to our expectations. And then we have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate the hiring and inflow, in particular, in North America of initiatives. And that represents approximately also 1/3 of our miss to revenue guidance. And here, we obviously saw the North American challenge to grow our headcount and initiatives in place from funding our -- and ensuring we have full capacity of hiring in place to focusing on the full fledge of resources available to us, including the utilization of subcontractors and accelerating visa travel and increasing employee referral product. So we have a set of initiatives in place. These initiatives have shown initial momentum, but they were scaling slower than we anticipated. So we have now our trajectory, and we think we have appropriately risk-adjusted our new revenue guidance. So we're keenly interested to meet our own expectations in it. And so yes, we have assumed an improvement in attrition levels that we can see. But we also see now the trajectories of some of these initiatives clearer than we had in the third quarter. Brian Humphries : Yes. And just to build on that, the resignations visibility we have, of course, differs in India versus North America because the notification period in India is slightly different. But I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call had July resignations have come down, and through August and September, it was a different plateau for those 3 months vis-a-vis the prior 6 months.  Certainly, if you look at India and indeed in North America and Europe, and in the first month of this quarter, it's continued to be low, in fact, lower than the prior 3 months. So we feel, Bryan, at this stage, very, very confident about that. And as Jan rightly pointed out, we wanted to give guidance that we want to make sure we can hit. So we're in the right zone. Bryan Keane : Got it. And then did the fulfillment challenges, especially in North America, will that be fixed by the time we get into the first quarter? Or could it linger into the first half of the year? Brian Humphries : We're aiming. As I said on the -- in my prepared remarks, we're working through that as quickly as we can, and we aim to make progress in Q4, but I think it'll still be a headwind in Q4. We hope by the time we come out of Q4, and we'll clearly give you an update on that in next quarter's earnings call, we hope to walk into Q1 with clear progress by the time we get through Q1. Operator : Next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Brian. Another one on the fulfillment issues. Could you give us some real-time insight into the nature of conversations that you're having with clients here? And kind of just thinking about all the rebranding and repositioning that the company has done in recent years, what are you doing to reassure clients that you are a digital transformation partner of choice? Brian Humphries : We actually see different stories, to be honest, Brian, across different industries in terms of our evolution towards digital, even banking where we are, let's say, more heavily exposed to time and materials. We have been able to increase our digital mix, and we've got some good proof points with certain clients. But more fundamentally, the journey we've been on is to extend the portfolio, which we've been successfully doing in recent years, and yesterday's announcement is another example of that.  To try to complement that portfolio then with a client-facing team that is more consultative in nature as anybody who's overseen a sales force and knows that is a multiyear journey. So we're en route, but it takes time to get there.  To complement then that more consultative sales force with a more industry-aligned consulting business, and so that's the space we should continue to watch in Cognizant because we will invest behind that, and we've got strong leaders in the capacity these days and then just to make sure that there's increasing brand awareness around the capabilities we have and references and case studies that we can showcase.  Last week in the Client Advisory Board was a very good example of certain clients not really been truly aware of the extent of our portfolio. So we have [Technical Difficulty] ourself. But I would say brand awareness of the company is up. Digital awareness is increasing, but it's a multiyear journey, and we're in the middle of all of that. And it starts with our client-facing teams and our delivery capabilities and our partnerships. And I certainly see in dialogue, with some of our key packaged application partners like Salesforce and SAP, growing recognition that we are getting stronger. But as ever, a few years ago, we were quite low in terms of digital mix, and we've been working our way back up to 50%, which we're pleased to cross, but there's more work to do. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. And just a follow-up. The forward-looking attrition commentary is encouraging. You've been vocal about the new normal for attrition being higher than pre-COVID levels. Perhaps you can share updated views here and the time line for when [indiscernible] is more in a steady state mode as it relates to attrition. Brian Humphries : I think it's very hard to really be precise on that, Bryan. There's just so much going on in today's world. We've gone through a period of pretty significant disconnect between demand supply on key labor -- key digital skills. We're going through a hybrid work environment as a society where, arguably, people are less entrenched or engaged with companies as they work remotely. And now we've gone through a very different scenario that the economy is uncertain, slowing. And people are -- recruiters have been laid off across the globe. We're seeing in certain companies, people are being laid off. And so the market is suddenly perhaps less hot than it was previously. And that can also have an immediate impact on attrition trends and voluntary resignations in particular.  So we will see where water find its own level over time. I'm encouraged by our specific actions that we've taken. Jan and I have also built that into our financial plan. So we have, notwithstanding a slowing, I would say, labor markets, we know that we want to invest on a sustainable basis in our employees in the years to come, and we factored that into our multiyear financial framework, and that will help increase our relative compensation vis-a-vis peers. And simultaneously, we're doing everything we can around training and development and career path and employee value proposition.  So I'm not sure when it normalizes to a new norm. I still believe there will be a new norm, and we won't go back to historical levels. And I think as a society at large, we'll probably see attrition slow across the industry in Q4 and beyond. But time will tell. Operator : Our next question is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : In terms of skills and looking at kind of -- as that relates to fulfillment, where are you seeing the most challenges in terms of finding the appropriate people and getting them into your fulfillment capabilities right now? And how are you thinking about the pyramid itself as it relates to solving for that? And I'm just wondering how that then impacts the you think about financial guidance? Kind of a complicated question, but hopefully, that's clear. Brian Humphries : Yes. I mean there's -- it's actually quite nuanced because, first of all, our headcount has materially increased year-over-year, but most of the increase has been in India. So by definition, then you have different bill rates. Within India, the lower levels of our pyramid are actually a fatter for lack of a better word than they were in the last few years. And that's because if you go back this year, we'll bring in about 40,000 graduates, 45,000 last year, 33,000 the year before, about 17,000 the year, less than 10,000. We had been too narrow as a period previously. We've done a good job, I think, addressing that. And that afforded us the opportunity to have more upward momentum in the company, which is one of the many factors that has helped us actually drive margin expansion year-over-year and sequentially in both Q2 and Q3. And -- but James, the fundamental element in terms of the demand supply economic imbalance and key digital scales was heavily related to skills related to all hyperscalers, things like Salesforce, [indiscernible] full stack engineers. I mean they've been probably the hottest parts of the market and there's been very irrational behavior, I would argue, over the last 18 months in terms of comp increases that went in, in glove with that. That's where we've seen the hottest challenges. In terms of the absolute attrition, it's fundamentally been in India and at the lower levels of the pyramid. James Faucette : Got it. Got it. And then I guess kind of a somewhat related question, but looking more specifically at the P&L and margin impact, can you help talk us through the impacts and mechanics of merit cycle changes? Are those accelerating? Are they going to be permanent? I guess should we expect 2 cycles a year? And just trying to make sure that we're contemplating that -- how that flows through the actual P&L appropriately. Jan Siegmund : Yes. That's maybe for me to answer. So effectively, our acceleration of our typical merit cycle that we're just experiencing in the fourth quarter and moving it up to the second quarter has really -- a main reason for it is to better align our HR processes, evaluation processes and reward processes together. So it is a benefit from a talent management perspective to have our merit increase in the second quarter. So that's really a very important driver of it.  And second important driver is obviously because we're accelerating the second -- this merit cycle by 2 quarters, we will incur a onetime shift of compensation by -- to our merit increase by 2 quarters forward. And that's going to be a onetime effect only because we're staying with an annual merit increase process. So in 2024, the normal cycle will be 4 quarters later again in the second quarter of the year. So we are capturing basically, I think, here an opportunity to improve our talent management processes, but also allows -- which also allows us to drive a faster compensation increase to our associates, which we think is timely because we really do want to be focused on attrition, and we anticipate that, that will have a positive impact on attrition, even though hard to measure, but we think it will send a positive signal of our commitment to our associates to be competitive on compensation and benefits. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just thinking about the knock-on effects of the fatter pyramid plus the attrition. Just -- is there an impact there on your ability to capture price or even be competitive on pursuing new work bookings, that sort of thing? Just trying to understand sort of the collateral impact because you're seeing some of that. Jan Siegmund : So what we -- maybe I'll talk a little bit about our overall maybe gross margin development, kind of what you're focusing on, Tien-Tsin, here is we did see, obviously, a decline, but I think the relative performance overall compared to the [indiscernible] has been relatively good. And so a few factors I want to point out. When we talk about pricing, I think we need to kind of -- in particular, now that we have been added for a little while, think about them as a regular contractual increase, pricing increases with our clients, but also a discipline to price our business appropriately in the market. And with both of these things, we have seen slow start in the fiscal year. And now we have seen steady improvement and compounding impact of those initiatives. So that has been getting better and has helped us on the relative gross margin performance. Also, the shift to the -- in our pyramid has been positive. We have been able to, to a large degree, offset the impact of comp and benefit increases by streamlining our pyramid and focusing on a slimmer permit, as mentioned, and that paired this promotion opportunities, which are positive, our associates, I think, we'll have over the next couple of years, as that is still scaling and maturing, a positive impact on how we price and how we win deals.  So we're feeling, I think, good -- well, we're feeling good about the improvements we're making of how we manage the business opportunities. It's a thoughtful process. It allows us actually also to make our strategic best moving forward. I think our margin profile is in good shape, and that should offer us opportunities to make our strategic bets where we want to go and grow faster revenues on a much more solid base than we are today. Brian Humphries : Yes. The only thing I would add there, Tien-Tsin, is I don't think we were doing anything except correcting what was an overly narrow pyramid back in the day. And on the contrary, I think because we had somewhat canceled the college intake in prior years, it led us having folks further up the pyramid doing work at lower billable rates than were optimal.  So I think what we've done in India is appropriate, and it's more in line with industry rates based on the dialogue I have with those from other companies. Where we have to do a better job on campus and college graduates, I think, is both onshore in Europe and Asia as well as in North America, where we are not adequately getting after the market opportunity there. It's -- obviously, there is a war on talent still. So we have to look at vocational colleges and not just the classic places as well, and that's an area of focus we'll have.  Fortunately, with Ravi coming on board in North America, he has run a play there previously, which we will obviously aim to replicate over here. And that can help our pyramid. But generally, I feel good about our skills in our pyramid. I think we corrected something that was mis-skewed. And I don't want anybody to get off the call worried about our skill set in our pyramid where we've got very talented employees, and I feel good about that. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just quickly, if you don't mind, a quick follow-up, just on the capital allocation front. I have to ask a capital allocation question. Just with the buyback of the authorization here, just your appetite to back stock. I know you talked about the acquisition you just announced. But just thinking about buyback here at this point in the cycle. Jan Siegmund : Yes. For this fiscal year, we gave you basically our anticipated number of $1.2 billion. And you see over the last few quarters as we have been lacking M&A activities that we basically redirected excess cash to return to our shareholders. That's the general philosophy that we've been following with no intent to build up cash on our balance sheet. And so that flexibility is in the model. We are seeing a good pipeline, though, of our M&A activity. So it's -- this we announced the deal, but compared to last quarter, we really moved the needle forward on our business development activity with very talented team. And we see also, I think, a little bit more realistic behavior in the market relative to acquisition opportunities.  So I think for us, the goal would be to get back to normal to the capital allocation framework that we have been talking about for a long time. It's going to be the mindset for us going forward. Operator : Next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Can we maybe go into a little bit more detail on the vertical specifically and just help us understand -- maybe starting with Financial Services, but any other one you think makes sense. Really, what you believe is the driving for some of the change in outlook, whether it's, number one, macro and just pure simple demand and bookings; number two, headcount -- your billable headcount available; and number three, is there anything else that's maybe, like, either tech stack or capability or competitive dynamics? I'm just really trying to parse out what's driving the story and what can be improved on your own doing versus macro. Brian Humphries : Yes. Look, it's a good question. I mean I'll start with the 2 bigger ones, Financial Services, which is about 31% of the company. It grew about 1.6 points in constant currency, but that was impacted by the exit of the Samlink business, which was previously disclosed to the tune of 180 basis points to normalize, let's say, 3.4 points of growth. And that's the low industry. We've got a lot of work to do there, as we've cited previously. . There is a slowdown in certain segments there we've touched upon in the prepared remarks, the mortgage segment in particular. I'm also seeing some of the C-suite there talking about, let's say, tightening their belts as they go into the fourth quarter and beyond. So I think that will be a tougher sector for others as well.  But fundamentally, our bigger issue there that we're evolving from, it's not just the folks we have in front of those clients, but also how the clients think of us. We've very often trained them to think of us as a provider of resources. I'm pleased to say that our digital mix in Financial Services is improving, and our staff -- or time and material mix is not improving enough yet. So we have to get that balance right in the period to come. Insurance, we're doing better than banking, and that's obviously in banking area we've got to go fix. In Health Services, we feel very good about our position on a relative basis or a competitive basis in both payer provider as well as life sciences. That's one of our core franchises, I would say, as a company. The business grew about 5.5% in constant currency year-over-year. It's 29% of our business. So it's catching up on Financial Services overall. We've had good momentum in the [indiscernible] business in the last few years. So I feel pretty good about our relative position there.  And then if I talk about the other 2 portions of the business where we have actually historically in the last 2 years, 3 years, been growing double digits, CMT is a good success story of ours. We've had good client acquisition there, good constant currency growth. Products and Resources, I think we have a lot of room to continue to do well there because our penetration of large accounts is lower there than it is as an example in life sciences, or indeed, the payer business where we are heavily penetrated into the major players. So that's kind of how I think about the framework.  The factors we touched upon today, elevated attrition across the industry and Cognizant, within that permeated across all industry segments, and indeed, the U.S. onshore situation permeated across all as well. So nothing specific to either of those. Darrin Peller : All right. Just one quick follow-up on the margin side. It did come in well. And I mean your guidance is relatively unchanged also for margin. So just thinking about that in terms of going forward a little more than just the fourth quarter, it would seem that if wage inflation calms down a bit, you should be able to maintain that level. Is that a fair assumption? Jan Siegmund : The -- well, I have to say and answer in the third quarter, we gave guidance in the fourth quarter. But I did mention that we feel our overall framework -- our multiyear framework is intact, and that didn't refer only to the revenue, but it refers also to our margin expectations. So that's kind of as far as I want to go for today.  We -- when you analyze the results on the margin, I think it's important to consider a number of factors. We have driven the margin expansion by having SG&A control and discipline. So it helped us to drive and leverage that SG&A as the company grew. We had also meaningful support from the depreciation of the rupee in our business.  And then I talked already about the impact that our actions had on gross margin. Gross margin was under pressure, but I think we had a lot of activity that moderated at what could have been a bigger effect on gross margin even.  So you heard me in the third quarter and continue -- and second quarter and now continues in the third quarter, we feel we have a relatively -- we have a good process in place to balance that business out. So our focus is to maintain that discipline, obviously, and then really accelerate revenue growth. That is the main focus that we're driving on because that's our biggest opportunity and use this -- the margin profile as a great foundation for that. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's Q&A portion of the call. Tyler Scott : Great. Thank you all for joining. Look forward to catching up next quarter. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Steve Rohleder, Chair of Cognizant's Board of Directors; Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures or appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Steve. Please go ahead. Steve Rohleder : Thank you, Tyler, and thank you all for joining us today. Given the recent news, I wanted to join the call for this quarter to introduce myself and explain the changes we've recently announced. For those of you that don't know me, I'm Steve Rohleder, and I joined the Board as an Independent Director in March of 2022. Last month, I became Chair of Cognizant's Board of Directors. I previously spent 35 years at Accenture, where I served as Group Chief Executive of Health and Public Services, Chief Executive of North America and Chief Operating Officer. Today, I'd like to briefly discuss our recent CEO transition and the Board changes announced this afternoon supporting our ongoing Board refreshment process. I also want to explain why we're excited for Cognizant's next chapter. Ravi will then introduce himself and share his thoughts before Jan discusses our fourth quarter results in detail. We'll then proceed to Q&A. Regarding our CEO transition, as we announced a few weeks ago, the Board appointed Ravi Kumar to succeed Brian Humphries as CEO. Brian was a resilient leader providing a steady hand as he steered the company through various challenges, including the global pandemic. On behalf of the Board, management and all of our associates, I want to thank Brian for his contributions, which have helped to position Cognizant to capture a large growing market and fuel profitable revenue growth beyond our short-term challenges. We also appreciate that Brian will remain with the company as a special adviser until March to ensure a seamless transition. As part of the Board's strategy to help Cognizant achieve long-term sustainable growth, we also announced today a new Board appointment. Eric Branderiz, a proven financial executive and public company director with demonstrated experience supporting growth in technology and in the energy industries, has been appointed to serve as an Independent Director on the Board. Eric brings significant experience in finance, accounting, M&A execution, risk management and ESG and corporate governance to Cognizant, and we welcome him to the Board. The appointment comes as our Board continues to strive towards optimizing its balance of director skills and tenures as part of its ongoing refreshment program. With Eric's appointment, the Board has appointed five new independent directors over the last four years. Maureen Breakiron-Evans, a member of the Board since 2009, has also advised the Board that she will not stand for reelection at Cognizant's 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. On behalf of the entire Board, we thank her for her more than a decade of astute guidance, exceptional leadership and dedicated service to Cognizant. Given these changes to the Board, our Governance Committee, our committee chairs and myself will perform a comprehensive evaluation of committee composition with an aim toward balancing representation of Board tenure and appropriate key skills and qualifications on our committees. These were topics that I, along with other members of the Board, had the pleasure of discussing with several of our largest investors during our annual governance road show in the fourth quarter. Now before I turn the call over to Ravi, let me share a little bit about our enthusiasm for his leadership. Over the past few years, Cognizant has navigated a dynamic uncertain market while strengthening its operational and financial fundamentals. Heading into 2023, the Board believes that Cognizant has established a solid operational foundation and now needs to move toward accelerating growth. This agenda requires a focused growth mindset driven from the C-Suite. Ravi has this mindset. He brings a passion for building teams and driving growth in our industry, and we're confident that he is the right leader to take Cognizant into our next phase with a goal of ultimately delivering significant returns to our shareholders. Ravi also brings to Cognizant best-in-class operations, transformation and leadership expertise at a global scale from a stellar 20-year track record of emphasis. During his tenure, he oversaw the company's global services organization and drove growth across its global industry segments. Ravi is a proven strategist who secured significant IT services deals. He led international business operations in India, Latin America, Japan and China, and he pioneered the creation of digital talent pools in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Importantly, during his time at Infosys, Ravi earned a reputation as a people-focused leader with a deep rooted commitment to teams and associates. Since he joined us a few weeks ago, Ravi has proven out this reputation as Cognizant associates have warmly welcomed into the team and are deeply enthusiastic about his leadership. We're confident that Ravi will help us further our efforts to support engagement and trust internally and drive retention amongst our high-performing leaders and associates. As we look forward under Ravi's leadership, Cognizant will have a sharp focus on two key priorities. First, we'll be focused on meaningful acceleration of revenue growth. Our second key priority will be ensuring that Cognizant is the employer of choice in our industry. Ravi is the right leader to achieve this vision, and the Board looks forward to partnering with him. I'll now turn the call over to Ravi to introduce himself and to share some additional perspective. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Steve, for that very warm introduction. Good afternoon, everyone. My appointment as CEO is one of the proudest moments of my life. I'm excited as well as humbled by this opportunity to lead Cognizant, a company I've long admired, closely watched and competed against. As I've experienced, Cognizant has a diverse, highly skilled and a fully engaged Board. I'm grateful for the Board's trust and support and for their efforts to lay the groundwork for me and the company to flourish. I'm also very grateful to my predecessor, Brian Humphries, who led the evolution of Cognizant's business. He refreshed and broadened the strategy, extended the company's portfolio and drove the implementation of more rigorous systems and processes. With a very strong foundation in place, I'm not going back to the drawing board. Instead, I plan to move forward by building on and refining what already exists, which will include calibrating a thinking to a growth mindset. I want to see us offer the full breadth of our industry-specific solutions, whether developed organically or acquired through targeted acquisitions to a large installed base of clients and investor growth. A few days after my appointment, I participated in Cognizant's annual sales kickoff, which was held in Abu Dhabi. At the summit, 1,000 of our client-facing associates came together from around the world to take stock of all of what we have and what we need to accelerate growth. I was so deeply moved by the warmth and the enthusiasm I was greeted with. We set ourselves a goal to be an employer of choice, which we believe will be a pivot for growth. I plan to spend the next several months meeting with so many associates, clients, partners and shareholders as much as I can. I will listen carefully with an open mind, build trust and learn all I can about how best to unlock more value for clients, make progress in accelerating top line growth and drive long-term shareholder value. Because I like to be highly visible with clients and associates, my plan is to meet with 100 clients over 100 days whether in person or virtually and to visit with as many of our global teams as I can. Later this quarter, I'm spending several weeks in India and visiting associates at many of our locations across the country. Having joined Cognizant just three weeks ago, I'm early in my learning curve and need time to get my hands on the pulse of the business. That said, I \u2013 while already identified several areas that are tied to operating with a growth mindset to focus on immediately. Today, I will look to talk about three of those important areas : first, making Cognizant an employer of choice in its industry; second, strengthening our ability to win large deals; and third, enhancing our operating discipline. A quick word on each starting with employer of choice. Spent time in the IT services industry, and you quickly realize that sustained success hinges on the quality, dedication and scale of our talent. The value we create for clients comes from the knowledge of the skills of our associates. Because the client experience and the employee experience are so tightly linked, we have the opportunity to create a self-reinforcing cycle. Highly engaged client \u2013 talent with a passion for clients and a growth mindset attract the best clients. These clients in turn, attract more of the best people, keeping the flywheel turning faster. That's why one of our goals and one of my specific important roles as the CEO is creating conditions for all our associates to excel. I'm committed to investing heavily in providing associates with continuous learning, upscaling and leadership development, all aimed at increasing the professional relevance. I believe the number one factor that will define success for Cognizant is to become the employer of choice in our industry. Everything else must be based on that foundation, especially the ability to consistently deliver industry-leading growth, which is the absolute focus of the entire management team.  Let's turn to large deals, which are another top priority given how essential they are to building commercial momentum and enhancing our station as a provider of business outcomes aligned by industry. Accelerating large deal bookings that will align with our risk appetite requires the client centricity and competitive self-confidence to work the corridors of our clients, cultivating and mining existing relationships, while hunting for new ones and always showing up with an informed point of view. Over the last year or so, Cognizant business has advanced its solutioning capabilities along with its project and program management processes. We have become better equipped to solution and manage large deals and have planned to build on this foundation to reenergize our efforts. In particular, I want to instill a greater sense of pride and empowerment among our client partners and delivery teams to encourage a faster, more agile response to client needs. I have a weekly standing meeting during which I review 10 large deals and do everything I can to help our teams to drive these deals over the finish line. Last week, we were pleased to announce the signing of a 10-year $1 billion renewal contract with a long-standing client, CoreLogic, demonstrating our capabilities and the confidence our clients place in us. The third area of focus is ensuring operational excellence across the company, including our approach to large deals and fulfillment in general. We are building out an organizational structure designed to bring together a continuum of activities such as industrialized delivery with high productivity rates, market competitive cost takeout initiatives, contract life cycle and risk management, consortium led deals and more. As one Cognizant team, we are also working on internal simplification as a team. We will carry forward to help achieve the company's full potential. With the market for tech talent showing some early signs of improvement, we are working to optimize fulfillment of existing engagements, unleash our entrepreneur spirit and rejuvenate the growth mindset. Switching gears for a moment, I would like to offer a few perspectives. On the long-term demand environment for technology services I believe we are in a golden era of technology and that software is the new alchemy for every business and industry. As the world prepares for a post-pandemic reset of the way we work and live our lives, we see more organizations accelerating their embrace of digital technologies. Industry is at lower levels of digital maturity like health care, life sciences and manufacturing are stepping up their tech intensity. While those that are more digitally mature like financial services, retail and communications are staying invested in digitizing the landscapes. We also interestingly see workplaces rapidly adapt digital technologies as employees get comfortable with continuously toggling between hybrid and physical workplaces. In an era of globalization that has spanned several decades, enterprises have turned to tech services companies to enable their businesses to scale and globalize. Today, every industry is a tech industry. Technology will be deeply embedded in the core of every business, every product and every service. Therefore, the use of deep software engineering capabilities to transform the core of businesses will be a big player for tech services firms like Cognizant. So too will be the market opportunity that comes from born-digital companies that outsource the technology core and operations. The cloud, needless to say, will continue to remain the biggest general purpose technology we have seen in decades, and be deeply embedded as a digital pillar in every business. Cloud migration, modernization, application services will continue to create significant market momentum. Growth will also be driven by new cloud services like data on the cloud, data exchanges, new SaaS services and cloud security services. Clients are aware of our deep alliances with the hyperscalers and new best-in-class SaaS companies as well as our ability to co-innovate with these partners. We truly believe clients will continue to turn to us to help orchestrate those cloud capabilities. The shift to the cloud and 5G have also accelerated IoT adoption as use cases grow with better connectivity and proliferating devices and that's core. Last week, we further bolstered our IoT embedded software engineering capabilities with our agreement to acquire Mobica, an IoT software engineering provider. Mobica also strengthens our near-shoring capabilities in Eastern Europe, which is home to nearly 8,000 of our associates. We see a strong push now to bring AI into business landscape with the expectation that AI will reengineer enterprises as completely as enterprise software did three decades ago. Of course, as clients navigate a challenging macro environment now, they need to fund their investments in digital transformation by executing cost and efficiency agendas. These same clients are now asking how we can help them achieve their cost reduction ambitions and underwrite savings for their digital initiatives. Given our broad capabilities, we can help clients, whether they need to drive efficiency gains, innovation or an end-to-end transformation of the business. I quickly want to turn for a moment to India, home to about three quarters of Cognizant's workforce. India is likely to be the world's technology talent hub for the next decade. India's population has a demographic profile and digital talent pool unmatched by any other country. And NASSCOM forecasts some two million IT professionals will be added to India's talent pool over the next three years. We'll continue to capitalize on this surge in the IT talent in India as we intensify efforts to recruit from India's Tier 2 cities as well. Our large associate base in India is an ongoing source of strength and differentiation for Cognizant and one in which we will continue to invest. As confident as I am in Cognizant's prospects, I'm fully aware, as we have signaled with our guidance for Q1, for quarter one, that we have a great deal of work ahead of us. It will take time to rebuild the pipeline and go after larger opportunities. Please know we put a lot of thought into our decision to hold off on providing full year guidance. But before making commitments I can stand behind, I really need to spend more time digging into the business and talking to associates and clients. Keep in mind that we are building on a strong foundation. We have a long-standing client relationships, a broad portfolio of industry-specific solutions, a robust and resilient global delivery network, a significant opportunity for international expansion and most important, a reenergized and highly motivated team. I intend to catalyze Cognizant's heritage culture of bold ambitions, our entrepreneur spirit that emphasizes being fast, agile and adaptable and of course, our camaraderie and teamwork. I'm super energized to lead Cognizant into the next era of growth, and I'll put everything I have into making this happen. As I've shared with all our associates, our mantra right now is to bring back growth and be the employer of choice. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the financial details of the quarter before we take over questions. Jan, over to you. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Ravi. And good evening, everyone. Fourth quarter and full year 2022 revenue were above the high end of the guidance range we provided on our third quarter earnings call in November and in line with the revised expectations we provided on January 12. Operating margin was negatively impacted by the previously disclosed noncash charge in the quarter, which I will cover in more detail later. [Indiscernible] of this charge, we were pleased with the continued progress towards our operating margin goals driven by commercial discipline, the depreciation of the Indian rupee and SG&A leverage. During the quarter, we made progress improving fulfillment, driven in part by a meaningful reduction in voluntary attrition, which declined to 19% on a quarterly annualized basis from 29% last quarter. This has allowed us to further decrease subcontracted usage and will enable us to put greater focus on driving improved commercial momentum in the quarters ahead. That said, the macro environment remains uncertain, and we continue to see pockets of weakness across several key verticals. Now moving on to the details for the quarter, fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 1.3% year-over-year or 4.1% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 40 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed at the beginning of 2022. Full year 2022 revenue was $19.4 billion, representing an increase of 5% year-over-year or 7.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 100 basis points of growth from acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. In Q4, digital revenue grew 4% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. This resulted in full year 2022 digital revenue growth of 11% or 13% in constant currency. Digital mix was unchanged from last quarter at 51%, up two points from the prior year period. Q4 bookings increased 12% year-over-year, including the large agreement with CoreLogic that we announced last week. This opportunity is primarily a renewal of existing work with some modest increase in scope during the latter years of the contract. For the full year, we recorded bookings of $24.1 billion and a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 times, unchanged from the trailing 12-month book-to-bill we reported last quarter. Outside the large renewal, bookings momentum remains muted exiting this year. This has put pressure on our Q1 outlook, which I will cover shortly. Moving on now to segment results in the fourth quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 1% reflecting a negative impact of 180 basis points related to the previously disclosed sale of our Samlink subsidiary. This was partially offset by growth among public sector clients in the UK and insurance clients. The revenue weakness is being driven by our banking and financial services practice, which we expect will remain under pressure for the next several quarters. Ravi, the entire team and I are laser-focused on reevaluating our go-to-market strategy, enhancing the strength of this portfolio and have initiated a series of actions, including certain leadership changes, that we believe will give us the best opportunity to improve our performance. We are seeing early signs of success with select global banking relationships where we have successfully shifted our portfolio mix towards higher growth in strategic areas. This gives us confidence that we are moving in the right direction. However, more meaningful improvements will take time to implement. Health Services revenue grew 5%, consistent with last quarter. We experienced similar growth among both Healthcare and Life Sciences clients, which partially reflects some normalization of demand that had been driven by COVID. As we discussed last quarter, we have seen some pockets of softness within the segment, driven by the macro environment and regulatory complexity. Despite these challenges, we continue to review our Health Sciences capability as industry-leading and remain excited about the growth opportunities over the medium term. Products and Resources revenue grew 7%, a modest deceleration from last quarter. Revenue was negatively impacted by slower growth among manufacturing, retail and consumer goods customers, which we believe primarily, reflected the softening of the macro environment. This was offset by continued strength among consumer goods, automotive, logistics and utility customers. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 9%. Growth again was led by our technology business, where our work with digital-native clients has driven growth in our core portfolio. Our growth has moderated somewhat as growth among some of our largest clients have slowed, but remains positive. We are closely monitoring trends and developments affecting the tech industry. Continuing with year-over-year growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q4. North American revenue grew 3%. Growth was led by CMT and Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 8%. It also included a negative 220 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was again led by the UK, which grew 16% and included double-digit growth in Financial Services including public sector clients. Now moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 14.2% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, both GAAP and adjusted operating margins declined by 110 basis points. This includes the previously disclosed negative 120 basis point impact from a noncash impairment of capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with a Health Sciences customer. Our operating margin benefited from SG&A leverage, while gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs was partially offset by delivery efficiencies and disciplined pricing. We also experienced a meaningful tailwind from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, which represented an approximate 110 basis point benefit net of hedges year-over-year. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 27%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%. Q4 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.02 and Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.01, down 7% and 8%, respectively. GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were each negatively impacted by $0.08 in connection with the impairment of capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with the Health Sciences customer. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.5 billion or net cash of $1.9 billion. DSO of 74 days was flat sequentially and increased by five days year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q4 was $612 million, representing approximately 115% of net income. This brings full year free cash flow to $2.2 billion, representing approximately 100% of net income, in line with our expectations. We are pleased with our performance in 2022. However, a change in U.S. tax law that became effective last year now requires companies to capitalize rather than currently deduct R&D expenses. As a result, like many other companies, this will impact our free cash flow in 2023. We expect capitalization of R&D costs for tax purposes to negatively impact free cash flow by $600 million, which includes deferred payments for the 2022 tax year as well as increased payments for 2023. With this change, we expect our cash conversion ratio to be below our target of 100% of net income in 2023. Moving on to capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $139 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to $2 billion for the full year. In the quarter, we also completed two acquisitions : Austin CSI and Utegration for a total purchase price of approximately $370 million. In addition, we announced the acquisitions of Mobica and the professional services and management practices of OneSource Virtual. These acquisitions are expected to improve our digital revenue mix, enhance our consulting capabilities. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. Over the longer term, we continue to expect to deploy a balanced capital allocation policy, returning to an aggregate of approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in form of dividends and share repurchases and allocating the remaining 50% to inorganic investments. Turning to our forward outlook. As Ravi mentioned, and you will see in our earnings materials, we are only providing revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2023. Given our bookings momentum in 2022 and the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we expect our full year 2023 performance to be below the multiyear goals we provided in late 2021. We intend to provide an update on the full year 2023 expectations for revenue and adjusted operating margin next quarter. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.71 billion to $4.76 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of minus 2.5% to minus 1.5% or a decline of minus 1% to flat in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 150 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. We look forward to sharing more as Ravi continues to get up to speed. As he discussed, we remain very excited about the medium-term market opportunity. We also believe that while the current macroeconomic uncertainty has led to some pockets of slowdown, it also presents an opportunity for Cognizant to help our clients operate more efficiently while continuing to invest in new digital capabilities. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you and congratulations and welcome Ravi and Steve as well, congratulations to you. It\u2019s good to reconnect. I think my first question is growth mindset, I get that, what are some of the explicit steps you might need to take incrementally to return to that growth mindset, if you can speak to your early view on what\u2019s needed for sales investments, capability investments, just the G&A investment to chase large contract, things like that? Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Ashwin, for that question. Good to connect with you. Having spent a significant time in this industry. I would say to build a growth mindset. There are a number of things we need to do. But I would probably highlight three of them as I talked to today, the most important priorities. First and foremost, Cognizant has to be an employer of choice in this industry. What I mean by that is spending time in the IT industry, IT service industry, what I mean by that is, you create a self-reinforcing cycle with employees and clients. Sustained success is based on quality, dedication and scale of the talent, but client experience and employee experience are so tightly linked. We have the opportunity to build a self-reinforcing cycle with engaged talent with a passion for clients and the growth mindset, which attracts the best clients. So that whole flywheel has to be self-reinforcing. It means a lot of things, all the way from retention to upscaling to leadership development to infusing the project and program leaders. Remember, we are a company of projects and programs, which essentially means as they walk the corridors, they mine our clients, these project leaders. And equally, they talk to our associates every day. So that is a starting point of where you try to build a trust with that player and continue to create that self-reinforcing virtual [ph] cycle does they call it. I think you talked about large deals. I think large deals has investments on both sides, investments on dealmakers, deal influencers, ability to create that momentum by supporting our client initiatives in various transformational initiatives of theirs. But equally, at the back end, you have to start to work on solutioning capabilities and the ability to build a continuum all the way from addressing cost takeout initiatives to manage services initiatives to large deals will come with people take over opportunities. And of course, productivity improvements. So there\u2019s a lot of tooling and infrastructure. I think Cognizant already has some of it, you have to build on it, and then go behind this opportunity. It\u2019s equally important that we build operational discipline, which also helps us to create the growth mindset all the way from fulfilling those deals to building market competitiveness on cost takeout initiatives to contract life cycle and risk management to consortium like deals and partnerships and a whole bunch of things. Well, do we have all of this in place? Yes. I think a lot of these things have already been set and I would say in the last few years at Cognizant. I have to orient this to a growth mindset and start to double down on the opportunities, which are there in the market. In the short run, some of this will mean additional investments, but in the medium to long run, you have to create that pool of investments inside by taking out costs so that you can then sustain that momentum for the future. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Thank you for the obvious thought you put into that answer. The second question is on the health care contract that was a problem in the quarter. Any granularity on sort of separating out the top and bottom line impact? And is it link-fenced now? In other words, at least the margin impact taking into account entirely in 4Q? Or is there a forward-looking impact? What\u2019s the forward-looking revenue impact as well? Jan Siegmund : Yes. Maybe I'll take this. The Health Sciences clients that we have is a volume-based contract-based on the performance of that healthcare client. And so as the outlook of our client has changed, we had to adjust our revenue expectations going forward, which led then to a charge that we had to take for the expected lower volumes of incoming business to us in essence. And so the revenue impact is really going to be baked into our natural revenue guidance and forecast. So the charge that we have been taking is a discrete charge of $60 million. And that is a non-cash charge of prior capitalized implementation costs that we are now taken out of the contract. So future volume changes of this client could impact our calculation on these capitalized implementation costs as well. So there's still outlook. We obviously work very hard with our clients to drive great revenue growth as our interest and the clients' interest, but there is still a possibility of depending on the revenue development and the market performance of the client that we could be impacted in the future as well. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey thanks so much guys. Steve, nice to hear from you upfront. It's been a while. So I want to ask similar to Ashwin to Ravi here, just the goal of being the employer of choice and having a growth mindset makes a lot of sense. How long do you think it would take for \u2013 to change the culture to get to that level? I'm imagining it can't be a quick fix, but maybe you feel differently? Ravi Kumar : Yes, that's a good question. I'm just three weeks into the job, so I'm continuing to assess what we have, what we need to do. It's a virtuous self-reinforcing cycle. As I said, as much as it looks easy, it's \u2013 if you're on it it's easy, if you're not on it it's not. I'm going to be on a listening tour for the next few weeks and months, meeting clients, meeting associates, meeting partners and I'll come back with assessment. I think we have built enough both on client and employee infrastructure \u2013 organizational infrastructure. Now I have to refine it and reset it for growth; that's how I see it. I want to build on it. We're not going to go back to the drawing board. We want to build on what we have and refine it, and as we refine it, we'll make some changes and get there. With related to employees, a lot of our \u2013 two-thirds of our employees work out of India. So India is an integral part of our strategy to differentiate and I'm going to spend the next few weeks in India as well, later part of February. And I'm meeting 100 clients in 100 days, and this is a goal which I've set for my own self, so that you get to know the pulse, you get stay focused on large deals. In fact, I'm doing a monitoring of 10 large deals every week, and we are continuing to keep the focus on commercial momentum. So it's in flight transformation, as I call it. We'll continue to do this, but we will continue to look for the medium- to long-term sustained momentum, how you create it. That's how I see it. It's still a question I will probably like to answer once I spend a few more weeks going through the listening part. Jan Siegmund : Maybe I'll give Ravi also a tiny breather here and talk about the improved attrition, which is certainly one. First step into the right direction of becoming a more attractive employer and seeing it reflected. So clearly the dynamic in the labor markets have shifted also, but we also believe that the investments that we have made not only in regular and competitive merit cycles. You may remember we announced in the last quarter that we had accelerated our \u2013 this year's merit cycle to the second quarter, which is also important for the modeling of you guys into the second quarter. And that we have made huge progress on internal promotions, career pathing and learning and development and education, et cetera, as we have increased the number of our college graduates into our permit. So I think we have seen now a year of this permit from a nuts and bolts piece to stabilize, and we were very pleased with this relatively steep drop in nutrition in just one quarter. So we feel we are off to a good start here and then I think Ravi is focus on management, on enthusiasm, on growth and aligning will help. And then we'll kind of continue to refine those investments as we \u2013 as we need it. But I think we have already ended the year actually on that side with a big step forward. Ravi Kumar : And also the talent supply chain, we've been able to streamline it, strengthen it, and be ready for fulfillment and opportunities, which our clients are looking forward to. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. Then if it's okay, if I can ask my follow-up then with \u2013 given that 10-point drop in attrition and you've still hired a little bit, the utilization rates did drop. So from a modeling perspective, not to bore people, but anything to guide us to in the short-term on some of those KPIs because they are moving quite a bit here? Jan Siegmund : We're obviously on this utilization metric also a very detailed answer. In this quarter, the slight decrease in utilization is actually more driven by the relative higher percentage of Gen Z hires into our pyramid, which are not as utilized in the young age and actually a return to normalized location taking compared to the COVID years of where we had abnormally low vacation period. So those were the biggest factors. So I wouldn't model too much into the utilization. Obviously, we need to drive growth and as we now have better fulfillment opportunities. But in this quarter, actually, some of the utilization, both were the 2 biggest factors, Tien-Tsin. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. Perfect. Thank you Jan and Ravi. Appreciate that and look forward to get to the updates and safe and healthy travels. Thanks. Ravi Kumar : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. James Faucette : Great. Thank you so much. I want to follow-up a little bit on Tien-Tsin's question as well as Jan and Ravi's comment is. If we look at Ravi, your initial stages of evaluating and listening to customers and what you're seeing in the business? And if I put that together with Jan's comments around investment that seems to be helping in attrition, et cetera. I'm wondering if the two of you can give some perspective on if there's anything that stands out right now as maybe points or places where there could have been under investment that you'd like to direct resources, and how does that impact the way that you're thinking about \u2013 you and the Board are thinking about the right objectives from a cost and profitability standpoint? Jan Siegmund : Ravi will chime in after I give you a more technical thing. I think as we mostly developing these plans, so we're clearly not at the end of the job, otherwise, we would give guidance today. But when you think large deals and calculate [indiscernible] of volume, I think deal characteristics of large deals have impact us on to our margin profile. And when we think about that, we need to build kind of our culture to leverage the relative margin strength if you exclude our health care charge and our pricing discipline and our delivery discipline, so that it allows us to be competitive for these larger deals that may cause dilution initially and then ramp up their full margin potential. James Faucette : So I think the biggest impact practically would be to figure out for us, assuming the success in our large deal focus of what that would mean for the overall P&L structure. I think that's going to be the biggest one. There's going to be other investments that Ravi is going is going to be proposing, but I think we're going to be managing those a little bit more within the framework of an SG&A volume that we have already not to take that away from you, Ravi, but I think... Ravi Kumar : Jan, I think you've covered it so nicely. The one thing I would probably add is, I think in the last one to two years, Cognizant has invested heavily on organizational infrastructure to take large deals on a continuum, all the way from managed services to transaction-based pricing to cost takeout initiatives to digital transformation on that continuum. Now is the time to leverage those investments and take those large deals and be competitive on those large deals. So in a way, I would say a large part of it is done. We have now strengthened it, and we have oriented to the market for the opportunity, which is going to be presented to us. So that's broadly how I see it. As I keep saying, it isn't going back to the drawing board, but I'm going to build on what we have. We're going to refine it. As we refine it, we have to make some changes. We're going to make those changes, but we'll be agile enough in the market to seize the opportunities we have. James Faucette : Appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, Ravi, how are you thinking about and what's your perception of the current economic environment? Obviously, as you go to listen and engage with customers, et cetera. It seems like a big part of the challenge for you will be to parse out feedback that is specific to Cognizant and has impact on how you should move the business going forward on a sustained basis versus maybe some things that are happening near-term. So just wanted to hear how you're thinking about the current economic environment and the lens that you're looking at, at some of these comments or listening to these \u2013 some of these comments through? Ravi Kumar : Yes. That's a good question, and I'm going to leave it to Jan as well to chime in. Over the years, IT Services has gone from a homogeneous landscape to a heterogeneous landscape, they're different swim lanes. In an uncertain economic environment, if you're going to see discrete study spend being a little softer. Large digital transformation engagements will start to become moderate in nature. But equally, you're going to see cost takeout initiatives, vendor consolidation initiatives happening on the other hand, I would say that's a different swim lane. But enterprises are continuing to invest because not only are they investing on the consumer side of digital. We're also investing on the employee side of digital because employees today are interacting with their organizations on a digital platform because of the hybridness of how work and what places are.  So I would say it's a duality of sorts. On one side, you would see softness. On the other side, you would see cost takeout and vendor consolidation kind of happening. Depending on the industry you look for, there are industries which have lesser tech and digital intensity and the industries which have higher tech and digital intensity. And some of them are using the digital platform to transform and deliver.  In fact, I would say, digital technologies is almost like a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. So some of our clients are using digital technologies to do so. So it's a mixed bag. It's \u2013 because of the heterogeneity, I would say it's a mixed bag; each swim lane has its own characteristics. Jan, do you want to chime in? Jan Siegmund : Yes. Like I'll give you a little bit more background maybe about our bookings performance and what \u2013 where we have seen the softness and geographically and by digital. We actually did have a relatively solid bookings growth in digital this last year, and I'm giving you full year numbers. It's about I'm doing to 16%,18% or something growth in the digital bookings world. And then we saw actually the weakness by sector really concentrated, as you would expect in our Financial Services Group, where we saw the biggest decline in bookings volume for us.  And as Ravi illustrated in his comments, it's kind of almost in every industry where we're trying to sort out, are we having some industries stronger and others, but we do have success stories by industry sector, and we have declines in industry. So it seems to be a little bit client specific of what we need to watch out. You have talked obviously, now looking forward; we entered the year with one of our largest pipelines ever, basically. And now a lot of work, which is for Ravi and the market teams to achieve, is to convert that pipeline into qualifications and into bookings numbers. So there seems to be a lot of opportunity still out in the thing. Obviously, the mix of that business is shifting a little bit. We hope we want to drive a higher participation and higher bookings number for larger deals, which we haven't had in the past, and that's the true revenue \u2013 incremental revenue opportunity that we're aiming to capture.  And but there is still a very solid market out there. Even though the demand on a sequential basis has gotten a little bit softer, if that makes some sense. So we're going to be laser focused, obviously on converting this opportunity into bookings and then to revenues. But the underlying market remains attractive from my perspective. James Faucette : That's great. Thanks for the color of Ravi and Jan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. David Togut : Thanks so much. Congratulations, Ravi and Steve, it's really good to hear your voice again. Could you, Jan, give us some guardrails around gross margins in 2023? Not looking for anything precise, but maybe just help us think through some of the headwinds and tailwinds. You had a number of wage increases in 2022. Obviously, attrition coming down helps a little bit, but could you help us think about, what the gross margin range might be this year? Jan Siegmund : Well, that I cannot do. But I think I can give you a few, David. Good to hear your words as well. And I give you a few pointers that I think are kind of important for the modeling that we had prior disclosed. So the usual merit increase that puts negative pressure on our gross margin in the fourth quarter will now occur in the second quarter. So that will disturb a little bit our pattern of regular margin development throughout the year. If anything, I think, that second and third quarter traditionally our strongest margin patterns, and then we have the fourth quarter due to the marathon this will shift a little bit. But other than that, we are not really thinking that the general dynamic of our pattern of the year is going to shift in a very meaningful way. So I think it's like even our past performance, there's no guarantee for future performance. But like when I think about our year, I think that the principal dynamics remain unchanged. We have seen \u2013 maybe at this one point I'm getting into 12 years I look at Tyler, but we have seen actually moderate to good success with our pricing initiatives.  And so the contribution of our pricing initiative to gross margin in the fourth quarter was the highest. So we have really built quarter-after-quarter momentum, and it was 50% higher than all other quarters together. And so we're entering with a little bit of pricing momentum, and then we have \u2013 that's going to be partially offset or offset by our wage increases in the second quarter. And then, as you said, coming up with some sort of metric, which of how attrition is going to help us in revenue or fulfillment and some efficiencies is going to be then for the modeling.  That's what we also undergo right now, David. So I really don't have those numbers yet for you, and we're planning to do the update in the second quarter then. David Togut : Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jason Kupferberg : Hey guys thanks for taking my call. Congrats to Steve and Ravi. Ravi, maybe just to start with you. I know you obviously need time to study the organization, develop your plan. But just at a high level, is your initial sense that Cognizant has more room to improve in terms of strategy or in terms of execution? Ravi Kumar : I think it's how I will see it. And of course, I need more time to assess, as I said, it's listening to with both clients and my associates. But the way I see it is the opportunity ahead of us. I think we have an extraordinary set of client relationships, extraordinary talent pool. Looking from outside, I've always been impressed by the entrepreneurs spirit, the bold ambitions and some very good teamwork at Cognizant.  The one trend I've always been excited about at Cognizant is the confluence of industry vertical experience with technology expertise, a very unique spot. It's a very, very unique spot. So I could almost see this as a way forward strength and look for opportunities, which will fit the bill. And I do believe that we have been necessary organizational infrastructure to attract employees, retail employees, attract clients, retail clients and also win large deals. That is how I see it. The opportunity in front of us is what I'm kind of configuring and calibrating the firm to instead of actually looking back and looking forward and trying to gear up for that opportunity with what we have and what we need to build. So that's broadly what I can say. How I'm actually trying to approach my way forward direction. Jason Kupferberg : Very helpful. And just as a follow-up, this might be more for Jan. But how close are we do you think to fully remediating the fulfillment issues? And then just any at least directional commentary you can give us on first quarter operating margins? Thanks guys. Jan Siegmund : Yes. The fulfillment in the fourth quarter really improved very meaningfully. And it gives us part, I think, is part of the optimism we have that we can go to clients and fulfill their needs, which as we have talked in the third and fourth quarter. In the third quarter was hampered at times by our resource constraints. So I think the improvement in fulfillment will translate into accelerated and enhanced sales activity. That's at least part of our thesis that we have. And it should obviously lower our need for recruiting and have efficiencies and the support for all of this will make clients happier and so forth.  So the underlying engine running a smoother is really a shift compared to where we were throughout last fiscal year. So I think that's really \u2013 that gives us hope and gives us optimism for it. Yes, we're not giving a first quarter margins, unfortunately, so I can't help you with any direction there. Ravi Kumar : Yes. So just to add to what Jan said, I think my initial few weeks, one of the observations is I think our talent supply chain is grinding well or it's kind of moving very, very well. Some of the clients I've spoken to in the last few weeks have started to tell us that we can start to get some of the demand moved to Cognizant with the fulfillment starting to look good. So I'm actually very excited about the progress we've made on fulfillment. I think we are ready to take more, and we're ready to continuously sharpen the talent supply chain for the opportunity with our clients. Our clients are starting to see that traction with us. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks for the comments. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Tyler Scott : Great. Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to catching up with you in a couple of months on our first quarter earnings call. Jan Siegmund : Thank you. Steve Rohleder : Thank you. Ravi Kumar : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company\u2019s first quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today\u2019s call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke to you early February, I was just 3 weeks into my role. I explained my plan to move rapidly up the learning curve by embarking on a global listening and learning tour with associates, clients and partners. I also mentioned that I would meet with more than 100 clients and as many of our associates as possible. In addition, I outlined three interrelated priorities : making Cognizant an employer of choice in its industry; accelerate revenue growth, especially by winning large deals; and enhancing our operational discipline. I will comment on progress of each of these areas, but first, I want to cover a few of the quarter\u2019s financial and operational highlights. In quarter one, we delivered revenue of $4.8 billion, a decline of 0.3% year-over-year as reported, but a growth of 1.5% in constant currency, above the high-end of our guidance range. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.6%. We recorded strong quarterly bookings growth of 28% year-over-year and ended quarter one with record trailing 12 months bookings of $25.6 billion in the trailing 12 months book-to-bill of 1.3x. Approximately, 30% of our in-quarter or quarter one bookings were large deals, which we define as total contract value of about $50 million compared to approximately 20% for all of 2022. We were very pleased with our first quarter bookings performance as well as the build in our pipeline, which includes a strong mix of large new opportunities. I am especially pleased to see the continuing reduction in our attrition with trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our technology services business declining to 23%, down 3% points sequentially and 7 points Y-on-Y year-on-year. While Jan will cover our financial performance at the business segment level, given the importance of financial services on our momentum, I want to comment on the state of this business and the emerging opportunities we see in this segment. For starters, we believe our company-specific operational challenges in financial services have largely subsided and we are beginning to stabilize the business. Our client portfolio has shown resilience, both in U.S. and internationally, but we are also seeing the impact from softer discretionary spending and decision delays by existing and potential clients. In the U.S., our banking clients are generally large institutions, and we have seen an uptick in our deal pipeline. Overall, we have seen early green shoots that we are moving this portfolio in the right direction while navigating the macro dynamics. We are encouraged by leading indicators such as strong Q1 global bookings growth for financial services at a rate above the company average as well as an uptick in our large deal pipeline. I am particularly encouraged by my conversations with about two dozen of our financial services clients. I came away from these meetings with many new opportunities to pursue related to cost takeout, vendor consolidation, post-merger integration and a new wave of outsourcing in fintechs. Having said that, we still have a lot of work ahead, and we will be closely monitoring the environment to anticipate shifts in our clients\u2019 needs. To-date, I have met either in person or virtually with C-suite executors from more than 100 of our clients representing nearly all of our industry segments and all of our major geographies. Several teams have surfaced from these candid conversations. We have a strong goodwill with our clients and continue to recognize a culture of client centricity. This way, we are easy to work with, attentive to nurturing our client relationships and deeply understand their businesses. They like our entrepreneurial approach to developing solutions to their challenges. They also appreciate our humility, our willingness to learn, listen and adapt. I believe the longevity and depth of our relationships have created a lot of accumulated trust. By the way, none of our clients I spoke to mentioned about Cognizant\u2019s digital mix. I believe that\u2019s because digital and non-digital capabilities have converged to the point where the distinction between the two is less significant. Instead, the differentiator many clients have spoken about is how well positioned Cognizant is that the confluence of technology and industry domains. Given that our digital mix is no longer a true measure of the value we are providing to clients, we have decided to stop disclosing this metric. With that said, clients want more from us. They trust us with their agenda, strategies and competitive challenges. They tell me Cognizant has earned the right to challenge their thinking and be a strategic partner who co-create solutions with them and offers insights on improving their operations. Overall, I came away with the sense that many clients are fans of our company. What also surfaced is that most clients are grappling with largely similar challenges, although with variations by industry. The cost basis reflect the higher growth levels seen during the pandemic era, prompting an intensified focus on optimizing cost and efficiency and building greater resilience. They need to digitize workflows, enhance their customer and employee experiences and boost the efficiency of their commercial and operational teams. In that context, I thought it would be useful to mention a few recent client wins that underscore the strategic cloud-focused work we do for clients and a skill-as-a-systems integrator. We are partnering with Microsoft to build an integration roadmap between our TriZetto health products and the cloud for healthcare. Our shared aim is to give payers and providers easy access to cutting-edge technology solutions, streamlined claims management and improved interoperability to deliver better patient and member experiences. In a new win, we are working with Boehringer Ingelheim to speed the development and improve the accuracy of their life-saving therapies. We help our clients unify medicinal development processes and data into unified cloud platform and enhance the collaboration across clinical, regulatory and quality functions. We\u2019ve been engaged by works within Group Ireland to reengineer its siloed contact center platform into omnichannel customer service landscape that will deliver more personalized agent and customer experiences using Salesforce Cloud and Amazon Connect. And last week, we announced a new 5-year agreement to transform and support the global technology operations of a long-term client, Nike. We will help drive customer, employee and partner experiences from Nike by leveraging hyper-automation, AI and processing reengineering. These are just a few examples. In short, our capabilities are in demand as clients navigate an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Let\u2019s turn to the company\u2019s three focus areas of growth enablers and the progress we are beginning to make. The first of these is to become an employer of choice. We recognize this as a multiyear undertaking. To take the pulse of employee sentiment, I\u2019ve been using every communication channel available to get unfiltered feedback from tens of thousands of associates to learn what\u2019s what needs to improve. As a part of my immersion, I spent 2 weeks in India visiting a half a dozen cities where we have major facilities, along with traveling to see associates in the UK, Switzerland, Canada and across the U.S. I\u2019ve been moved by our associates warmth, enthusiasm and energy, and what I am hearing from them is very encouraging. In this post-pandemic era, we are back to walking the corridors for clients, mining relationships and building new ones, and we\u2019re revitalizing our ability to land and expand within existing clients as we steadily bring on new accounts. Across the organization, I see a rising pride in the company. Associates at all levels of our company want to partner with me to begin writing the next chapter in Cognizant\u2019s nearly 30-year history and are moving forward with renewed confidence about the future. To be an employer of choice, we need to meet the demands of a diverse workforce that spans geographies, generation and the range of work and life priorities. Here are a few of our approaches. We have made career progression easier by expanding our internal job board process and redesigning the promotion process to increase more movement across our organization. We have intensified our focus on continuous upscaling and learning by expanding a learning library, running internal learning and development campaigns and launching a new leadership training initiative for people at all levels. We have had three merit increases in 18 months for the majority of our associates who are in the levels up to associate director. And over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve invested significantly more in compensation. In addition, we are stepping up the efforts to get our associates to return to office because doing so, we believe, helps build and sustain our culture and helps associates build their social capital with colleagues. To tap into the creativity of our more than 350,000 associates, we are launching a grassroots innovation movement because I believe innovative ideas can come from everyone. This program called Blue Bold encourages and celebrates the thousands of flashes of inspiration that our associates have every day as they innovate for our clients. Over the coming months, we plan to train more than 20,000 additional project leads in our innovation methods and generate over 100,000 ideas for client to use rapid prototyping and the identification of new opportunities. A second focus area I\u2019ve spoken about is accelerating revenue growth and building commercial momentum, especially by strengthening our ability to win large deals. Our Q1 bookings were a balance of renewals, expansions and new engagements, which we believe will provide revenue opportunities for us later in the year and valid to 2024. Our strong bookings growth in the quarter, including four deals with a total contract value of about $100 million. To cite one large deal, one recent large deal, Horizon Healthcare Services selected us to manage their claims processing and counter submissions to the state and enrollment services for their 1.2 million members. In the 7-year renewal agreement, we will bring to bear advanced automation solutions for our TriZetto product suite to help Horizon expedite the claims payment process and ensure accuracy in support of their member services. Our large deal pipeline remains healthy for the next couple of quarters. Large deal bookings that aligned with our risk appetite are essential to building commercial momentum, but they can take time to ramp up and realize revenue. We are working on strengthening and industrializing delivery to support our execution of large deals. Moving to our third priority, operational excellence. As you may recall from my last call, I said that internal simplification would be a team will carry forward to help achieve the company\u2019s full potential. Our drive for simplification will include operating with fewer layers to deliver greater agility along with realigning the business to be closer to our clients and employees, and of course, to increase a growth mindset. This endeavor named NextGen is aimed at building the enterprise of the future by simplifying our business operations, optimizing our corporate functions and realigning our workforce to a post-pandemic era of hybrid and redistributed work. This shift will provide an opportunity to rationalize the workspaces across the world and especially in India\u2019s largest cities where we\u2019re distributing some real estate to smaller cities where we can expand and by modernizing some existing space. We expect the structural shift in our real estate costs to help eliminate 80,000 seats and 11 million square feet in large cities in India. This shift will also enable us to invest in collaboration spaces in smaller cities while creating structural savings for the future that we can invest in our people and growth opportunities. We expect this program to help enable us to deliver margin expansion in the range of 20 to 40 basis points in 2024 while supporting a large deal pipeline. Combined with our efforts to increase utilization, improve delivery efficiency, maintain disciplined pricing and a lower attrition, we believe we have the levers to drive modest margin expansion over the next several years while we continue to fund growth investments in 2024 and beyond. Recognizing how much work we have ahead of us, I plan to provide periodic updates about our progress in achieving these three priorities. Let\u2019s spend a moment on the demand environment and tech trends. We are carefully monitoring what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment and with its potential for shifts in client priorities. That said, we are optimistic about our long-term opportunity within the IT services market. The demand for solutions and business outcomes remain solid as technology becomes core to nearly every business. The tech trend on everyone\u2019s mind is generative AI with recent breakthroughs offering the potential to fundamentally transform our clients\u2019 businesses and increase our own productivity. To that end, we are accelerating our investment in generative AI. Our AI accelerator process uses studio environments to collaborate with clients to identify priority AI use cases and rapidly implement prototype solutions for field testing. We have conducted ideation sessions with over 30 clients and are now working to industrialize solutions to their common challenges. We believe generative AI will revolutionize the technology services industry, creating higher rates of productivity and driving greater prominence for software and data engineering expertise. We are using AI to enhance our own creativity and productivity. We are operating pilots that use generative AI to accelerate consulting, design, engineering and operations with the long-term goal of doubling the productivity of our associates. With that in mind, last month, we launched a neuro IT operations, a next-generation platform that brings new levels of automation and intelligence to applications and infrastructure operations. By applying an AI-led automation-first approach, we are enabling enterprises to innovate faster and drive down cost and risk. We believe that enacting new IT operations can actually reduce operational costs by 25% to 45%, reduce mean time to delivery and mean time to detect by 30% to 50% and reduce FTEs by 15% to 30% compared with the use of traditional approaches. Across every industry, the cloud is today the biggest transformational opportunity, and therefore, our clients need a partner that can orchestrate cloud in a heterogeneous environment. In response, we just introduced a new cloud platform called Cognizant Skygrade. This multi-hybrid cloud and edge management platform applies an industry-focused approach designed to help clients transition to a modern cloud-native architecture, develop modern applications that evolve with the pace of business and streamline the cloud management operations. With Skygrade, we believe we can accelerate migration and modernization programs by shortening transformation time by 20% to 40%, resulting in faster value realization while reducing ongoing run and governance costs by 15% to 25%. To wrap up, I stand behind my initial assessment that Cognizant has the strong foundation in place on which we could accelerate growth. I am especially optimistic about the strength of our portfolio and partner ecosystem, combined with our ability to create value for our clients at the intersection of technology and industry use cases. We recognize that our renewed strength in bookings momentum is helping us replenish a softer backlog from the past 9 months, and we believe we can demonstrate improved growth towards the end of this year and in 2024. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jan to provide additional details on the quarter and our outlook for 2023. Jan, over to you. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Ravi, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I touch on the details of the first quarter, I would like to spend a moment on the NextGen program we announced today. During the second quarter, we initiated NexGen to simplify our operating model, optimize our corporate functions and realign our office space to reflect our hybrid work environment. We expect to record total estimated NexGen costs of $400 million, approximately $350 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024. This consists of $200 million of employee severance and other costs primarily related to non-billable and corporate personnel which we expect to mostly incur in 2023. The personnel-related actions under this program are expected to impact approximately 3,500 associates or approximately 1% of our total workforce. We expect to realize savings from our NexGen initiative in the back half of this year. The NexGen program also includes $200 million of costs related to the consolidation of office space and approximately $150 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024. We do not anticipate these real estate actions will begin to generate savings until 2024. By 2025, we expect to reduce our annual real estate costs by approximately $100 million versus 2022. This reduction is net of investments to expand our real estate footprint in smaller cities, primarily in India, in support of our hybrid work strategy. Our full year operating margin outlook includes the anticipated impact of these actions. As Ravi mentioned, we expect this program to help enable us to deliver 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion in 2024, in addition to funding revenue growth opportunities. This 2024 expectation assumes no further deterioration of the economic environment. Beyond 2024, we are focused on driving structural cost improvements to fund investments to support revenue growth, our people and modernization of facilities while driving consistent, modest margin expansion. Now moving on to the details for the quarter. We were pleased to deliver revenue above the high end of our guidance range, strong free cash flow and healthy large deal bookings, which has helped us to begin to replenish our backlog following muted bookings growth throughout 2022. First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 30 basis points year-over-year or growth of plus 1.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 100 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. As Ravi mentioned, we were pleased with our bookings performance in the first quarter, including the mix shift towards larger deals. We also exited the quarter with a strong pipeline of larger opportunities across industries. At the same time, we also saw pressure in smaller contracts, which we believe is a result of a softer discretionary spending being driven by the macro environment. This environment has a near-term impact on our revenue in the second quarter, which I will touch on in my guidance commentary. Moving on to segment results for the first quarter where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 1%. Revenue pressure within our North American portfolio was partially offset by growth in our global growth public sector and insurance clients. In the first quarter, bookings growth within financial services outpaced the total company, and we are seeing an improving pipeline of opportunities over the next 12 months. While we have begun to see signs of stabilization, we are still rebuilding our backlog as we continue to navigate an uncertain macro environment. We believe this uncertainty has impacted the pace of client decision-making and put pressure on discretionary budgets. It has also resulted in new pipeline opportunities around cost savings, efficiency and vendor consolidation which we are actively pursuing. Health Sciences revenue grew 4%, consistent with last quarter. Growth was driven by increased demand from health care payer clients for our integrated software solutions. Products and Resources revenue grew 1%, reflecting inorganic contribution from recently completed acquisitions and continued strength among logistics, utility and travel and hospitality customers. This was partially offset by pressure from retail, consumer goods and manufacturing customers, which we believe reflects the economic environment. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 4%, reflecting slower growth among our largest technology clients and muted growth among communications and media clients. Similar to our other segments, we believe the macroeconomic environment pace of decision-making and discretionary spending among our CMT clients. Continuing with our year-over-year growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q1, North America revenue declined 1%. This performance reflected declines within Financial Services and Products and Resources, partially offset by growth in Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 7%. Growth was again led by the UK, which grew 14% and included strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients and CMT. Now moving on to margins. In Q1, both our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 14.6% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, both GAAP and adjusted operating margin declined by 40 basis points. This primarily reflects gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs, partially offset by tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, lower SG&A expenses and the benefit of 2022 pricing actions. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%. Our effective tax rate included a discrete benefit from a settlement of prior year tax audits. Year 1, diluted GAAP EPS was $1.14 and adjusted EPS was $1.11, up 7% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.5 billion or net cash of $1.8 billion. DSO of 73 days was down 1 day sequentially and increased 1 day year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q1 was $631 million, representing approximately 110% of net income. This compares to free cash flow of $186 million in the prior year period, which represented approximately 35% of net income. The increase in free cash flow was driven by strong collections. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for $200 million under our share repurchase program and returned $150 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. We also closed 2 acquisitions in the quarter, Mobica, which helps bolster our IoT software engineering capabilities; and the professional and application management services business of OneSource Virtual, a Workday partner. Over the last 6 months, we have deployed approximately $800 million of capital across 4 acquisitions. Before we move to our outlook, I would like to spend a moment to discuss the change in our attrition disclosure. As you heard Ravi mentioned, we are now disclosing voluntary attrition tech services on a trailing 12-month basis, which we believe is most relevant to our business. This new metric includes all employees, except those in our intuitive operations automation practice, and replaces our prior disclosure. Now turning to our forward outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.83 billion to $4.88 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 1.6% to minus 0.6%, or a decline of minus 1% to flat in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 60 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. We are also providing initial full year 2023 revenue and operating margin guidance. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to continue to replenish our backlog to successive quarters of strong bookings performance, which we believe would improve revenue momentum towards the end of this year and as we enter 2024. For the full year, we are guiding revenue in the range of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion, representing a decline of minus 1.2% to growth of plus 0.8%, or a decline of minus 1% to growth of plus 1% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is expected to be approximately 100 basis points. This assumes no major deterioration in the demand environment, and our assumption that large deals we have signed and expect to sign in Q2 begin to ramp more meaningfully in the second half of the year. Moving on to the adjusted operating margin. We are guiding operating margin to be in the range of 14.2% to 14.7%. Our margin outlook is impacted by several factors. First, we expect the macroeconomic environment will impact pricing, which was a key lever for us in 2022 to help offset the elevated wage inflation. Second, we are achieving a faster pace of large deals than we initially anticipated. These larger deals generally have a dilutive impact in the first year. Finally, as mentioned, the NextGen program is not expected to drive meaningful savings until the back half of this year. For real estate, we anticipate initial savings in 2024 and a full run rate in 2025. Our operating margin guidance also assumes a sequential decline in Q2 as a result of the merit cycle that took effect from April 1. As a reminder, this is our second merit cycle for the majority of our employees in the last 6 months. We anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $85 million, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, and an adjusted tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. In 2023, we expect to deploy approximately $800 million on share repurchases, including the activity in Q1. This assumes repurchase activity above our long-term capital allocation framework and will reduce our weighted average share count by approximately 2.5% in 2023. Based on the share repurchase activity, we anticipate full year average shares outstanding of approximately 506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.11 to $4.34, which reflects our wider-than-typical operating margin guidance. Finally, we are targeting free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% of net income, which assumes the negative impact from the changes in the U.S. tax law that we discussed in February. We now estimate the negative year-over-year impact of $540 million from this change, which is slightly down from our prior estimate. This includes approximately $300 million in deferred payments relating to 2022. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. Good nice uptick here on the bookings side. I just wanted to talk about this dynamic a little bit. I mean you understand it a little bit more. Is it something that has been a little bit of a struggle with Cognizant over the last few years. You\u2019re showing 9%, I think, bookings growth year-on-year, but that was a book-to-bill of like 1.3x, which is \u2013 implies a bit of a disconnect in sort of how bookings translate to revenues. Can you just talk a little bit \u2013 I know you mentioned you\u2019re refilling the backlog and you\u2019re expecting to come in later in the year. Can you just help us a little bit again with how we should think about that dynamic, the translation of bookings into revenue and the timing and maybe what\u2019s going on with the backlog or with the underlying base of revenue? Thank you. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Lisa. I\u2019m going to \u2013 this is Ravi here. I\u2019m going to start off and then ask Jan to add. We recorded very strong bookings, 28% year-on-year and 12-month trailing bookings of $25.6 billion. And you\u2019re right, book-to-bill ratio is at 1.3x. I think the way to see it is it has multiple factors associated with it. First and foremost, how much of it is renewable? How much of it is new? How much of it is expansion? While we don\u2019t give those numbers out, we had healthy expansion and new business in comparison to the past. We had four large deals more than total contract value of $100 million. Just to give you an order of magnitude. Last year, same quarter, we did not have any large deals. Large deals come with a little bit of \u2013 it comes with a runway where a lot of it is at the end of the cycle or rather at the back of the cycle. Short deals, small deals come with immediate short-fuse demand, which gives you revenue on the short run. Large deals give you revenue on the medium to long run, while in the short run, they take a little time to ramp up. So in summary, how this translates to revenue in the short and the medium and the long run is dependent on what percentage of it is large deals, what percentage of it is small deals. You would appreciate small deals are actually a little softer for us because we\u2019ve \u2013 we know that the discretionary spend is softening in an economic environment we are in. So the large deals gives us the opportunity to accrue revenues at the back end of this year and the next year while we build the pipe for the future. Our pipeline is looking strong as well. Jan Siegmund : Yes. Lisa, the 9% trailing 12 months bookings growth is really entirely driven by the very strong bookings growth in the quarter. In this quarter, as you know, we had three quarters of flat bookings that contributed to this overall trailing 12-month result. And so the revenue growth, in this case, will be picking up. We expect a model in our revenue guidance, some revenue impact from these larger deals picking and starting and ramping up in the second quarter \u2013 in the second half of this fiscal year and then have a full year impact next year. So for the second quarter, impacting our guidance is also the anticipation that we see softness in the small-scale bookings. So the second quarter, in a sense, it\u2019s kind of a transition quarter, I would say, because we have the high bookings growth, hopefully, continued momentum in bookings as we go through the year. But we do have a short-term revenue impact from the decline of these shorter and smaller deals that are impacted by the economy, by discretionary spend. So that\u2019s kind of how I think best to understand the relationship between bookings and revenue growth. Lisa Ellis : Thank you. And then maybe for my follow-up. Ravi, this one is for you. I know you mentioned you\u2019ve been out talking to 100-plus clients and have now been at Cognizant for 3.5 months or so. Can you just articulate, when you\u2019re talking out there with clients, how you see Cognizant, like, really uniquely differentiated in the market when you\u2019re \u2013 with what you\u2019re hearing back from them, what you\u2019re hearing from associates, etcetera? Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Lisa. I\u2019ve met more than 100 clients in my first 100 days across all geographies, and traveled extensively to meet them and my associates. I would say, just to keep the high-level observations, I think our clients love the confluence of technology and industry demand which Cognizant really comes with. Cognizant, if you go back to the history of Cognizant, it was bought at a time when there was a tail end of the ride to cable, and it was born to be application outsourcing wave, which was starting off. And Cognizant built the capability on a confluence of industry and domain. And industry and domain, the confluence is very important now than ever before because we all know that we are living in a golden era of technology where the core of every business in every industry is transitioning to a technology-led core or a technology must core. So I would say we have to progressively make sure that the confluence of technology and industry, we actually demonstrate the differentiation in every industry we represent. Our biggest exposure is healthcare, life sciences, financial services, which is where I think we have really doubled down on this confluence and we now have to progressively build in every other industry. The second piece, I would say, is client centricity. I think over the years, Cognizant\u2019s growth has actually come from mining accounts with the breadth of capability Cognizant brings. And of course, the entrepreneur spirit of our teams. These are the three things which stood out for me. And in fact, some clients actually who have worked with us for very long, actually said we are fans of Cognizant. I mentioned that on my initial remarks. And that was \u2013 that really stuck to me that these are clients who want us to move with them, who want us to challenge them and to want us to co-create along with them for their technology future, if \u2013 in \u2013 So there can never be a better time for the confluence of technology and industry, and I think we are so well positioned for that. Lisa Ellis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. My first one is a margin, and I guess, a NextGen program clarification. And sorry if I missed this, but can you give us a sense of what the run rate cost reduction or the net savings you expect to achieve by the end of 2024? And I\u2019m trying to understand if the 20 to 40 bps of \u201824 operating margin is incremental to what you would normally had planned for? Or if that\u2019s kind of the total level of operating margin expansion, which would align with prior targets? Jan Siegmund : Yes, Bryan, there is many moving parts here. So let me talk first about the overall program of $400 million of restructuring charges, of which $200 million comes from severance and $200 million comes from real estate. We provided really only an expected run rate savings rate to materialize in \u201825 at the full range of $100 million for the real estate component. We offer that savings opportunity because we feel it\u2019s hard from the outside to calculate of how restructuring charges in the real estate space translate actually into full run rate savings. So that\u2019s kind of we wanted to help you with the impact of the $200 million component for real estate with that. A portion of that, a meaningful portion of that will be achieved in \u201824 and then the full run rate in \u201825. On the severance, we haven\u2019t given you a net impact or a gross impact. Number one, I think you can fairly easily calculate by the number of employees affected in the severance volume that we anticipate and make an assumption about the cost savings that we would see. There are many factors, and you\u2019d see this reflected in a relatively wide range of margin that we gave for the year is wage inflation there is an uncertain pricing environment and other things that we will have to manage through. So we haven\u2019t given more detail about the $200 million severance charge at this point in time. For \u201824, the 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion would be off the exit rate in \u201823, and that would be our current outlook to \u201824. It should signal from our point of view, our confidence that the full run rate of this program will help us to not only offset large deal pressure that we\u2019re going to see for this first year business cases of the larger deals plus the wage inflation or other elements for \u201824. So it\u2019s a little unusual that we give that early in expectation on the margin. But we felt, given that the program is fairly sizable and only a portion it is going to be realized in \u201823, it will be helpful for you to know that we are confident about return to margin expansion in \u201824. Ravi Kumar : Just adding one additional thing out here. I think these are two structural shifts in our cost as well. We listed costs in a hybrid environment as well as the structural shift in our personnel cost, which is a part of our SG&A., I think is an important part of this program, it\u2019s a structural shift. Jan Siegmund : Yes, we \u2013 we should mention that we did, I think, in our script that we are focusing on non-billable and corporate functions. So these are intended to actually lower our SG&A rate basically. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Okay. I appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up, Ravi, on the large deal front, I guess, maybe the sales force. Can you talk about what you\u2019re doing specifically in these large deal pursuits and maybe your initial assessment of the sales force and the semi structure, I am curious what you may have put in place here early on in 1Q to give you some quick wins? Ravi Kumar : Yes. So we\u2019re very excited about the large deal momentum. This is initial momentum based on the bookings this quarter as well as a good pipeline. I would say there are two swim lanes to this. One is a swim lane on transformation deals, which I think, in some ways, now a little slowdown with the current economics environment. There is a second swim lane on cost takeout, cost takeout, specifically in industries, which went through a higher growth rate in the last few years, but are starting to go back to the post pre-pandemic growth rates. They are starting to see that there is significant opportunity to take out cost, and they are using vendor consolidation or cost takeout as a way to construct a large deal. I see more of them now. And I would say both the simulants are equally important as the economy takes an upturn, you\u2019re going to see more transformational digital work coming the other way. So I would really say both \u2013 these are the two big categories of large deals. And the industries where we see more of it are the ones where there was a swing of growth during the upswing \u2013 forward trajectory of growth in the last few years where that growth has started to taper down. The timing wise, also the labor market is a little soft end. So this is a good time for all our clients to start to get efficiencies and cost takeout and use a partner like Cognizant to support it. So we see more of them now than before. And of course, it\u2019s also reflective that our clients have the confidence to \u2013 for us to execute to those deals. Bryan Bergin : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Kumar : Hey, Ashwin, you may be on mute. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hey, I am sorry. I didn\u2019t recognize it was my name being called, sorry. Hi, Ravi. Hi, Jan. Good to hear from you. Clearly, you guys have both been very busy. I appreciate the well thought-out commentary. I guess I wanted to ask, first, about the cadence that you expect. Obviously, you\u2019ve given Q2 outlook. Is there more of a ratable improvement from that rate to get to the full year? Or is it more of a \u2013 I don\u2019t want to call it a 4Q hockey stick, but is it a sharper improvement to the positive for 4Q? And then a similar question on margins, if you can talk about cadence. Ravi Kumar : Yes. I mean you see our revenue guidance for the second quarter is largely in line with our revenue guidance in the first quarter. And so we do not anticipate a really material contribution of the large deals that we signed until the third and fourth quarter of this year. So we do anticipate revenue growth acceleration throughout the fiscal year throughout the quarters. And I think we\u2019re giving you a fair revenue guidance for the second quarter. We did still see basically pressure on some discretionary projects and smaller deals, as I mentioned in in my comments before. So I think the revenue guidance is kind of where we really solidly think we\u2019re going to be at. The margin guidance is a very important question, Ashwin. Keep in mind, we do implement for the vast majority. We have implemented in April a merit increase. And the second quarter will, therefore, be different from our historic profile of margin that we have shown in the past year. So our second quarter, I think, warrants a good look of what happens when we implement that merit increase, which happened historically in our fourth quarter. And so think of it as a normal merit increase and the margin pressure that we will get from it. And that\u2019s going to be some material impact for us in the second quarter. << And so think of it as a normal merit increase and the margin pressure that we will get from it. And that\u2019s going to be some material impact for us in the second quarter. That\u2019s why I am mentioning it. And if you do the math of our comparable merit increase in the fourth quarter and exclude the one-time components of the fourth quarter that we had, you will see that in the fourth quarter, we recorded about 100 basis points impact of that merit increase on our margins. And fair to assume that things wouldn\u2019t be that different in the second quarter, may be actually probably slightly a little bit more pressure because the economy is changing a little bit. But that\u2019s kind of the framework. That\u2019s why I want to point that out, so. And then the people action of our NextGen program, we are going to start to execute in the second quarter, but given of how we are going to be executing, of course third quarter and the fourth quarter will be reflecting the impact of a big portion of them \u2013 good portion of that program. Ravi Kumar : And Ashwin, if you \u2013 just to jog your memory on this, we actually did one in October, a merit cycle, and we are doing one more in April. So, these are two merit cycles. In fact, three merit cycles in 18 months. It\u2019s good for our associates. It starts to reflect on our attrition numbers starting to drop. And you have already seen that it\u2019s an investment for the future, but it equally has pressure on our margins. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. I guess the first part of that question was on revenue cadence, if you could address that. But then I also want to ask you, your headcount did go down sequentially. When do you expect that to stabilize and start to grow, I guess in anticipation of revenue growth in the future? And what part do you think increased automation? Applying AI to yourselves might play as you think of headcount in the future? Ravi Kumar : Ashwin, that\u2019s a great question actually. One of the things, as I mentioned my priorities is to get commercial momentum, large deals, reduce our attrition and be an employer of choice. The third piece I spoke about is simplification of our operations. The NextGen program is an important program to de-layer our organization and to simplify our operations. Equally, one of the things we want to bring a huge cadence on, I think in the last 12 months or so, we had some \u2013 we had a very good initiative around pricing in the market. And that\u2019s a way to actually keep your margins intact. One of the focus areas for me moving forward is increased utilization, higher off-shoring, better pyramid ratios, better leverage of Gen C program. And the fourth is what you just mentioned, which is embrace of automation in everything we do. In fact, just a few weeks ago, I launched a platform called Neuro IT Operations where we want to go relentless on a client automation to ourselves, both on technology as well as IT operations and of course, on the process side. So, we do think this is going to be a little bit of a structural shift in the way we see our operating model, where we look at an uplift of margins, not just through pricing, but also through operational efficiencies and the leverage of automation. Automation is a moving scale. When everybody moves on that scale, you then start to share those benefits with your clients. And when you start to share those benefits with your clients, you have to re-innovate so that you can actually be ahead of the curve and keep it for yourself. So, it\u2019s kind of a cycle you have to keep working on. And when everybody \u2013 when you start to share it with your clients, when there is a new baseline, you have to re-baseline it with more innovation. So, I would say we are now \u2013 we have got into that rhythm. So, we are very excited about how we could be competitive to our deals, which we are starting to see and how we could also on the downstream price deals to win and deliver them to margins using automation as a lever. So, it\u2019s an important shift in the way we are seeing our operating model. And it\u2019s an evolving scale because of the fact that technology in that space is evolving so fast, including the leverage of generative AI to increase developer productivity, which is the new thing we are working on. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Surinder Thind : Thank you. Following up on the last question, Ravi, can you maybe talk about the level of productivity gains in terms of potentially automation and the level of disruption here? And what I am getting to here is, is there the potential for a step function change? And if there is a step function change, how does that impact the revenue model as you look over the long-term, right? I assume you won\u2019t be able to generate the same level of revenues for a given level of service. Ravi Kumar : It\u2019s an interesting question because it all depends on how much you want to leverage the productivity you generate out of these tools and instrumentation and platforms into your deals and use that to win more and share it with your clients. And how much you could actually constantly innovate beyond the time when you start to win the deals to when you start to execute the deals. So, it\u2019s a very difficult one because it\u2019s a moving scale because nobody spoke about generative AI in 2022. Everybody is speaking about it because just the scale at which it\u2019s come to disrupt various businesses in the world, including ours, right. So, I would say it\u2019s a hard one to put a quantifiable impact on revenue and on margins. It is a moving scale. We have to be constantly ahead of the curve. And again, constantly ahead of the curve not to execute programs, but also equally to win business because these are the same productivity baselines we actually take it to our proposals. So, sometimes, we wonder as the baselines constantly change whether it will translate that back to your bottom line, or it will translate that back to better win ratio. So, you have to keep that balance so that you have growth. And equally, you are able to generate that growth in a profitable way by not just leveraging the traditional levers of higher utilization, higher off-shoring, better roll mix, but also using technology as a lever to do this. So, I know I have given you a high-level answer, but it\u2019s very hard to simulate and put a revenue model attached to it because it is just such a fast moving curve. I actually think we are well equipped to capitalize on the advances in the space and we are well equipped to generate the value for our clients, and we are well equipped to actually evolve our business model, which is potentially going to go from people to a people-plus-machines model, if I may, or a people-plus-AI or AI-amplified-human model, which I have been very fascinated about. Surinder Thind : Thank you. That\u2019s it for me. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Keane : Yes. Hi. I just had a question on the overall IT services environment. Just thinking in your conversations you had with the 100 or so clients, Ravi. Are people expecting the environment to stay similar in their IT spending budgets, or do you think people will put further pressure on budgets and IT spend as we go forward through this year? Ravi Kumar : Yes. It\u2019s a great question, actually. I will kind of pivot this in a little different direction. If you are working on traditional technologies or classical technologies, as I call it, which is enabling a business, the pressure on IT budgets is going to be very high because a lot of it is cost driven. If you are building a CRM system, if you are building an HR system, a supply chain system. I think the pressure of IT budgets with the economic uncertainty is going to be very \u2013 it\u2019s going to be tight. That\u2019s how I see it. If you are leveraging technology to disrupt the core of a business, as an example, if you are doing the connected car initiative of an automotive company, I don\u2019t think budgets will come on the way because it\u2019s a disruption of the business model. Equally, the capability you need is going to be deep as well, which means you have to build different swim lanes in your operating model so that you could cater to classical technologies on one side, but equally cater to deep expertise needed for disrupting the core of businesses. This is a swim lane which did not exist before because most businesses enable the businesses using technology, now, technologies emerged into businesses, which I think will have more flexibility on budgets because the paranoia about the core changing means you could become irrelevant if you don\u2019t make the change, and therefore, you allocate more for securing your future as a business. Some industries are doing it more paranoid because there is more change in the core products and services, and some are actually not as worried about this issue. I would say, depending on where you are, this would \u2013 you would find IT budgets to be under stress or you are able to find IT budgets not to be under stress. The second piece, I would say, we all have to think about is our universe is not as much just tech spend of enterprises. Our universe is operations spend of enterprises because technology is so deeply emerged into operations. So, if you put that lens in, operations, which have to be automated for better experience, for lower cost, for higher \u2013 for high-touch services, you could potentially immerse in technology, outsource and immerse in technology for companies like Cognizant to benefit out of it. So, if I see that as the universe, that\u2019s a very different universe. In fact, just to give you a case in point, there are companies which have accumulated cost equivalent to the growth rate during the pandemic. And when they go back to the pre-pandemic, those growth rates start to taper down. They have to take their operations cost down. So, they could either do it by automating it, or they could do it by outsourcing and off-shoring it. And so you can have a benefit there. So, I would say these are three different things to look at. Even today, there is a consolidation of providers, cost takeout, which is actually winning in the terms, as I call it, where customers don\u2019t spend more, but there is a swap of the portfolio between one provider to another provider, which means one wins and one loses. So, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 if I just look at straight IT spend in classical technologies, you have a different answer \u2013 for core, you would have a different answer. And of course, if you are consolidating providers, it\u2019s a win for one and loss for somebody else. Bryan Keane : Okay. Great. Yes. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Tyler Scott : Great. Thank you everyone for joining. We look forward to catching up with you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may disconnect now.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Cognizant Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tyler Scott, the Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's second quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to discuss four topics with you today. Our second quarter results, the demand environment of comprehensive commitment to generative AI and an update on our long-term priorities. We made continued progress during the quarter in what remains an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. Q2 came in at $4.9 billion at the high end of our guidance range. We were pleased to return to sequential revenue growth of more than 1%. Year-over-year Q2 revenue showed a modest decline of 40 basis points or essentially flat in constant currency. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.2% and adjusted EPS was $1.10. We recorded another quarter of strong bookings growth 17% year-over-year ending quarter two with record trailing 12-months bookings of $26.4 billion. A book-to-bill of 1.4x approximately 30% of our in quarter Q2 bookings were large deals and five of this deals exceeded $100 million each. Our bookings continue to be a balance mix of renewables, extensions and new opportunities. The leadership team and I remain intensely focused on a talent. So I am glad to see the continued reduction in our iteration with trailing 12-months voluntary attrition for our tech services business declining to 19.9% down 3 percentage points sequentially and 11 percentage points year-over-year. While Jan will cover our performance at a business segment level, I want to offer a quick word about financial services. Our quarterly year-over-year revenue decline in the segment reflects the soft market and continuing weakness in discretionary spending. In response, we are transitioning more existing work in the sector towards managed services as many clients remain focused on driving cost takeout, vendor consolidation and productivity initiatives. We also stepping up our engagement with fintech companies which we believe offer a great opportunity for digital transformation. And we are strengthening our capabilities with a goal of capturing discretionary spending on transformation work when it returns. For example, we continue to support the modernization of S&P Global's Configure Prize Quote System to enable end-to-end digitization in what we believe is the world's largest CPQ implementation on Salesforce. And we are collaborating with Max, Life Insurance to launch an innovation and development center in Chennai to help accelerate the digital transformation efforts. With a flexible fine-centric operating model, we can assist clients across industry sectors, takeout costs, consolidate their vendors and achieve both technology and operational efficiencies which provide opportunities for large deals. We can also help them develop digital platforms to deliver richer and more personalized experiences to their customers. What's more, we can engineer technology into their products and services. As an example, we recently extended a partnership with Gilead Sciences. This agreement includes the renewable and expansion of Cognizant services for a total expected value of $800 million over the next five years. We'll manage Gilead's global idea infrastructure while leading digital transformation initiatives designed to enhance their overall client experience and enable faster time to market for the products. We will apply the power of GenAI and Intelligent Automation to help improve Gilead's customer service experience and assist in driving greater manufacturing efficiencies. To support clients' transformation leads, we've established a distinctive position across industry using a platform-centric approach designed to speed clients' consumption of technology. You've seen the emphasis we've given to this platform approach. For example, Cognizant, TriZetto and healthcare are shared investigator platform in life sciences, asset performance excellence in smart manufacturing and Car-to-Cloud in automotive. Last quarter, we launched two new platforms with applications across industries, new royalty operations, which enables AI-led autonomous operations and Cognizant Sky-grade designed to help clients maximize the full potential of cloud. Turning to AI in quarter two, we expanded our platform portfolio further with Cognizant Neuro AI. It's designed to speed the adoption of generative AI and harness its value in a flexible, secure, scalable and responsible way. With Neuro AI, we are helping clients advance from identifying company-specific use cases to operationalizing AI. I should point out that generative AI is a natural evolution of a work-crossed cognitive AI enterprise applications in data analytics services. To extract value from GenAI, the data must be curated, trained, modernized and made production ready. You also need a deep understanding of clients' data estate, data architectures, data usage patterns, and business applications of the data. Our current approach to leverage third-party foundational models and enhance them with our platforms and IP and then fine tune the models for clients. Today we have more than 100 active client engagements in various stages with the focus on cognitive and generative AI, as well as hundreds more projects using AI services within the context of delivery. We're designing a generative AI offerings for industry-specific solutions, cross-industry use cases in productivity, enablement, under themes like transforming code processes, improving the customer and employee experience, product innovations, software and coding, and knowledge management to name a few. For example, one of the world's largest healthcare product companies, we are helping to speed up the research process by deploying GenAI to author scientific content. We developed a workbench that uses GPT models to summarize and generate content from unstructured and structured data, such as laboratory information management systems with the aim of automating the generation of regulatory content. For a top-20 property and casualty insurer, we have helped frame its GenAI strategy and conduct real-world tests based on company data. For example, we built a GenAI-based digital virtual assistant that analyzed large loss complex claims submissions. By referencing the insurer's claim data, the virtual assistant was able to guide a human claims handler to gather nearly 100% of missing claims information. This simple application is expected to produce millions of dollars in savings through improved operational efficiency and reduced claim costs. In addition, we signed a new multi-year agreement with Nuance Communications, a Microsoft company, to help scale the resources for Nuance's Dragon ambient experience operations. This solution is at the forefront of conversational AI and ambient clinical intelligence. Let's turn to the essential role partners play in delivering our AI capabilities. We expanded our alliance with Google Cloud to help enterprise clients create, migrate, and modernize their AI journeys, and offer clients innovative industry solutions founded on the tenet of responsible AI. Our investments in developing GenAI capabilities include launching the Cognizant Google Cloud AI University, a program designed to train 25,000 Cognizant professionals on Google Cloud AI technologies. We'll offer this program to our clients as well. And earlier today, we announced that as a part of our expanded partnership with Google, we'll be building on Google Cloud's Generative AI technology with Cognizant's AI domain expertise to create a healthcare large language model. This LLM is designed to simplify and improve the accuracy of complex healthcare administrative tasks and strengthen business outcomes for healthcare organizations. We've also expanded our relationship with Microsoft to deliver industry solutions and enable AI-led transformation. This includes expanding the focus of our Microsoft Center of Excellence in AI and other next-gen technologies to drive competencies across architecture, technology leadership, value delivery tools, and enablement. Cognizant and ServiceNow have announced a strategic partnership to accelerate the adoption of AI-driven automation across industries. Our industry expertise and solutions integrated with ServiceNow's intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation will bring to market offerings that are designed to solve complex problems, automate operations, and enhance employee as well as end-customer experiences through the use of AI. Now a quick update on our three long-term performance objectives, becoming an employer of choice in our industry, accelerating revenue growth, and enhancing operational discipline. Let's start with the employer of choice. During our Q4 call, I talked about how tightly linked the client and the employee experience are, giving Cognizant the opportunity to create self-reinforcing cycles. Highly engaged talent with a passion for clients and a growth mindset attract the best clients. These clients, in turn, attract more of the best people, keeping the flywheel turning faster. Now, two quarters later, we are seeing the early benefits of this interdependent relationship between employees and clients. Our trailing 12-month voluntary attrition has been trending downwards for the last four quarters. And our just-completed annual people engagement survey showed meaningfully improved engagement results. Among the many questions the survey poses to associates, we saw multipoint increases in three areas strongly correlated to engagement. Would you recommend Cognizant as a great place to work? Are you excited about Cognizant's future? And do you plan to be working at Cognizant two years from now? On the client side, data from our project-level client feedback process through the first half of this year shows solid improvement over the previous period scores as well as our best net promoter score since launching this program in 2021. I see us making real progress on creating a self-reinforcing cycle. From day one, my commitment to our associates has been to cultivate a diverse organization that reflects the world in which we operate. Our top priority has been to increase a diverse talent including at leadership levels. I\u2019m delighted to say that in the past couple of months we have appointed 7 women to fill strategic roles at the Senior Vice President level. We are resolved to help all our associates bring their best selves to work and that means focusing on all aspects of their Cognizant experience. For example, we develop talent early through educational partnerships and apprenticeships. We invest heavily in upskilling and reskilling current employees through our award-winning leadership and development ecosystem. We also employ innovative trained to hire initiatives such as the Cognizant's Skills Accelerators aimed at people seeking to kickstart a technology career in the U.S. and the Cognizant internship program for technology professionals looking to restart their careers. Our next priority is to accelerate revenue growth which is the absolute focus of the entire management team. We are differentiating Cognizant and large-deal opportunities by scaling our capabilities for cost take-out and optimization and focusing more on managed services. And we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities of the cost and efficiency side. Given the groundswell of interest in generative AI, the number of projects we have underway focused on cognitive and generative AI, we see this technology generating a new wave of opportunities for us. Accordingly we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next three years. Our third long-term priority is to enhance our operational discipline. We are working to fortify a day-to-day business execution and optimize cost of delivery by driving higher productivity powered by advances in tooling platforms and automation technologies and by improving their operational labor in areas like billable utilization. Our NextGen program which we announced last quarter is on track. We are making progress on removing structural costs as we continue to simplify our operating model and reline our office space to the future of hybrid work. Or our last call, I talked about a plan to redistribute some of our development centers from India's largest cities to smaller cities. I'm pleased to announce the first phase of this shift with the planned opening of two new centers, one in Bhubaneswar and the other in Indore India, which offer great talent pools. Keep in mind the next generation next-generation program, over rights, overriding aim is to generate savings to invest in our people and our growth. Yan will provide additional details in his remarks on the next-gen program. In closing, I'm now seven months into my tenure as a CEO. I've met with more than 200 clients, dozens of our partners and through in-person and virtual town halls with most of our workforce. I've also made a point to continuously soliciting ideas and perspectives from our top thousand leaders on strategic topics of importance to our future. Further, a company-wide grassroots innovation movement launched earlier this year, Blue Bolt, has led to such a surge of fresh ideas with more than 32,000 generated so far that it's now serving as a company's innovation engine. I'm convinced Cognizant path to winning in the market place, runs through fully embracing our heritage and DNA. We are leaning into our heritage at the intersection of industry and technology, a flexible client-centric operating model and a distributed delivery network that bring together global and local capabilities. All-in-all, we've been making good progress, but to recognize how much more work lies ahead, continuing to build on our growth imperatives as the goal on which everyone in the company is focused. I especially want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all our associates for the extraordinary work they do each day. Before I turn the call to Jan, I want to comment on his plans for the future. Jan let me and the board knows his intention to retire from Cognizant early next year. Jan has been a wonderful business partner to me and over the past three years he's played an instrumental role in designing and executing a strategic financial and operation operating plan while developing superb talent with our finance organization. As we begin the search for the company's next CFO, I'm grateful for Jan's willingness to work closely with his eventual successor to ensure his smooth transition. With that, I turn the call over to him to provide additional details on the quarter. Thank you. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Ravi, for the kind words. I'm proud of what we have accomplished over the last three years, including our work together over the last seven months. I'm looking forward to continuing our partnership in the months ahead while the search for my successor is underway. Until then, it's business as usual, so with that let's turn out to our second quarter results. We delivered second quarter revenue at the high end of our guidance range and adjusted operating margins above expectations. We were pleased to deliver another strong quarter of bookings growth, driven by larger and longer duration deals. Our pipeline for larger bookings also remains strong and is up meaningfully year-over-year. Additionally, our NextGen program is on track and yielding early savings through our efforts to structurally reduce our cost base and fund investments for growth. Moving on to the details of the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of over 1% sequentially and a decline of 40 basis points year-over-year, or roughly flat in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 130 basis points of contribution from our recent acquisitions. Bookings growth in the quarter was again driven by a mixed shift towards larger deals, which had in turn led to longer average duration of our bookings. We are pleased with our bookings performance in the quarter and are focused on building momentum in the quarters ahead. Consistent with the first quarter, we have continued to experience softness in smaller, shorter duration contracts, which we attribute to weaker discretionary spending. The translation of bookings to revenue growth is impacted by this change in deal mix. As duration has increased, the conversion to revenue will be longer, but helps to improve our forward visibility. Moving on to segments result for the second quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within financial services, revenues declined 5%, which reflects a softer overall demand environment and weak discretionary spending. As we navigate this environment, we have continued to strengthen our leadership team and sharpen our client engagement. While our pipeline for work related to cost takeout and productivity-led initiatives remains healthy and meaningfully higher than prior year period, we expect the uncertainties of the macro environment to continue to impact the pace of client spending over the next several quarters. Health sciences revenue grew 2%. Growth was again driven by strong demand from healthcare clients for our integrated software solutions, which increased mid-teens year-over-year. While the life sciences was down year-over-year and impacted by softer discretionary spending, we experienced strong sequential growth driven by increased volumes with existing customers. Products and resources revenue grew 4%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions, ramp of recent wins, and demand from automotive and travel and hospitality clients. This was partially offset by softer discretionary spending across industries. Communications, media, and technology revenue declined 40 basis points, reflecting softness among both technology and our communications and media clients. We expect growth to improve in Q3 as recent new bookings have already begun to ramp. Continuing with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, from a geographic perspective in Q2, North America revenue declined 2%, reflecting softness within our financial services and CMT portfolio. This was partially offset by growth in health sciences and products and resources. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside North America, grew approximately 5%. Growth was led by Europe, which grew 6%, and included strong growth within CMT and products and resources, particularly within automotive. Now moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $117 million cost related to our previously announced NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 240 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 14.2%. Operating margin included the negative impact from an increase in compensation cost, primarily the result of our two merit cycles since October 2022. This has impacted both gross margin and SG&A. This was partially offset by tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee and higher utilization. It also included an approximate 60 basis points benefit from an insurance recovery related to our previously disclosed 2020 cyber incident. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.1%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.7%. Our effective tax rate included a discrete benefit from a settlement related to U.S. state income taxes. Q2 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.91 and adjusted EPS was $1.10. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.1 billion or a net cash of $1.4 billion. DSO of 75 days increased two days sequentially and one day year-over-year. Free-cash flow in Q2 was a negative $32 million which reflects the previously disclosed impact from the change in the U.S. law that we discussed earlier this year. This change negatively impacted Q2 free cash flow by approximately $420 million which included tax payments of approximately $300 million related to 2022. This impact was largely in line with our expectations and we continue to expect free cash flow to represent approximately 90% of net income this year. During the quarter we've repurchased about three million shares for $200 million under our share repurchase program and returned $148 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately six million shares for about $400 million. At quarter end we had $2.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our forward outlook. For the third quarter we expect revenue in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.94 billion representing a year-over-year increase of 0.6% to 1.6% or a decline of 50 basis points to an increase of 50 basis points in current constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a positive impact of a 110 basis points as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. For the full year we are reiterating our constant currency revenue growth guidance. Our range is slightly wider than our historical practice reflecting a heightened level of uncertainty and the recent pace of client decision-making. For 2023 we expect revenue of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion representing a decline of 0.9% to a growth of 1.1% or a decline of 1% to growth of 1% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is still expected to be approximately 100 basis points. The midpoint of our guidance suggests a softer fourth quarter relative to historic norms as we anticipate softer demand and more volatile discretionary spending patterns driven by macroeconomic uncertainty to continue throughout the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, the next-gen program is on track and our assumptions for cost savings are unchanged. However we now expect to incur $350 million in total charges versus $400 million previously. This reflects our assumption for lower employee separation cost as a result of voluntary attrition trend. We now expect to incur approximately $250 million of next-gen cost in 2023 including approximately $100 million relating to employee severance and an unchanged $150 million related to net consolidation of office space. Moving on to adjusted operating margin, our guidance is unchanged at 14.2% to 14.7%. Our margin outlook is impacted by several factors but primarily the negative impact from recent merit cycles. It also reflects our assumption for NextGen savings and growth investments including the dilutive early impact associates with large deals. We anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $115 million versus $85 million previously reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24% versus 24% to 26% percent previously due to several discrete items in the first half of the year. In 2023 we continue to expect to return approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and our regular quarterly dividend. We continue to expect full year average shares outstanding of approximately $506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.25 to $4.48 versus $4.11 to $4.34 previously. With that we will open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you and good execution in the quarter. I think my first question is with regards to the bookings. If you can provide maybe a little bit more color with regards to the nature of bookings, the nature of discussions with clients, and maybe even any CCD versus ATV balance that you can maybe talk about. Because I think the bigger issue here is not the bookings but the conversion. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Ashwin. This is Ravi here. We had another good quarter of bookings growth, 17% Y&Y. We are excited about -- I've spoken about this before -- there are two swim lanes on large deals. One is related to transformation. One is related to efficiencies, productivity, cost takeout. I think it's fair to say that at this point of time the deals we are seeing in the market are over-indexed to efficiency, cost takeout, consolidation kind of deals. We are excited about the fact that we are starting to win them and translate that into revenues for the future. You would understand that these deals come with a gestation period which is longer than the smaller deals or the transformational deals because of the nature of them. We had five deals more than $100 million TCV in the bookings. Two of them were renewals. One of them had renewals plus expansion. Two of them are net new. So a very healthy mix if I may, of our bookings. The interesting part of doing large deals is you build the rhythm so that even if the period is long enough, as you keep building the rhythm, it will start to contribute to the next year and the next year. I wish I had a big pipe the year before so that it would have contributed this year. So that's how you see it. You have to create that rhythm. Financial services, of course, is less on small deals. Financial services and, for that matter, most of the sectors are muted on discretionary spend on small deals. So that's the color of what we are seeing. We continue to be excited about our ability to win, our ability to also build the organizational infrastructure to execute them, including the productivity gains which we have baked into those deals as we factor them to win and execute. Jan, do you want to add anything? Jan Siegmund : Yes. So Ashwin to your question of translating all those bookings into revenue, I think intuitively you had already your finger on one of the components of the characteristics of our bookings this quarter, and that's basically, on average, the duration of the deals that we signed up in the last year has very meaningfully lengthened, basically. So we have been signing up longer-term deals, on average, with a higher deal value. We actually saw an absolute decline on smaller deals with lower deals below $5 million in our pipeline and that's softness and discretionary spending and smaller type of deals was just offset by the really excellent performance that we had on the larger deal volume and so that led to the 17% overall booking scope. But with respect to translating into revenue, the actual contribution of this book in volume just to give you an example for the rest of year revenue is actually lower than it was in the comparable quarter. So we really have built a pipeline for longer type of revenue streams in the future, which obviously gives us good comfort into the quality of revenue stream going forward, but it also explains why and we're not seeing immediate uptake on our revenues as these bookings will take time to translate into revenue. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you, that's very useful. This second question on margins, pretty solid performance here and the question with regards to why you might not increase the full year range. I think Jan you answered part of that question in your prepared remarks when you said that there's a ramp cost. I just want to make sure are there other things investments you're making, from a R&D perspective perhaps into GenAI capabilities or things like that, investment payment, are there non-deal related factors also included in your decision to think the margin is unchanged. Jan Siegmund : Yes, I think the starting point for the market discussion is for the rest of the year, the one thing that's different compared to prior period is that we won't have an October at fourth quarter merit cycle in our in this year, because as you know, we move forward our merit cycle into April. So that's going to be important as you build a quarterly model to consider. Secondly, I use this moment maybe to talk a little bit about the progress we have been making on our next year in the initiative, we have been recording a severance cost in the quarter as well as cost related to the restructuring or real estate portfolio and we're going to start seeing increased impact of the NextGen action relative to our people in the third and fourth quarter, which gives us basically the room to offset some of the pressures that we're seeing, namely some of expected pressure on the large deal rollout and letting those larger deals season in. And I think the general expectation of a given a higher uncertainty in our business environment that will create, I think, it could create some kind of unspecified yet to be seen pressures in our portfolio. We do have seen a number of clients, kind of reacting to their own economic pressure it's reaching out to us. So we do see an economic environment in which they is pressure and so I think it turns out that I think NextGen is well-time to help us through this, but not it would be too early to celebrate basically a false success of that but we're kind of really moving along in the execution of that program gets a bit of confidence to just reaffirm basically that operating marginal  outlook. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Makes sense. Thank you both. Operator : Next question, Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Oh, follow up. Maybe first on the GenAI thread and Ravi you commented extensively on what at Cognizant you're doing on GenAI externally with partners and to help clients transform their businesses. Can you comment maybe a little bit more detail on how you are deploying GenAI internally at Cognizant and how you see it over time you know being able to transform your business operations and maybe give you more competitive edge relative to peers. Thank you. Ravi Kumar : Thank you for that question. I did extensively speak about it because it is in the middle of everything we do in the company today. I see this as three; the GenAI embrace is going to be in three parts. The first part is how do we apply to our business to run our business, which is like eating our own dog food. The second is how do we make sure that we build our operating model, how would by GenAI? How do we make the average developer productivity increase multi-fold? How do we make sure that we build the platform to the instrumentation, the technology we need it. I also call it the ability to arbitrage on technology. I mean over the last 40 or 50 years tech services companies did labour arbitrage and capability arbitrage I would say this is our time to actually do an arbitrage and technology. The more the more instrumentation we create, the more we can make our model efficient enough with productivity gains. The question is how much of the productivity has to be shared with our clients so that we stay competitive to win as well as keep a part of it for us for ourselves. So I'm not as concerned about a smart developer, I'm concerned about an average developer how do I lift the productivity so that the productivity of the organization goes up? So that's my second part of GenAI. We have extensively worked on building those platforms and we also started to partner with a big tech companies. I would say our ability to train in fact we made an announcement with Google to train 25,000 people. We made great progress on it. We ran an initiative with Microsoft on GenAI and the co-pilot initiative. Today along with the earnings we also timed a large language model in partnership with Google. I think that's a step up. I mean, in general way I can, we could use the curation of data, the ability to use, use the model to contextualize to a business. I would say that's the last mile on generative AI. But leveraging our healthcare expertise, leveraging the asset we have and healthcare, the install base we have in healthcare. We potentially thought it's a good board move to actually build a large language model with Google. Now the third part of the mix, before I go to the third part, equally we are starting to think about how do we actually build cognitive skills in the company, which are different to the past. I mean, if generative AI is going to co-exist with humans in tech services, the reality is you read a very different cognitive diversity. We could potentially need people who don't have a stem background because the people who have a stem background engineer those platforms, so the people who come with a cognitive diversity of say human sciences can actually apply generative AI to a client's landscapes. Now coming to the third part of a generative AI story is, how do we actually embrace with our clients. I've actually spoken about a couple of examples in my earnings script, which is starting with a client at financial services. We have one on one on health care. All of those need front-end consultative skills to start with and back in platforms to support it. So our clients, we almost have 100 plus early engagements either on a proof of concept or on prototype model, where we are experimenting on how do we embrace generative AI with our clients. These 100 early engagements in different areas of the most I would say is in customer service. And the most I would say is related to efficiency, productivity and better experience. So I'm excited about all of what we've done. We've also completed $1 billion in the next three years to continue our investments in the space. And we want to stay ahead of the curve and be that cutting edge partner which our clients are looking for. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. And then maybe for my question, my follow-up. I guess thinking about it as I'm being sad about Jan\u2019s departure. But Ravi, maybe back on you know that you've been at Cognizant I guess coming up on a year or so. How are you thinking about kind of shaping the senior executive team at Cognizant? Are there some other kind of senior leaders you would point to that you're bringing in and that you're thinking about finding a replacement for Jan sort of what's the profile and of folks that you're looking at and bringing in given the priority you highlighted about making the Cognizant a top place an employer of choice. Thank you. Ravi Kumar : Thank you for that question. Jan is going to be with us until we identify a new CFO, and we'll have some overlap period to it, and he's been kind enough to partner with me in the last 7 months. I've not spent a year yet, but in the last 7 months but I'm very hopeful as we finish the transition, I will continue to have his support for the next few quarters. On leadership, per se, we have a very healthy bench. As I put my structure in place, I am excited about promoting and progressing people inside the company and giving them the opportunities. In fact, we have a sizable workforce which has spent more than 7 to 8 years at Cognizant. And I'm actually leading on to build that leadership from inside. We've also -- I'm excited about Cognizant employees coming back to Cognizant. I mean, some of the leadership which left us in the last few years, which we believe are worthwhile and they call Cognizant their home, we have got them back. I have one leader who's come back to do my Industry Solutions Group. I have one leader who has come back to run my infrastructure sales. I'm also excited about other external hires we've done. We've hired a leader for our telecom business. So the excitement of being a part of this journey allows me to straddle between the three, look for people inside the company who can be on that. And I think we have a very good bench of people who have been in the company for a long time, and I'm excited about grooming them to the future leadership. The second is bringing some of the people who want to come back, and we believe that they will add significant value to our future, and of course, the external hiring we could do. In fact, I hired a senior leader for running my partner, organization. So we have made some good progress on putting a leadership team to support us for the future. Operator : Next question, Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. So Ravi, wanted to follow up with a demand question here. Just did you get a sense of any real changes in demand KPIs over the past three months? Or would you say it's been largely consistent as it relates to the level of macro and spending uncertainty that you have been conveying here over the course of 2023? And I guess based on these current client conversations, are you getting any sense of how long you anticipate discretionary spending to remain under pressure? Ravi Kumar : That's a great question, actually. I mean, the demand profile has certainly been very volatile. I mean, if you are capturing opportunities related to discretionary spend, capturing opportunities related to future transformation of enterprise landscapes, it's either been uncertain or it's been kind of, in some places, it has fallen off. And that's one of the reasons why Jan mentioned that smaller deals have -- we have lesser volume of smaller deals and which is true for what the market situation is. Of course, Financial Services is the most impacted but we do see that in other sectors as well. I equally believe it also opens up an opportunity in places to consolidate. It opens up an opportunity to proactively go to our clients who are paranoid about the costs and give them a value proposition which appeals to them where their total cost -- the total cost of ownership goes down but we've been in the process. It's a win-win value proposition. So I'm seeing more of those deals and I'm doubling down on those deals, and that is allowing me to keep the large deal pipeline in good health. And it is an opportunity for us to even proactively go and bid for some of the business. I mean, one of the deals we announced is the Gilead Sciences deal, which is an existing customer. And we not only renewed the contract but we actually got an expansion on it. The key point there is in the past, those consolidation initiatives were run by a smaller productivity attached to technology and a bigger productivity attached to the efficiency of running your labor model, including offshoring, including a better pyramid, including a better roll ratio. I think we have a unique opportunity to switch that into a technology arbitrage which I spoke about, which is using technology to get better productivity and then sharing the benefits to your clients. And that can happen more with consolidation and I think we are trying to seize those opportunities. So I see like these two swim lanes, one which has kind of shrunk and another which is continuing to be in good shape. The idea is to double down on the one which is continuing to have traction so that you could set off against what you're losing on the other side. But discretionary spend is pretty weak. That is something I should highlight. Bryan Bergin : Okay, okay. Understood. Appreciate all the color. And then just shifting to the workforce. So understanding headcount down quarter-over-quarter a bit more, I think, in the second quarter, but you do have NextGen flowing through there. Just thinking forward in the second half, is it fair to assume this workforce level remains relatively flat to down, just given the optimization in workforce and utilization? Ravi Kumar : The way I see it is there is opportunity for us to increase billable utilization, and I think there is some more headroom for me to do that. And as I continue to do that, we all want to hit end of a runway on increased utilization. That's when you will see a flip on how you need more headcount to increase billable headcount. So I've said this in my last quarter as well that there was a cushion for us to increase utilization, billable utilization, that also contributed to our margin trajectory a bit. And I think we have some more headroom to increase our operational efficiency to run our business so that we can then get to a point where we then start to increase our net headcount. What also is important is we've also had a good trend of lower attrition. In fact, we ended up with 19.9% on a trailing 12 months, which is 3 percentage points lower than last quarter and almost 11 percentage points lower than Y-on-Y. And as we can keep that down, it will also help us to keep the headcount up. And then as we get to the other end of the NextGen cycle, it will kind of help. So I think we have some headroom for operational efficiency to conduct more billable work before we start to see headcount increase. Bryan Bergin : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next question, Rayna Kumar with UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon. My name is [indiscernible] I'm dialing in for Rayna. I had a question around generative AI. So the benefits of GenAI have been widely discussed but we haven't heard as much about the potential risks. Given that GenAI can potentially improve the internal productivity, do you think there's a risk to the top line over the medium term from like short contract lengths or pricing pressures? Ravi Kumar : This industry has always had productivity tools. If you go back to the last 20, 25 years, productivity tools have been a way to differentiate, and it has very nicely got baked into our estimation model and then subsequently our execution model. And in addition to labor arbitrage, those productivity tools were the reason why our clients actually came to us because we had capability, we had -- we, of course, had capacity and we had productivity tooling to help them to deliver projects. I would say the advent of automation technologies in the last, I would believe, 5 years or so, including robotic process automation has been a continual embedment into our services. And I want to highlight that the universe we operate in is no longer tech spend of enterprises. The universe we operate in is operations spend of enterprises because technology is deeply embedded into operations. So these tools -- embedding these tools has been -- the industry as well as Cognizant has been very habituated to it. I mean, the ones who do it more are the ones who benefit out of it, and they then bake it into the estimation models. And the estimation models then allow you to stay more competitive than your peers to win business. And then as you win the business, you then keep working on engineering more so that you stay ahead of the curve. GenAI in a way has been a bigger inflection point. It's not different in that continuum but it's a much bigger inflection point. It is a complete game changer. So my belief is, and at least on behalf of Cognizant, I would say, we want to embrace that as much, to make it an opportunity for us for the future. If you don't embrace it, it's going to become a threat for you. If you embrace it and create that technology arbitrage I spoke about, it will allow us to get our clients to partner with us, even get our clients to partner with us at points where our -- at points where they believe that they could in-source. They would potentially outsource because they see us as a unique way to bring productivity to them. So I'm excited about the fact that this is going to be an opportunity. And it's a tectonic shift in the way our operating model will be. Operator : Thank you. Next question, Jamie Friedman with SIG. Please go ahead. James Friedman : Hi, I'm just curious as to -- in terms of the environment for the second half, what do you see as the factors that could put you, say, towards the higher or lower end of the guidance, with furloughs contemplated potentially for the fourth quarter? Jan Siegmund : Yes. We -- well, we try to give guidance that reflects at the midpoint our true expectations of what we achieve. So that's really our core belief. And the elements that we are watching carefully in the next couple of quarters are the scaling of the implementation of a couple of our large contracts that we signed. Those are complex deals that need to be rolled out in partnership with our clients. And that can be just the practicalities of a complex project can give delays or can give you positive news. So that's something that I'm very carefully watching. And certainly, there could be a theoretical path that some of these projects scale a little faster than we anticipated and that would give us some upside. But also in the quarter, we have observed this economic uncertainty hitting us, and you always get also some unanticipated bad news that happens. Certain deals get either canceled or scaled down or less visible, smaller deals just dissipate into nothing. So the general economic environment and the climate of our clients, and Ravi just gave you the assessment, we kind of feel that, that pressure will continue in the second two quarters on discretionary spend. That puts the pressure on it. And so in a sense, it's really a balanced outlook that I have. We are lucky that we are able to add the revenue stream of large deals into our revenue mix compared to our competitors in our market. We didn't have that last year, and so this is a truly incremental opportunity for us. But as everybody, we are facing also with a downward pressure in the rest of our portfolio. So I think the outlook that I gave is a fair and balanced view of the expectations that we have. James Friedman : Okay, thank you for that. And for my follow-up. Jan, that's a great answer. But just wondering could you double click on the assumptions by vertical? I realize you don't guide by vertical but, are at a higher level, any of these contemplated to be above or below the corporate average? Jan Siegmund : Yes. I think the one that what we're trying to signal in my comments also is that we feel that for the next couple of quarters, we're going to continue to see the pressure in Financial Services performing below our own. I hope, basically, but then the reality of a sector that has shown weakness really, I think, across in our industry. I don't anticipate that to change. And there's some strength, as you saw in the quarter and now have strength on a relative basis in Healthcare. And that reflects our strong market position that we have with our clients in Healthcare. So those would be the two big factors. Those trends are relatively consistent, I think, with what we have seen in the first two quarters of the year. James Friedman : Thank you. Operator : Next question, Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. And Jan, congrats on the retirement news. I want to ask on the booking success, especially on the larger deals you have been talking about here. What changes are working? Is there a way to rank that for us because we get a lot of questions on pricing, of course? Where does pricing rank amongst all the factors with you winning on the larger deal side? And is there any impact here on gross margins for the second half to consider? Jan Siegmund : I think from my perspective, pricing is definitely a very important factor. All these deals are -- or the vast, vast majority of these deals is competitive and you just have to be in the range of the expectations and meet the clients. And that is kind of table fixed. The commitment that the company brings to the table as we now compete for these large deals, from Ravi at the top to the entire team, from our markets to our integrated service lines is really different and I think has made a difference in winning the deals. Our clients have seen the commitment that we are making and the importance that we are giving to their specific deals just by the, I think, pure exposure and access to our teams and then obviously, the strength of our solutions that we have brought to the table. So it's that whole package that plays into it. I would say these deals that you have seen here in the quarter and really starting in the year, a little bit stronger focused on traditional deals, focusing on cost takeout and some on consolidation, are more classic deals, bread-and-butter type deals, large in nature but that have made the portfolio of those wins. Maybe Ravi, you add a little? Ravi Kumar : Yes. So large deals come with a very different rhythm, right? We have made sure that we have an outreach now to our -- to a chance, I mean, partners, hyperscalers, deal advisories and a whole bunch of players in the mix. The second is our ability to build institutional infrastructure because a lot of deals don't just need the heavy lifting upstream. They need the heavy lifting downstream as well. So that you price them to win but you deliver them to margins. Our ability to put all of that together, I think the company had it before. I have kind of assembled it together and then we have strengthened it further. And our entrepreneurial spirit to go and tell our clients some provocative opportunities, which could create a win-win situation for our clients and us, and therefore, create value for the process, has helped us to create a large deal mindset or a growth mindset. And I'm very confident that, that's now a part of the muscle of the company. So as we continue to invest on deal infrastructure into the market, as well as the mindset to be provocative with your clients and support that bold vision by building downstream infrastructure, organizational infrastructure including the tooling on new age AI-led productivity, that's very important. The deals could be traditional but the levers you press could be relatively new. I mean, the amount of automation infrastructure, the amount of AI infrastructure you could use to actually create straight-through processing and operations kind of work and create higher productivity run, maintain as well as build businesses for our clients, I think, is -- it's a new lever. And I think we -- I'm confident that we are ahead of the curve and therefore, we are competitive in the market to win these deals. Tien- Tsin Huang : Perfect. Thank you both on the thoughts. Operator : We've come to the end of the Q&A session. I would like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks. Tyler Scott : Great. Thank you very much, Stacey, and thank you all for joining us tonight. We look forward to catching up with you on our next earnings call. Talk to you soon.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's third quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to cover 3 topics : our third quarter results, the demand environment and a brief update on our strategic priorities. We are pleased with the company's continued progress in the third quarter, during which clients remained cautious amid economic uncertainty and discretionary spend was under pressure. Q3 revenue came in at $4.9 billion, within our guidance range. We saw sequential revenue growth of 20 basis points year-over-year. Revenue grew 0.8% as reported or a modest decline of 20 basis points in constant currency. Our adjusted operating margin of 15.5% exceeded our expectations, mostly reflecting savings from our next generation program which remains on track as well as from our operational discipline and the timing of spend on investment opportunities. We recorded another quarter of bookings growth, up approximately 9% year-over-year. We ended Q3 with a record trailing 12-month bookings growth of $26.9 billion, up 16% year-over-year and a strong book-to-bill of 1.4x. We have sustained our large deal momentum through Q3. Approximately 30% of our in-quarter Q3 bookings were large deals and 3 of these deals exceeded $100 million each. I believe we are getting progressively better at building a creative deal generation engine and solutioning large deals. I am especially encouraged to see our continued decline in attrition. Trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our tech services business declined to 16.2%, down about 4 percentage points sequentially and down 13 points year-over-year. This decline in attrition was a positive factor in our just completed annual client Net Promoter Score survey which showed significant improvement year-over-year and hit a historic high for Cognizant. Clients let us know that leadership, account management and delivery are especially important to them. And the survey results show that in these areas, we're doing a great job. This assessment of how clients perceive Cognizant underscores the interdependence of the employee and client experience that gives us confidence that the changes we are making will help strengthen the portfolio over the long run. While Jan will cover our performance at a business segment level, I want to offer a quick word about financial services. We continue to reposition our Financial Services segment, while responding to an increasingly challenged demand environment. One of the ways we are striving to reinvigorate growth is through a sharply focused subindustry go-to-market approach in the Americas directly by highly experienced leaders. We believe this change will increase our agility and deepen our domain expertise. Let's turn to the demand environment and what I'm hearing from clients. Clients remain focused on efficiency initiatives to reduce costs and consolidate providers as they increase their productivity and resilience and we are helping them do so. This should, in turn, enable them to underwrite their continuing investment in digital transformation. For example, during the quarter, we expanded our relationship with Lineage, a global leader in temperature-controlled logistics to help build an industry-leading operating platform and establish a plan to support their operations through automation and infrastructure management. We also established a new multiyear relationship with Swedish firm, Intrum. We expect to provide end-to-end digital integration and core modernization services for their credit management technology platform. To dive deeper into clients' long-term objectives and discover new ways to strengthen our partnership with them, Cognizant held a 2-day Discovery Summit last month for about 130 of our North America clients, our first large-scale client gathering in more than 4 years. We discussed the transformative power of generative AI and how we believe it can reshape every industry. We showed clients how to apply generative AI to create more connected, collaborative and responsive relationships with their customers. We also ran live use cases at Cognizant's new AI platform, showing generative AI working alongside legacy data and machine learning models to rapidly create end-to-end AI use cases to tackle client KPIs. As mentioned last quarter, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next 3 years, focusing on areas such as platform modernization infrastructure, recruiting and upskilling. To that end, we opened a dedicated AI innovation studio in London. And later this year, we expect to OpenAI studios in New York, Dallas and Bangalore. We have trained about 55,000 of our employees in generative AI this year and have an additional 40,000 employees from all levels of our company registered in pursuing training on Gen AI. We have also invested in AI partnerships and experimental infrastructure to support early client engagements. We believe clients will depend on partners like Cognizant to generate significant productivity gains through automated AI-powered platforms for design, engineering and operations. This shift in client behavior further validates a recently refined strategy which is aimed at strengthening Cognizant's differentiation to help drive growth. Our strategy is focused on 3 imperatives. First, we are resolved to be an industry-led, creating value for clients by integrating technology with industry use cases to drive business outcomes. We are embedding industry expertise across our value chain and select industries. We are developing more enterprise scale platforms designed for industry and operational use cases. Partnerships have a major role to play here. We are focused on expanding our partner ecosystem across a range of technology providers. Among them, hyperscalers, cloud providers, enterprise software companies, digital software enterprises and emerging start-ups. We believe this partner ecosystem will enable us to enhance our integrated offering by combining third-party products with our service solutions, helping to deliver enterprise-wide digital transformation. We believe this strategy as a full stack provider opens new and significant managed services opportunities. Second, given today's more heterogeneous technology landscape and the desire of many clients to build their own technology muscle, we focus on operating a highly flexible business model to meet clients where they are in their digital transformation journeys. We can support them across a range of project types, whether that's structured deals, traditional managed services, build-operate-transfer, co-innovation, partner solutions or large technology transformations. And to help clients strengthen their technology expertise, we can either lend our human capital along with our human capital value chain which includes learning, development, automation and AI infrastructure and more. Our business model flexibility is well suited to the changing nature of large deals where we see increasing demand for bundling services, often a combination of software people takeover infrastructure and services. These deals have a potential to bring Cognizant into the heart of clients' business landscape, putting us in a strong position to capture future services opportunities. Our third imperative is to enable more intimate levels of client collaboration and co-innovation. This effort grows out of our heritage of client centricity and grassroots innovation. Given the scale and diversity of our global teams, we believe we have a potential to harvest an abundance of ideas, big and small, that can contribute to our clients' focus. Inspired by our BlueBolt's grassroots innovation movement launched in quarter 2, more than 35,000 of our employees have generated 75,000 ideas. We have already implemented about 14,000 of these ideas, nearly 6,000 of which are client-facing. A strengthened ability to co-innovate with clients is especially valuable as they grapple with understanding and applying generative AI. During the quarter, we launched Telco Assurance 360; a cloud-based AI-powered solution built on ServiceNow and designed to provide telcos with real-time visibility into network issues and fast proactive resolution through AI-powered analytics. We also signed a multiyear agreement with a leading provider of digital and cloud-enabled solutions that are vital to the administration of health and human services programs across the U.S. Cognizant will serve as the client's sole global IT services and operations partner to help drive transformation at scale. We also provide the client with access to our AI, machine learning and generated AI tools, along with our TriZetto platform to advance revenue growth, increase administrative efficiency and improve the member experience. What's more, we are expanding our strategic collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies to jointly implement the AI-based solutions at the edge as a part of our Car-to-Cloud initiative. We encourage our clients who want to transform their businesses by being AI first to begin the journey by modernizing the data architecture, cloud infrastructure and core business applications. Today, we are running more than 150-plus early client engagements that incorporate the use of generative AI. Some of the examples of this work include general productivity use cases related to writing code, code analysis and troubleshooting, knowledge management and translating product specs into natural chat or speech, business specific use cases for call center automation product prototyping, audience prediction, claims management, medical scribing and research and development; and domain specific use cases like onboarding new employees, validating deep documents and financial statement planning analytics. We have 300-plus additional opportunities in our pipeline that we are planning to scale. Let's turn to a quick update on our 3 long-term strategic objectives, starting with becoming an employer of choice in our industry. I see Cognizant as a human capital company, first; and a technology company, second. Everything we do hinges on the quality, dedication and scale of our talent base. That's why it is so consequential that our voluntary attrition continues to fall, putting us on par with the industry average. We expect further improvement in our attrition in quarter 4. It's also worth noting that in quarter 3, we had a net sequential head count increase for the first time in several quarters. As a human capital company, we are determined to help improve the lives of workers around the world. With that in mind, we announced a ground-breaking training initiative yesterday called Cognizant Synapse Initiative, a job training endeavor, is aimed at empowering more than 1 million individuals with the advanced technology skills, including generative AI and that, they will need to thrive in the digital economy. We intend to build a consortium of partners for training and jobs which will then employ individuals who have upskilled through our Synapse Initiative. Our next performance objective is to accelerate revenue growth. When I joined Cognizant in January, I said large deals are one of my top priorities. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased to see our continuing large deals momentum which is underpinned by the work we are doing to improve the capabilities required to seed, shape and sell large deals and our ongoing investment in the client-facing roles needed for driving growth. These efforts have helped to partially offset what remains a softer discretionary spending environment and provides new growth opportunities following last year's muted bookings growth. Our third performance objective is to ensure operational excellence across the company. We remain focused on simplifying our operations, including a sales and delivery structure so we can continue to become more agile and get closer to clients and their unique business challenges. In general, we are operating with fewer layers, optimizing our day-to-day operations with enhanced systems and tools and working to streamline our processes and automate information flows using AI. Differentiation in the tech services industry happens at the clients' side and the project level, making relationships and strong execution key. That's why I've invested so much time in meeting with over 270 clients so far this year, building trust and learning all I can about Cognizant can deliver more value to them. Over the past 3 quarters, I believe Cognizant has made meaningful progress on our long-term priorities. While we have a lot of work ahead, we also have much to be proud of. This includes continuing large deals momentum, improved employee and client satisfaction scores, declining attrition, the scaling of our industry leadership with a platform-centered approach, heightened operational discipline and the launch of a grassroots innovation movement. Looking ahead, we believe the soft demand environment is unlikely to see a rapid rebound. Therefore, we expect clients to continue tempering the discretionary spending as we begin the new year. Given that market reality, we remain focused on winning efficiency-led large deals aimed at cost takeout and vendor consolidation which can offset current pressure on discretionary spending. Our focus on operating discipline and our year-to-date progress on the NextGen program gives us confidence that we can meet our expectation to deliver our 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion next year. Jan will share more detail on NextGen in a moment. Taking a longer view with my read of business history, periods of great uncertainty and periods of change rarely coincide. Today, I believe we are in just such a period of simultaneous great uncertainty and deep-seated change. The uncertainty is being compounded by a number of intertwined domestic and international risks. What can become a transformative change is being driven primarily by new general-purpose technologies with immense power such as generative AI which I believe could become as ubiquitous and consequential for business as society as the Internet did 3 decades ago. I expect this reality will leave most clients. However, focused they are on navigating uncertainty with no choice but to make some big bets if they are not to be left behind by the peers. I believe Cognizant is in a position -- in a great position to prepare them for this future, whether by helping them achieve significant savings to underwrite investments in transformation or by helping them build their own technology muscle which can include becoming fully AI-ready. In closing, you are all aware that we recently appointed Jatin Dalal to be Cognizant's next Chief Financial Officer and we're excited that he will be joining us in December. Since this is Jan's last earnings call with Cognizant, I want you all to know that what a powerful partner he's been to me across so many dimensions : strategic, financial, operational and cultural. He left a positive and indelible mark on our global organization and I'm especially grateful that he agreed to stay with us until early next year to ensure smooth transition to Jatin. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan to provide additional details on this quarter. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Ravi, for the kind words. I want to thank all of our associates around the world for welcoming me into the Cognizant family 3 years ago and for making my time here such a memorable experience. It has been a pleasure working with so many great people at Cognizant and all of you on this call. I'm confident that I'm leaving the company in great hands with Jatin, who many of you know, is an accomplished CFO and an experienced IT services executive. Over the next several months, I look forward to working with Ravi the Jatin and the rest of the leadership team to ensure a smooth transition. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. We delivered revenue within our guidance range despite a soft discretionary spending environment and ongoing economic uncertainty. Adjusted operating margin exceeded our expectations, reflecting savings from our NextGen program and the timing of investments which is driving some modest upside in our guidance range that I will touch on later. We were also pleased to deliver another quarter of solid bookings growth which continue to be driven by larger longer-duration engagements. Moving on to the details of the quarter; third quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of 0.2% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue grew 0.8% but declined 0.2% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of contributions from our acquisitions. Similar to last quarter, our 9% quarterly bookings growth was driven primarily by larger and longer-duration deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, duration is up over 50% from the prior year period. At the same time, we are continuing to experience softness in the smaller short-duration contracts, driven by weak discretionary spending. This dynamic has negatively impacted our near-term revenue but we believe will put us in a better position to accelerate revenue growth in the future when discretionary spending improves. Moving on to segment results for the third quarter where all growth rates discussed will be in year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 4%, reflecting the softer demand environment across regions and subindustries. This decline was partially offset by the benefit from the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offering strategy that Ravi mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks. Looking ahead, we believe the market remains challenging and we expect the macroeconomic uncertainty will again have a meaningful impact for this segment in the fourth quarter. That said, we are working hard to correct what is in our control and I believe we can make meaningful progress under the new subindustry go-to-market approach and leadership. Health Sciences revenue declined 1%. Growth was negatively impacted by a large renewal that we signed earlier this year with a payer customer which resulted in a lower revenue run rate but meaningfully improved profitability. In addition, several of our larger customers have been impacted by their own company-specific and end market challenges which has in turn led to softer discretionary spending. Products and Resources revenue grew less than 1%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions, strong performance from utility clients driven by their grid modernization investments and growth among automotive clients in Europe. Growth in these areas was partially offset by pressure in manufacturing. Communications, Media and Technology revenue increased 7%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new contract awards. This includes the expansion of current engagement with our largest customers in this portfolio, who are launching innovative vertical solutions and leveraging our expertise in these areas to rapidly scale globally. Continuing with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q3, North America revenue was down less than 1%, driven by declines within our Financial Services and Health Sciences portfolios. This was partially offset by growth in CMT and Products and Resources. Our global growth markets or GGM which include all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 1%. Growth was led by Europe which grew 3% and included strong growth within CMT, Life Sciences customers within our Health Sciences segment and Products and Resources. Finally, the resale of third-party products contributed 120 basis points to our overall revenue growth in Q3, the majority of which was in the Financial Services segment. Now, moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $72 million of costs related to our NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 150 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.5%. Similar to last quarter, our adjusted operating margin included the negative impact from increased compensation costs attributable to our 2 merit cycles over the last 12 months. This was partially offset by savings from our NextGen program and tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.7%. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.04 and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.16. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, or net cash of $1.7 billion. DSO of 77 days increased 2 days sequentially and 3 days year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q3 was $755 million which brings year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1.4 billion. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to represent approximately 90% of net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $147 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 11 million shares for about $700 million. At quarter end, we had $2.1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our forward outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.69 billion to $4.82 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 3.1% to 0.3% or a decline of 4% to 1.2% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a benefit of approximately 90 basis points as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. Our Q4 revenue guidance range is wider than our historical practice, reflecting a heightened level of uncertainty regarding client discretionary spending and recent pace of decision-making heading into the end of the year. For the full year, we expect revenue will be in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.4 billion which is down approximately 0.7% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency, as we do not expect a material impact from foreign exchange rates. This compares to our prior guidance range of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion or negative 1% to plus 1% growth in constant currency. We still expect inorganic contribution to be approximately 100 basis points. Our NextGen program remains on track and our assumptions for cost savings are unchanged from last quarter. I'm also pleased to share that we are further reducing our expectations for NextGen costs. We now expect to incur $300 million in total charges versus $350 million previously, with $200 million this year versus $250 million previously. The reduction is a result of lower real estate cost as we are now -- as we now expect to incur about $100 million related to the net consolidation of office space in 2023 versus $150 million previously. This reflects lower expected third-party costs associated with the real estate exits. As we have spoken about previously, we still intend to reinvest the majority of the NextGen savings and growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond. Moving on to adjusted operating margin; we are modestly increasing our guidance to 14.7% which is the high end of our prior range. As a reminder, our Q4 operating margin is typically seasonally lower than Q3 levels. We still anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $115 million and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 24% and versus the range of 23% to 24% previously provided. In addition, we now expect to deploy approximately $1 billion on share repurchases in 2023 versus our prior expectations of approximately $800 million which assumes an additional $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In total, we expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2023. Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.39 in to $4.42 versus $4.25 and $4.48 previously, reflecting our updated expectations for revenue and adjusted operating margin. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Bryan Bergin : So I appreciate you offering the early commentary on the 2024 margin expansion potential. I just want to clarify first that, that's off the base of that 14.7% raised adjusted margin here. And then understanding the environment's quite dynamic. But based on what you're seeing in bookings activity and deal duration and backlog behavior and pipeline, can you share any thoughts or guardrails for 2024 growth now as well? Jan Siegmund : Yes. So Bryan, I'll catch the easy one first. Yes, the reaffirmation of our intent to expand our margins by 20 to 40 basis points is up midpoint of our expectation or our point of landing at 14.7%, so that's a good assumption. For the bookings momentum, Ravi might be giving you a little bit of color around what we're seeing in the markets. Ravi Kumar : Yes. So Bryan, I've been saying this for the last 2 quarters and this quarter as well. Our deal momentum and our bookings momentum is very strong. We are continuing to see good traction. I've spoken about 2 swim lanes. There is a swim lane on transformation-led deals and I've spoken about cost efficiency, vendor consolidation, efficiency-led kind of deals. We see more in this category versus the transformation but we also see this category underwriting the savings to the transformation. So a lot of times -- remember, one of the things I spoke on my -- in my initial remarks is this is a period of uncertainty and change coming together. So clients are navigating the 2. There is change, significant change ahead of us. And clients are wondering who funds the CapEx cycle. So the ability to take cost out and underwrite the savings to the transformation, I think, is a great template and I think we are well positioned for that. What happens in the short run, though, is the discretionary spend has really fallen over the last 3 quarters. I mean, it's been very, very soft. So the deals we have won in the first and the second quarter, we have to backfill that as well as you know that large deals actually come with a gestation period to get to the peak levels of their potential. So we are hopeful that the large deal momentum continues. It continues over the next year. And of course, the deals we won this year will contribute more to the next year. What I don't know is what happens to discretionary spend. I mean, the environment is very soft. So we'll have to wait and see how the discretionary happens but I'm very optimistic about how the large deal momentum is, especially on cost takeout, vendor consolidation efficiency-led deals that we are seeing across the spectrum. And I think we are winning well. You can see the bookings momentum this year. So the one which is unknown is discretionary. That's the piece we are not sure of. Hopefully, as these deals -- as the cost takeouts continue, if they kind of trigger CapEx cycles for transformation, hopefully, that happens. And if that happens, we are going to catch it early on. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Understood. And then a follow-up here, just on the resale piece of the third-party products. I think you mentioned 120 bps in the quarter, how does that compare to maybe the average over the last 4 to 6 quarters? And are you assuming resale amounts in the forward outlook? Ravi Kumar : Yes. So Bryan, I had spoken about a strategy of large deals with all -- in all swim lanes, all the way from productivity to people takeover to software-led to efficiency-led. And I've spoken about it, that our participation is going to be in all of them. Now sometimes what happens in these situations is you have upstream software coming in and you have downstream services coming in. And it's the timing. I mean, for software upstream, there is significant downstream services which is attached to it. So we've had 60 basis points before in the year that we have added in this quarter. But what you really have to look at is the timing of these deals. Now in quarter 2, we announced a strategic partnership with ServiceNow for $1 billion, a joint partnership. And we have offering which actually has a bundle of software, reusable assets and services attached to it and it is a managed services model. And that's the opportunity we are pursuing. And as the large deals come, you're always going to see the timing. In one particular quarter you could have software, in a particular quarter, you could have services downstream. So it's -- that's the process of how you see this. Sometimes there are people takeover, sometimes there is asset takeover, sometimes there is productivity upfront and effort upfront, sometimes you have transition upfront and you have services on the downstream. So it's hard to pick which quarter you're going to see this. But the nature of large deals gives you that flow, if I may, in terms of how they get constructed quarter-on-quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I would say, just before I start, Jan, yes, if this is going to be your last earnings call, thank you for all the work and effort over the years. The question is probably since you come to Cognizant, you made a number of changes. You talked about large deal infrastructure. It seems to be in a good place. But how would you rate Cognizant's ability to win and be competitive in the discretionary work that isn't there now but you will need to be competitive in there when it does come back because that, it seems to me, is going to be the difference next year between, say, low single digits and mid-single digits? Jan Siegmund : Yes, I'll give a little bit of an answer but I think Ravi will be adding much more color to this. The overall position that we have in -- with our clients, I think, has really meaningfully improved over the last 3 or 4 quarters. We have -- in the Net Promoter Scores that Ravi was reporting on is kind of really the statistical leverage of this coming in at a historic high. But we can just see from the comments and the number of escalations is another one. We haven't talked in the call about it but obviously, that has been in parallel coming down. So the service quality has been better. That's partially fueled by low attrition rates. So the overall relationships that we have with our clients have really very meaningfully improved. And I think we have embraced kind of a philosophy of meeting the client where the client has needs. And right now, the needs are more on the structural cost improvement and productivity type, vendor consolidation type deals and discretionary spending has taken the back row. We want to be there for our clients when that discretionary spend comes and the transformative deals are popping up and going part of it. So we're going to be having deep relationships with our clients and the high focus on client relationships and I feel we should be ready for that to do so. Ravi? Ravi Kumar : Yes. So thank you, Jan. I think very well said. So Ashwin, thank you for the question. You're absolutely right. This is -- the large deals muscle is consistently improved over the last 3 quarters. This is something which did not exist before. I came in, in January and built that muscle and I'm very confident that we can sustain it. We've sustained it for 3 quarters and we're very confident we can do that for the future. And we have actually now invested on institutional infrastructure to support it all the way from productivity to automation infrastructure to the classical levers which you apply in managed services and cost takeout kind of deals. We did have good muscle on discretionary before. I mean, the transformation infrastructure of the company is strong. As the spend comes back, I'm very confident that because we have good engagement with our clients, we are also going to naturally be the providers for discretionary spend. You could, in some ways, use the strength of our current deal momentum to support the discretionary -- the historic discretionary muscle of the company. Now, I think Jan raised an important point which I think is very, very important. We ran the Net Promoter Score survey this year and we have historic high scores. And there are 3 or 4 things which have come out of that. Our attrition rates have gone down. They've gone down and they're trending downwards, even into the next quarter. Our employee satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. Our client satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. Customers are engaging with us much more over a variety of swim lanes which means when the discretionary comes back, each of these swim lanes is going to contribute back to that -- back to the strength of those relationships, so. In fact, there's one thing which really registered with me on the Net Promoter Score survey which is about our customers saying Cognizant is back in some form. I'm paraphrasing it, Cognizant is back or the mojo is back. I think that is the momentum which will allow us to get back the discretionary spend as and when our customers start to spending it. So, I think we have set this foundation, a very strong foundation. The 2 things which our clients have spoken about, as I said, Cognizant is back. The second is we have a much more stable leadership, good execution, agile responses and much lower -- significantly much lower turnover of employees. And these would actually rub off on the discretionary as it comes back. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Good to hear. The second question, again, it's a good job on the margin performance. The question I have is on the deals that you are signing, you mentioned that there is now need to be flexible in terms of structuring, in terms of bringing various partners together and so on and so forth. Does any of what you are doing today to get new deals affect how you think of future margin potential? Jan Siegmund : Yes. So when we sign up the deals, obviously, they are in a competitive environment and we apply a disciplined approach to those deals in order to keep a balance of growth and continued margin expansion. And it played out this quarter, Ashwin, really, to the benefit of the margin because we had anticipated some investments a little bit stronger than we actually needed in this quarter on, for example, investments into larger deals with maybe initially lower margins and we didn't meet those investments. So I think this view that we have about very carefully layering our large deal portfolio and supporting it with disciplined approach on non-billable and administrative cost controls is playing out. And I think we're entering that year, next year with that confidence that, that balance is intact. And I think I mentioned it in our prior call, in the large deal, expected business profile that we do have deals that we expect to exhibit lower margin profile. But we also have deals that have very meaningfully -- actually, renewals of historic deals that have very meaningfully improved our gross margin profile in the renegotiation. So in the net profile, the impact has been actually more muted and that may not continue all into the future. But for now, it has been a very balanced outcome, I would say. Ravi Kumar : So Ashwin, we are -- the first thing we just changed is we are participating on deals across the swim lanes I just spoke about and we are competitive enough and we have built the institutional infrastructure to support execution and actually better our performance to the metrics which we commit when we win those deals. So we have to keep strengthening that. This is always a work in progress. We have to continue to stay competitive and we have to continue to price them to win and deliver them to margins as I call it. And we continue to keep our competitiveness by strengthening our productivity tools and our automation tools and our AI tools. So this is an ongoing process and you have to keep changing the baseline because as you want to be competitive, you have to continue to keep working on the productivity levers. Unlike in the past, where these productivity levers were labor-oriented or, I would say, they were classical, now they are technology oriented. And hence, we have a unique opportunity to create some nonlinearity. In the past, we did not participate in those deals. Now we are participating and winning them, so the confidence has been really high. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Tyler DuPont : This is Tyler DuPont on for Jason. I wanted to ask about the demand environment you're seeing as we start -- as we look into the end of 2023 and as we start to look into even the beginning of 2024. When looking at the updated revenue guidance being narrowed, I'm just curious what incremental trends you've seen over the past couple of months, whether that's changes in win rates, ramp times or softness, whether that's a particular service offering, vertical, geography, anything like that, that may be driving the additional cautious stance. Ravi Kumar : I think the cautiousness is related to the uncertainty around the discretionary spend. I think everybody in the market is facing it, including us. What we are certain is our deal momentum and our large deals and our bookings continues to be very vibrant. What we do not know, especially in a seasonally slow quarter, quarter 4 is always a seasonally slow quarter because of furloughs as well. What we are unable to predict is how much of the discretionary gets impacted and how much of our large deal momentum will get neutralized by this. And to that extent, we felt it was only fair that we keep a risk -- we keep the risk adjusted to what we believe could be soft in quarter 4. Tyler DuPont : Okay, that's very helpful. And then, I guess, just to kind of go even just a little bit deeper into visibility into 2024 budgeting decisions. I know it's still early and you don't give guidance on '24 or anything yet. But just given the current rather choppy macro environment that we're seeing and have seen, can you just speak to sort of the conversations you're having with clients regarding '24 budgets, sort of how does that visibility compare with this time last year? And is there more certainty in certain verticals than others? Or just any clarity there would be very appreciated. Jan Siegmund : Yes, I'll jump in for -- number one, I think we actually kind of gave a lot of -- half of the P&L we already disclosed because we're really committing to our 40 to 20 basis points of margin expansion. And so now the revenue range, going forward, will be subject to our guidance call in 3 months. But if you -- what we know today is, as Ravi said, that I think, gradually, the economic uncertainty has increased and discretionary spending has softened throughout the last 3 quarters. So we have seen that trend not stopping yet. And part of our lack of knowledge, if it's stopping in the fourth quarter, or if it's going to turn around early in the year or later in the year is really not known to us to be quite honest as well. And clients will be forming their budgets and their IT budget at the same time as we are developing our own budget. So this is kind of always a simultaneous process. What has improved for us is obviously the visibility of the longer-term deals that are now in our portfolio and that they will be contributing and scaling in '24, so that gives us a little bit of a planning safety. And then we have to just kind of really make assumptions on -- and you can do that for your own self. It's like, are you bullish on the discretionary spend and economic development on next year, or are you the same, or more bearish. And I think that will then determine the revenue outcome for next year to do so. I think that's really what we will go under. We haven't finished that process and -- but in February, beginning of February, we'll commit to that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : I just want to drill in, maybe for Jan, the TCV versus ACV and how to consider that in the short term the next couple of quarters. I know the book-to-bill is quite high at 1.4. But in terms of translation, with this mix shift toward larger deal, how would you guide us there between ACV and TCV? Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Tien-Tsin, for that. The -- I gave, in my remarks, this duration comment. And I think we had, in previous calls and historically, disclosed that our average duration was roughly around 2 years and now our duration in the bookings is about 3 years, so it's a meaningful increase. And obviously, then ACV, the annual revenue expectations for this is down. And that's actually -- on top, you have also that mix shift. The larger deals need some scaling. So they have -- the ACV is not completely symmetrical because in the first year, you're building up the infrastructure and you're starting transferring assets and do your thing, what you need to do to get ready. So some of the ACV of the larger deals is delayed and will come in '24. And at the same time, we have a decline of deals below $5 million of TCV which are typically deals that always translate in here to revenue. So those things together are basically a 90% explanation of what you see in our revenue trend actuals in the last few quarters. And I'm anticipating unless the discretionary spend is coming back, roaring that, that won't change. Now, so the -- we're entering the year with all these moving parts, probably in a position that is not too different from last year in terms of visibility of revenue going forward, so. And mysteriously, it balances out because some of our larger deals now maturing and scaling, having a little bit better contribution to next year. And then, we'll -- as I said in my prior answer, we'll have our estimate to make on how short-term demand is going to be developing. So the net of it is that factors within the setup have changed compared to the beginning of '23 but in '24, we are kind of approximately in a similar position to stock. Ravi Kumar : Just to add to that, what Jan said, because we didn't have large deals in the previous year, what -- the slope it had of this year in terms of realizing this year did not happen. What's going to happen for next year, though, is you're going to have tail velocity of deals we won this year which will accrue revenues next year. And then -- and that's a change because we have consistently done it from quarter 1, quarter 2, now quarter 3. We have done -- the percentage of our large deals has gone up. And the percentage of new in these large deals has also gone up, so that's a positive change. The question -- the unknown piece is the discretionary spend. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Keith Bachman : I wanted to follow up on that set of comments. And as you think about next year, you've talked a lot about the large deal program ramping and contributing to revenue growth and mentioned that discretionary is still a headwind. Can you give us a sense of proportionality of how much discretionary is of either revenues, bookings, any kind of metric and how that's changed today from what it is at the beginning year? Because it seems to me, as we start to think about growth, that percentage of low duration deals, if you will, or discretionary spend is at a level such it would be less of a headwind next year as you anniversary the March quarter when it first impacted Cognizant and many others. Ravi Kumar : It's a difficult question to answer now on how it's going to be next year. I mean, the swim lane of large deals we are doing and then that is 30% of bookings. The swim lane of large deals we're doing, always the savings of those large deals, some of the smarter clients are not necessarily taking it to savings but they are actually underwriting it for transformation which means if some of them can trigger the CapEx cycles, then you're going to see some of that discretionary coming back because the savings you do on productivity will allow you to trigger the CapEx cycle. I mean, I spoke about 150-plus AI -- preliminary early AI engagements. The reality is if they have to scale up, you need the CapEx. The CapEx will either come because our clients have, themselves, navigated the uncertainty and got the CapEx covered, or they would use some of the savings from the cost cutting and the cost takeout they have done related to technology to leverage it into discretionary. I mean, many of my clients today, I've met 270 of them this year. They're not saying they want to take their IT budgets down. What they're really saying is, can you do more for less. And can you actually divert the savings to the transformation they're looking forward to and they're very, very anxious about the transformation because we are all living in this period of change. The issue is -- what I do not know is whether the economic and the overall environment which is really a headwind, is that going to change significantly next year? That's something that's hard to predict now. But if that uncertainty continues, you're obviously not going to see the discretionary spend coming back. But if you see that triggering positively, then you're going to see the savings of these cost takeout initiatives to move into transformation and that will trigger another cycle of spend which in turn, hopefully, will trigger revenue cycles for our clients which will then hopefully create a virtuous positive cycle. So it's a tricky one to answer. You need a trigger for the CapEx cycles of discretionary. And all the discretionary spend, as Jan mentioned, these are all deals between $0 to $10 million. They all get they all get realized within the same year because these are small deals. So it's a very unusual time, a time of uncertainty and a time of change coming simultaneously. So the cost takeout deals potentially can fund them and that's the point I'm making. And if they don't, then there are other triggers of CapEx cycles which have to fund them. Keith Bachman : Okay. Okay. Jan, I wanted to also thank you for all the work you've done over the last couple of years. And then direct to question, as you think about the 20 to 40 basis point range for margin improvement next year. I know you don't want to give metrics associated with revenue but just, how do you think about the upper end versus the lower end? In other words, is it as simple as discretionary comes back and that has greater OpEx leverage? Or is there anything else, puts and takes that we should be thinking about? And particularly, you did mention that the large deal ramps can and indeed, in many cases, have lower margin profiles. Just any puts and takes that you want us to think about as it relates to the 20 to 40 basis points range. Jan Siegmund : Look, we're entering the year with the NextGen initiative executing well and according to our plans. And we're going to have what were -- some impact in the third quarter but really not full run rate impact yet. And so we will have a lot of momentum on NextGen next year. So we offered the savings opportunity for '24 to -- for '25 to REIT, in real estate, $100 million savings. And you all have your own assumptions on our head count reduction program, easy to be calculated and that's a lot of efficiency that we can book on our side. I anticipate the revenue momentum is obviously the mix factor for us that will shift. And in that revenue growth factor that determines the scale of our SG&A development and other elements, it's kind of probably a big factor. And the second one I would give to you is the style and the execution of our large deal scaling. With larger deals, there is a little bit of risk factor just by the nature of their scope involved. And if we are executing well and the deals don't develop problems, that will help us to be very solid in our margin expectation. And if we run into some problems, maybe we'll need to invest a little bit more cost. So those will be the 2 major factors, I think, that we're going to be considering as we give our margin range and the substantiation of it. Ravi Kumar : Yes. So also just to add to what Jan said, the NextGen program really kicked off at the end of quarter 1. We had impact in quarter 2 and quarter 3. It will have a full year impact next year. I mean, the savings will accrue next year. And of course, the real estate savings come at the back end as well. So we have -- now we have -- we are going to look at incorporating that into our workings as we work out the next year next year margins. And that's one of the reasons why we reiterated that the 20 to 40 basis points we set early in this year. We probably have -- we wanted to reinforce that message that we can get that margin expansion which we earlier committed in the year. Operator : Our final question of the night will come from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. James Friedman : I was wondering if you could share some high-level observations, really, about in-sourcing trends. Is that any different than usual? Do you see acceleration or deceleration? And do you see that as friend or foe? Ravi Kumar : That's great question. I see that as a friend. In fact, I stated that if you carefully observe my initial comments, even before you asked this question, I had stated that if technology is strategic to our clients. And remember, technology was an enabler for our clients. Now it is strategic to them because is deeply embedded into their products. It is integral to the differentiation in the market. Every industry is a tech industry. We have to help our clients build their own technology muscle. And to help our clients build their own technology muscle, I think Cognizant is probably best suited to do so. Our entrepreneurial spirit, our flexible operating model, our co-creation attitude and our co-creation culture. We think, as companies build their own technology muscle, we will lend our human capital and I stated this in my remarks, that we would even lend this value chain of human capital which is not just the people to support their transformation but potentially lending our training infrastructure, our learning infrastructure, our ability to actually help them build their own captives if they want to, or global capability centers. And I think that is sticky because once you do so, you can even lend your automation infrastructure, AI infrastructure and actually take them through that maturity curve. So it's much more sticky than before. So I see this as an unique opportunity for Cognizant and we want to double down on this offering. James Friedman : And then, you emphasized in your prepared remarks and it did not go unnoticed the sequential increase in the head count. And you're one of the few companies, at least that I'm aware of, that's growing their head count. So my question about that is are you anticipating, I would assume increased utilization and realization from that head count? Because the commitment to the head count is what we think of as a leading indicator -- so -- but where are you planning to deploy those people? And what gives you the confidence to be growing them right now? Ravi Kumar : After very many quarters, we had sequential positive head count growth. Of course, it is a tiny number but it is reflective of the momentum of -- the commercial momentum of large deals and bookings. It is reflective of the needs for the future and it is reflective of the needs of the near future. So I'm very, very -- I'm very confident that if we continue on the deal booking momentum, we will have to increase our head count to fulfill and satisfy those programs. So it's encouraging -- it's a very encouraging indicator about how well our commercial momentum is shaping up. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Tyler Scott : Great. Thank you all very much for joining. We look forward to catching up next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to cover three topics. Cognizant's fourth quarter and full year results, an assessment of our progress in 2023, and a look ahead to our focus and outlook for 2024. I've been in the CEO role now for a full year and have used this 12 months to dig into the company's client relationships, operations, services portfolio, market environment, finances and culture. I've met with about 400 clients and established a regular cadence of listening to and speaking with our employees across the world. My full year immersion into everything, Cognizant has confirmed my belief in the high level of initiative and motivation of nearly 350,000 employees as well as my belief in the company's distinctive core strengths. I have confidence in our potential to increase our revenue growth, and I'll have more to say about this in a few minutes. Let's start with the fourth quarter where we delivered on our commitments while continuing to implement our cost management program. To call out three highlights. First, we executed well, delivering revenue within our guidance range despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures and meaningfully exceeded our adjusted operating margin expectations. Second, we made further progress on our goal to increase the percentage of large deals, new clients and business in the overall mix. And third, we saw continued improvement in our voluntary attrition. Q4 revenue of $4.8 billion was in line with the guidance range we provided last quarter. Year-over-year, Q4 revenue was down 1.7% as reported or down 2.4% in constant currency. The quarter developed much as we expected as clients remain cautious and limited the discretionary spending. Our Q4 adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was meaningfully stronger than we anticipated, driven by savings from our next-gen cost management program and better execution on our operational efficiencies. We sustained our large deal momentum in the quarter, winning seven deals exceeding $100 million each. Of these seven deals, two were new business and five were a mix of renewals and expansions. I am especially pleased to see our continued decline in employee attrition, trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our tech services business declined to 13.8%, that is down 2.4 percentage points sequentially and down 12 points year-over-year. Turning to the full year. Revenue of $19.4 billion was down slightly from the prior year and in line with the guidance we set on our Q3 call. A strong Q4 margin performance enabled us to achieve a full year adjusted operating margin of 15.1% compared with a guidance of approximately 14.7%. We ended Q4 with a trailing 12 months booking growth of $26.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.4x. For 2023, about 30% of our TCV exceeded 50 billion plus deals, compared with approximately 20% in the previous year. We signed 17 deals that exceeded $100 million TCV, $100 million TCV. Total TCV for deals above $100 million increased 42% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to this progress. We have reoriented our teams to large deal demand generation and execution across all service lines. We have strengthened our ability to seed (ph), shape and sell large deals. And we have made progress in industrializing delivery with automation and productivity tools to create repeatable solutions and enable a consistent and efficient delivery operating model for large deals. Turning to our business segments where Jatin will cover our financial performance, I want to comment on our two largest segments. In financial services, while responding to a demand environment that remains challenging. We are increasing our efforts to stimulate growth. We've installed new leaders in a number of key positions across the segment. We have invested in consulting and commercial resources and targets of industries and in partner relationships. We are also focused on expanding our service offerings and on enhancing our industry solutions powered by new technologies like Generative AI. In Health Sciences, as the healthcare industry continues to undergo major transformation, we believe Cognizant is well positioned to become the nucleus of an emerging healthcare ecosystem through our platform's data and solutions. With these dynamics in mind, we are investing in the expansion of our TriZetto platform and our healthcare BPaaS solution capabilities. We are also capitalizing on the opportunity Gen AI presents to the healthcare market. For instance, LLM can be used to streamline payer administrative processes, automate clinical documentation and enhance clinical decision support systems. I remain confident in the value of our health sciences portfolio provides to clients. For example, Fortrea recently chose Cognizant as its technology transformation partner to deploy a modern secure digital ecosystem to help bring treatments to patients faster while strengthening its position in the life sciences industry. And Takeda, a global biopharma company with whom we have had a long relationship has selected us to help modernize their infrastructure and application management in support of the digital transformation. Now let's turn to an assessment of how we move the company forward in 2023. To begin, we made considerable progress enhancing three core strengths that taken together, I believe, Cognizant set apart in the market. First, industry expertise. In 2023, we further deepened our expertise at the intersection of technology and industry use cases to deliver industry specific solutions in service of business outcomes. We also enhanced our collaboration and co-creation with clients and the broader partner ecosystem to stitch together industry-leading capabilities. A good example is our strategic partnership with ServiceNow to advance the adoption of AI-driven automation across industries. We are also collaborating with ServiceNow to enhance Cognizant's WorkNEXT modern workplace services solution with generative AI capabilities. WorkNEXT aims to provide more intuitive and personalized experiences for employees, while helping to better quantify and improve the return on experience for enterprise customers. A second core strength we are collaborative partners to our clients. As mentioned on our Q3 call, our annual client Net Promoter Score survey hit a historic high for Cognizant last year. Our empathy for clients as a part of our DNA and we believe we have become even better at listening carefully to, learning from, and working with clients to earn their trust, solve their problems and help them succeed. Third, we are passionate innovators. Last April, we launched Cognizant's Bluebolt grassroots innovation program calling on all our employees to help us solve client problems, look for unmet or latent client needs and challenge the status quo. And in just nine months, our employees generated more than 100,000 ideas, 21,000 of which we have already implemented. We expect to augment our Bluebolt program through a new collaboration with Microsoft to launch the innovation assistant as generative AI-powered tool built on Azure OpenAI service. Shortly after my arrival, we consolidated our performance objectives, the way we measure success. But just three long strategic priorities, long-term strategic priorities. Become the employer of choice in our industry, accelerate revenue growth and simplify our operations. I'll touch on our progress beginning with employer of choice. Our voluntary attrition improved throughout 2023 to multi-year lows, while our employee engagement scores improved to capitalize Cognizant's entrepreneurial spirit, we have given greater autonomy and accountability to business unit leaders. This is helping increase our responsiveness to client needs and market conditions. We remain committed to providing our teams with continuous learning, upskilling and professional development. In 2023, 90% of our global workforce spent time in learning with 270,000 of our employees acquiring at least one new skill proficiency. And 88,000 completing AI and generative AI courses. We've also established programs provide more opportunities for employees to advance their cadence. I'm pleased to say, we promoted nearly 30,000 people across the company last year. Later this month, we'll bring together our entire employee population and gatherings, physical and virtual to recognize excellence across the business with Cognizant's companywide awards program the IMPACT Awards. Late last year, we introduced an initiative called Shakti that will unify our women-centric programs to further advance carriers and boost women leadership in technology. Shakti will encompass Cognizant's leadership development programs for our senior level women globally and for our mid-level women in India along with our period upskilling program for women returning to work after a career break. Our second performance objective is to accelerate revenue growth. We've invested heavily in platform-centric approaches to further differentiate Cognizant in select industries. I've talked about our core platform just TriZetto in healthcare, Shared Investigator in life sciences and asset performance in smart manufacturing to name a few. Last year, we also began industrializing solutions for the next wave of technologies with our AI portfolio. We introduced Cognizant Neuro IT Operations, our AI led platform built to reduce the complexity and costs of enterprise infrastructure. We launched Cognizant Skygrade our cloud orchestration platform designed to help clients to rapidly transition to modern cloud-native architectures. In addition, we introduced Cognizant Neuro AI, developed to speed clients' adoption of generative AI. With Neuro AI, we are able to quickly build AI enablement use cases for clients that are specific to their businesses. And just last week, we expanded our GenAI portfolio with the introduction of Cognizant Flowsource, developed to help engineering teams, deliver high-quality code faster with increased control and transparency. Today, we have over 250 early engagements that incorporate the use of generative AI. Some examples are creating a virtual coach for a diabetic patient for a pharma company, predicting the size of target audiences for a TV network, conducting sentiment analysis and summarization of user comments for a large bank, developing field services expert advisor for a manufacturer, enabling conversational intelligence for an insurance call center and auto generating a sales pitch for a tech company. We have another 350 plus opportunities in our pipeline that we are planning to scale. We aim to infuse AI, not only into our core offerings but into everything we do, including using generative AI to create industry and functional services. It's worth mentioning that one of our integrated practices, intuitive operations and automation which helps clients, build and plan modern operations across $2.5 billion of revenue in 2023. Our tech-driven modern BPO and automation services helps clients achieve higher levels of productivity and reap benefits of generative AI in the core processes. We strive to stay tuned to market shifts, which is why last month, we acquired Thirdera. And Elite ServiceNow Partner that specializes in solutions for the ServiceNow platform. Adding Thirdera brings an on and near-shore global presence to our own ServiceNow Business Group. With Thirdera, we'll continue to advance the efforts of our strategic partnership with ServiceNow to build a $1 billion combined business focused on AI driven automation. Our third performance objective is to simplify our business. We executed well on our NextGen program, which is aimed at simplifying our operating model, optimizing corporate functions and consolidating and realigning workspace to reflect the post pandemic work environment. Our cost management enabled us to achieve a 2023 adjusted operating margin performance that exceeded our expectations from early in the year. Simplifying our business goes beyond structurally reducing costs. It also helps us become more agile and productive and innovative. Last year, we further streamlined our operating model and what we -- what was a complex metrics structure to focus primarily on our markets and integrated service lines. We are moving towards fewer layers in the organization, which we believe will bring us closer to our clients and associates, help drive strong coordination across the company and further empower account teams to make decisions. In summary, 2023 was a year of strengthening our company's fundamentals. Now let's look at -- look to our focus in 2024. We have selected six strategic imperatives that will help further sharpen our differentiation across clients' primary needs, while strengthening our ability to achieve our performance objectives. These imperatives are to grow in select industries, expand internationally, with large deals capabilities, capture the AI opportunity, deliver our talent strategy, and implement our IT roadmap. In the interest of time, I'll focus on only one of those initiatives which is capturing the substantial AI opportunity. Although, consumer use of generative AI is starting to explore, enterprise use cases have been ramping slowly. That said, we expect the pace of enterprise adoption to pick up soon and believe that after a slow takeoff movement of this curve will accelerate sharply. The results we have seen from initial GenAI proof-of-concepts are very encouraging. We believe system integrators like Cognizant will play a major role in managing, governing and optimizing generative AI initiatives upscale. This includes building accuracy in output, reducing hallucinations continued reenforced learning and testing incorporate -- incorporating transparency and accountability and iteratively driving performance optimization. Therefore on -- as mentioned on our prior calls, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next three years, spanning people, platforms, partnerships and M&A. We believe generative AI is becoming a driving force for the economy and society. In partnership with Oxford Economics, Cognizant developed and published a new economic impact study end of last month's World Economic Forum that predicts, generative AI could inject up to $1 trillion into the U.S. economy over 10 years. Our research also predicts that 90% of the jobs will be disrupted in some way by this technology. From 2023 to 2032 the percent of jobs with high exposure scores, meaning the degree to which an occupation will be affected by generative AI could increase from 8% (ph) to 52%. Setting the stage for a profound shift in how we approach work, productivity and economic growth. One last topic to cover and that's the demand environment. We see little change from the assessment we have provided in recent quarters about uncertain and weak discretionary spending in the early part of 2024. Given that clients are experiencing a period that has brought both change and uncertainty together, we expect them to continue to focus on reducing costs, consolidating vendors, modernizing the data and the processes and increasing the productivity, so that they can imply savings to AI led transformation. On a closing note, we celebrated our 30th anniversary just last month. We have stood the test of time and we are determined to sustain and extend the momentum we've created last year. As optimistic as I was about our company's future, when I joined last January, I'm doubly so now. Whatever the future may hold, I believe we are in a significantly strong position today than we were one year ago to seize the market opportunity ahead. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jatin, who joined us on December 4th for his initial observations about Cognizant and additional details on the quarter. Jatin Dalal : Thank you, Ravi and good afternoon everyone. I am very excited to join Cognizant, and would like to thank the entire organization for such a warm welcome. I would also like to thank, Jan, for helping me in making the onboarding experience so seamless. I have always admired Cognizant's growth mindset, client centricity and the entrepreneurial culture. While it has only been two months since I joined, the energy and passion across the organization are apparent. I have also had the opportunity to participate in our global sales kickoff events in January. This has further strengthened my conviction in Cognizant's capability and our market opportunity. I'm excited to partner with Ravi and the entire leadership team, to build on the progress we have made in 2023, as we strive to reach our full growth potential. In doing so, I believe there is a tremendous opportunity, to create long term sustainable value for our associates, clients and shareholders. With that, let's turn to our fourth quarter and full year revenue results. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 1.7% year-over-year or a decline of 2.4% in constant currency. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 90 basis points of growth from our acquisitions. This led to full year revenue of $19.4 billion, which declined 0.4% year-over-year or 0.3% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of growth from acquisitions. Ravi discussed Financial Services and Health Services, which declined 6.6% and 2.7% year-over-year in constant currency, respectively. So I will quickly comment on our other two segments. Products and Resources revenue was roughly flat year-over-year in constant currency, which included contribution from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new business. This helped offset the macro-driven discretionary spending pressure. We saw relatively better performance in North America, particularly among auto, utility and travel and hospitality clients. Communication, media and technology revenue increased 2% in constant currency. The growth reflected the benefit from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new bookings. Now, moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $40 million of costs related to our NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 90 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 16.1%. Year-over-year, margin included savings from our NextGen program and tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee. This helped partially offset increased compensation costs. As a reminder, the prior year period also included a negative impact from a noncash impairment charge, related to a Health Sciences customer. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26%, adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.4%. Q4 diluted GAAP EPS was 1.11, which is $1.11 and Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.18. Now, we turn to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of $2.6 billion or net cash of $2 billion. DSO of 77 days was flat sequentially and increased three days year-over-year, driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q4 was $659 million which brings full year 2023 free cash flow to $2 billion or approximately 95% of the net income. This was slightly ahead of our expectations. During the quarter, we repurchased over 4 million shares for $313 million and returned $146 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. For the full year, we returned about $1.7 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion through share repurchases and $591 million through our regular dividend. As of December 31, we had $1.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our forward outlook. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.68 billion to $4.76 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 2.7% to 1.2% or a decline of 3% to 1.5% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a positive impact of approximately 30 basis points. For the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $19 billion to $19.8 billion, which is a decline of 1.8% to growth of 2.2% year-over-year or a decline of 2% to growth of 2% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is expected to be up to 100 basis points, and we anticipate approximately 20 basis points positive impact for the year from the currency. Our NextGen program remained on track this quarter, and we still expect to incur total cost of approximately $300 million. This includes $229 million incurred in 2023, and our expectation for an additional $70 million in 2024. There are no changes to our savings assumption from NextGen, and we still intend to reinvest the majority of the savings in the growth opportunity in 2024 and beyond. Moving on to adjusted margins. We are pleased with the strong finish to 2023, which allowed us to deliver a full year adjusted operating margin of 15.1% versus our guidance of 14.7%. In 2024, we continue to expect 20 to 40 basis points of operating margin expansion. This represents an adjusted operating margin range of 15.3% to 15.5%. We remain focused on driving further efficiency in our business model through improved utilization, increased operational discipline and automation of tools and processes. We are also introducing guidance for net interest income versus our prior practice of providing gross interest income. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $40 million. Our expectation for the full year adjusted tax rate is 24% to 25%. For the full year, we expect free cash flow will represent about 80% of net income. This includes an anticipated negative impact of approximately $360 million because of a ruling on January 8 in India relating to a previously disclosed 2016 tax matter in connection with share repurchase transactions, undertaken by our Indian subsidiary. The ruling required Cognizant to deposit the funds with India tax authorities to proceed with our appeals process. The funds deposited with tax authority were previously held in bank deposit under lien. And as of December 31 were presented on our balance sheet under long term investments. The outflow will negatively impact our operating cash flow, but will not impact the cash and cash equivalent amounts on the balance sheet, and therefore, we do not anticipate any impact to our capital allocation priorities. Final amounts refunded to Cognizant or due toward tax authorities will be determined at the end of the appeals process. We continue to believe that we have complied with all tax regulations applicable to this matter in accordance with the law and intend to vigorously defend our position. Moving on to capital allocation. We expect to return over $1 billion to shareholders in 2024, including at least $400 million through share repurchases and $600 million through regular dividends. We will also continue to pursue acquisition opportunities aligned with our strategy. For the full year, we therefore, expect to deploy more than 100% of free cash flow, given the negative impact of the free cash flow from the aforementioned additional deposit with the India tax authorities. Based on our anticipated share repurchases, our guidance for shares outstanding is approximately $497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.5 to $4.68. With that, we'll be open to take the questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Hi, Ravi and hi, Jatin, welcome. My first question is with regards to bookings, if you can provide some color as it relates to ACV versus TCV expectations. New versus -- new versus renewals by sizing perhaps, I know you provided by count. And in terms of just cadence of when you expect new contracts to start kicking in and influencing growth, if you can comment on that, that'll be great. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Ashwin. Hope you're doing well. And I'm going to start -- this is Ravi here. I'm going to start and ask Jatin to chip in. If you look at how we shaped our 2023 bookings, we have significant upside on the category above $50 million, above $100 million and actually above $250 million TCV. Because these are large deals, managed services, cost takeout opportunities because 2023 was a lot of them, it also has a longer period if I may, in comparison to shorter deals in the range of say $0 million to $5 million versus $0 million to $10 million. The $0 million to $10 million deals actually they kind of get consumed in the same year as they form and it is actually in some ways driven by the discretionary spend. So we have more skewness. We don't comment on the ACV versus TCV. We don't publicly say that, but we have more skewness on large deals in comparison to the smaller deals. The large deals actually, we have significantly gone up over the previous years. Also, we have new renewals, new expansion, I mean renewals, new expansions and new logos in the mix I would say, we again have a significant upside on new and expansion, like we have commented on the numbers of deals. I think even in the TCV numbers, you will find new business and expansion being very, very high. In fact, we also made a point to make sure that we published some of these names in the market, for example, this quarter the important ones we published is Fortrea and if Fortrea is one of the customers we signed large deal with, we also published one on Takeda. So effectively what it does is, it gives you a good backlog for the future because the large deals have a longer period, so they are -- they give you a good backlog for the future. But they also have a runway into the current year where you win, but they have a bigger runway into the future years as you go forward. When we did 2023, we didn't have that luxury from 2022, because the large deal proportion was much lower. Now that we're entering 2024, what we won in 2023 will contribute to 2024, it did contribute to '23, but it will contribute more 2024 and it will create a backlog for the future. Now -- Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. Ravi Kumar : The question is, what does it do to -- in our revenues. As much as it starts to contribute to revenues, it -- there is also a discretionary softness, which we had in 2023, which kind of -- a portion of it sits off. So the question is, in 2024, how much is the discretionary going to hold, depending on which you could see the impact. I mean, it's unknown at this point of time, early in the year, what is going to happen to discretionary in 2024. And discretionary in 2023 went down, and it kind of made up -- it kind of got neutralized by the extraordinary run we had on large deals. In 2024, we don't know what's going to happen to discretionary, but it will -- the '23 wins will contribute to it and the continued momentum in '24 will contribute to it as well. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So as it relates to your outlook, what are you assuming beyond 1Q in terms of discretionary? And if discretionary does not actually come back to a good extent, would you still expect things like the investment in consulting relationships, partnerships and so on, to at least incrementally contribute or are we just in a waiting game? Ravi Kumar : So Ashwin, if you do the math, you will notice that there is some sequential growth assumed in our numbers. So if you do the math, you will get that there is sequential growth assumed in our numbers. We have good traction on cost takeout, vendor consolidation, AI-led productivity deals, those are the large deals we are winning. So we want to double down on those opportunities. We think we have a winning formula, and we will continue to run on it, which will give us the new business and which will give us the expansion on our existing clients. So discretionary today is unknown. I mean -- and that's why if you notice our guidance range is broader because we do not know what we do not know. But our thesis is very simple. We are going to be prepared for a comeback of discretionary. We're going to be fully prepared for it. We will gear our operating engine. We'll gear our fulfillment engine, and we'll double down as it comes, so that we don't miss the opportunity. Equally, on a separate swim lane, we've got a winning formula on large deals for cost takeout, which will remain irrespective of discretionary comes back or not. So we're going to ride on them as well. We're going to continue on that momentum from 2023, which has contributed to new business and new logos. So we will go behind it. So we're going to be prepared on one swim lane, and we're going to double down on the other one. And if that comes back, we want to be seizing those opportunities. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Very helpful as always. All the best. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please proceed. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. The margin outlook was encouraging. So I was hoping for little more detail on the gross margin versus operating margin dynamic. It sounds like utilization rates should improve. You talk about NextGen benefits, productivity, pricing, that kind of thing. So I just want to make sure I understand the callouts for the -- for margins for the year across gross margin and operating margin, if that's okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Jatin Dalal : Sure, Tien-Tsin. The -- I think the opportunity exists on both lines, and the drivers would be clearly different. The driver for gross margin would be really the efficiency of operations kicking in. We have quite a bit of utilization upside that one can capture as the growth return. The second is really deploying the tools and processes related -- around AI and automation to, to get some operational benefits out. So there's the opportunity on gross margin apart from the traditional opportunity around pyramid and Gen Zs and related traditional measures. On operating margin, definitely, there will be an upside on SG&A front led by some of the cost take-outs related with the tail end of NextGen program that will complete in 2024. So I would be -- I mean, we'll work on both, and we'll see where we go by the individual lines. But overall, we think we have sufficient actions around the overall expansion we have spoken about. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. And within\u2026 Ravi Kumar : Just to add to what Jatin said. We're very pleased with our performance on the NextGen program. We do think we have an opportunity for a full year impact this year on the NextGen program. Equally, as Jatin also pointed out, in addition to the classical levers in gross margin, we do have -- I mean, classical levers being, better operational efficiency, higher utilization, better pyramid, higher offshoring, I mean all of these are -- we are very encouraged with the progress. But we also have this unique opportunity to share the productivity benefits with our clients, which is the technology arbitrage versus the labor arbitrage, driven by generative AI tooling. And I think we are ahead of the curve, which is the reason why we are winning a lot of these large deals and sharing those benefits of productivity, which will then start to contribute to growth and operating margin as we go forward. Tien- Tsin Huang : Great. That's what I was looking for. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed. Moshe Katri : Hey, thanks for taking my question. And Jatin, welcome. It'll be great to work with you again. So a couple of questions. If we're looking at revenue growth, and we're looking at the deal flow that you've been winning since you came on board, Ravi. When do you think we could see that inflection point in revenue growth, especially as you start seeing some of these deals ramping on top of what you won last year and obviously, factoring the fact that it takes some time for these deals to ramp. That's my first question. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Moshe. Good to hear from you again. The wins in 2023 started to ramp in 2023, of course, they have a partial benefit in the first year and the start to get to more benefits in the second and the third year. Equally, the momentum as we got into the, into the back end of last year, we actually had more new business, more new logos in the percentage mix of our large deals, which means it'll have higher impact in the future years. So what this really does to us, it makes our business sticky, it increases our backlog for the future, and therefore you're entering the year with tail velocity. The only unknown in the mix is the $0 million to $5 million deals, which are discretionary in nature. And, they kind of neutralize if the fall-off, they kind of neutralize what you win on the large deals. I think part of that happened in 2023 because discretionary was pretty soft in 2023. 2024, we do not know what's going to happen to discretionary. Otherwise, I would say the flow of those deals, the large deals is continuing and it will strengthen in '24 and '25 when it will actually be fully realized. What it does though is -- I mean the unknown in the mix is, how much does that get neutralized by soft discretionary. If the discretionary is not soft, it comes back, we want to be prepared, it then starts to show the momentum. So it's interesting part because it's not about the large deals, it's also about the small deals, because if the small deals start to neutralize even if the plateau, then the large deals will start to show revenue momentum. That's how I see it. So we are executing to these deals pretty well. And this, Moshe, that in the first year, they always start with a transition, they start with a slower trajectory. And then once they take off, they get to a steady state of revenue. So that I'm not as worried about. I continue to believe that we are in good shape on that. What certainly I do not know is discretionary. Moshe Katri : Okay. That makes sense. And then the second one is more related to strategy. I've always been intrigued in terms of what Cognizant does with TriZetto. And that used to be a pretty big part of your healthcare practice, and I think you've indicated during our first introduction when you came on Board that you will be taking a second look at TriZetto and trying to kind of maybe revive the business. Are there any actions that you're doing there to, for us to see more of that reflected in the numbers and the healthcare vertical. Thanks a lot. Ravi Kumar : Moshe, I have to say this, the healthcare ecosystem for Cognizant is the strongest in the market. It's an industry which will go through a significant transformation. So we are on a pole position in healthcare -- in the healthcare economy, all the way from payer, provider, pharma benefits management to Life Sciences. We have an extraordinary strength of platforms plus services. Just look at the order of magnitude of what we do on TriZetto. 250 million plus claims on an annual basis approximately, 100 million plus enrollments on an annual basis. We do 3 billion electronic data interchange transactions. So we have an extraordinary story of TriZetto, 60-plus percent of the U.S. insured population goes through our platforms. It's the fulcrum and the nucleus of healthcare ecosystem. So we're going to invest and double down on it, and seize the opportunities which come on this transformational journey for our clients. This is going to be a sector which will significantly transform and we have an exciting clientele base across the spectrum. We've invested on generative AI. We have done multiple announcements last year of embedding generative AI, including our partnership with Microsoft on the OpenAI piece, which we have embedded into the entire stack. So we are very excited about TriZetto. I am actually doubly sure that, that is going to be an integral part of our healthcare strategy for the future. Moshe Katri : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed. Surinder Thind : Thank you. Just on the AI component and the potential acceleration that you may see as the year progresses. When you roll out these new products and services, is there a pricing conversation that you have with clients? Is there a way to price this differently? Can you command more? Or is it just that the expectation is you'll get a lot more in consulting services down the road? Can you maybe provide some color on that? Ravi Kumar : Surinder, that's a great question. Thank you for that. I would say three swim lanes Surinder. The first is the last -- the last mile holding. The ability to take foundational models, which are available in the market and create a funnel to make them enterprise-grade which is the work you have to do on the last mile, all the way from managing, governing and orchestrating large language models or foundational models. And that's a variety of things. It starts from accuracy of the models to reducing hallucinations, to doing performance cost optimization, to reinforced learning unlike software. Generative AI goes through reinforced learning, even after you implement it because it learns through the process. So there is a lot of heavy lift needed to take the foundation models and make it production-grade, enterprise grade. And I think we have a unique opportunity, and I'm excited about what I have actually seen with the platforms we have built, the platforms we announced to the market, and how we are helping our clients to get there. We have 250-plus prototypes running, we have 350-plus in the pipeline. Whenever those CapEx cycles trigger off, I think we are in a good position to monetize on that. That's the first swim lane. So it's -- you could call it consulting in your language the way you put it, but it is actually a bunch of things we want to work on. There is a second swim lane, I would say, which is about how do you apply it to your productivity. And that kind of switches on to two things. How -- what does it do to developer productivity? What does it do to technology life cycles, all the way from design to testing to writing code to all of it. And I call them to subsegments because one is to cannibalize the business you do and share the benefits with your clients. The second is to go and cannibalize or rather go and propose something provocative on the work. We don't do as an incumbent, but we could actually create better productivity to our clients. And one of the reasons why we are winning those large deals is that's a pivot on our large deal story. We actually go and disrupt client landscapes with -- which is where we are not incumbent with not just labor arbitrage, but arbitrage powered by AI. So I would say there are opportunities all through, all the way from applying it to the landscapes to -- applying productivity to the technology life cycles, be it our business, we do or be it where we are not an incumbent. And I would say this is a pervasive opportunity. It will be a short -- it will be a slow takeoff, but it will be a short cycle of a slow takeoff, and it will then get into a sharp S-curve, as I mentioned on my preliminary comments. So it's a very pervasive technology. It diffuses very fast, and it has a very good distribution network. So I'm excited about the prospects, excited about the investments we're making, excited about how we're staying relevant with our clients. We've also embedded it into our platforms like TriZetto. So we are equipped to seize these opportunities as the CapEx cycles of generative AI trigger to enterprise grade work. Surinder Thind : That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, just to kind of tease out what you're seeing in the discretionary spend environment. I guess the question I would ask is how much more can clients really pull back on that spectrum of spend? And then I guess the counterquestion here would be, given the relative economic resiliency, why aren't clients spending more at this point? Like what's holding them back? Like what do they need to see? Or what are they signaling to you of when they're willing to perhaps take some risk? Ravi Kumar : So let me start and ask Jatin chip in. I would say, the discretion or the spend, if you take industry view is the motion banking, financial services and insurance. That's a sector which is burdened with high interest rates. And because of the high interest rate, there is a wait-and-watch and kind of a pause on discretionary work. Remember, these are financial services is one of the sectors which also has a strong technology retained organization. So what they outsource is dependent on how much is the discretionary. Let's see how the industry shape up in the year. And normally what I have seen based on the experience is, if there are one or two repeatable cycles of interest rate adjustments downwards, we will start to see the spend to come back. Discretionary is also tied to transformational work, that means transformational work, normally it takes off when there is a period of certainty. I've said this before in my remarks that we see this as a period of uncertainty and a period of change. I mean the change is -- the change ahead of us is, is such a positive catalyst. So if the uncertainty starts to go away. I think that change will trigger discretionary to come back. It's also a deal where, at the back end of the year, we -- in many parts of the world there are elections, so I don't know what impact does to discretionary. But, the AI cycle can trigger the discretionary back the industry rates drop can trigger the discretionary back, financial services is the biggest one. So we are hoping that the stability in that sector based on interest rate cuts can drive that discretionary back. So it's a little bit of -- I'm waiting for how the interest rate shape up for the -- in this year to really say whether it is going to come back or not. Jatin Dalal : Yes. So Surinder my -- this is Jatin. I will just add to say that, there is this -- if you see the history of IT services industries and shocks and shock recoveries is always some event led. And as we all know, the current situation is not a shock, it's not an event, it is an overall high interest cost across the spectrum of the yield curve, which is weighing down on minds of decision-maker. It is difficult to call when the discretionary comes back, it's very sector-specific. And it is a little novel from what the world has seen in last 20 years, where there was one big event and then you actually saw interest rates go down very, very sharply, very quickly, and there was a bounce back of the demand. This time, it is a new slowdown that we are -- and I'm sure all our customers are coping to deal with that in terms of how they react to it. Ravi Kumar : Also one other, one other, I would say, one other event in the mix is, during the COVID era there was a heavy discretionary in many sectors. And that's going to -- that went through -- that's kind of gone through a course correction, if I may, including the fact that there was uncertainty. So it's going to be an interesting year to watch on discretionary and that's probably as we go through the year, we'll probably get more visibility on it. Surinder Thind : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. James Faucette : Great. Thank you very much and really appreciate all the color and detail you are giving today. I'm wondering, just in terms of the larger deals that you've talked about, can you talk about the scenario of win rates for Cognizant? Sounds like you're pretty confident, etc., but just wanted to get a sense for how you're perceiving your competitiveness right now in the market. Ravi Kumar : Yes. So you would have noticed that these large deals we are doing, we're doing based on a differentiated value proposition, and we are holding our pricing. I mean that's one of the reasons why our margins were good enough, good in 2023. And we gave 20 basis points to 40 basis points improvement this year. Our strength on our large deals is the following. We are able to unify the company together with the velocity, which is in line with what our clients are looking for. I mean, the velocity of these deals is very high, because these are cost takeout, vendor consolidation kind of deals. So you need that velocity, you need the unification of -- to come together, it's in our DNA, so I have kind of energized the DNA if I may in 2023, and that has helped us significantly. The second I would say is, there are sectors where we have strong capabilities. And in those sectors, we are a formidable force. We can be provocative in those sectors. We don't need to wait for a request for a consolidation or a request for productivity. We can actually work with our clients. We are very sticky. I mean we are also a company over the 30 years of Cognizant's heritage. We are very sticky to our client. So we could be provocative with bold ideas. I see that as a trade and an integral part of the DNA. And as a CEO of the company, I've been able to lead those provocative conversations with our clients. That has helped us significantly. We have an extraordinary front-end team, if I may. The third, I would say, is our execution muscle, which we built in the last one year, I'm very proud about it. And that has helped us to not just deliver these deals well, but also hold our margins as we execute these deals. The last one, I would say, in the mix is we also have, I would say, uniquely a differentiated value proposition related to productivity led by automation and AI, which can actually help to that provocative board thinking to support construction of these deals and share the benefits about the extraordinary opportunity AI provides to us. So I would say these are the three or four things which have helped us to win deals. And I would like to continue on that momentum in 2024. James Faucette : That's great. And then wanted to ask is -- it's interesting in each of the last couple of quarters, you've increased net head count slightly. I think usually, that's taken as a positive indicator. Can you just talk about, as you're maintaining head count even in the face of potentially being down as much as 2% at the bottom end of your guided range this year, how you're thinking about managing that? And is the nature of the people you're adding and retaining just to serve kind of these larger deals that you've already booked? And how much of it is just in anticipation that more discretionary and smaller deals could come back? Just trying to get a sense for how you're thinking about managing head count and what we should take from that? Jatin Dalal : Yeah. So James, this is really a combination of both retaining sufficient flexibility for the growth to come. If the growth comes back, you should have sufficient flexibility on the bench. That's one. And two is really some plant addition that we do systematically to certain skill sets and certain part of our pyramid that has both contributed to this small addition that you are seeing on the total headcount. Ravi Kumar : Also, just to add to what Jatin said, you should remember, we have an extraordinary story on how well we have done on attrition. I mean we are now really a top-notch player with industry-leading retention plan. I mean we have -- look at where we were at the start of quarter one in 2023 to now, our attrition has significantly improved. That is also helping us to be ready for the discretionary at any point in time it comes back, because it gives you the cast and capacity to fulfill. James Faucette : That's great. Thank you so much to both of you for your help. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, James. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions this evening. I wanted to ask you if you could comment on how much visibility or maybe relative visibility you have right now into fiscal '24? And I guess I mean relative to a more settled normal environment, and I guess the underlying question is, are you having to bake in more conservatism into your guidance this year to account for environmental, external factors that are difficult to kind of see through at this point? Jatin Dalal : Sure, Ramsey. Ramsey, I mean, this is a typical beginning of the year where we don't know what we don't know. If you really see mathematically, if you dissect our guidance, you would see that there is a certain growth -- sequential growth that we have assumed during the course of the year. So there is a certain growth assumption that we are working in with. But environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly a slower start to the year, as Ravi indicated in his opening remarks. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up from me. Could you also give us your view on the extent to which clients are prepared to embrace generative AI? How much work still needs to be done on core sort of underlying technologies at this point for enterprises to start taking advantage of the new technology? Ravi Kumar : I would say, in some areas, we are seeing more confidence. The two big areas I want to highlight is employee productivity and the second is customer service. We see them getting faster to production grade. Employee productivity is amplifying human potential, as we call it. Customer service always had uniquely opportunities here because remember, when robotic process automation, which is down the chain and the continuum of AI and generative AI, we also had the most reduction there. These are the two areas where they are ready. I think the things that grappling with is, as I mentioned, and the need of a system integrator like Cognizant plays an important role. The things they're grappling with is the accuracy of the models. They explain ability of the models, the traceability of the datasets. So that the explainability could be judged. I mean, remember this is, this is output, which is coming out from a computer which is building logic, which means you need to have explainability behind it to make it responsible enough. And I think the other thing that grappling with is -- I mean, we call that hallucinations but that's what it means in different ways. The other thing that they are grappling with this performance versus cost. So that they can make it production grade. But we will -- If it will disrupt, one of the studies we did with Oxford Economics is it will disrupt 90% of the jobs. Some jobs will get disrupted more, some jobs will get disrupted less. The tasks within jobs will get disrupted and we created something called an exposure of core on jobs which gives us the opportunity to figure out with jobs will actually go through more disruption. But at a high level I would say, these are the two broad areas where customers are probably going to be more prepared to cross the bridge on embracing generative AI into enterprises. Needless to say, this is going to be one of the most pervasive technologies in -- at times. So, I'm excited about the prospects but I'm equally, I'm equally getting prepared to what it means for a system integrator. Ramsey El-Assal: Very interesting. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to management. Tyler Scott : Great. Thank you all for your interest in Cognizant and for joining our call. We look forward to catching up next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Enjoy the rest of your evening.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's first quarter 2024 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during the call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead. Ravi Kumar S : Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, we continued to make progress against the strategic priorities I laid out last year while navigating a challenging demand environment. We delivered revenue growth that exceeded the high end of our guidance range and expanded our adjusted operating margin year-over-year. Voluntary attrition improved again, and we ended Q1 with trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our technology services business at 13.1%, representing a decline of 10 percentage points year-over-year. And our NextGen program remains on track as we continue to focus on simplification and operational excellence. As we have all seen in recent earnings results for our peer companies and economic headlines, the demand environment remains uncertain and geopolitical risks continue. These dynamics are shifting near-term client spending priorities from discretionary projects towards projects that will drive near-term cost savings and fund innovation for the future. Now moving on to Q1 highlights. We delivered revenue of $4.8 billion, which was sequentially flat and represented a decline of 1% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 50 basis points to 15.1% as we continue to execute our cost optimization strategy and take out structural costs. First year -- first quarter bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $25.9 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. While there is good sustained traction with our large deals, we saw softness in smaller deals in the range of 0 to $10 million total contract value, reflecting the tight discretionary environment. Our strong deal momentum in the quarter was evidenced by the fact we signed 8 deals, each with TCV of $100 million or more compared to only 4 in the prior year period. We've also seen early green shoots in our efforts to diversify our large deals outside of North America. And in quarter 1, two of the 8 greater than $100 million contracts we signed with in the APJ region. On a trailing 12-month basis, our book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x remains strong, which we believe provides a healthy backlog of opportunities to improve revenue performance over the next several quarters. We continue to grow our pipeline for larger deals and make progress against our goal of increasing the value of large deals in our bookings. From a segment perspective, demand trends were consistent with what we have seen in recent quarters. We saw sequential growth in Health Sciences and Communications, Media and Technology, offset by declines in Financial Services and Products and Resources. While Financial Services has been impacted more meaningfully than other segments by weaker discretionary spending, we did see sequential growth among our banking and financial services clients, which represents about 60% of our Financial Services segment, and are encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing in the overall pipeline, particularly within our intuitive operations and automation practice area. We see several themes that we believe are helping drive demand for our services. This includes clients' continued investments in developing a modern technology infrastructure related to AI, cloud and digital technologies, data engineering, prioritization of hyper-personalization and customer experience projects and the need to deliver innovation. One example of infrastructure modernization this quarter was an agreement we signed with a new client, McCormick & Company, a global leader in flavor. Over the next 5 years, we will help transform and manage its global technology infrastructure, leveraging AI automated tools to enhance McCormick's employee and customer experience while improving productivity and driving financial savings for our clients. Another example of monetization hyper-personalization is our recently announced new strategic alliance with Shopify and Google Cloud. Under this alliance, we will help drive digital transformation and platform modernization, enabling global retailers and brands to unlock business value from generative AI. We believe today's retailers must drive a modernization agenda while investing in innovation to elevate their end users and customers' experiences. Earlier this week, we signed a strategic agreement with Telstra, Australia's leading telecom and technology company, to elevate their software engineering capabilities and enhance their customers' experience. We believe this is a key strategic win in our APJ market. And we will leverage our AI tools to drive innovation, enable more efficient software engineering and ID operations, and decommission legacy systems to improve operational efficiency and support their employee experience by building them a superior engineering experience. And as a fourth example, we extended our long-standing relationship with CNO Financial Group during the quarter.  Under this expanded agreement, we will implement cloud and digital technologies to help CNO deliver more personalized digital and convenient solutions to their customers. We'll also leverage gen AI technologies to help drive efficiencies across infrastructure, applications, enterprise software and engineering services. Our clients' desire and need to drive innovation is apparent in all our client interactions, but funding for that innovation is being impacted by demand uncertainties in our clients' own end markets. The timing of a return in discretionary spending remains unknown, but our thesis remains simple. We plan to be prepared when it returns by continuing our organic investments in learning and development, people, platforms and innovation, while supporting those initiatives with inorganic capability-enhancing investments. On the client side, data from our project-level client feedback process for the first quarter of this year shows a 39% improvement in our Net Promoter Score regarding our project delivery quality over the last 2 years. We believe this is a result of a self-reinforcing cycle we created through tighter client collaboration since the beginning of 2023. As a testament to our longtime focus on helping clients innovate, during the quarter, Fortune Magazine recognized Cognizant as one of the America's Most Innovative Companies in 2024. Our focus on innovation is reflected in our Bluebolt grassroots innovation initiative, which we launched a year ago in April. Bluebolt has already generated more than 130,000 ideas from our associates, 23,000 of which have been implemented with clients. Overall, more than 220,000 Cognizant associates have been trained on Bluebolt. In addition, Google named Cognizant a Google Cloud 2024 Breakthrough Partner of the Year. This is one of our industry's most distinguished awards. I will elaborate more on Google Cloud in a moment. And just this month, LinkedIn recognized Cognizant as a #3 on its Top Companies 2024 Employer List in India, which is home to more than 250,000 of our valued associates. This repeat recognition is a reminder that our focus on becoming the employer of choice is paying off in the country that is at the heart of Cognizant's success in India. These client wins and industry recognitions demonstrate one of our core differentiators, our collaborative innovation. And nowhere else is the demand for innovation higher than in gen AI. To date, we have more than 450 early client engagements in more than 500 additional opportunities in the pipeline. We have seen increased demand for AI services across 4 key areas. First, customer and employee experience as clients seek to deliver improved interactions through hyper-personalization. Second, content summarization and insights to empower decision-making. Third, content generation. And finally, leveraging gen AI to accelerate innovation and technology development cycles. We continue to see strong interest from clients as they assess proofs of concept and the return on investment of these opportunities. These efforts are supported by our recently launched Advanced Artificial Intelligence Lab in San Francisco, where we are investing in state-of-the-art core AI research aimed to position us at the forefront of innovation in our industry. This builds upon our network of AI innovation studios in London, New York, San Francisco, Dallas and Bengaluru. Incidentally, our Advanced Artificial Intelligence Lab has already produced 53 AI patents with applications for many more pending. This quarter alone, we had 7 new AI patents approved and granted to us. In quarter 1, we announced a series of new partnerships and co-innovations behind this strategy we announced last year to invest $1 billion in generative AI over 3 years. This includes our collaboration with Microsoft to infuse gen AI into health care administration. The TriZetto Assistant on our Facets platform will leverage Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel to provide access to gen AI within the TriZetto user interface. We are already progressing from proof of concept to the piloting phase and are seeing strong interest from some of our largest health care customers. And last week, we announced another element of our expanded partnership with Microsoft. We plan to leverage Microsoft Copilot and Cognizant's advisory and digital transformation services to help our employees and enterprise customers operationalize generative AI and realize strategic business transformation benefits from this technology. In addition, as a part of Cognizant's Synapse skilling program, Cognizant will train 25,000 developers of the use of Github Copilot, doubling the number trained on the technology. We are also collaborating with NVIDIA to leverage our deep life sciences and AI domain expertise with NVIDIA's pretrained industry-specific generative AI models offered as a part of BioNeMo. There -- through this collaboration, we will provide clients access to a suite of model-making services, including pretrained models, cutting-edge frameworks and application programming interfaces, that offer clients an accelerated path to train and customize enterprise models using the proprietary data. By leveraging gen AI-infused models, clinical researchers can rapidly sift through extensive data sets, more accurately predict interactions between drug compounds and create a new viable drug development pathway. We also expanded our partnership with Google Cloud. We'll adopt Gemini for Google Cloud in two ways : first, by training Cognizant associates to use Gemini for software development assistance; and second, by integrating Gemini's advanced capabilities within Cognizant's internal operations and platforms. Using Gemini for Google Cloud, Cognizant's developers will be equipped to write, test and deploy code faster and more effectively with the help of AI-powered tools, improving the reliability and cost efficiency of building and managing client applications. Over the next 12 months, Cognizant expects to up-skill more than 70,000 cross-functional associates on Google Cloud's AI offerings. This is another milestone in our Synapse initiative to up-skill 1 million individuals globally by 2026. Additionally, Cognizant will work to integrate Gemini into its suite of automated platforms and accelerators beginning with the recently announced Cognizant Flowsource platform for developers. As a part of our social responsibility platform, we recently announced that since 2018, we have awarded $70 million in philanthropic funds to global skilling programs for underrepresented communities. These 117 grants combined Cognizant's culture of continuous skilling, our focus on prioritization on empowering diversity through technology, and the philosophy that AI and other advanced technologies can be a great equalizer for the future of work. We intend to continue following and participating in the AI innovation cycles by investing in last-mile platform infrastructure, productivity studies and capabilities to enable better and faster integration into enterprise landscapes. In the last 12 months, our AI platforms gained significant traction as we on-boarded clients on the Neuro, Skygrade and Flowsource platforms to cover various phases of AI deployment cycles. By investing in productivity studies, which dissect the anatomy of skills and occupations and map the AI exposure scores to different roles, we have assisted our clients in realizing value and driving the scaled embrace of newer AI use cases. As we continue to navigate this ongoing soft demand environment, we remain focused on investing in areas to help our clients reduce total cost of ownership, boost productivity, enhance technology intensity and enable better adoption of new age technologies like AI to capture the current demand and be prepared for the future. And we remain differentiated by investing in industry domain capabilities and platforms in select industries. We also believe inorganic opportunities remain an important element of our investment strategy. We continue to seek to expand and deepen capabilities, diversify our business, including into industries where we are underexposed and improve our geographic mix. For example, we are pleased with the early traction of our Q1 acquisition of Thirdera, an industry-leading ServiceNow platform, which has significantly expanded our capabilities and credentials. We already see a healthy pipeline of opportunities as direct result of this acquisition to cross-sell within our existing client base. In closing, I want to thank our 345,000 employees around the world for their dedication to our clients and Cognizant. In 2024, we will keep working to increase our revenue growth, become the employer of choice in our industry, and to simplify our operations. Jatin, over to you. Jatin Dalal : Thank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us. As I enter my sixth month as Cognizant's CFO, I remain deeply impressed by the culture, passion and client centricity across the organization. I am pleased with our execution in the first quarter in what remains a tough economic environment. Revenue exited the high end of our guidance range, supported by our Communications, Media and Technology segments. The sequential growth of our healthcare segment was also heartening. Strong execution on our NextGen program and disciplined cost optimization actions allowed us to deliver a 15.1% adjusted operating margin, representing 50 basis points of expansion year-on-year. Looking ahead, I am focused on several objectives in support of our broader strategic priorities. First, continue to strengthen our partnerships and collaborations across the organization to improve revenue growth. Second, improve our margin profile through our NextGen cost programs and process enhancements, driven in part by leveraging AI tools. Next, continue to invest in our people with a focus on supporting our company-wide employee skilling programs designed to train our employees on the latest technology, including gen AI. And finally, drive disciplined execution with a focus on maximizing value creation from our M&A investments and improving our large deals risk management framework. First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 1.1% year-over-year or a decline of 1.2% in constant currency. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 70 basis points of growth from recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, revenue was flat from the prior quarter. Across global industry segments and geographies, we have seen the uncertain economic outlook and volatile geopolitical environment weigh on our client spending priorities, which has kept their discretionary spend muted. These headwinds are more pronounced in Financial Services, which is more susceptible to higher interest rates. Health Sciences customers are also being impacted by the inflationary environment and industry-specific headwinds. At the same time, clients continue to prioritize spending that can deliver cost savings quickly and continue to fund investments in transformation and innovation. For example, within our Products and Resources segment, we have seen resiliency among utility customers where grid modernization remains a critical priority. This has been further supported by our 2022 acquisitions of Utegration, which helps drive SAP S/4 cloud opportunities with the utilities customers. In addition, we have seen positive trends amongst automotive customers in area like software-defined vehicles and in our Products and Resources segment, where the convergence of IT and operational technology is driving transformation and digitization priorities. Finally, we were pleased with the performance of our Communications, Media and Technology segment, which grew year-over-year, driven by contribution of recently completed acquisitions and wins with the communications and media customers. This has helped offset discretionary spending pressure among our technology customers, which we believe have been impacted by clients focused on reducing costs. Now moving on to margins. Our NextGen optimization program has progressed well in helping us drive structural cost savings and simplification of our operations. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $23 million of costs related to this program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, which benefited from savings related to our NextGen program and the depreciation of the Indian rupee. Both our GAAP and adjusted tax rate in the quarter were 24.8%. Q1 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.10 and Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.12. Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. DSO of 78 days was up 1 day sequentially and increased 5 days year-over-year, primarily driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q1 was $16 million and included the impact of previously disclosed $360 million payments made to Indian tax authorities as well as the payout of bonuses that were accrued last year.  As a reminder, the tax payment to the Indian tax authority was required to proceed with the appeals process relating to our 2016 tax matter. The appeal is ongoing and final amounts refunded to Cognizant or due to tax authorities will be determined at the end of the process. We also returned $284 million to shareholders, including $133 million through share repurchases and $151 million through our regular remit. In addition, we completed our acquisition of Thirdera in January for a total consideration, net of cash acquired, of approximately $420 million. These factors drove quarter end cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.6 billion. In 2024, we continue to expect to return over $1 billion to our shareholders, including at least $400 million through share repurchases and $600 million through regular dividends. We will also continue to evaluate inorganic strategic investment opportunities to help accelerate our growth profile, expand our capabilities and diversify our portfolio. Now let me speak about the forward outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to growth of 1.5% sequentially, in constant currency.  Year-over-year, this implies a decline of 2.5% to a decline of 1% in constant currency. On a reported basis, this translates to a revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.82 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 2.9% to a decline of 1.4%. For the full year, we continue to expect a revenue decline of 2% to a growth of 2% in constant currency. On a reported basis, this translates to revenue in range of $18.9 billion to $19.7 billion and a decline of 2.2% to a growth of 1.8%, reflecting our latest exchange assumptions. The guidance we are providing as of today assumes up to 100 basis points of inorganic contribution. We see an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities, and we continue to evaluate assets for the right capabilities to support our strategic priorities. Our NextGen program remains on track, and there are no changes to our assumptions regarding the program. We still intend to reinvest the majority of NextGen savings in our growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our Q1 performance and we continue to expect the full year to be in the range of 15.3% to 15.5%. For Q2, we expect adjusted operating margin will be in a narrow range around Q1's number, with NextGen cost savings and improved utilization being offset by initial negative impact from the ramp of large deals and the revenue mix. I am pleased with our sequential improvement in utilization during the quarter, and we are sharply focused on driving further improvements to support margins next quarter. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $60 million, which compares to $40 million previously, primarily reflecting updated interest rate and cash balances assumptions. Our adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% remains unchanged. Our full year free cash flow guidance is also unchanged, and we continue to expect it will represent 80% of our net income. This includes the previously discussed negative impact of $360 million payment made with Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter.  Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.50 to $4.68, unchanged from our previous guidance. With that, we'll open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Bryan Bergin : I guess to start, can you comment on what areas performed better than your expectations here on growth in 1Q versus your guide? And then as we see an implied sequential improvement in the coming quarters, at least at the midpoint, how do we reconcile that with some of the commentary about the unknown timing of discretionary recovery? I'm curious if it's kind of an improvement driven by the ramp of the large deals and easier comps or if you're actually forecasting some improvement in that discretionary -- in that decision-making environment too. Ravi Kumar S : Thank you, Bryan. Thank you for that question. This is Ravi here, and let me give it a try, and then I will ask Jatin to add in. The way we look at our guidance range is based on the visibility we get to the middle of the range. And then we look for what's the upside available. The upside available is based on large deal momentum. There is 30 to 40 basis points of M&A, which we are yet to do because this guidance includes 100 basis points of M&A. And the committed spend from many of our clients, sometimes, you can get an upside on it if you ramp up well. So that's the starting point. Why did we put this in a broad range? We put it in a broad range -- normally, at this point of time, you would have 200 basis points of range. We have 400 basis points of a range because the market is sluggish. While we are doing well, we've performed well in quarter 1, the market is sluggish, so we kind of kept a broader range. How do we see discretionary today? We don't see discretionary changed since we spoke to all of you last quarter. So it remains the same. It hasn't changed. Now let's come to performance of quarter 1. If you've noticed, I mean, the biggest drop in discretionary has been in Financial Services in the past. And that has been for us as well as for the sector and the industry. If you've noticed, the sequential drop from quarter 4 to quarter 1 for us is only $10 million in banking, financial services and insurance. And we are seeing green shoots in BFS, which is 60% of BFSI. Health care is doing well. We have managed to continue on our strong portfolio with sequential growth. You've heard about communications, CMT, it's been a phenomenal run for us. We have had year-on-year growth as well as sequential growth that is backed by some large deals we won in the last 12 months. This is also a quarter where we have 8 large deals. If you compare that with quarter 1 of last year, it is 4 large deals last year. And these -- out of the 8, 5 were expansion plus renewal, and that gives me a lot of confidence about the fact that we're continuing to expand on large deals. The large deal momentum continues. Of course, there is softness in 0 to $10 million and 0 to $20 million of kind of deals, which are discretionary in [ India ]. So that's broadly how I shape it. And if I have to add manufacturing and products, that is pretty stable. So this is how I see how we got to the guidance range. This is how we performed in quarter 1. We have also seen expansion of our deals outside of Americas to Asia Pacific. We have 2 deals out of the 8, which have actually come from Asia Pacific. You've already seen the announcement we did with Telstra, which is a part of our release. Jatin, anything else? Jatin Dalal : Yes. No, Bryan, we are good. If you have any follow-up, we can take it. Bryan Bergin : No, that was very detailed. I appreciate that. My thoughts on margin, so just kind of unpacking the margin attribution with the gross margin contraction year-over-year but a strong SG&A reduction. Is that a trend we should expect that will continue as you move through '24, just given the large deal ramping? And just maybe, Jatin, talk about your comfort level in reducing the SG&A profile in NextGen still? Jatin Dalal : There will be puts and takes every quarter, as you very well know. But directionally, SG&A should continue to show a right momentum around improvement, but not so much because we have taken a large action in '23. So you would see the [ back ] end of our NextGen program acting through the SG&A line during the course of the rest of the year, but it won't be as large an impact or a big number compared to 2023. That's the view on SG&A. Ravi Kumar S : I would say the only thing I would add to what Jatin said is SG&A also has leverage with growth. So if growth comes back, you will see leverage on SG&A. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just following on Bryan's question there. Just thinking about bookings ahead in the second quarter, maybe second half as well. Any call-outs there around expectations, new deals or logos versus renewals, short versus large? What do you see on the horizon there? Ravi Kumar S : Tien-Tsin, thank you so much for that question. We continue to see good large deals momentum through the whole of 2023. I mean, whatever we did in 2023 is helping us on ramp-ups this year, and we'll continue to build that for the rest of the year. This has been a good quarter. In fact, if you just see the announcements we made with clients as a part of our earnings release, you would notice that the number of announcements have also gone up. So I'm very pleased with the progress. I'm also pleased with the fact that we have now started to expand that into Europe and Asia Pacific. The softer nature of smaller deals between 0 to $10 million and, I would say, 0 to $15 million or $20 million, that hasn't changed much since we spoke last. And it's hard to predict how that's going to look like for the rest of the year. I do see some improvements, some green shoots in it, and that is reflected in our Financial Services BFSI results, but we should -- we are continuing to watch that area very keenly. Essentially, most of the large deals are on cost takeout, vendor consolidation, productivity, efficiency kind of deals. And we are very, very excited about the fact that, that momentum is going to continue for us. Those are deals the market offers, and we are -- we seem to be winning well on that. Of course, the period -- because these large deals are cost-takeout deals, the period of -- the duration of those deals is longer, so you will see realization of revenues over a period of time. But it is also sticky, and it gives you an opportunity to create better fulfillment through managed services. So one of the other things we are tracking internally is annual contract value in addition to the total contract value, so that we start to know how much is it contributing to this year. What will be exciting for us is we now have a runway from 2023 into 2024. And going into 2025, we'll have a runway from 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I just wanted to ask about pricing in the environment right now since demand is low. Wondering if you're seeing pressure on the rate card in the industry right now? And any kind of bottom insight for that? Jatin Dalal : Yes. Bryan, thanks for your question. This is Jatin. Fundamentally, the current environment is that of consolidation of spend, of cost management, improvement in the productivity and so on and so forth. So this is the characteristics of the deals that we are seeing in the market. By design, these deals come with an expectation of superior pricing than what is the pricing which is inherent in the current work. So yes, there is a downward pressure on pricing, but it is nothing out of ordinary that one would expect in the current demand environment. We are not seeing out-of-ordinary behavior in the market as we compete. And I think it's a fair play from that expectation standpoint. Bryan Keane : Got it. And then as my follow-up, you mentioned that normally, you guys would narrow the range for the revenue guide, but you've kept it due to some of the uncertainties. What would need to happen for you guys to get towards the high end of the range? Would you need some of that short-term demand work to come back? And would it even come back fast enough to hit the P&L to impact this fiscal year to get up towards the, I think, 2% constant currency revenue range? Jatin Dalal : Sure. So overall, the reason for large -- a larger range is as follows. I mean, as Ravi mentioned, we start with the midpoint and we look at what is the expected outcome that one can get to. Then we see the range of possibilities. Now if you see our own guidance vis-a-vis quarter 1 to quarter 2, there is an improvement in the guidance range that we gave in --  we are giving in quarter 2 versus quarter 1. And that also means that we will grow sequentially in quarter 2. So overall, we are making good progress. But if you see the demand environment remains reasonably tough, no different than what we spoke in the beginning of the year. And hence, there is a sort of uncertainty in the environment that we are factoring in as we look at our own performance as well as we look at the environment, which is surrounding us. Now what can help us go towards the higher end of the range are a few things, and one or more of this could help us. One is that there is some improvement in discretionary spend in the later part of the year. The second is, as Ravi mentioned earlier, a lot of times, when we win a large deal, there is a committed business and there is a right to go after sort of business, which is not committed. But if you fulfill well, if your delivery is good, you can naturally go after that upside to the committed business. That's second. The third is we spoke about the inorganic component of our guidance. We have maybe 30 to 40 basis points of potential to execute on. And that could mean in the second half, that could get added to the performance because we have done only one acquisition since the beginning of the year. And fourth is sometimes, a re-batch kind of deal, which comes with a large volume of revenue getting ramped up at a relatively faster pace than the normal ramp-up that you see in a deal. So one or more of this could be at play. Right now, we have remained sort of true to our original guidance. We will narrow the range when we meet you next time. But right now, considering all of this, sitting where we are in the year, we thought we'll keep the range same as it was in the beginning of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Securities. Yu Lee : Ravi, given your call-out in your prepared remarks to your commentary, can you talk through any sort of deal leakage or cancellations or delays you may have seen in recent months? And if so, across which types of projects or verticals are you seeing this in? Ravi Kumar S : Yes. So let me start and get Jatin to add. Discretionary has to be earned every year, so the discretionary doesn't come back. You could call it as structural leakage, if I may, but it isn't as much. It's not like somebody else is taking that away. So discretionary is always the unknown part, if I may. On the -- when I started the year in 2023, we had leakages because when there was a consolidation, somebody else was winning it and not us. That isn't happening anymore. I mean we are very stable with our clients. Our clients are continuing to invest in customers. There's no company-specific challenges, which have led to leakage or there is a potential of leakage. We see that as a very stable platform. In fact, my Net Promoter Scores with the clients is continuing to scale up every quarter since 2023. Our attrition rates have fallen significantly, the 10 percentage points we have dropped Y-o-Y this quarter. That's an important part of what clients trust, providers like us. So there is no structural leakage, if I may. The discretionary, which is -- the behavior of discretionary spend leads to it not coming back sometimes, coming back in shorter spurts, coming back in a delayed way. Those are the ones you would be watchful about. So that's broadly how I see it. I mean most of the managed services deals, we are winning, both with existing clients, new business as well, some which are proactively bid. We are on the winning side. We are mostly on the winning side in the last, I would say, 15 months or so. Jatin Dalal : Yes. And if I just add a perspective of the deals that we have won in last, let's say, 18 months. Typically, you would see that compared to what you expected at the time when you won the deal, typically, you will go sometimes faster because you are fulfilling better, you are executing better than what you initially thought and customer thought. And sometimes, it would be slower because there are more change management issues they need to deal with, et cetera. So I think we are evenly placed regarding the pace versus expectation. I don't see anything out of ordinary. There will always be one of the deals that is taking a little longer time to ramp up because there is some change in the client organization, but nothing that is out of ordinary on a win versus execution of the deal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I just wanted to start on gen AI. I kind of had a 2-part question there because I know, Ravi, you mentioned rural gen AI and accelerating software development a couple of times. Just curious what your longer-term views are on role of a human software developer will change as gen AI tools potentially do more of the actual coding. And then just you mentioned 450 active gen AI client engagements. Can you give us a sense of the average project size there? Ravi Kumar S : Thank you, Jason. The 450 -- let me start with the first one. The 450-odd client engagements, we've come a long way. If you remember, in quarter 2, 2023, we spoke about 100, and now we have 400 early client engagements. And these are very short prototype, rapid prototype kind of deals. 500 of them -- more than 500 of them, we have in the pipeline, and the thing to watch for now is how many of these will go into scaled execution for our clients. And that's where the monetize-able opportunities are. So we are continuing to work on it. There are broadly 2 things we are investing on -- or rather, three: first, follow the innovation cycles of AI; second, build the last-mile infrastructure so that the raw power of AI can be made production grade, enterprise grade for our clients. That means last-mile infrastructure related to managing AI platforms, orchestration. In case of AI and like other discontinuities, how do you improve the accuracy of the models? How do you create explainability because this is a black box? How do you create explainability? How do you create observability? So all of those platforms we have built and we have announced is the last-mile infrastructure I kind of referred to, which helps us to take the drop over and make it production grade. The second thing we're investing on is productivity studies. I mean, what does AI do to different roles and different operations of different industries? And how do we make embrace of AI much faster on larger cohorts? And we partnered with Oxford Economics and we created templates for every industry, every role, so that we can do an anatomy of tasks, as I call it. And then we then start to figure out how to create a much faster and a much broader embrace in enterprises. So this is preparing for the future where we believe enterprises are going to be a people-plus-machine endeavor. Now what does it do to our operating model? Our tech for tech, as I call it. It, of course, changes the productivity of a developer. When the cloud came into picture a couple of years ago, it flipped the productivity where, as a developer, you spend very little time on the plumbing, but you spend a lot of time on innovation. You spend a lot of time on building. This is our second shot at improving developer productivity and not actually spending time on repetitive tasks, not actually spending time on things which a machine can write, but you could actually pivot the developer productivity on innovation. So this is the second shot at it. And I would believe this is probably more disruptive than what the cloud did. And we think what will happen is this will lead to reducing backlog, improving the throughput to our clients, increasing the tech intensity at a lower cost. So I always believe that this is going to be an opportunity than a threat if we can pivot ourselves well. And the opportunity is about creating the tech intensity. Every industry doesn't have that intensity, so we have this unique opportunity to create that intensity at a lower cost and a lower entry barrier. I mean you don't need to be a developer to embrace software code, which means the entry barrier goes down. So we think we have a bigger opportunity than before as long as we can embrace this into our own landscape and equally build the use cases for our clients to embrace it. So I see this as a uniquely big opportunity for companies like Cognizant. Jason Kupferberg : That's good color. And then just a quick follow-up. You mentioned 8 large deals you won in the quarter, $100 million-plus TCV, I think. Are those expected to contribute materially to 2024 revenue? And if so, were they already contemplated in your original revenue guidance? Ravi Kumar S : Yes, I mean the visibility we have so far on the deals we have won, we have baked it into our guidance range. But Jason, you know this, the deals we won last year have a better throughput this year. And the deals we win this year will have a better throughput in the second half of this year and in 2025. The challenge in 2023 was we did have that backlog as we got into 2023 because we were not playing on large deals. Right now, I don't have that challenge because I had a good, healthy pipeline in 2023 that's contributing to 2024. And then we keep doing this in the same sustained manner, we will exit into 2025 with tail velocity. So the first year is normally lower than the second year. And by the end of the second year, you get to the run rate you have to. Normally, the span of the deals has changed. Earlier, it used to be lower. Now, it's 3.5 years or plus because large deals now come on a cost-takeout model, unlike transformation related to -- unlike transformation-related large deals. But once we start to execute and get the bid versus bid in a good shape, then the committed spend will then flip over to new spend because you're already in the groove. So that's what we are betting on as well. I mean, once you start to perform well, you have the license to take more from our clients. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. You kind of laid out what needed to happen, particularly in the return of discretionary deals in order to get to the high end of your guidance range. Conversely, what would be the scenario in your mind that would end up with you towards the lower end of that guided range? I mean, are we looking at incremental pushouts and delays of starting of deals? Or I'm just trying to get a gauge there on the bottom end. Jatin Dalal : Yes, sure. So if you do that mathematically, I'm sure you already looked at those numbers, and those numbers really mean a very flattish performance for rest of the year and a negative performance that typically happens in quarter 4, given the furloughs. So that's the sort of trajectory we are looking at if markets really tanked and our performance didn't show any positive progress. James Faucette : Got it. Got it. Okay. And then there's been a lot of talk about the transformational or discretionary deals and more focus on transformation. And it seems like that that's directly impacting your bookings and the types of things that you're able to put in into the pipeline right now. But is that having any impact on what you're doing from a hiring or skilling perspective? And how should we think about that as we go into next year if this kind of environment persists? Are there other considerations we should be taking into account in terms of how you'll be hiring and what impact that could have on profitability, et cetera? Ravi Kumar S : Yes. So discretionary is small projects. Normally, in smaller projects, you have a different kind of a pyramid versus large deals, where you have a much healthy pyramid, if I may. So with discretionary -- normally, when discretionary comes in, you hire more lateral hires with experience. And when you deal with managed services deals, you hire the pyramid because the pyramid rightly fits in there. So that's probably how it is. If you've noticed, we improved utilization from quarter 4 to quarter 1. So that gave us the extra runway, and we'll continue to sharpen our utilization. So that gives us the continued extra runway to grow and keep the engine agile enough to hire the senior people you need and rotate the people from existing teams into newer projects as that happens. So I think we have that agility now on our fulfillment engines. I'm very pleased not just about the -- how we have tackled the demand environment. We're very pleased with what we have done on utilization and what we have done on fulfillment of deals we have won as well as getting prepared for the discretionary spend whenever it eventually comes back. So the engine is as agile enough for the current demand situation as well as if there is a spike in the demand. We think we are well placed to seize those opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Moshe Katri : It's Moshe Katri from Wedbush. Ravi, congrats on strong execution in a pretty tough environment. I just want to go back to the booking kind of metrics, 1.3x book-to-bill. Is there a way to kind of break it down by new logos to the renewals and extensions and maybe compared to last year of, I guess, you mentioned ACV? I think you said bookings on a 12-month basis were up 1%. Is there a way to kind of get the same comps for ACVs? Ravi Kumar S : Moshe, good to hear from you. So we do have that visibility. We have not published that externally. What we track is multiple things. We track the total contract value, the size of the deals, the duration of the deals, how much of that translates to ACV for this year and ACV for the next year, so for the first 12 months or the next 12 months. And we also track the pyramid attached to it and the capability set needed. So I pretty much have that information to rely on so that we can get our fulfillment engine intact as well as forecast better. So it is something we have. We have not published that externally, but I'm keeping a constant track on it. And in the book-to-bill ratios, Moshe, you know this, it also depends on what are the duration of the deals. I'm sure you asked this question because of that. The duration of the deals, when you take large deals, they go up. When you take small deals, it goes down. So the book-to-bill has a meaningful impact between the 2. So one of the other metrics we are internally tracking is ACV because then that gives us what is the incremental revenue we'll get for the current calendar year. So it's a combination of things you have to put together to get to a point where you know how much is it going to incrementally contribute to growth. Moshe Katri : Okay. And then is there a way to get that mix of new logos to renewals? Or that's also kind of internal and you don't disclose that? Ravi Kumar S : So we have had a very healthy new logo program, Moshe. Since I've come on board, we have a specific program for new logos. We also have a program to ramp new logos to, say, a $50 million or $100 million client, an annual spend of $100 million, $50 million client. I mean opening new logos is one thing, but ramping them up to a $50 million account is another thing. So we have put both swim lanes. We're very, very active in our journey. We also have a target list now of new logos and geo-based. And we have kind of separated that from the mining engine because the hunting engine has to -- the hunting engine is humming very well. And there's a transition to the mining engine as the annual size of those accounts changes. What we have not done is we have not expressed this to our market on how many new logos we are opening, and we have not created that information pack in the external market. But internally, we're very, very pleased with where we are on new logos and how we are ramping it up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with SIG. James Friedman : Jatin, I just want to make sure I'm understanding how you're thinking about the shape of the year. If I take the midpoint of your Q2 sequential and if I make the assumption that the Q4 is flat, and I know in most years, it's not, but just for simple math, I'm getting about a 2.5% sequential in the Q3. Does that sound about right to you? Jatin Dalal : I'm -- I don't have the math in front of me, but yes, I mean, qualitatively, I would agree with you that we'll have to have a strong quarter 3 and a flattish quarter 4 for us to get to the -- towards the higher range -- higher end of our range, for sure. James Friedman : Okay. And then Ravi, you, I think, used the word green shoot in the context of the BFS letters in BFSI. And it's the first time I've heard your company or most companies use that language with those 3 letters in years. Can you elaborate on that? Ravi Kumar S : Yes. So the context was if you look at the last few quarters of sequential drop in BFS, you would notice that the sequential drop is relatively smaller between quarter 4 and quarter 1. So something has happened in between. So in the last 12 months, we have worked on reorganizing our BFSI vertical. We have energized the teams with some new hires. We have now a exceptionally good list of offerings. I mean, I now have an operating list for banking and financial services or for insurance. We have opened doors on fintech. We have taken AI and created small discretionary spend opportunities for ourselves. Just to give you a sense in insurance, we have quite a few AI projects running. So we have a variety of things happening. I'll give you one or 2 examples. In insurance, there is mainframe modernization, which is a important initiative. In P&C insurance, there is digitizing the distribution network, which is primarily agents and platforms. The group benefits and the policy admin platforms are going through a significant change. In banking and financial services, customer service is going through a significant transformation. So we have an offering that -- and it is an offering which is bundled with AI. We have fraud detection and prevention, which is an important opportunity. The regional banks are going through massive cost takeout. We have an offering out there. So I think we now have -- I mean, there is a market reality of what is happening in BFSI. And there is the organizational strength to counter that market reality. So we are a stable shop with all the offerings in place with the right teams, and we are climbing up the ladder. We are trying everything we can in a tough market. Jatin Dalal : Yes. Sorry, Jamie. I just add to what I just said before. It's -- I want to go back to what I said in response to an earlier question saying, our expected likely outcome is what we see at the midpoint of the guidance. And then we see the range of possibility on the both ends. And when you specifically asked, I was reacting to the range of possibility on the upper end. I mean, I just want to reflect accordingly so that I respond to you in its completeness. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's second quarter 2024 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will provide certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased with our strong execution and results in what remains a challenging market. We delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance range, expanded our adjusted operating margin both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, sustained our large deal momentum by signing five deals each with total contract value of $100 million or more, and announced an agreement to acquire Belcan, which is expected to expand our ER&D capabilities, while diversifying into the high-growth aerospace and defense sectors. Although the demand environment remains challenging and clients' discretionary spending behavior is unchanged from recent quarters, we believe these results demonstrate our rigorous execution against the strategic priorities we set forth last year. Q2 revenue was $4.85 billion, which was $30 million above the high end of our guidance range and grew 2.1% sequentially in constant currency. This was the highest quarter-over-quarter growth since 2022. With strong execution of our NextGen program and overall cost discipline, we achieved adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year. Our trailing 12-months voluntary attrition for tech services was 13.6% compared to nearly 20% in the prior-year period. Second quarter bookings grew 5% year-over-year and, on a trailing 12-months basis, bookings were $26.2 billion, representing a 1.4x book-to-bill. In addition to the five deals each with TCV of over $100 million, we signed two deals that were above $90 million each. In the first half of this year, we have now signed 13 deals each with TCV of over $100 million, well ahead of our 2023 pace, which included 17 deals of this size for the entire year. From a segment perspective, we are especially pleased with Financial Services, which grew 5% sequentially in constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas. Within Financial Services, our banking business posted a second consecutive quarter of sequential growth and returned to modest year-over-year growth in constant currency for the first time since Q2 of 2022. We are seeing demand being driven by client investments and hyper personalization, infrastructure and platform modernization. Our insurance sub-segment also grew sequentially in Q2, and one of the $500 million-plus TCV deals we signed this quarter was with a large American insurance provider. I believe these results reflect our actions to stabilize the BFSI business since last year. Over that period, we put new leadership in place and drove greater industry focus on this customer segments. We also aligned our go-to-market approach and launched industry-led service offerings in areas like real-time payment fraud detection, payments hub modernization and digital banking. Health Sciences grew by 3% sequentially in constant currency and we see a number of positive secular trends. For example, payers and providers remain focused on reducing the cost of care. We believe this is benefiting our TriZetto platform, where we are helping clients manage more than [$500 billion] (ph) in complex claims and improve patient outcomes. TriZetto's end-to-end capabilities are gaining traction as clients see the value of -- in our ability to provide both revenue cycle management and clearinghouse services. On the payer side, we're seeing demand being driven by data and cloud modernization as our clients seek to deliver a modern best-in-class consumer experience for the members. And in life sciences, clients have begun moving beyond cost optimization projects to once that accelerate their GenAI and digital transformation in R&D and continue to drive enterprise modernization with SAP S/4HANA. By region, we are very pleased with the performance in Americas, where revenue grew 2.8% sequentially and returned to growth year-over-year. I am extremely proud of the progress the team has made and I'm confident in our opportunities ahead. Looking back over the last 18 months, we believe our strategic investments and focus on improving our operational rigor has further strengthened a foundation on which we can drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. We invested in our leadership team and attracted new talent to the organization. We drove internal process improvements, particularly around large deals and our talent. And we focus sharply on strengthening our relevance with clients through investments in our innovation strategy and platform offerings. We believe these changes are starting to pay off and are reflected in our recent revenue performance and year-over-year operating margin expansion in the first half of this year. We have maintained our focus on becoming an employer of choice in our industry and we're recognized by the Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Places to Work and Greatest Places for Job Starters. We also continue to expand our footprint in smaller cities in India with the opening of a newest office in Indore, as we remain committed to bringing offices closest to where our employees are. And I'm pleased with Bluebolt, our grassroots innovation program, which has generated 210,000 ideas by our associates since its inception last year. We're also hearing positive feedback from our customers through our project-level net promoter score, which I'm pleased to say has improved consistently since 2021 through the first half of 2024. This quarter marks our highest NPS to-date. We have taken a number of actions to-date to accelerate growth and drive operational improvements, and we look forward to continuing to update shareholders on our progress. To that end, we plan to provide an investor update in the first half of 2025 to discuss, among other things, our strategy, our differentiation in the market, our efforts to create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. A prime example of our investments in higher-growth industries and expanding capabilities is our agreements to acquire Belcan, a leading global supplier of engineering, research and development, or ER&D, services. We have seen growing demand in ER&D services, an estimated $190 billion market whose high growth has been fueled by the convergence of digital technology and the physical world. Over the last three years, we have strengthened our ER&D capabilities, starting with our 2021 acquisition of ESG Mobility, a digital automotive ER&D provider for connected autonomous and electric vehicles. And at the start of my term last year, we acquired Mobica, which focuses on IoT-embedded software engineering capabilities from the chip to the cloud. We expect the Belcan acquisition to provide an opportunity for us to expand our service offerings into growth vectors that help move the physical world of manufacturing aerospace and automotive into the age of digital data and AI. Earlier this week, we introduced the next evolution of our experienced practice area called Cognizant Moment, which is a new integrated business within Cognizant that builds on our over 20 years of expertise and digital experience. Cognizant Moment will focus on next-generation experience services that are dynamic, data-led and AI-powered, harnessing the content generation and personalization power that generative AI brings, combined with human ingenuity, to help clients innovate, differentiate and grow. The creative and programmatic services lifecycle is expected to go through significant transformation in the years ahead, and we see an opportunity to disrupt the status quo agency model as creative content becomes increasingly generated and orchestrated by Gen AI-led models. Moving on to additional highlights from the quarter. We extended our relationship with Victory Capital to provide IT infrastructure and data analytics support. Over the next five years, we aim to provide this client with new service management capabilities, improved service productivity, opportunities for cost savings and the ability for Victory Capital to cost effectively scale in support of business growth. Additionally, we signed an agreement to provide engineering services to Gentherm, the global market leader of innovative thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry. Under this agreement, we will expand our existing services to help develop a next-generation of products aimed at elevating customer vehicle experiences. Our expertise in firmware development and verification and validation from the Mobica acquisition played a critical role in differentiating our value proposition. We have also seen increased demand for infrastructure-led transformation to cloud, boosted in part by our Thirdera business, which we acquired in the first quarter. And our platform investments have helped drive increased Gen AI adoption. As of this quarter, we have over 200 clients on our AI-led platforms, including Neuro IT operations, Skygrade and Flowsource. Now, where are we with Gen AI? We see one of the biggest opportunities for Gen AI as tech-for-tech, which applies Gen AI to our software development cycles. With higher cost of capital in recent times, we believe that the need to do more with less combined with the leveraging of generative AI with lead companies into an era of hyper productivity. We believe this will fuel the next wave of digital transformation as clients seek to modernize the tech stack and reimagine business workflows with partners like Cognizant. In fact, in recently released follow-on analysis to our 2023 study with Oxford Economics, 70% of the respondents globally indicated they're not moving fast with Gen AI and 82% indicated a delay in execution could put them at a disadvantage. We are seeing a desire from our own clients to move more quickly. Over the past few quarters, we have become more deeply involved in our clients' Gen AI journeys. As of the end of second quarter, we have over 750 early client engagements, up from 450 in Q1, and we have over 600 opportunities in the pipeline compared to 500 last quarter. These early engagements have been across verticals with healthy activity in products and resources along with Financial Services and Health Sciences. We're seeing demand across four key areas : first, customer and employee experience; second, content summarization; third, content generation; and finally, tech-for-tech to accelerate innovation and technology development cycles. As an example of our recent work, Cognizant designed and recommended a business and technology architecture for AI development for a multinational accounting and audit services firm. This work included identifying the relevant technologies, infrastructure, skillsets, processes and data required to support AI development across the organization. And we are building a strong partnership eco-system to support our Gen AI strategy. This quarter, we are selected as an AWS Gen AI competency partner driven by our capabilities in addressing complex industry problems and our expertise in AWS specific Gen AI solutions. And we have signed a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS to bring smart manufacturing solutions powered by Gen AI to market and transform manufacturing operations across various industries. As another example, we helped set up the world's largest pharmaceutical company's AWS infrastructure as a part of their Gen AI journey. We also automated the client's channeling of desperate data sources into a single vector data store to build a foundation for the Gen AI programs. In Health Sciences, we launched a first set of healthcare large language model solutions and Google Cloud's Gen AI technology, including Google's Vertex AI platform and Gemini models. The suite of solutions addressing four workflows, marketing operations, call center operations, provider management and contracting. Our aim is to improve healthcare administrative processes and experiences for our clients and their clients. We believe Gen AI has become a catalyst for clients who are behind in their data modernization or cloud journey and we are pursuing these projects to help them lay the foundation for enterprise-grade Gen AI implementations. In closing, I want to thank our employees around the world for their dedication to our clients in Cognizant. We have been executing well in a challenging macro-environment. In the back half of 2024, we'll remain focused on our strategic priorities to drive revenue growth, become the employer of choice in our industry and to simplify our operations. With that, I'll hand it over to Jatin. Jatin Dalal : Thank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us. Second quarter revenue and operating margin came in above our expectations. Despite customer behavior and discretionary spending trends remaining largely unchanged, strong execution and the ramp-up of large deals supported sequential revenue growth of 2.1% in constant currency. This provides us with revenue exit velocity going into Q3, and has allowed us to increase the midpoint of our organic revenue growth guidance for the full year. Our cost optimization efforts, including structural actions under the NextGen program helped us deliver adjusted operating margins of 15.2%. This was a modest increase sequentially and 100 basis point increase from the prior-year period. We are pleased with the cost savings we have achieved under the program, which allowed us to expand adjusted operating margin while funding growth investments. Now, let's turn to the details. Second quarter revenue was approximately $4.9 billion, which, Ravi mentioned, exceeded the higher end of our guidance range. This represented a decline of 0.7% year-over-year or a decline of 0.5% in constant currency. In constant currency, growth was approximately 50 basis points better than the high end of our guidance range. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 60 basis points of growth from the recent acquisitions. Q2 bookings grew 5% year-over-year and were driven by mid-sized deals. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ticked up slightly to 1.4x from 1.3x in Q1. We continue to see a lengthening of contract durations, driven by a shift to larger longer-term contracts. This has extended the revenue conversion timing, but also provided improved forward visibility. As Ravi mentioned, we were pleased with the improved performance in Financial Services, which grew 5% sequentially. Our Health Sciences business grew over 3% sequentially with solid growth across payer, provider and life sciences customers. Products & Resources revenue was down modestly quarter-over-quarter and down approximately 4% year-over-year in constant currency. The decline was due to ongoing discretionary spending pressure among our customers. We have seen demand in areas like grid modernization and cloud modernization investments among our utility customers. We have also seen pockets of strength in the travel and hospitality sector, led by improved travel demand as well as interest in Gen AI-powered personalization to deliver differentiated guest experiences. Our pipeline in Products & Resources remains healthy and we are excited to close the Belcan acquisition, which we expect will provide new growth opportunities in this segment. Communications, Media & Technology grew year-over-year, again supported by recently completed acquisitions. We have also continued to benefit from the ramp of new business within comms and media, which has helped offset lower level of discretionary spending among the technology customers. By geography, we were pleased with the growth in North America, driven in part by large deals ramping up over the last few quarters. However, other parts of the world, particularly Europe, remain challenged by soft discretionary spending. Despite this, we were also pleased with our return to sequential growth in our rest of the world region, where we are seeing early progress from recently won large deals and new logos and a healthy pipeline of new opportunities. Now, moving to margins. NextGen cost saving continued to progress and helped us offset the margin impact of recent large deal ramps. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $29 million in costs related to NextGen, which negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 60 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, the prior-year period included a 60 basis points benefit from an insurance recovery. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%, reflecting a benefit from the timing of discrete items. Q2 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.14 and Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.17. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.6 billion. DSO of 80 days was up two days sequentially and increased five days year-over-year, driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q2 was $183 million, primarily reflecting the seasonality. During the quarter, we returned $226 million to the shareholders, including $76 million through share repurchases and $150 million through our regular dividend. At the end of Q2, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. As of today, other than the expected closing of Belcan, we do not anticipate any material inorganic activity for the remainder of the year. As our immediate focus is on closing the Belcan acquisition and its initial integration work. We expect to return approximately $600 million to shareholders in form of share re-purchases and dividends in the second half of this year. This is expected to bring total capital return to the shareholders to approximately $1.1 billion for the full year. These amounts exclude the expected additional share repurchase activity to offset the new shares we plan to issue as part of Belcan acquisition. Turning to our forward outlook now. Our updated guidance does not include contribution from Belcan. We plan to update our outlook after the acquisition has closed, which we still expect to occur in the third quarter. There are no changes to the estimated financial impact that we provided at the time of the announcement. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to up 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Sequentially, this implies a growth of 0.7% to 2.2% in constant currency. For the full year, our organic revenue growth outlook has modestly improved. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion, which is a decline of 0.5% to growth of 1% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Our updated guidance includes approximately 70 basis points of inorganic contribution versus our prior guidance of up to 100 basis points. This reflects the contribution from only our completed transactions. Therefore, at the midpoint, our organic growth outlook has improved by approximately 55 basis points. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our first half performance and we continue to expect the full year to be in the range of 15.3% to 15.5%. Our guidance includes the expected impact of our merit cycle, which will take effect on August 1st. We expect this will be partially offset by the savings from our NextGen program and operational discipline. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $80 million, which compares to $60 million previously. Our adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% remains unchanged. Our full year free cash flow guidance is also unchanged and we continue to expect it will represent 80% of net income. This includes the negative impact from $360 million payment made to Indian tax authorities in the first quarter in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter. Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.62 to $4.70, which reflects a $0.07 increase in the midpoint versus our prior range of $4.50 and $4.68. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jim Schneider : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. First of all, on generative AI, helpful commentary, and Ravi, you mentioned the 750 early client engagements. Could you indicate whether any of your clients are moving beyond the proof of concept stage and what are those larger engagements -- what form are they taking? And can you maybe quantify the amount of bookings you currently have tied to generative AI at this stage? Ravi Kumar : Yeah, thank you for that question. I think the one thing you want to know is generative AI is diffusing into all our technology-led projects in a very, very fast way. So, the ability to ring fence it and start to think about what it does to a technology, what it doesn't do a technology or how do you trace it back is always hard. So the best metric for us was to find out the number of projects we are doing around generative AI. So, the number we gave this quarter was 750, which is up from 450 last quarter. So, we're very, very pleased with the number of early engagements. We have 600 more in the pipeline. And if you remember quarter two of last year, we spoke about 100 active engagements. So, we've gone all the way from 100 to 750. Now, how much of this is going into real production work? I would say very small number of projects are going into production work. And that number is small because of multiple reasons. One is, as you get to production-grade work, you need to start to think about your data architecture, you need to start to think about your cloud infrastructure, and you also need to start to think about the cost of compute, the availability of talent and everything else. So, only a small minor portion of it is going into live production work. But what we are pleased is as we get past these inhibitors, if I may, we're going to see a sharpest curve. I actually believe this is going to be a sharpest curve. A lot of them are related to productivity and task automation. So, the benefits are very tangible, and hence, it will go through the sharpest curve. But progressively, we will start to see more projects related to innovation, more projects related to change in operating model. And in fact, one of the surveys we did just a few weeks ago with 2,200 business executives from 15 countries has also started to tell us that productivity doesn't mean just cost reduction. Productivity also means new revenue streams and new products and new services. So, we are, again, excited about the fact that if it is revenue generating, the acceleration to the smart -- the sharp S curve is going to be much quicker. So that's one metric to know how well we're doing. The second metric I would say, which I spoke about, is we have 200-plus clients on all our platforms, AI platforms. The AI platforms we have at Cognizant are all related to how do you take foundation models and make them production grade, be it accuracy of the models, be it governance, be it management, be it responsible AI. So, these 200 clients are experimenting with us to make sure that they're getting ready for production, because they're a part of our platform. So, that gives me indication that there is a good momentum in the future. We also dissect this into four different categories. A lot of it is content aggregation and customer experience and employee experience. Again, the benefits in the business case are very tangible here. So, we will see faster acceleration. Then, of course, the biggest use case is tech for tech, which is applying it to development cycles. The challenges in that particular case, you have to share the productivity benefits with your clients. So, the good news is, it increases our win rates. And if we are ahead of the curve, we get to save some of that. And the last one, I would say, is content generation, which is more creative. It will take a little longer time. So overall, we're very pleased with where we are. We're very pleased with the fact that some of this is leading to more structural work related to data and cloud, which by itself is a heavy lift for us, which will then get monetized into services dollars. So that's broadly where generative AI story is. And I think the excitement about how much productivity we can generate for our clients and create a flywheel on this makes it the biggest opportunity for us to tap into the future. Jim Schneider : Thanks for that. And second one, if I may, on gross margins, in the quarter, revenue was up sequentially, headcount was down, I believe, and utilization was up. So, what were some of the factors that are pressuring the gross margins such as project pricing and higher start-up costs on large deals? And can you maybe comment on the prospects or expanding those gross margins over the next couple of quarters? Jatin Dalal : Sure. So, quarter two was a good execution quarter where we improved our utilization. We continue to deliver sequential growth while actually reducing the trajectory of employees in terms of the headcount. So, overall, good execution. Why you are not seeing it yet reflected in the gross margin is really what you mentioned, the growth or the ramp up of the large deals that we have won in past, and they are ramping up and there is an initial investment of slightly lower margin as those deals ramp up. And that's the reason that gross margin number has remained flattish between quarter one and quarter two. We are optimistic that as we move into quarter three, quarter four, you should start seeing a slightly better performance on gross margin as we get through quarter four. Ravi Kumar : Just to link back to your AI question on this, if you look at the math, we sequentially dropped by 8,000-odd people and year-on-year we dropped by 9,000 people, but we sequentially grew by 2%. And what that really means is a part of it is running with tight utilization. A part of it is related to AI, doing work with lesser number of people, and therefore, creating a productivity benefit for us. So, just to add to the AI -- the reason why some of that is explainable is also because AI and automation is starting to be applied to our projects. Jim Schneider : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on bookings, so nice to see a return to growth here. It does seem like you've had a recent uptick in deal activity just based on your announcements. Can you comment on the level of bookings that you would say are kind of net new work versus renewals? And just any common threads to highlight across the latest deals that were announced? Ravi Kumar : So, let me take a shot at it and I'll ask Jatin to add. We don't give the renewal and -- split of renewal and new business, but I can tell you one thing that our new business is significantly higher than the renewals in 2024 versus 2023. So, we're very, very happy about it. The second is there is also new logos and expansion in the bookings. So, we are again very pleased. One of the reasons why Financial Services grew well -- I mean Financial Services grew sequentially after 2022 and it grew well, because we also opened new logos. We started to look for expansion in existing customers. So that's all contributing to our bookings. We had five large deals with more than $100 million and we had two of them with the range of $90 million-plus. In fact, all five of them actually had expansion in new business in the mix. So, we are again very pleased about how the amount of work we're getting, which is new and expansion, is increasing. Of course, the duration of deals is also increasing. On the higher end, I mean the larger deals above $50 million, the duration is increasing. While it creates stickiness, but it also creates a little bit of a tail on -- when the revenue is going to be realized as we go forward. Bryan Bergin : Okay. I appreciate that detail. And then my follow-up on Belcan. So, I understand you're still waiting to close the deal. I believe you mentioned it was estimated to be about 40 bps of a margin headwind and then some revenue synergies over three years. Can you detail kind of the transitory costs, the deal costs in that 40 bps versus the structural margin of Belcan? And then just any further detail on kind of how you thought about the phasing of the $100 million-plus revenue synergies over three years? Jatin Dalal : Yeah. So, we -- I mean the numbers that you mentioned are accurate, 40 basis point of margin dilution and the synergy numbers. We will share a more detailed update on Belcan on closing including making sure that our guidance then reflects the Belcan acquisition for the rest of the year. There is no new or -- new data point or update to the numbers that we had shared before at this juncture. Bryan Bergin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate the insight here. I understand some of the efficiency gains you're seeing, but how much room do you have in utilization before it perhaps runs too hot? And how are you thinking about pace of hiring for the remainder of the year, particularly as you look to support from the deal wins and pipeline? Additionally, any callouts here around competition for talent given the higher attrition you saw? Jatin Dalal : So, this is Jatin, and I'll go first, and I'll request Ravi to add. I think so far, we are seeing stability in the talent marketplace. It is reflected in our attrition. We are seeing sufficient availability of the talent that we need to hire for the specific skill set that we need to hire from the marketplace. There will always be couple of skill sets which are more hot or difficult to find than others, but on an aggregate basis, I think we still have a reasonably good market for talent as we look at the second half of the year. Ravi Kumar : Was there a first part of the question as well, Jonathan? Jonathan Lee : Yeah, it was more about the room you have in utilization before it perhaps runs too hot. Jatin Dalal : I think we still have some headspace for sure as we exit quarter two. Certainly, not as -- I mean, the headspace we have continued to sort of utilize and this is the third quarter of improvement utilization. So, we are continuing to improve it. We have some space. I wouldn't say it's a significant space. And we are managing the supply chain with that visibility of headspace and the demand which is coming into the door. And we are confident that we'll be able to manage the demand and supply chain equation well as we execute through the second half of the year. Ravi Kumar : Yeah. So, just to add some more color, Jonathan, on this, we are now at a spot where we have significant attractiveness in the market for employees to join us. I mean, our momentum in the market also allows us, gives us the ability to hire. We also have returners. In fact, we have a historic return of returners as I call it. I mean, it is people coming back who worked at Cognizant before. And our fulfillment engine is a combination of four things : freshers, rotating talent inside the company, reskilling from the adjacencies, and hiring lateral talent. All four, I think, we are getting better and better and better since the last 18 months. So, we are gearing up for a high-demand situation whenever, but we want to be prepared for it. Our two big industries, financial services and healthcare, together is 60% of our business. They're both in great and in a good spot. So that gives us confidence. I mean these were two verticals where Cognizant's legacy and heritage was so strong. So, we are back on those two verticals with a good positive momentum. Jonathan Lee : Thanks for the [detail] (ph) there. How should we think about potential for stabilization around large deal project margin, especially given some of the elongation of the duration in these large deals? And how are you thinking about pyramid structure around staffing these large deals? Ravi Kumar : Yeah. So, large deals -- and Jatin chip-in as I complete. Large deals always have upfront cost and downstream revenue kind of a thing, because you do transition and a lot of these are vendor consolidation, cost optimization kind of deal. So, you will have to invest on transition and everything else. So, there is lumpiness on how that works, but we have now muscle to execute them pretty well. We have done this for 18 months now. We've been on a cycle of winning and delivering the large deals. So we're very confident of continuing on that process. We are not only doing this on application services now, which was the heritage and the historic muscle of Cognizant. We are doing it in BPO and infrastructure services, and now we're starting to see good traction in ER&D and as Belcan comes in subsequently, we will -- hopefully as it gets close, we will hopefully have more of it as well. So, it's a much more comprehensive breadth of capability and the breadth of large deals which we are executing on. We are competing in the market and the levers to compete are not just arbitrage on labor, the levers to compete are also productivity levers powered by automation and AI. And I think we are ahead of the curve. That's one of the reasons why we are winning more. It is a wallet share, which we are picking up from our peers. Jatin, do you want to add anything? Jatin Dalal : Yeah. I think the only additional color is there are two ways of looking at a large deal sort of dynamics or financials. One way is that they initially do come with lower margins, but if you see the construct of a large deal, they are typically fixed price projects over a long-term period, which means your ability to improve overall pyramid into the company, deploy Gen Zs as we call them internally or fresh talent at the bottom of the pyramid is much better, ability to execute on your automation goal is far superior in a larger program. So overall, the second way of looking at a large deal is that you can really push the envelope of efficiency and productivity much better than what you would be able to do in a time and material construct. So, it has also a positive angle to it as the deal matures. Jonathan Lee : Always appreciate the color. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. Rod Bourgeois : Okay, great. Hey, Ravi, a couple of big picture questions. Over the last year and a half, you've been in a turnaround situation, while also wrestling with a cyclical downturn in demand. You've definitely made progress on shoring up talent and the culture and you're now winning these large deals. I just wanted to see if you can now speak to like your main goals for the next phase of Cognizant's improvement process? Ravi Kumar : Rod, thank you for that question. I've always been a believer of layering performance and change. So, for the first 18 months, I've been constantly making changes and generating performance and using the performance to make more change. At the end of first year, we bought a company called Thirdera, and that was the time I started to believe that performance has changed as you layer it. You also start to get the license to do some big bets. So, we made that big bet of buying Thirdera, which is the single largest ServiceNow standalone company. And right now, they're probably one of the top two players of ServiceNow in the market. And I'm very confident that journey will continue. In the first half of this year, we started to think that -- our business has four vectors, as I said, tech services, BPO, infrastructure-led services, which is security, cloud, everything put together, and ER&D. We always wanted to take another big bet and look for a different bio group and look for a different industry muscle, if I may, and we took a bet on Belcan, which gives us the opportunity to be in aerospace and automotive embedded software and engineering research and development, which is a different buyer group in any of our clients. And we took a bet because we think that's going to increase the breadth of services and it's going to give us a new vector for growth. So, I think I'm going to layer the performance and change on a constant basis and keep looking for big bets so that we make this a resilient platform. Remember, healthcare and financial services, we are heavy on it. Now, we're going to create muscle on manufacturing, industrial, automotive, aerospace, which is going to be a very different industry vector. We are -- we will constantly keep looking for bridging those gaps in new industries and a breadth of capabilities and also expanding internationally as we go forward because we are over indexed on the U.S. So that will be my goal to create sustained momentum and create a resilient platform for our employees and our clients. Rod Bourgeois : Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for sharing that. And maybe I'll change my follow-up given your answer related to Belcan. One of the questions that we're seeing right now Capgemini recently cited weakened demand in aerospace and automotive. Those are verticals that had been very strong over the last year at most players. Are you seeing similar trends in aerospace and automotive weakening, or is that not really a concern, especially as you onboard the Belcan business? Ravi Kumar : Rod, that's a great question. Organically, we are seeing strength in automotive. Our pivot on Belcan is very simple. We think the next decade is going to be about digitizing everything physical, so we believe the industries like manufacturing, industrial, automotive, aero. If you pivot into services, which are embedded software, pivot into services, which are digital in nature, there's significant headroom, and there is very little spent in the last 10 years, and therefore, I think the next 10 years are going to be much better. So therefore, I actually believe there are -- there is more space and more room for us. Our concentration is very high in healthcare and financial services. So, this actually gives us much -- a very different industry vertical, but it also gives us an opportunity to bring technology closer to the physical manifestation of these industries. So, that thesis of mind still holds. And I think with AI in the mix now, I actually believe the offerings we will now present to that industry segment are going to be as contemporary, and therefore, will continue to flourish. So that's my thesis when I looked at Belcan and that would be the thesis that it will remain with me even now. Rod Bourgeois : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. James Faucette : Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate all the color. Encouraging to see the turn in in the financial services end market, et cetera. And it seems like [indiscernible] things from others. Kind of wondering what your visibility is on that part of your end market base. And what the nature of the work is that you're doing now say versus before it kind of turned down and if that's changed at all? Ravi Kumar : Financial Services, we've been working on it since 2023. 2023, we stabilized the teams, we ensured that the leaks we had -- we were on the other side. I mean when consolidation happened, we lost business in 2022. We now are gaining market share when there is consolidation. And we did a very good job of leading that vertical with industry solutions. So that helped us to pivot into some of the small discretionary spend, which is coming back to -- we rallied behind it. So, the industry solution approach, a stable team, walking the corridors, proactively pitching for value-led work, breadth of capability now, I mean, we are no longer a tech services firm, we have a breadth of capability, all of that has helped us to stabilize financial services. Of course, there's going to be variability quarter-on-quarter, but we feel confident about the fact that each one of those subsegments underneath that are in good shape. Our business in Americas and banking has sequentially done pretty well for two quarters in a row. So, now we are starting to progressively take that -- take the same template to -- in the international market, so that we could replicate that success. James Faucette : Got it. Appreciate that. And then, back on Gen AI, I'm just wondering if you're seeing those projects crowd out other consulting priorities. And if so, which ones? Or are we still -- as you suggested, still so early before moving to full production implementation of AI -- Gen AI projects that it's not really having much of an impact? Ravi Kumar : That's a very good question. In fact, I agree with you that a lot of the consulting dollars are getting diverted to generative AI. I mean, all the way from business case creation to governance to -- some companies are reorganizing their -- I know companies which are now saying, we need to reestablish an enterprise 2.0, so that process and technology can be together and it could be a distributed networked organization versus a hierarchical setup. So, lots of organizational change and experimentation is actually led by generative AI. So, some of the discretionary is getting diverted there. But these are small prototypes, and as you finish the prototypes, you start to see the bottlenecks to take it to production. The good news is at least you start to know what the bottlenecks are and then you start to work on it and then you take them to production grade. I have at least some projects which have started to go production grade. I've mentioned it in my earnings, which is a pharmaceutical company taking generative AI for drug development and insurers using generative AI to support claims which come in, which need to be corrected because there are either fields which have not been filled up or there are clarifications. So, I think at a task level, we are starting to see this go forward. The productivity studies we did in 2023 that helped us also to put the business case up. So, we've seen in healthcare in one of my clients, we've done auto adjudication of claims better using generative AI. So, the ability to make this a very outcome-centric business case will allow us to take this to more production-grade work, and the ability to continue to look for new use cases will help us to build the pipeline as the old ones mature. James Faucette : Great. Appreciate all that color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey, thanks so much. Just want to follow-up on your answer to Bryan's, I think, question on bookings. Ravi, you mentioned duration. I always ask you, but I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on just the ACV versus TCV dynamic. Has that changed, improved, worsened? And then also on incremental bookings, where is the work coming from? Is it new work or take away from other vendors? Has that changed at all in terms of sourcing deals? Thanks. Jatin Dalal : Yeah, sure. So, I think fundamentally not much change in ACV as you can imagine with the deal duration going up from -- I mean over longer term, it has to reflect in a slightly slower growth in ACV and that dynamics continue. However, we are clearly winning market share in as we execute every quarter. So, the deals that are ramping up or the deal announcement that we have done are really reflection of new work that Cognizant is getting, sometimes in new accounts, but also in many accounts where we were present, but we were not addressing that segment of the work with our customer. Ravi Kumar : There's also focus on new logos. So, it's a combination of new logos expansion and new work. And I can certainly tell you that the new work is outpacing the renewals at least in 2024. Tien- Tsin Huang : Right. Heard that. Loud and clear. Thank you for that. Just my quick follow-up on the fourth quarter implied from the guide for the full year that implies some sequential deceleration. Any call outs there beyond seasonality? Jatin Dalal : Yeah. So, you're right, it does at the midpoint of quarter three performance, it would imply a deceleration in quarter four, but that is really seasonality right now as we see it. Tien- Tsin Huang : Terrific. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys, very strong results. Nice to see that. Can you maybe -- I mean, the number one question we get from investors right now is like have we seen the bottom in IT services spend? I mean, this is pretty much what everyone is trying to figure out. Can you maybe make a more general comment from your seat on where we are in the cycle? Thank you. Jatin Dalal : So, it's a broad question. Let me address it from the context of Cognizant, clearly, for us, we see a growth as a guidance range that we have given for quarter three after a decline sort of a performance for [indiscernible]. So certainly, we are seeing an uptick and an improvement from where we were. So certainly, there is an uptick in the numbers in a positive growth trajectory as we progress through the year. It's difficult to make a comment on a larger market as we covered in our prepared remarks, market still remains uncertain, but clearly, there are pockets where there are opportunities and we are capitalizing on those opportunities as has been reflected in our BFSI performance, as has been reflected in our health performance, both of which our largest sector, we have delivered very strong sequential numbers. Ravi Kumar : Just to add to that, I said this before, we are -- we don't see deterioration or improvement. We see the market unchanged, as I call it. However, our execution, our fulfillment rates and our win ratios continue to be very strong. So therefore, we are winning wallet share in a market which has remained unchanged. Dan Dolev : Understood. And then maybe a follow-up on Gen AI. I know everyone's talking about this, but would you feel comfortable, I guess, at some point providing dollar value of the scope of the AI projects? Ravi Kumar : We have to keep thinking about what are the right ways to tell the market about generative AI. It's a pervasive technology and therefore it diffuses into everything we do. And because it is diffusing so fast, you almost want to say -- you almost don't know what to categorize as Gen AI and what not to categorize as Gen AI. The only thing I can say is in this market, you could win using generative AI, you could increase your win rates, you could create new deals, you could generate more momentum with your clients, equally you could flip it around and use it on your own self to disrupt your own development cycles of our teams and create productivity, which you can share with your clients and then create a flywheel of winnability through it. So, I mean, right now, we are talking about projects which we are doing, we are talking about platforms and how many clients have onboarded on platforms. The traceability to revenues is, I mean, anybody's guess what you call generative AI as generative AI and what you can't. I mean, today, data modernization project or a cloud modernization project, which we do because generative AI is going to be the future, I actually can call it as generative AI or I can say this is not generative AI. However, it is creating more momentum because that foundation is needed for generative AI. So I mean, we have to evolve this to an extent where we could communicate to all of you much -- in a much traceable way. But nobody has found -- I mean, nobody seems to have found the right way to do it. We are trying our best to tell you the traction we have. Dan Dolev : Fair enough. Great results again. Thank you. Jatin Dalal : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Ravi Kumar : Thank you so much. Thank you for joining in today and looking forward to the next quarter and thank you for all your support. Operator : This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions' second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's third quarter 2024 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which delivered revenue and earnings growth while expanding adjusted margins sequentially and represented strong execution of our strategic priorities to accelerate growth, become an employer of choice in our industry and modernize operations. We are seeing a gradual rebound of spend cycles and gaining wallet share in financial services. While our historical strength in health sciences is driving differentiation and growth. Meanwhile, a significant traction with large deals and AI-led revenue opportunities, investments in talent and a steadfast focus on operational rigor together led to a strong all-round performance. Let me begin with a quick summary of our results before an update on our strategic priorities. Third quarter revenue was at the high end of our constant currency guidance range. Revenue of $5 billion grew 3.5% sequentially, in constant currency, including approximately 150 basis points of inorganic contribution from our recently completed acquisitions. Year-over-year revenue grew by approximately 2.7% in constant currency, including approximately 200 basis points of inorganic contribution. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3% improved sequentially, driven by strong cost discipline despite investments in Belcan in the partial quarter impact from our annual minute cycle. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 7% year-over-year, our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, bringing our year-to-date EPS growth to approximately 5%. Now let me provide an update on the progress we made against our strategic priorities. First, accelerating growth. Our improving momentum was driven in the quarter by growth in our two largest segments, Health Sciences and Financial Services and contribution from our recently completed acquisitions. Health Sciences increased 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency backed by our strong differentiated offerings. Financial Services returned to year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution and partial return of discretionary spending. And we maintained our large deal momentum, signing six deals, each with a total contract value of $100 million or more. Year-to-date, we signed 19 sub deals compared to 17 during all of 2023. We are excited about the all-around sustained momentum in large deals across industries and service lines. I'm particularly pleased with the traction we are getting in digital engineering, infrastructure and cloud services. We believe in order to sustain this momentum, we must remain at the forefront of our clients' innovation agenda where today, AI is at the top of the list. Our heritage of deep engineering and strong domain expertise intimate client relationships and flexible operating model has allowed us to quickly respond to this opportunity. We have rapidly developed practical tools to help our clients accelerate AI adoption, while also applying it to ourselves as we aim to significantly accelerate our own productivity. AI is a profound shift, what I call a double engine transformation because it offers Cognizant the chance to disrupt ourselves as much as it does for our clients. Consistent with our heritage, we spotted the AI opportunity early and in mid-2023, announced plans to invest $1 billion into AI initiatives, platforms and capabilities. Let me share some examples, beginning with our platforms where our clients are co-creating with us. The foundation of our AI strategy is powered by the Cognizant data and toolkit, which we utilized to increase speed, reduce costs and improve the predictability of our clients' data modernization journeys. Today, we have over 225 project implementations supporting over 120 clients. And our Flowsource platform, which is a developer workbench that is integrating human and AI effort to improve productivity. Today, we are in various phases of testing and adoption with more than 150 clients. Using AI tooling, we are generating 150,000 lines of accepted core per month. That means an annualized basis, 2 million lines of code are accepted by our developers into the projects to deliver to our clients. It's a great example of how AI is enabling hyper productivity as we share these productivity gains with clients and lower the cost of technology deployment. Our Neuro IT Ops platform launched in late 2023 is also supporting 150 clients in various phases of testing and adoption. It enables end-to-end AI-driven automation for IT operations, bringing Ops and infrastructure in a single pane of glass. As an example, we are leveraging both our Neuro IT Ops and Flowsource platforms together with a strategic project for DIRECTV to modernize its technology infrastructure and enhance its operational capabilities. Neuro IT Ops is helping DIRECTV increase efficiency and resiliency through intelligent detection and automated IT issue resolution. And Flowsource is scaling GenAI across DIRECTV software development life cycle, promoting innovation through faster time to market, increased collaboration and greater transparency. We've recently introduced two new additions to our Neuro suite. First, our enhanced Neuro AI platform incorporates market orchestration, aims to help enterprises by simplifying problem identification, data generation and AI model creation and improving decision-making and revenue opportunities. Clients like Gilead Sciences appraised its approach, while others like Bayer have tested several foundational capabilities, now available on the platform. These enhancements aim to help our clients to navigate complex decision-making scenarios effectively. Second, Cognizant Neuro Cybersecurity offers AI-enabled enterprise security orchestration for enhanced cyber resilience risk management. This tool is designed to help improve cyber security resilience by integrating and orchestrating point cybersecurity solutions across the enterprise. We have also infused AI through our TriZetto product suite, helping improve end user productivity by at least 30%. Looking across our enterprise, we now have more than 1,000 GenAI early engagements compared to about 750 at the end of the second quarter. We are seeing significant traction in four categories of use cases starting with tech for tech or applying AI to software development cycles, which had the highest velocity, followed by customer and employee experience, content aggregation and early use cases in content generation. We see broad-based demand across industries, including fraud detection, credit risk assessment and regulatory compliance in financial services. Drug discovery, medical imaging and transcription and health care and design optimization and predictive maintenance manufacturing. Partnerships and strategic acquisitions are also important levers in our strategy to accelerate growth. First an update on our partnerships. I'm excited about our recently announced relationship with Palo Alto Networks through, which we will deliver AI-driven cybersecurity capabilities and services for enterprises across industries. We significant opportunities to leverage AI to keep with evolving cybersecurity threats and improve overall levels of security. This last week, ServiceNow announced that Cognizant will be the first system integrator to bring its new workflow data fabric to market, giving our joint customers the capability to integrate AI agents and real-time data orchestration layers that can be tightly integrated to their digital workflows. We also announced an expansion of our NVIDIA partnership, bringing together our capabilities with NVIDIA\u2019s RAPIDS, part of the NVIDIA AI software platform to enhance data modernization offering. Together, we aim to help clients transition to GPU-based infrastructure and accelerate the implementation of exciting new GenAI use cases. And earlier this week, we strengthened our partnership with Amazon Web Services by signing a strategic collaboration agreement with plans to deliver advanced technology solutions and cloud computing services focused on enhancing smart manufacturing capabilities for global enterprises across multiple industries. Turning to our strategic acquisitions. Thirdera acquired earlier this year positioned us as one of the world's largest ServiceNow partners and as a leader in AI-driven automation and enterprise workflow solutions. And our acquisition of Belcan has significantly broadened our access to the $190 billion ER&D services market, which is projected to outpace the legacy IT services market through 2026. Additionally, it has notably increased our footprint in the aerospace and defense industries with an attractive blue-chip client base. I'm happy to report that our commercial integration is progressing well. We have already seen early pipeline opportunities and identified the potential for new joint offerings in areas such as model-based systems engineering where Belcan has significant expertise. We believe these actions to accelerate growth are resonating in the market. Let me share a few additional highlights of the value we are bringing to our customers across industries. Within Financial Services, we continue to see traction from the changes in investments we have made over the last 20 months. We are bringing the breadth and depth of our capabilities to every opportunity. For example, we are supporting Citizen Bank's ongoing cloud transformation journey. We have collaborated with citizens to revamp their fraud management capabilities with a new in-the-house system. And we are helping citizens elevate their customer banking experience with a modernized system that streamlines dispute resolution. In the UK, we continued to see success winning in the public sector. During the third quarter, we expanded our relationships with the UK Valuation Office Agency of His Majesty's Revenue and Customs. This was one of a greater than $100 million contract signed in the quarter. Under the agreement, we'll provide the UK government with property valuations and advice needed to support taxation and benefits. And clients are still looking to drive productivity and underwrite future innovation. For example, we won a significant $200 million deal in the third quarter with a longstanding global technology client to transform the customer support operations using GenAI. This was a vendor consolidation opportunity where we leveraged GenAI to streamline operations, improve agent productivity and reduce costs. A differentiated AI-led approach, which included elements of outcome-based pricing allowed us to displace the incumbent. Now moving on to our next strategic priority of becoming the employer of choice in our industry. We believe our investments in talent are bearing fruit as well. We're adding more access to learning and upskilling, notably through AI in an effort to boost mobility and demonstrate that we are in an organization where our employees can grow. Our grassroots innovation initiative, Bluebolt continues to build traction with more than 300,000 ideas, of which 40,000 ideas, mostly related to AI are being presented to clients. Employee engagement scores stayed strong. Trailing 12 months voluntary attrition for tech services is at 14.6%, near multiyear lows. And we are -- we were recently named for the second straight year to Forbes list of world's best employers. Our Synapse program, which aims to provide technology training to nearly 1 million people worldwide is another great example of a deep commitment to learning. I was delighted when Fortune named us as the number seven in the world on its prestigious change the well list while recognizing the impact of Synapse. Just last week, we were named number 10 on Newsweek's list of America's most reliable companies. This recognition based on the independent survey of more than 1,700 decision-makers highlights our exceptional reliability in delivering services to our clients. We are confident that our expanded breadth of portfolio of services, strengthened by our domain capabilities, talent and partner ecosystem is more resilient and healthier than when I joined Cognizant nearly two years ago. And I believe we are in a strong position to capture the growing and developing AI opportunity for ourselves and our clients. In closing, a few weeks ago, we brought together over 200 clients to our to our Americas discovery event in Austin, Texas showcase the strength of AI platforms, capabilities and offerings. The events buzz and enthusiasm was incredible. We were excited about the early momentum of large deals with AI-powered productivity and numerous initial products. Our belief is the AI productivity way will evolve from task automation to business process to business model transformation, leading to new products and revenue streams and faster innovation cycles, a flywheel of new opportunities to tap into. I want to thank all our employees globally for their commitment to our clients and the work to strengthen our capabilities for the future. With that, I will turn the call over to Jatin, who will cover the details of the quarter and progress against our third strategic priority of modernizing operations. Jatin Dalal : Thank you, Ravi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered a solid third quarter performance with revenue at the high end of our constant currency growth guidance range and a return to organic year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in six quarters. During the quarter, we continue to focus on modernizing our operations. This helped us increase gross margin by 50 basis points sequentially, driven by improved utilization and increased adoption of automation and AI within delivery. This allowed us to deliver adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, which modestly exceeded our expectations despite headwinds from acquisition elated costs and a partial quarter impact from our annual merit cycle that became effective on August 1st. Year-to-date, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, a 40 basis point increase year-over-year. Now let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue was $5 billion, growing 3.5% sequentially in constant currency, including approximately 150 basis points of inorganic contribution from about five weeks of Belcan. Year-over-year, revenue increased 2.7% in constant currency. This included approximately 200 basis points of growth from recent acquisitions. From an industry standpoint, Health Sciences was our strongest segment, growing 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth here was broad-based across payer, provider and life sciences. On the payer and provider side, clients continue to seek our TriZetto platform solutions for modern scalable cloud solutions. In particular, our offering has seen healthy demand for its delivery of true end-to-end revenue cycle management, including clearing house services. On the Life Sciences side, growth has been supported by the ramp-up of recent large deal wins. Our Financial Services segment grew 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. This performance added to last quarter's momentum and benefited from an uptick in the discretionary demand environment and better execution. Growth was led by banking and financial services clients in North America. In Canada, we have seen strong performance across both banking and insurance customers. Products and Resources revenue grew 4.6% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by the contribution of Belcan. We have seen pockets of discretionary weakness with clients in manufacturing, logistics, aerospace and automotive industries. We are sharply focused on grid modernization, software defined vehicles and smart manufacturing. This area, we believe will drive significant opportunity in the long run. CMT declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency, primarily reflecting a continued tight discretionary spending environment across customers in both technology and telecom and media. Moving on to the details by geography, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Growth in the third quarter was led by Americas geography, which increased about 4%. This was driven by the strength in Financial Services and Health Sciences and the contribution from Belcan. Europe declined about 2% and has been impacted by software discretionary spending. However, recent wins in our largest segments helped support positive sequential growth in Europe. And we are optimistic about the growth opportunity we see in areas like UK and Ireland, Germany the Nordics. We delivered healthy growth in our Rest of the World region, which increased about 4%. Performance in this geography was driven by recent large deals, particularly within comms, media and technology and strength in financial services. Turning to bookings. Third quarter bookings were roughly flat year-over-year, driven in part by the lumpiness of large deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings were $26.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year and represented a 1.3x book-to-bill. As Ravi mentioned, we signed six deals in the quarter that each had a TCV value of more than $100 million. This included four deals in Health Sciences, one in financial services and one in CMT. I am also pleased that two of these six deals were from outside North America, one each in Europe and rest of all. We also saw TCV from smaller deals stabilized sequentially. This has led to a modest improvement in our trailing 12-month annual contract value trend from last quarter. We are seeing this reflected in our improved revenue performance this quarter despite muted TCV performance. Now moving on to margins. In the third quarter, we incurred $33 million of costs related to NextGen, which negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 70 basis points. Adjusted operating margin was 15.3%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year. Our sequential improvement was driven by gross margin, which expanded approximately 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We delivered this through operational rigor, improved utilization and corresponding lower bench costs. We are also making progress in modernizing our operations, increasingly leveraging our AI platforms in delivery to help improve fulfillment and increase productivity with fewer resources. In Q3, our GAAP tax rate was 22.7%, and adjusted tax rate was 22.2%, reflecting a benefit from the timing of discrete items. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.17 and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.25. This represented year-over-year growth of 13% and 7%, respectively. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2 billion or net cash of about $800 million. This reflects our $1.3 billion acquisition of Belcan in the third quarter, which was funded primarily through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credibility. DSO of 81 days was one day up sequentially and increased four days year-over-year driven by our business mix. Free cash flow of Q3 was $791 million, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1 billion. There is no change to our full year free cash flow conversion guidance. We continue to expect full year free cash flow to represent about 80% of the net income. This includes previously disclosed negative impact from $360 million payment made to the Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter in the first quarter. During the quarter, we returned $391 million to shareholders, including $242 million in aggregate through share repurchases and $149 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. As of September 30th, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And for the full year, we now expect to return approximately $1.2 billion. This includes approximately $100 million of share repurchases to offset the new shares issued as part of the Belcan acquisition. Turning now to our forward outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to increase 4.8% to 6.8% in constant currency. On and as reported basis, this translates to revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5.1% to 7.1%. This guidance reflects the benefit of full quarter of Belcan, partially offset by year-end seasonality, including the impact of lower builders and furloughs. For the full year, we have tightened the revenue range and maintained the midpoint. We now expect revenue to grow 1.4% to 1.9% in constant currency. On and as reported basis, this translates to revenue of $19.7 billion to $19.8 billion, representing growth of 1.6% to 2.1%. Our output includes approximately 200 basis points of inorganic contribution, unchanged from our prior assumption. As Ravi mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Belcan in late August. There are no changes to the financial projections we shared at the time of acquisition announcement in June. We anticipate the transaction will generate over $100 million in annual revenue synergies within three years and be accretive to EPS starting in full year 2026. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance. We now expect full year adjusted operating margin will be approximately 15.1%, which is the midpoint of our prior range. The fourth quarter adjusted operating margin expected to be impacted by the full quarter impact of Belcan, including integration related costs, and the impact of non-cash amortization of acquired customer intangibles. It also will include the full quarter impact from our merit cycle that was effective August 1st. We expect these headwinds will be partially offset by continued rigor in operations and the savings associated with our NextGen program. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $65 million, which compares to $55 million previously, primarily reflecting the latest cash balance assumptions. Our full year adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% is unchanged. Our guidance for shares outstanding is also unchanged at approximately $497 million. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is $4.63 to $4.67, which is up from $4.56 to $4.64 previously. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : Great. Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you, guys. So just looking at the midpoint of Q4 guidance, our math suggests organic growth will be right around 2%. So I just wanted to check and see if that's right. And if so, is that a floor we can think about for Cognizant to accelerate off of in 2025, especially since it seems like you are starting to see a turn up in discretionary spending in your largest vertical? Thanks. Ravi Kumar : Yes. So I thought the upper end of the Y-on-Y quarter four was around 2%. So you're right that in quarter four, we are starting to build an organic Y-on-Y positive movement. I mean the midpoint is going to be 1% and the upper end is going to be 2%. So it's a good tail velocity to get into 2025. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Understood. And then I wanted to come back to some of the comments around sharing savings from the AI-enabled coding efforts with your clients. What would you estimate the productivity improvement has been that you're seeing from those AI-enabled coding efforts? And what are the sort of offsets that you're seeing to avoid revenue cannibalization? Ravi Kumar : Jason, this is a complicated economic and a complicated -- the response is going to be a little, I would say, complicated as well. Let me state how this works. When we have productivity, which is non-linear and not labor oriented, and it is new, you have an opportunity to go and tell your clients, if you have time and material business, we can translate that to fixed price business and share the better fit with them. If you have noticed, I mentioned about 2 million lines of code annually accepted by our developers. So that number is going to keep going up. So our ability to share those benefits with the clients actually makes us more competitive in the market. In fact, many of my clients have actually said, when you share these benefits and the cost of deployment goes down, we can take our backlog down, that's a very positive side. I mean clients are not saying because of productivity, we'll reduce our budgets. They're actually saying we want to do more for less. So that is a very positive indicator. It also gives us an opportunity to consolidate in places where our productivity is higher than our peers. We can actually -- we can offer a consolidation and, therefore, increase revenue throughput to us. One of the examples I mentioned in my remarks is about a client where we displaced an incumbent because we actually showed up with higher productivity. Now there is a third set, where you could arguably say clients -- it will cannibalize our revenue. But those are the times you want to be creative and you go back to clients and say, \"Look, the work packet we did, we could do it for less. But you know what, if we consolidate it, we actually do more for less,\" which then means you could protect your turf, but you could still stay the productivity benefits. Then there is a fourth set, which I would actually say is time and material work, where in some ways, the productivity benefits can generate value, but you have to work with your clients to move that work to fixed price. So I would actually believe this is a very positive development. There is elasticity in tech spend. So if you can reduce the cost of deployment, clients are actually going to spend more with you. And we believe we are ahead of the curve in comparison to all our peers. And that's why we're winning more large deals and we are able to protect our tough. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, Ravi. Operator : Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, here. I want to ask on the large deal pipeline, considering you signed quite a bit here year-to-date more than last year, your confidence in being able to replenish the large deal pipeline from here, Ravi? . Ravi Kumar : Yes. So last year, we did 17 for the full year, $100 million deals, more than $100 million deals. This year, we are already at 19, more than $100 million deals. I'm very confident that we can sustain the momentum. The way to sustain this is not just look for transformation opportunities where the spend goes up, but also look for cost takeout efficiency and vendor consolidation opportunities. Similar to what I mentioned in my previous response, there's always an opportunity to consolidate using productivity. So we are excited about it. I think we have to \u2013 we are starting to see now large deals in Europe and Asia Pacific. In fact, out of the six deals we did this quarter, one of them was in Asia Pacific, one of them was in Europe, and we had similar large deal in Asia Pacific last quarter as well. So we can expand. I mean this is also concentrated in a few industries. Now we are stepping up and taking a broader view of other industry. So the expansion will come from more industries. The expansion will come from going beyond Americas, which has already started happening. And the expansion will come from also our services landscape. Two years ago, a lot of our work was related to tech services and BPO. Now we have tech services, BPO, engineering because of the Belcan acquisition and some of the acquisitions we did before. We are now a top five player in engineering services. And interestingly, we are getting quite a bit of traction on infrastructure services, which we historically not having those many large deals. So right now, all four capability sets are firing cylinders. So I'm very confident about how we can sustain the large deal momentum. Tien- Tsin Huang : No, that's great. That's good color. It actually segues nicely into my follow-up question because I know one of your objectives was to diversify. You just mentioned you're doing that geographically and across some of your practices. But healthcare is now your largest vertical looks like, which is so used to seeing BFSI being the biggest recognizant. But where are you in the journey now to expand into some of other under indexed verticals. Is that still a priority? Can we expect that to come? Or is it more work to do on what we discussed before? Ravi Kumar : No, that's a great question. I would say if you look at our revenue mix and the momentum we have, I mean, look at healthcare, we have grown 7.6% Y-o-Y. Both sequentially, we've grown and we have grown Y-on-Y. So we are very excited about the opportunities in healthcare, the differentiation we have and the lead we have in some of the areas is unmatched. So healthcare, we are very confident. Financial services, we are back on track. I mean, this is the -- this quarter -- last quarter, we did sequential growth. This quarter, we have done Y-on-Y growth and sequential growth. So again, financial services has a very different muscle. I think we have now stabilized, and we do believe that we are winning the wallet share there. We now have, I would believe, a unique opportunity in industrial and manufacturing with Belcan in the mix. And that's because they have -- we have access to blue-chip clients in aerospace. We have that capability set in engineering, which gives us a chance to go into industrial and manufacturing and automotive. It is a sector where we do believe we are now going to build a muscle to win deals, large deals. And I think we have a breadth of capability way from engineering services to tech services. The vertical comps, which if you have noticed, there has been a lower pace of spend in comps. But as that picks up, I think we have put a good team to get that moving. Where we have to make progress on is energy oil and gas, where we have a much lower presence. And that's something I'm going to work on. So the idea of the last two years, what we have essentially done is we've created a breadth of capability all the way from engineering, BPO, technology services and infrastructure services. We have created now more expansive opportunities on industries. I have work to do on international markets outside the US. But very pleased with the progress we've made so far because this expansive -- the strategy of expansion has helped us to keep the sustained momentum on our large deals. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you for the complete answer there. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jim Schneider : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the momentum in healthcare, you just talked about earlier. So maybe to follow up on the last question. Maybe as you think about your backlog of business for 2025. Obviously, you're not providing guidance now, but can you maybe tell us directionally which verticals do you think might outperform your overall corporate revenue growth in 2025? And then which ones might lag a little bit? Ravi Kumar : Yes. So Jim, as we look at the deal wins and -- the momentum that we have built, certainly financial services and healthcare will continue to lead the growth of the company. We have to build back momentum that we had all through 2023 in CMT, Comps Media and Telecom, as we get into next year. And manufacturing has been slow, but one hopes that, that should also come through. So I think that is the order, Jim, for us to look at who would lead the growth as we look at next few quarters. Jim Schneider : Thank you. And then maybe as a follow-up. It was good to see the gross margin leverage you delivered in the quarter. You mentioned part of that is utilization, but also part of it was AI, as you mentioned in the quarter. Can you maybe just help us on a go-forward basis into Q4? And then 2025 with sort of the moving pieces of gross margins, how much of those gains are sustainable? And what should we think about in terms of the mix of Belcan in Q4 and beyond in terms of where gross margins should land? Ravi Kumar : Sure, Jim. So let me start with Belcan because that's easier to get out of the way. I think Belcan will not have a material movement on the gross margin number of the company they operate at a similar sort of range. So we should be okay. There should not be any noise from that. Now from a classic gross margin standpoint, the levers are utilization, automation and productivity led by AI is another one. Pyramid is the third one and the fourth is really the pricing. So I would say these are the four most or largest rivers. The fifth is offshore mix, but offshore mix, typically tends to be driven more by the requirements of our customers in time and material business. And only in the fixed-price projects, we have more flexibility around offshore. So I would count sort of four big ones and fifth on, which can be leveraged in specific situations. So -- as we look at the performance of this year, certainly utilization has continued to inch up every quarter. And I think we still have some flex left as we enter quarter four. Automation, led by AI is a tremendous opportunity. We have executed well in 2024, and I still feel we'll continue to get additional leverage of that as we build a greater rollout capability, greater absorption capability of that within our delivery -- within our spectrum of our delivery. The Pyramid is certainly an ongoing initiative. We have had, as an organization and as an industry struggle to keep up with the reason of Pyramid, all through 2020, 2021, 2022 as the industry went through a shock of a sudden drop of demand and then sudden increase in demand I think we are getting back to that rhythm of building Pyramids. So I would say it is not a lever for 2025, but it certainly is a lever as we look at next three years and that we are putting a great internal initiative around. And finally, pricing. Pricing in the current environment is, I would say, competitive. It's not something that is adding to gross margin today, but it is a factor of the demand environment. So that's how I see it. Jim Schneider : That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Maggie Nolan from William Blair. Please go ahead. Maggie Nolan : Hi, thank you. Do you view financial services as leading in terms of how IT spend may trend across your business and end markets? Or do you view the dynamics of the financial services performance to be more vertical specific and Cognizant specific at this time? Ravi Kumar : We're very pleased with how we have gone about structurally turning around our financial services business. When I came on board, we had both company-specific issues and market-specific issues. I'd say the company-specific issues have more or less gone. They have gone at least a few quarters ago. We put a good team on board now very stable team. We now have compelling offerings, and we are working the corridors of our clients. So we are starting to see the wallet share gain for ourselves. There is uptick in spending in financial services clients, and we are probably seizing those dollars of our peers, and therefore, we are starting to see that. I am very optimistic that financial services will continue to go back to a high discretionary environment at some point in time because it's also one of the most cutting-edge innovative industries. And they all have retailed organizations where a lot of technology innovation is done in partnership with companies like ours. We always had that muscle before. I mean, we were one of the leading financial services players across the world, and it does -- I do believe that we have got that module back. So depending on how the market turns around in financial services, we will grab those opportunities. We do not have any specific company-specific challenges which we had in the past. So that gives me the confidence that we have the differentiation, the agility, the team and as the market keeps bouncing back. I mean there is a rebound of discretionary dollars in financial services. And as that continues to go up. We are in a great start to gain more wallet share. Maggie Nolan : Okay. Thank you. And then any changes that you're seeing in the sales cycle and the conversion rate, both for this quarter that you just reported? And then also your forward expectations just given that continued large deal traction, but also what appears to be the early return of some the smaller discretionary deals and demand? Ravi Kumar : Yes. The smaller discretionary deals have started to take a little momentum. So -- on the large deals, I would say the biggest change I have seen in the last few months is -- if we are able to put a proposal on the table where you can feed to the legacy, make savings, underwrite those savings for innovation. Our clients love that flywheel. So times are not saying I'm going to spend more. But try times are saying, can you do more for less. So the AI tooling is helping us do more for less. And those savings are getting translated to innovation dollars and translate it to backlog getting cleared. I think that is a new -- it's a new model which is helping us to win those deals. I mean, when we win these large deals, those dollars are not going back elsewhere, they're actually going back to technology. And we are able to put a model where we underwrite those dollars for the innovation. So that's the change. That's what clients are looking for in an industry of this kind where you can do more for less, the spend is elastic. I mean, you can -- if you do more or less the spend, you could get more done, and therefore, clients are going to get for you more. That's because the spend is elastic. You get more value, you get more projects to be done. Maggie Nolan : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Jamie Friedman : Thank you. So I wanted to ask briefly on your view of the durability of the Health Science recovery. Ravi, results speak for themselves. It's a very -- this is a clear turnaround. But we're getting a lot of questions that the end market seems to be volatile. And if you could unpack that maybe to the payer and Life Science side, but how do you see the changes in the end market, especially on the payer side potentially impacting the demand for your services? Ravi Kumar : It's a great question. There are four segments here, there is payer provider, pharma benefit and Life Sciences. Life Sciences clearly is a standout because Life Sciences clients are no longer using technology for enabling their business, they're using technology at the core. And we have some extraordinary capability of partnering with our clients for that core business. This is not enabling the business I mean enabling the business is IT systems, enabling the core as their discovery cycles, the drug discovery cycles and the ability to apply technology to support it. We have really some very good capability there, including Life Sciences manufacturing. So I think that's a sector which we'll continue to invest in technology to reduce the drug development cycle, and we think we have a good opportunity there. On payer, as you would have noticed, there's a lot of cost takeout, which is going to happen because the PMPM as I call it, the cost per member per month that is under pressure. So you have to start to think about how do payers reduce their cost and increase the value towards care. So we think technology can be that enable us to reduce cost. Just to give you an example, on TriZetto, we applied Generative AI. And we are able to take out 30% cost for case managers and end users who are processing claims. The administrative costs and payers are so high that you produce technology and you could use the power of AI to create more -- generate more value, more straight through processing. Our auto adjudication on claims has significantly gone up. I mean we could auto adjudicate claims without human intervention. So there is so much happening on the payer side on technology that it's a cost takeout opportunity rather than anything else. Cost is going to lead to transformation of payer. Provider a very distributed market, and there is consolidation happening on providers. And I think we have, again, a unique opportunity because our TriZetto platform today has a large pool of providers. In fact, we have 200 million members, and we have thousands of providers who are on our platform. We also do Clearing House, which is a combination of payer and provider because the Clearing House actually sits on the gateways between providers and payers. Pharma benefit companies, very small number and they are themselves going to transformation. So is there going to there going to be more consolidation? Is there going to be more change? Is there going to be more transformation in this sector? Yes, but they're all going to be powered by technology. So we think our unique position in healthcare, our unique edition in healthcare is going to be a huge benefit for the opportunities which come out where. So I'm excited about the transformation in that entire value chain, which is going to happen in the next few years. Jamie Friedman : Okay. Great answer. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bryan Keane : Hi. Hey, Ravi, to me, it sounds like you're using GenAI as an advantage to come in and price below some of the peers using you guys' expertise in the technology to replace some incumbents and pass on some productivity gains. Is that fair? Ravi Kumar : Yes. I know Yes. If the engagement model allows us to do that, we could share those benefits with our clients. In the past, it was labor-led the labor-led cycles are pretty much -- I mean, we have really optimized it across the industry. The new cycles are technology-led. And AI-led and automation-led productivity sharing the benefit to clients, I think, is a mainstream model which we are adapting to win these large deals where we have had sustained momentum. Bryan Keane : Yes, because the argument will be that it's a deflationary environment for the overall IT services adds more of the cost save productivity in GenAI gets passed on, the old time and materials models come under pressure and the yields are lower. The outcomes-based pricing is going to yield the outcome for the contracts. So it's got a deflationary impact. So you've got to make it up by volume is the only way you can make faster growth. Ravi Kumar : Yes. So my thesis there is almost every CIO, I have spoken about has actually said, they have a backlog, which they want to clear. And this is our opportunity to clear backlog. There are CIOs who have actually told us that, look, there is so much technical debt sitting with us. I mean there is a report which talks about $1 trillion of technical debt in US balance sheets -- American Corporation balance sheets. Almost $400 billion is actually being spent on again, another report which talks about spent on servicing the debt. And because of that, a lot of money is being spent on the run versus the bid. So this is our opportunity to readjust the run in the bid. So -- and that's what I was referring to earlier. We were able to reduce the run costs and transfer that to the bid, you can actually build more stuff. So technology spend is so elastic that -- I mean it will remain elastic because it is such a transformational tool that you could -- if you do more for less, you're actually going to get more to do because there is no -- the headroom is so high. So I actually believe that the thesis of doing more for less is only going to generate more opportunities for us. Bryan Keane : And is it roughly 20% to 40% less or how much more or less is it? Ravi Kumar : Yes, it's a hard put a number because it depends on the phase of the technology cycle. If it's pure play development, it is much higher. If it's testing, it is much higher. Equally, if you're in a fiercely competitive situation, you probably give it away to \u2013 you partially give it away to clients. There's also the maturity of the client, which kind of determines how much you can get productivity. So there is a compelling proposition to do fixed price and managed services deals. But there are always companies which have huge retained organizations, and they use companies like us to engage on a time and material or a capacity-based because they have strategically taken a call to build their own tech shop. In fact, we are actually helping some of those clients to build the tech shop. There are captives being set in India. We are actually a pioneering partner to partner with our clients to set up their captives. Another opportunity which has kind of evolved in the last one year. And again, I'm excited about it. I don't see that as cannibalization. I see that as an opportunity to stay more relevant with them. Bryan Keane : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : The last question is from Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you. I do have a follow-up question here on the forward view. If you're targeting kind of an organic exit rate of about 1% of the midpoint, and flattish bookings here when we consider the year ahead, are there puts and takes about the conversion of the multiyear larger deals versus some of the smaller deals picking up to support the near-term growth reacceleration. Just any thoughts you want to share directionally about growth considerations as we get closer to 2025? Ravi Kumar : Sure. So if you see this year, every quarter, we have been able to execute to the growth agenda that we set in the beginning of the quarter. This is first quarter, quarter three was our first quarter of organic growth in -- over the last few quarters. We are exiting with a significantly better velocity than what we had at the end 2023. So that certainly sets up well. But we will -- I think it's -- what is critical for us is really focus and execute well to quarter four, and then look at the opportunity that presents us in beginning of 2025 and then guide for 2025. So I would say little early to talk about 2025, but quite happy with the progress that we are making every quarter in -- on the trajectory. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Understood. And then when we think about the margin levers, specifically on utilization. Do you have a targeted optimal level for you as you manage the bench, so you've gotten 84%. Can you lean on that more until demand recovers? Or is that an upper bound as you think about utilization? Ravi Kumar : I do think there is a little more flat left on that, certainly, that I see, but not a lot more. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. This also concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tyler Scott : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead. Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. I joined Cognizant two years ago, drawn by its heritage and unique DNA, along with its extraordinary ability to sense, incubate, and scale new technologies for global enterprises, often ahead of peers and clients. We set out to harness these trends and reclaim our place in the winner circle. I'm pleased to report solid progress in 2024. We successfully pivoted from stabilization to growth, building momentum throughout the year. Q4 marked a high point for year-over-year revenue growth, large deal signings, and bookings. Operationally, we completed our NextGen program, delivering savings reflected in our adjusted operating margin and strengthening our ability to make strategic investments and drive profitable growth. Our 2024 results reflect the strong execution of our strategic priorities, accelerating growth, becoming an employer of choice, and modernizing operations. Our North Star remains returning to the winner circle with top-quartile revenue growth, while steadily expanding our margins over time. Let's take a moment to reflect on 2024, starting with our growth initiatives, which gained momentum through large deals, platform enhancements, new and strengthened partnerships, and strategic acquisitions. With respect to platforms, our AI labs made significant advancements with our AI capabilities and offerings in 2024. We introduced Flowsource for full stack engineering, Neuro Edge for real time AI, Neuro Cybersecurity for AI-enabled proactive defense, and Neuro AI Multi-Agent accelerator for AI agent development. We also added multi-agent orchestration capabilities to our Neuro AI platform and we debuted our AI-powered Cognizant moment to help clients reimagine client experiences. In 2024, we expanded the breadth and depth of our global alliances' ecosystem and we added two strategic acquisitions to our portfolio, Thirdera and Belcan. Thirdera made us one of ServiceNow's largest partners, and in the first quarter of 2025, ServiceNow elevated us to globally lead status, the highest level of partnership recognition within their ecosystem. Belcan significantly strengthens our opportunity in the $190 billion ER&D market. We believe our integration is on track. We recently completed Phase 1 of the integration focused on commercial integration for clients outside of aerospace and defense. And in the fourth quarter, we signed a multi-year deal valued at several $100 million with an aerospace client. Finally, one last note about our efforts to accelerate revenue. Our NPS client satisfaction scores improved to a historic high in 2024. Turning to our second strategic priority of becoming an employer of choice. Developing and strengthening our associates is key to our future. We drove AI reskilling at scale, sustained high employee engagement scores, and maintained low voluntary attrition. I'm also pleased to share we have 13,000 current employees who have returned to Cognizant. These metrics combined with our rising NPS scores are evidence of the high correlation between happy employees and happy clients. Our grassroots innovation initiative, BlueBolt, continues to generate tangible ideas for clients. Our associates doubled the number of ideas in 2024, submitting nearly 240,000 of which 47,000 were implemented by clients. Our Synapse program equipped more than 400,000 people with skills for future work opportunities, well on our way to a goal of 1 million workers. Our work in 2024 earned prestigious recognition, including Forbes World's Best Employers, Newsweek's America's Most Reliable Companies, and ranking number seven on Fortune's Change the World list. Turning to our third strategic priority, we took several steps during the year to simplify and modernize our operations. For example, completing our NextGen cost program helped drive sequential adjusted operating margin performance throughout the year, while supporting our growth investments. We optimized and diversified our infrastructure in part by directing our India expansion into smaller cities in India. You have heard me call AI a double engine of transformation because it offers Cognizant the opportunity to accelerate our own progress as much as it does for clients. We are rapidly applying AI across the organization to strengthen our operating agility, while at the same time quickly sharing our learnings with clients. We have identified more than 200 internal AI use cases, applying AI across three major dimensions : associate experience and productivity; enabling business operations; and to improve our technology and security landscape. These will remain important priorities in 2025. Now let me turn to some highlights from the quarter. We finished the year on a strong note with accelerating momentum as we delivered another quarter of improved year-over-year organic revenue growth and expanded our adjusted operating margin sequentially ahead of our expectations. Revenue was $5.1 billion, up 6.7% year-over-year in constant currency. Performance included the contribution of Belcan and improved organic growth, driven again by our two largest segments, Health Sciences and Financial Services. Organic revenue growth was fueled by recently won deals and improved discretionary spending primarily in financial services. We signed 10 large deals in Q4, up from a seven a year-ago, reflecting strong momentum across service lines and industries, including digital engineering, financial services, and cloud services. This brought our large deal total to 29 in 2024 compared to 17 in 2023. Health Sciences led with over 10% revenue growth. This included continued strength in TriZetto, our differentiated software platform that is used to process about two-thirds of US healthcare claims. As a recent example, we entered an agreement in 2024 to enhance healthcare operations for Blue Shield of California with our TriZetto Facets platform as a service solution. And our Financial Services segment delivered another quarter of year-over-year growth, supported by increased demand for cloud, data, and modernization services. Adjusted operating margin improved sequentially to 15.7%, driving full-year performance that exceeded our expectations while we continue to make investments in AI and M&A. Taking a step back, we believe our expanding Gen AI capabilities are gaining momentum in the marketplace. For example, we now have over 1,200 early Gen AI engagements compared to 1,000 at the end of the third quarter. We see demand for AI services expanding across industries as use cases proliferate. This includes productive analytics for patient outcomes, drug discovery, and virtual health assistance in healthcare, credit scoring and analysis, customer service automation and fraud detection in financial services, productive maintenance, quality control, and supply-chain optimization in manufacturing, content personalization, and targeted advertising in media, just to name a few. Another great application of our AI capabilities is Stores 360, recently launched for the retail industry with our strategic partner ServiceNow. Stores 360 aims to help retailers streamline store operations, enhance employee productivity, and improve their customer experience with integrated, automated and predictive Gen AI capabilities. We are already seeing early interest and excitement. We also signed a five-year agreement with Toyota during the quarter to infuse Gen AI across its software development cycles by leveraging hyper-automation AI and process reengineering. It is a great example of proactive solutioning, allowing us to deliver significant productivity for the customer that can be redeployed to cover new services under an extended contract tenure. And we renewed our strategic partnership with McDonald's to streamline operations and support its delivery of exceptional customer experiences. Our multi-year agreement aims to transform McDonald's legacy infrastructure into modern cloud-based systems using our Neuro IT operations and Skygrade platforms to improve system observability, reliability, and agility. Lastly, we expanded our partnership with Gilead Sciences. Our collaboration with -- will engage our expertise in machine learning and Gen AI with an agentic framework to improve productivity and generate cost savings. Our new agreement accelerates Gilead's digital transformation, allowing Gilead to focus on its core mission of discovering and delivering critical medicines. And we are also seeing traction with global capability centers or GCCs. Earlier this year, we were notified that we won a new strategic partnership with a leading insurance provider to establish the GCC in India. We will work to enhance their operational efficiency, accelerate digital transformation, and expand their global talent footprint, leveraging our deep expertise in building and scaling GCCs. This partnership reinforces our position as a trusted transformation partner and marks a significant milestone in our continued growth in the GCC space. These are just a few recent examples illustrating how our innovative solutions and strategic partnerships powered by cutting-edge technologies are delivering significant value to our clients in addition to helping accelerate our commercial momentum. As we think about AI-enabled enterprise landscapes, I'm very excited about the role Cognizant can play in reimagining businesses, reshaping operating models, co-creating new products and services, and redefining work, workforces, and the workplaces of our clients. The recent advances in democratizing foundation models are efficiently diffusing value to the front end of the AI value chain. We can play a big role for our clients in unlocking newer efficiency and innovation value levers and we think it will be a force multiplier. We believe our industry domain strength in the intersection of design, deep engineering, and operations will allow us to stay differentiated and be a front-runner as we see a proliferation of AI-led services. We see the AI-enabled opportunity playing out in three distinct vectors with the first already here. First, the most mainstream use case of AI is tech for tech for its application in software development cycles with the help of code assist platforms. We have our own developer workbench on the Flowsource platform. In the fourth quarter, we estimated that 20% of our code accepted by developers was generated by AI, allowing us to do more for less and unleash a wave of hyper-productivity. Our belief is with this level of hyper-productivity, there will be an opportunity for partners like us to help clients unlock the estimated trillions of dollars of technical debt, find viable ways to modernize legacy systems and applications, automate infrastructure and operations, and eliminate the backlog of workloads. The Vector 2 opportunity will be about modernizing the data and cloud foundation for integrating AI into enterprise landscapes. We believe this opportunity will require building last mile infrastructure related to domain-specific cognitive and reasoning frameworks, explainability and traceability, agentification, and multi-agent orchestration and platforms. It also involves ensuring that AI's use is ethical and responsible and the output is optimized for accuracy and costs. Our belief is that this process of agentification will drive significant innovation cycles, leading to new AI-enabled products and services work that is being advanced by our AI labs. And finally, Vector 3 is about untapped and newer service pools that we believe will unlocked by agentification. Our view is that, software may no longer be mainly a tool for organizing work, but can become the worker itself, capable of understanding, executing, and improving services traditionally delivered by humans. We expect the most transformative applications of AI will be those that collaborate with human teams with the potential to unlock new and previously unimaginable categories of work. We see a future where a system of agents can inject autonomous [Technical Difficulty] to our clients' expansive business operations budgets rather than their technology budgets alone. Early use case opportunities for many of our clients are to agentify horizontal business functions like sales and marketing, human resources functions, and customer service, as well as vertical functions like clinical operations, retail operations, and connected care to name a few. I will close by saying our 2024 accomplishments have strengthened Cognizant operationally and strategically by broadening our portfolio, while increasing our agility. We believe we are now transitioning from a phase of stabilization to a phase of growth. Our early investments in AI, practical tooling, thought leadership, and unique capabilities at the intersection of design, tech-led engineering, and operations gives us confidence that we have the right to win in this dynamically changing IT services market. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead and confident that our strategic focus will help us deliver improved revenue growth to get us back to the winner's circle and gradual margin expansion over time. Before I turn to Jatin to review our financials in greater depth, I would like to thank our clients and partners for their trust and our associates worldwide for their steadfast dedication and daily drive to deliver. We look forward to updating you in more detail at our March 25th Investor Day in New York. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jatin. Jatin Dalal : Thank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us. Our fourth quarter results underscore the progress we have made against our strategic priorities to improve commercial momentum and enhance operational excellence. Fourth quarter revenue of $5.1 billion grew 6.7% year-over-year in constant currency at the high end of our guidance range. Organic revenue growth was driven by Health Sciences, which grew more than 10% year-over-year, and financial services, which grew approximately 3%. Our acquisitions of Thirdera and Belcan have supported our entry into new end markets with attractive long-term growth profiles. Fourth quarter revenue included approximately 450 basis points of year-over-year growth from these acquisitions. For the full year, revenue of $19.7 billion increased 1.9% year-over-year in constant currency and included approximately 200 basis points of growth from Thirdera and Belcan. We were very pleased with our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 15.7%. This performance driven by completion of our NextGen program and our rigorous actions to strengthen operations drove full year adjusted operating margin of 15.3%. This was 20 basis points ahead of our guidance. This also represents 20 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, net of significant investments we have made to accelerate growth, such as Belcan and our AI platforms. Now let's turn to the details of the quarter. By segment, Health Sciences saw broad-based strength across payer, provider, and life sciences end markets. Clients continue to prioritize cost optimization, cloud migration, and legacy modernization projects, which are helping to more than offset the muted discretionary spending environment. Within financial services, growth was balanced with positive trends across capital markets, cards and payments, fintech, and commercial banking clients. We saw a further albeit gradual pickup in discretionary spending. In North America, we are seeing an improved pipeline of opportunities for transformation and modernization projects across both insurance and select areas of banking and financial services clients. In addition, we have continued to see healthy growth in Canada, driven by the recent new bookings. Products & Resources or P&R growth was driven by Belcan. As we noted last quarter, the segment has been pressured by cautious discretionary environment across end markets. This includes automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, and logistics, among others. We signed three large deals in this segment in the fourth quarter. Despite the near-term pressure, we are excited about the opportunities we see across P&R, where the convergence of information technology and operational technology is rapidly accelerating. Communication, media, and technology performance was consistent with last quarter as clients remain focused on cost optimization and discretionary spending budgets have been pressured. From geographic perspective, growth was led by North America, which increased more than 8% year-over-year. Health Sciences, Belcan, and banking and financial services all supported the growth. Europe grew by about 1% year-over-year. By segment, strength in Health Sciences and Financial Services were offset by softness in products and resources. And finally, rest of the world increased about 4% year-over-year. This reflected solid growth across most segments. Now turning to bookings. Fourth quarter bookings increased 11% year-over-year, driven by large deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings grew 3% year-over-year and represented a 1.4 times book-to-bill. Trends in smaller deals improved, which supported a low-to-mid-single-digit increase in our trailing 12 month annual contract value, both sequentially and year-over-year. Turning to expenses, quarter four marked the end of the NextGen program and we incurred about $49 million of costs related to the program in the quarter. Excluding the impact of these costs, adjusted operating margin was 15.7%, significantly above our expectations. Year-over-year, margin declined by 40 basis points, primarily reflecting the impact of Belcan and increased compensation costs. This was partially offset by savings from NextGen, high utilization, and a favorable currency exchange rates. We are pleased to be exiting the year with an improved cost base and more resilient operating model. Now moving to cash flow and capital allocation. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $837 million. This brought full year free cash flow to $1.8 billion or 82% of our net income. This is in line with our guidance. As a reminder, free cash flow was negatively impacted by the previously disclosed impact from a $360 million payment made to Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing dispute of a 2016 tax matter. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.3 billion. DSO of 78 days decreased by three days from third quarter and increased by one day versus the prior year. For the full year, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $300 million in the fourth quarter and we invested $1.6 billion into strategic acquisitions. Turning to our forward outlook now. Before I start, I would like to reiterate our strategy -- that our strategy is built around driving long-term EPS growth through revenue growth and modest operating margin expansion, which we believe will support enduring shareholder value creation. For the first quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to grow 5.6% to 7.1% year-over-year or 6.5% to 8% in constant currency. Sequentially, this represents a range of negative 0.5% to positive 1% growth in a constant currency basis. For the full year 2025, we expect revenue to increase 2.6% to 5.1% or 3.5% to 6% in constant currency. Details of revenue in dollars are available in our press release and supplement. We expect Belcan will contribute a little more than 250 basis points of growth in 2025. With a greater contribution in the first half of the year compared with the second half. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition of Belcan at the end of August 2024 and it contributed approximately $300 million to our 2024 revenue. For the full year, we expect adjusted operating margins will be 15.5% to 15.7%. This represents 20 basis points to 40 basis points of expansion of our strong performance in 2024. Over time, we expect our growing adoption of automation and AI to drive better productivity and higher margins. We remind you that in the first quarter, seasonality typically drives a modest sequential margin decline. We expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. Some of you may have noticed that we are no longer providing net interest income guidance. We made this change to align our guidance metrics more closely with the industry. For the full year, we expect our net interest income will decline modestly given lower cash balances exiting the year. This leads to full year 2025 earnings per share guidance of $4.90 to $5.06. This represents 3% to 7% growth compared to our 2024 adjusted EPS. This growth includes more than 2 percentage points of expected headwind from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates impacting reported revenue and other below-the-line items, including slightly higher tax rates. For the full year, we expect free cash flow will represent more than 90% of the net income. In 2025, we do not expect material changes to our capital allocation strategy. We plan to balance the return of capital to shareholders with inorganic growth investments that strengthen our capabilities and support our growth ambition. For the full year, we expect to return approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders, including about $600 million in share repurchases and the remainder towards our regular quarterly dividends. We expect a weighted average dilutive share count of about $493 million for 2025. And during the year, we plan to repay the $300 million outstanding under our credit facility. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I want to start with bookings here. So you're excited with building momentum on the larger deal front. Do you feel like you're reaching a rhythm now where you'll have more consistent quarterly bookings performance? Ravi, maybe talk about go-to-market and just a large deal edging now versus where you've been as you've gone through 2024? Ravi Kumar : Yes, thank you for that question. Yes, I mean we've got some phenomenal momentum on large deals. We did 29 of them, $100 million plus in 2024 versus 17 in 2023. So, there are multiple things which I believe are going to help us in 2025. First, we have a tail velocity of deal making. Second, we have a book-to-bill now of 1.4%. The third, I would say is the small deals are starting to come back. So we are excited about it because it has monetization in the same year. In fact, our ACV numbers, we track that internally are higher than before, which gives me, again, great confidence that it's a combination of ACV and TCV. We also do a bid versus bid inside the company and we are looking pretty good. On the deals we signed in 2024, the deals we signed in 2023, we are executing to a pretty good track. So, I would say we are now in the rhythm. We are accessing the deals well. Our win rates are significantly higher. It's a spread, in fact, over the two years, we have moved from application services to infrastructure services to now engineering services, which is a combination of the organic engineering strength we had and the stuff we got from Belcan. We also got a breadth of the industries from healthcare to -- from healthcare to financial services to products and resources to now progressively moving from Americas to other parts of the world. So, this is a great rhythm for us, good tail velocity to getting into 2025 and it is a very good spread. So, it is resilient and sustainable for the future. Bryan Bergin : Okay. That's good to hear. And then a follow-up on just the growth outlook as you built the plan here, the organic growth plan for 2025, can you comment on potentially how some of these industries unfold relative to what you saw in 2024 as it relates to healthcare versus financial solutions versus a P&R and commuter tech? Ravi Kumar : Yes. So because we have the breadth and the resilience now, I mean, our growth is going to be very broad-based and all-round. You've seen healthcare, we have done 10% Y-on-Y, which is pretty healthy on a good big base. We are having pretty all-round growth all the way from payer, provider to life sciences. On financial services, where I started last year to where I am today, we are -- we have now created a rhythm of Y-on-Y growth for subsequent quarters. And we are very, very excited about the fact that financial services, we are seeing discretionary coming back and we are actually capturing a lot of that. Now we are starting to -- with the muscle we have created on a broader capability, we are starting to see communications which -- and the technology, which is a muscle we created in the last two years is doing well. Products and resources with retail and consumer goods was otherwise doing well. And now we have strength in manufacturing with the power of the Belcan capability we built. So I'd say it's all-round comprehensive organic growth we are looking at. And I'm also excited about the fact that while Americas is actually a principal market and it is leading the way, the international markets are starting to contribute to this process. Our first-quarter guidance is pretty strong. I mean, this is one of those quarters which is normally seasonally weak, but if you see the midpoint of our guidance range, we are positive. So, it is tail velocity from quarter four cutting into quarter one, plus all the momentum we have. Bryan Bergin : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys or good afternoon, I should say. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just start on the organic growth for the year. It looks like we're targeting 1% to 3.5% organic constant currency. The midpoint of that, I guess, would be pretty consistent with how you exited 2024 on the same basis. So I'm just wondering, in terms of acceleration, it sounds like there's more discretionary spending going on and you have some bookings momentum exiting the year. So, it doesn't seem like we've built much acceleration into the guide on an underlying basis, but is that just conservatism, or are there other considerations there? Ravi Kumar : Yes. So it's the start of the year. The visibility into the second half, you kind of build it in the next few weeks. We are hoping there is continued buoyancy into the second half, so that the upper end of the range is doable. So, the way I constructed it is, there is a tail velocity to the first half of the year and that is constructed to the middle of the guidance range. And then we are hoping we continue to execute well. We continue to see the same buoyancy we're seeing now. I mean, discretionary is starting to come back. And as the visibility builds in, we do our best to outperform. If you look at the last four quarters, we got to the upper end of the guidance range in the last four quarters, including the one we just concluded. So I would say, I mean, that's how I'm seeing it. I mean there is -- when I spoke to all of you one quarter ago to where we are today, I'm more optimistic about the future. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. That's very helpful. And I know you touched on agentic AI earlier. Wondering if clients are starting to talk more about it? And what's Cognizant doing to invest to prepare for that opportunity? And then just any views on how DeepSeek could ultimately impact the IT services industry? Thank you. Ravi Kumar : Yes. So I spoke in detail in the -- just a few minutes ago. Yes, I think I put this in three vectors. The first vector is writing code. I'm a strong believer that writing code with machines amplifying humans is only going to get us to write more. We will unlock billions of dollars of legacy debt -- legacy technology debt sitting on corporate landscapes, backlogs and we are seeing that in our deals now. I mean, one of the reasons why we are winning large deals is, productivity is baked into it and the early investments we made is helping us to win because the productivity assumptions between providers is very different. I mean, we have done now 29 plus 17 deals in the last two years. A lot of that productivity we have baked in is AI-led. So we're excited about the efficiency part of this process. The second lever is how does it help our innovation and growth. I mean, our clients are starting to invest on us. We have 1,200 projects running now and a lot of heavy lift in our cloud migration, data modernization, the last-mile infrastructure, we have platforms to help our clients. That helps us to create a stickiness and helps us to accelerate the journey and helps us to make the journey of agentification predictable. In fact, we have our own agentification platform, which is an orchestration layer. If you have existing software, which has agents, this can orchestrate between the software pools. If you do not have an agentification layer, this can actually act as an agentification layer. So we think we are way ahead of most of our peers and this is a -- probably an opportunity of a lifetime. It is also unlocking new pools of addressable spend, which we didn't earlier address, which is -- things I spoke about, which is say connected care or retail operations or drug discovery. So the service pools, which we didn't capture before are now available to us. So we are now seeing opportunities, which are not just at the CIO, it's actually across the business operations of the company. So I think the addressable pool of work is going to be multi-fold to where we are -- where we were before and that gives me confidence that this is a force multiplier for companies like ours. In context to DeepSeek, it's a simple quick summary. DeepSeek has uniquely democratized a layer at the back end, which is the foundation models and it has commoditized that layer, so a lot of that money will now flow into the front end and it will accelerate the adoption of AI into enterprise landscapes. And as it does so, we will be in the middle of it heavy-lifting and helping our clients. So the DeepSeek opportunity uniquely is a moment, is an inflection point on transferring that value from the back-end to the front-end. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you, Ravi. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Surinder Thind : Thank you. Ravi, just kind of building up on the last part, if you think about the proprietary solutions that you're building within the AI landscape and all of the changing demand, can you provide a bit more color there in terms of the sustainability of those types of solutions that you're building? Or is this one of those things where, as you go to a client, you build a solution and then somebody follows you really quickly? I just wanted to better understand that the shifting model of, before it was all about services, but now we're injecting what sounds like a bit more of a software there into the solution itself, and if that's sustainable? Ravi Kumar : Thank you, Surinder. If you remember in the London Conference, I started talking about this and we've come a long way from there. The layer of software you built, I call it, fast software is practical tooling needed by our clients to either accelerate the journey or to bridge a gap or potentially to build micro industry vertical templates, which the existing software doesn't contain. I mean very similar to how enterprise software was built many years ago. How the cloudification of technology in some ways changed the role of system integrators. Now I would say, all of this is helping our clients. I'll give you one example. We have a platform called Flowsource, which is an orchestration layer on top of code assist platforms like GitHub. Now that orchestration layer is something we built practically because we figured out that as you bring code written by machines and you bring code written by humans and you bring it together, you need a worker -- a developer workbench, which will synchronize that effort and improve productivity. And will some of the existing platforms replicate that functionality over a period of time? Maybe yes. But by then, we will start to look at advanced problems to solve. Some of the problems we have today, some of the gaps we have today will remain gaps and it's the job of the system integrator to fix them, and some of them will productize. And as they get productized, we move to the next endeavor -- the next problem-solving endeavor, there is work between efficiency of the output and cost efficiency is needed for making AI enterprise grade. Some of that optimization will automatically happen with software and some of it will not. So I would say it's an evolving role of a system integrator. The heavy lift will remain. I am now venturing not just into agentifying landscapes, I'm venturing one step further, which is identifying new service pools, which we did not capture. I'll give you one example. If you take sales and marketing function, all the data sitting in software is structured data. If I actually tap into unstructured data in a sales cycle, I mean, there is data sitting in chat messages, data sitting in emails, data sitting in minutes of meetings of salespeople who are actually working on, and if you want to find the momentum of a company -- sales momentum of a company, you could identify that pool and then transfer that into value, which means that was a labor pool we didn't touch. Either people were doing it and we didn't capture it or new sets of work which people were not doing, which is unstructured data. I mean, it was not getting tapped. So I see this as an opportunity for not just technology spend of enterprises, I see this as an opportunity to go into the operations of companies and identify it and create service pools, which we can address. And we do believe we are -- our strength at that intersection of deep engineering, operations, and industry domain will help us. And this is no longer theoretical. This is real-life projects we are now implementing for our clients. And some of those examples I've already stated in my remarks. Surinder Thind : That's helpful. And then when I think about -- as I look ahead and I think about all of the large deals you signed, the ramp, the managed services wins, is that where most of the growth should come from in 2025 as we wait discretionary spend to improve on the consulting side or how should we think about the two segments and maybe how much integration is there when we think about the large deals in terms of the sharing of work between consulting and managed services with the large deal? Jatin Dalal : Yes. So I'll take that, this is -- I think the texture of the work is changing a little bit between 2024 and 2025. In 2024, we saw that it was essentially the large deals and the volumes led by large deals were driving the growth. But 2025, as we exit particularly quarter four, we have seen some improvement as I described in my opening comments, in annual contract value terms, which means we are getting some discretionary spend back and therefore the volume or the texture of growth will be slightly different for 2025 where you will see both the short-end work as well as the volumes which are being added by the large contracts or large deals. Ravi Kumar : Especially in financial services where there is more discretionary. In fact, Surinder, I just mentioned earlier that our ACV numbers have significantly jumped in quarter four, which is an indication of not just large deals, but also smaller deals coming back. Surinder Thind : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Lee : Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Tremendous to see the margin outperformance here, can you unpack what drove that, especially with softer utilization and perhaps some [indiscernible] benefit? And what incremental levers could you see into calendar 2025? Jatin Dalal : Sure. So while using numerically the utilization looks softer in quarter four, but we continue to execute very well on the ground. So this is a -- this sort of underrepresents the operational improvement on that we have been able to achieve over the last 12 months the way we run the organization. So I think that is one big driver. That is also reflected in the performance on the gross margin side. We have definitely seen a benefit on the profitability coming through our NextGen program, that is another key contributor to the performance for 2024 in general and specifically for quarter four. Ravi Kumar : So overall, our operational rigor has improved significantly in the last two years and we have some runway. I mean we have the pyramid -- continuing to sharpen the pyramid, AI-led productivity, sharing with our clients and part of it accruing to us. Our NextGen program, which we started in 2023 flew into -- it had a flow-through into 2024 and it will have a flow-through into 2025. So we are very excited about it. And the large deals for which we were, we were always budgeting if something goes wrong, but the reality is the bid versus did on large deals also contributed to the margin growth. I mean, we have really executed our large deals very well. So, we are very pleased with where we have landed on the margin and the runway we have for 2025. So -- and interestingly, we've also done M&A and we have absorbed the margin dilution plus we are investing heavily into AI. We are absorbing that as well. So I mean, the ability to contribute to margins, create an expansion, and that's going to be my desire. We've got to keep an expansive desire to improve our margins, but continue our investments and stay ahead of our peers. Jonathan Lee : Thanks for that detail there. And to support your growth in 2025, can you talk through how you're thinking about pace of hiring and perhaps geographic mix of talent base given Belcan as a new dynamic there? Jatin Dalal : Sure. So we continue to hire as we need for our growth and certainly, it's a cycle that you will see panning out in 2025 also. Probably from Q1 and onwards, you should start seeing the addition of headcount versus what you've seen in previous few quarters. Overall, we are well-placed in every geography from availability of talent from a bench standpoint as well as our capacity to hire as we need in each of the geographies. So, we feel quite good as we enter 2025 from a supply equation standpoint. Jonathan Lee : Appreciate the color, guys. Operator : Our next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. James Faucette : Thanks. I appreciate all the detail and color here today. I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up question on Belcan I think if I heard you correctly that you expect that it will contribute roughly 200 basis points in 2025. Does that include both the inorganic and the organic period after August? And I guess as part of that in your growth assumptions, are you building in any other inorganic contribution from maybe deals that haven't been announced or closed yet? Jatin Dalal : Yes, sure. So essentially, this provides for -- the 250 basis point is the number that I have mentioned in my opening comments, and that 250 basis point is essentially for the additional eight months -- approximately eight months of revenue that we will get from Belcan in 2025. We have not factored in any additional inorganic in that 250 basis points. James Faucette : That's great. Okay. So that's very clear. Thank you for that. And then I'm wondering as you're -- like I think your messaging, Ravi, has been really clear and we've seen kind of this consistent improvement where we're now to this point where it seems like discretionary is improving and that's great to hear. And on top of that, the large deals, et cetera. As we went into the end of this year and I know it's a little early still on budgeting processes to have a conclusive view. But did you see any budget flush type engagements or bookings, maybe like what you've seen in past years and what's your early temperature in terms of growth for most people's budgets? It sounds like it's pretty positive, but is that universal? Thanks, guys. Ravi Kumar : Yes. So I mean, this is totally in a way, but I also want to tell you that the mood is very business-favoring, right? I mean, people are expecting regulation to be coming down and it's a pro-business environment. The uncertainty around us is starting to settle down. There is lesser uncertainty in general across the world, which means all those dollars will actually trickle down to innovation and discretionary work. I would say financial services, we have -- I'm very pleased with where we are at financial services, which is where all the discretionary conversations are. We're very pleased with the progress we've made, how we are seizing the opportunities which are coming our way. You would have noticed one other area I spoke about, which is global capability centers. A lot of our clients are actually saying, can you help us set up the global capability centers, which is interestingly one of our biggest strengths, setting up ID shop for one of our clients, but doing it in a build-operate-transfer. So lot of all-round opportunities to play with. As the AI wave is hitting enterprises, the reality check on the data and their cloud migration is reopening that journey. I mean the heavy lift on data modernization and cloud migration is a unique opportunity for us. We are a very different company now in two years. I mean, I would say we have a heterogeneity in our landscape on services, all the way from experience application services, BPO Ops to engineering and we now have more vertical play. I mean, we aren't just a financial services healthcare company. We now have multiple verticals to play with. So I would say the -- I'm optimistic. I don't know if things will change in the second half, but I'm optimistic about the fact that where we were a year ago or where we were a quarter ago to where we are now, I feel very optimistic. James Faucette : That's great color. Appreciate that, Ravi. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much. Just to build on James' question, you mentioned the GCCs here, Ravi. Can you expand on what that means for Cognizant in general, if that is a new theme that you see emerging? And does this change the balance of trade between in-sourcing and outsourcing? Just trying to understand how to read into that and how Cognizant is going to see that. Thank you. Ravi Kumar : So you know, multiple things to -- for Cognizant to be a part of that chain. One-third of the GCCs, one-third of the worker -- one-third of the tech prof services in offshoring destinations like India is GCCs. So we have a big role to play. They are themselves directly buyers of services. So that's one. Second, a number of them who do not have access to that market because that's a different labor market. We are a sizable, formidable player in India. So it gives us an opportunity to help these companies build, operate, and transfer. In fact, last year, I signed a deal, it's in the public domain where I did build, operate, transform, and transfer. Essentially, we are building it for them, we are operating it to them, we are applying AI tooling and then we are transferring it to them. And then we underwrote all the AI tooling for the next couple of years, which means we are just going to give them -- they can draw from us. There is a third set of offering, which is the micro-services around GCC, which is, you focus on the core and offload the non-core to us and we will set up for you. I mean, there are a variety of templates on this and companies are reorganizing, I call them 2.0, and they're reorganizing their technology Ops and BPO together. I mean, you know, my universe is not technology anymore. Operations of companies are actually getting offloaded to nearshoring and offshoring destinations and that's a new addressable spend. And finally, engineering of companies. I mean, if you are a car company, you would probably outsource your HR applications and CRM applications, writing software to run the car, you are probably not going to outsource. You want to build it yourself. Building it is not easy. So we can actually give you deep engineering capacity to build your own core. So we have number of opportunities, which we have won and which we have in the pipe, and I've actually mentioned about one in my earnings, which is primarily an insurer who just signed up with us, so we are kind of excited about this opportunity. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. That's really interesting and thoughtful. Always appreciate your comments. Just have to ask you, Ravi, as you're talking to clients and you've talked about a lot of themes here, how would you characterize just overall budget and client decision-making with all this news flow that's happening? You got tariffs and immigration and tax, all this stuff, how would you characterize that? Ravi Kumar : Yes, technology is a very interesting space. When everybody is growing, you use technology to grow, and if there is uncertainty, you use technology to improve efficiency. So you can win in the turns with technology. So I've seen it in both sides. And I think as a company, we are agile to anchor on both sides. When the market is soft, you want to anchor on efficiency. When the market is taking off, you want to anchor on innovation. And I think in some ways, AI can do both. So I'm anchoring on both sides and that's why I placed this opportunity in those three vectors because I do see this as a player on both sides, which is why it is exciting. Budgets are -- I mean, you know, the visibility of budgets are much better than last year. Is it completely up and running? I don't think so. As we move into the year, we will see more, but we are in a much better spot than last year. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you so much. Always appreciate it. Ravi Kumar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is actually [indiscernible] on for Jim Schneider. My question is, how do you see the divergence in consumer behavior right now between the UK and Continental Europe? Is this being driven by geopolitical considerations or do you think it's being driven by the competition of industries of these clients such as like banking versus industrial? Thank you. Ravi Kumar : Is this specific to Europe or otherwise? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, Europe, so between the UK and Continental Europe. Ravi Kumar : Yes. So I mean, Continental Europe still has uniquely first time outsourcing opportunities, which can manifest itself into not just offshoring, but outsourcing and offshoring, and sometimes -- in fact, Continental Europe has one of the most number of GCCs going back to the old topic. So I see that opportunity in some ways a very different -- it's in a very different stage of evolution in comparison to the US and UK. And some industries are very mature and some industries are really opening it up for the first time. UK is a much more mature market. We have a big role in UK, I mean, we are strong in financial services. We also do public sector in the UK. We are pretty strong in consumer and comms. So UK is a very different market. I think it's much more ahead in terms of outsourcing, offshoring, and actually efficiency cycles. But I would say, in Continental Europe, if we make the right investments, which we are doing over the last two years, we are unlocking much more than before. Our presence is much -- our -- the proportion of business we do out of Europe and Asia-Pacific is much lower than the US in comparison to our peers. So that's an area for us to capture more and be a challenger in some of this -- some of these geographies? Jatin Dalal : I just want to add a point on UK versus Europe. I think UK has really started to show a lot of momentum in the second half of 2024 than what we saw before. The current quarter, there is a delta between UK and Europe and that's more led by a fact that one of our CMT customers renewed a contract in US versus UK, so there is some movement of revenue between geographies, but otherwise, we continue to see good momentum in UK. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the floor back over to management for any closing comments. Tyler Scott : All right. Great. Well, thank you all for joining us tonight, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Ravi Kumar : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
