Connor - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Brian Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Expedia Q1 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill : Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia, Inc.'s financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014. Pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, May 1, 2014, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, technology and content expense, exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense, and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. With that, let me turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. We're pleased with the solid first quarter performance and a good start to the year. From a geographic perspective, revenue growth was healthy across all the major regions. Outsize gross bookings growth of 29% was driven by continued strong performance at most of our major brands, in addition to the gross bookings generated through the Travelocity implementation. From a brand perspective, Brand Expedia continued to deliver strong top line performance despite tougher comps, as it continues driving innovation on its new technology platform. Hotels.com had healthy gross bookings growth and launched their new largest-ever integrated U.S. brand campaign called Captain Obvious, which is off to a good start, obviously, otherwise, I wouldn't mention it on this call. Hotels.com's loyalty program, Welcome Rewards, continues to do very well, with an increasing number of members driving a higher mix of gross bookings. Egencia and EAN, our private-label business also posted good results for the quarter. Near-term results continue to be challenging for Hotwire, but we're investing aggressively in growing our mobile channels, improving our supply and analytical capabilities, and are confident that the team is executing on the right plan that will get the business back to growth. Just a quick update on the Travelocity implementation. The rollout has been going well and the early results are encouraging. Travelocity Canada just launched this week, and the teams will continue to enhance and optimize the sites to improve conversion and add a few remaining products. Overall, the speed of this implementation and the success we've seen are strong evidence of the strength of our execution, technology and teamwork. From a product perspective, we saw healthy hotel room night growth, essentially consistent with the growth we posted in the fourth quarter, with the positive impact from Travelocity largely offset by the shift of Easter into Q2. We're pleased to see continued healthy growth in Brand Expedia's air ticket volume. The team continues to improve our cross-selling capabilities so that we can put air ticket bookers into hotel rooms and rental cars, and we believe there's a lot more potential here. We continue to build a big advertising and media business from both trivago and our Media Solutions group, which sells advertising for global OTA brands. trivago revenue was up over 80% year-on-year on a stand-alone basis, and we expect the team to continue with their aggressive global expansion efforts and heavy brand advertising. Media Solutions grew revenue 26% for the quarter and saw ongoing strength from their TravelAds product, which allows hotel partners better exposure in our marketplace. In fact, hotels that have participated have seen an improvement in room night growth of as much as 20% using this product. We're also ramping up media sales for Travelocity sites, and we believe this represents an attractive media opportunity for advertisers. Advertising and media represents a high-growth, high-margin business with low capital requirements, and we're excited about the opportunity and pleased with our progress. In terms of innovation, as we move past our focus on platform migration, we're getting into a product and technology rhythm of test and learn as part of our regular operations. And while the results would be most visible on our customer-facing front-ends, like the new Expedia.com responsive homepage, or the award-winning Hotels.com app, we're executing across all aspects of our business; from using automation to scale our marketing platforms and financial systems, to improving our connectivity and tool sets to make it easier for our hotel partners to work with us, to increasing our air and hotel search query speeds, to continuously improving our APIs for our private label and affiliate partners. All of this is dedicated to building the very best search and booking machine for our travel customers and supply partners, wherever they are, however they want to connect. We continue to see incredible opportunities in this large, global and competitive industry, and our teams are all up for the challenge. Mark? Mark D. Okerstrom: Thanks, Dara. Overall, the results for the first quarter were slightly better than we had expected for both revenue and expenses. Disciplined expense growth in cost of revenue, technology and content and general administrative expenses again allowed us to invest aggressively in selling and marketing to drive solid top line trends and deliver slight adjusted EBITDA growth in a quarter that we had originally expected to be down year-over-year. In hotel, room night growth of 24% consisted of domestic growth of 20% and international growth of 27%. Travelocity added just under 3 percentage points of room night growth, the majority of which we estimate was offset by the shift of Easter into the second quarter. And note that the Travelocity bookings were 100% U.S., and as such, had a disproportionate impact on our domestic trends. Revenue per room night was down 10% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven primarily by the same 3 factors we have been discussing now for a while : expansion of our supply portfolio, including efforts to rollout ETP; improved inventory availability and adjust margins to account for specific market conditions; growth of our loyalty programs, along with discounting and couponing; and lastly, overall geographic mix, as we continue to build scale in international markets where unit economics and margins are lower. Note that all of these efforts are specifically designed to improve our customer experience through broader selection and choice, as well as competitive prices, in order to increase the likelihood that travelers will return to our brands as loyal customers, driving unit growth, scale and efficiencies over the long term. Advertising and media revenue grew 116% in the first quarter, adding over $50 million of revenue, with trivago driving most of this growth along with the strong performance for Media Solutions. Air revenue grew 28% on ticket growth of 30%, with solid performance in both domestic and international markets. Growth in both gross bookings and air revenue was amplified this quarter, as we scaled up the Travelocity site, which accounted for 18 percentage points of ticket volume growth, again, with a disproportionate impact on our domestic trends. Excluding Travelocity, the air business grew both ticket volume and revenue at healthy rates, similar to those we posted in the fourth quarter of last year. We are pleased to deliver a quarter where expense growth was in line with our target P&L, leveraging cost of revenue and G&A, de-leverage in selling and marketing as we grow the business globally and take share in key markets, and technology and content growing in line with to slower than revenue. Note that technology and content expense did grow a bit faster in Q1 than we had seen for the prior couple of quarters. Looking forward, though we continue to keep a close eye on our overall cash spend in this category, we do expect to see an acceleration in the growth of our reported tech and content spend over the next few quarters, due primarily to lower rates of capitalization, certain technology investments for some of our growth brands, like trivago and eLong, as well as incrementally more difficult expense comps. Regarding depreciation. We expect to see dollar growth on a sequential basis, similar to what we saw in the first quarter, for the remainder of 2014. As a reminder, although we have structured the business to drive towards a targeted P&L shape on an annualized basis, we don't expect to see it every single quarter. Before moving to our full year financial expectations, I'd like to cover a couple of quick housekeeping items. This quarter, we revised our presentation of operating expenses in the Discussion of Results section of our earnings release. Specifically, we have presented the expense line items there, excluding both stock-based compensation and now, depreciation. In this manner, the discussion of expenses is consistent with our adjusted EBITDA profitability metric. We included depreciation expense in total as a separate item with the applicable explanation of growth. Note that the GAAP income statement was not affected. Secondly, you'll note that our effective tax rates on both the GAAP and adjusted basis, were a bit anomalous this quarter. The GAAP effective rate was driven primarily by certain foreign losses for which we do not recognize a tax benefit, along with a revaluation of some deferred tax balances. The effective rate on adjusted net income was on the high side, also due to the foreign losses. The year-over-year comparison for both measures was also impacted by some items in the first quarter of 2013, which we described last year. Though difficult to predict with precision, we are expecting our full year effective tax rate to be around 25%. Turning to our financial expectations for 2014. We continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 13% to 16%, with the vast majority of the dollar growth generated in the back half of the year. With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : A couple of questions. I don't know if you called it out, but maybe you could call out the Travelocity contribution to total bookings. I'm sorry if I missed that. And then, Dara, bigger-picture question. Several years of technology investment in the platform, where are you with that now? Do you think you've closed the gap versus peers? And then as far as like managing during the quarter, do you have better visibility now and are able to make adjustments more on the fly, so maybe less surprises? Pretty consistent results this quarter with last quarter. Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. So on Travelocity, we didn't disclose the gross bookings number. It did add just under 3 percentage points of global room night growth and about 18 percentage points of air ticket growth. This should help you approximate the number. And I would just remind you that Travelocity has a heavier air bookings mix, so there would be a disproportionate impact on gross bookings relative to revenue. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. And in terms of our investment on our technology platform, listen, we're very happy about where we are as far as the technology capabilities go across the board as a company. And I think the -- as I mentioned in my remarks, the parts of that you see are the website themselves, but our investment has gone much deeper into the core platforms. And I think at this point, we're at a place where we can continue to roll out new feature sets, whether they're customer-facing feature sets, supplier-facing feature sets, et cetera, while at the same time, continuing to make the kinds of platform investments, reinvest in our platforms so that we don't get into the situation that, frankly, we got into 5 years ago. I think we're at a very, very good place here. There are parts of the business that are still really aggressively investing in technology. trivago is increasing their investment; Egencia, as it integrates; and VIA continues to pretty aggressively invest in technology and appropriately. But I think we've seen the results that we've seen on our consumer sites. We're encouraged. And our execution is getting consistently better across the board. And I do think that you're seeing it on the results. The results have improved. And as you've said, the results in general have gotten more predictable. We're sometimes subject to the vagaries of the market, if there are significant changes in the competitive environment, et cetera, but we do feel like we have a lot more tools at our disposal. And the business is feeling much more like business as usual, which as far as I'm concerned, is great. And I'd say our confidence as a team in our ability to execute is much higher now than it was 2, 3 years ago. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Yes. So just on your room night growth, Dara, can you give us some color on room night growth for different geographies between EMEA and Asia Pac? And then, as for the total properties you had, it seems like you added 30,000 properties in the last quarter alone. Is that sort of a run rate you expect to see for some quarters moving forward? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. As long as the room night growth goes, the room night growth is pretty consistent, as it was last quarter, in that the U.S. room night growth was quite solid. It was aided by Travelocity coming into the mix. EMEA room night growth continued to be healthy, and then Asia Pacific room night growth was at very strong levels, along with Latin America as well. So we aren't seeing any significant changes one way or the other as far as the room night volumes and where they're coming from. It's pretty predictable. And we're really happy to see the strength that we're seeing domestically and internationally as well. As far as our total number of properties that we've added, a fair amount of those properties were coming in from eLong. We're integrating the eLong inventory into our mainline inventory, and we'll continue to do so. We are, in general, losing hotels on the GDS side and adding them onto our ETP and other platforms. We do expect that, this year, the contribution that we are getting from new hotels added to the system is going to increase significantly on a year-on-year basis. So I think you will see that as the year goes by. We think that new hotel adds are going to be a bigger part of our business going forward and we like where we started, although it's early. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : And in terms of the dynamics of hotels sort of dropping on the GDS side and being added more on the ETP side, are these the same properties or -- can you speak to that a little bit? Dara Khosrowshahi : I think it depends. We often see our big GDS producers, we're able to go to them and offer up much stronger merchandising capabilities, packaging capabilities, et cetera. So very often, we're moving them over from the GDS over to our systems. And it's a big win for the hotels, and obviously, it's a big win for us. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just a follow-up on the room night growth, so the 24% average and 20% domestic. Can you give us a little color on -- as you mentioned the 3-point benefit from Travelocity and the 3-point headwind from Easter, but we also are comping the slowdown from Hotwire from the beginning of last year. So can you just give us a little more color on maybe, at the brand level, what's outperforming or underperforming the prior trend line, given the easy comp with Hotwire? Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. So I mean, the 2 biggest factors were the ones we called out, Travelocity and Easter offsetting themselves. From a brand perspective, I would say, quarter-to-quarter, pretty consistent trends this quarter to what we saw last quarter across the portfolio. I think that the Hotwire comp will get incrementally easier as we move from Q1 into Q2. It really won't get purely clean until Q3. So that's a bit of a headwind for us. And then the other headwind to keep in mind, although trends continue to be very strong at Brand Expedia, is that we were ramping up on the new packages platform last year in Q1 and into Q2. And so that's an incremental headwind as well. But I think the important message is that, broadly speaking, trends were consistent this quarter to what we saw in the prior quarter across the portfolio. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And then as we look into 2Q, you got the swing factor of Easter now benefiting the second quarter, that could be 3 to 6 points potentially, and the easy comp with Hotwire. So you could see a much more meaningful re-acceleration, potentially, north of 30% in the second quarter. Is that the right way to think about it? Mark D. Okerstrom: Well, I would say that Hotwire is actually a headwind for us until Q3. It was -- performance was, I would say, on the way down in Q1 and continued into Q2. And actually, some of the bigger challenges we saw were in fact in Q2. And so, whether that and Easter completely offset each other or not, I'm not sure. But we wouldn't expect a net good guy in Q2. And then I would just remind you what we said or what I said on the last call with respect to Q2, which was that we -- despite the fact that the Street's expectations were higher than ours, we broadly hit our bottom line objectives for Q2, with the exception of some incremental investments in eLong and trivago that we made, and we called out $13 million on a year-on-year basis. And those are brands that we continue to invest in. So we don't expect that Q2 is a particularly easy comp for us on the bottom line. I think we do have some easier volume comps, just given the TripAdvisor transition that started really dropping in, in the second quarter. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And if I can squeeze one more, I'm sorry. But the TripAdvisor spend in the quarter, I don't think you guys broke it out. What was that? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, we're not going to break out our spend by channel broadly. You can see that, in general, our sales and marketing spend overall was up significantly on a year-on-year basis. And our strategy has been to invest aggressively in variable channels. So you can come to your own conclusions as it relates to TripAdvisor, but we're not going to be breaking out channels specifically. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes. And Ross, just specifically on the disclosure this quarter. Effective into the future, TripAdvisor is no longer going to be treated as a related party for disclosure -- financial disclosure purposes. And this is a result of the ownership and governance changes that we saw in late 2012 and into 2013. Operator : Your next question's from the line of Tom White with Macquarie. Thomas Cauthorn White - Macquarie Research : My question's on Travelocity. And I realize it's still a little bit early since the implementation. But relative to their marketing activity, I'm just wondering, do you guys have any visibility there? And are you in touch with them about kind of their marketing strategies or objectives or timing? Would their willingness to spend marketing dollars in a given period impact your appetite to do so in any way? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, we are -- Travelocity is very much an independent entity as it relates to their marketing spend. So we have very little visibility into what their marketing strategy is. Obviously, we talk to them. But it is a real third-party relationship. And so we see the effects of their marketing spend after the fact. After they spend it, we'll see more visitors, we'll see more transactions or not. So really, we do have some limited visibility there. So far, the implementation has been going well. So far, we hear from Travelocity that they're happy. And obviously, our technology platform and our supply base seems to be converting quite well for them. But other than that, we have quite limited visibility into what's going on down there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan. Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I just want to ask you a couple of things. First just on ETP, if you could update us on the progress there. And I may have missed it, but if you could talk more about the upticks that those properties are seeing in terms of room nights and how you're managing the incremental demand there, just as hotels want to increasingly shift over? And then second question, just regarding Room 77 with Google, if you could comment on how you're thinking about that partnership from a competitive perspective, but then also, perhaps, of course, as you're -- seem to be an investor in Room 77 as well. Mark D. Okerstrom: Great. Thanks, Doug. So for ETP, it's really transitioned into business as usual for us, and it's really transitioned into our primary form of contracting new hotels and our primary form of relationships. 2013 was a year where we transitioned a whole lot of new relationships over to -- our existing relationships over to the ETP contract. And I think we ended the year with about 45,000 hotels live. And really, in 2014, it's just about, as new contracts come up for renewal, putting hotels on those contracts and as we sign up new hotels, putting them on the ETP platform, I would say, broadly speaking, for our consumers and for our suppliers, ETP has been and we expect will continue to be a huge success. It's really removed a lot of the barriers that we historically had with going with the pure merchant model, barriers that consumers felt, barriers that suppliers felt, and really have opened up our platform. Specifically, just in terms of some of the impacts that ETP has driven to our business, really best shown through the growth in our non-eLong agency room nights. Last quarter, we disclosed that the room night mix for the non-eLong Hotel Collect or agency room nights was over 15% and growing at rates over 100% year-on-year. And we actually saw metrics broadly consistent with that in the first quarter this year as well. Dara Khosrowshahi : And as far as our investment in Room 77, the investment that we did have in Room 77 was pretty small in the grand scheme of things, so we don't have any particular insights as to that acquisition and discussions that happened behind the scenes and/or Google's strategy. If you level up a bit, Google has been investing in their hotel search experience for some period of time in the HPA product, as well as their other mobile products. So their investment in Room 77 and the team there certainly makes sense from a thematic standpoint. And that Room 77 had, we feel, built a nice travel search product, a nice hotel search product. So it fits along that theme, as far as Google's investments go. As long as we are able to work in partnership with Google and are able to competitively bid for their travel search volume, not just hotel search volume, we think we can continue to build our partnership with Google. And at least so far, we don't see any reason why we won't be able to be competitive in the very large Google marketplace on a go-forward basis. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I guess, now that you've had some time with the partnership with Travelocity, I want to understand if there was any update on the way in which you think sort of the run rate benefit to EBITDA might be, once you have sort of a full 12 months of full implementation, not this year, but further beyond. Second question on the guidance, with EBITDA coming in slightly better than the way you had talked about Q1, curious about maintaining the guidance at the 13% to 16% and what we might be looking for on the investment side for the rest of the year. Mark D. Okerstrom: Thanks, Eric. So with respect to Travelocity, we're not giving an update. It's really just too early for us, for one. Secondly is, on the last call, I went through a number of the unknowns, if you will, around where that lands. Implementation, I think, is better known now than, certainly, it was the time of our last call. But what they spend on sales and marketing and the ultimate conversion of the websites are still an unknown for us. So we have no updates. Our full year guidance does include our expectations for Travelocity. Our next year guidance will include our expectations for Travelocity. And with the exception of some incremental disclosures that we'll make, similar to what we did this quarter around the impact on some operating metrics to help the investment community and our shareholders understand what's happening with the core business, we don't plan to give specific disclosures around Travelocity, similar to the way we treat our own owned main brands. With respect to our full year guidance, listen, all I'd say is that Q1 is a relatively tiny quarter for us, particularly on an adjusted EBITDA and net income level. And so a slight beat versus our expectations results in a de minimus change to our full year outlook. And certainly, we, at this point, are not -- have not changed our outlook on the business and our guidance remains the same. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Two questions, please. I want to follow up on Doug's question. And maybe there was some commentary or controversy intraquarter about Google and hotel product finder. Can you just comment a little bit more on whether you think there's any of the things that Google is doing, like hotel product finder is changing the economics -- unit economics for online travel agencies? And then secondly, can you talk big picture about alternative accommodations? And I know you've got a -- you've been working on an implementation with Home Away. Your thoughts on -- if they've changed at all, on how interesting that market could be to Expedia over the next 3 to 5 years? Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks. As far as Google's hotel product finder, listen, they are -- Google is constantly testing and learning, and they are making all kinds of changes now. Obviously, because of the market share that they have, any changes that they make can have significant downstream effects on partners of theirs, such as ourselves. I'd say the greatest worry that we have with Google in general is not specific to hotel product finder, but it's in general, with the amount of space that they give to other third-party sites, such as ourselves, both on paid and unpaid basis, relative to the amount of space that they give internally. And in markets where they're dominant, which are many markets, this can be a real issue for any one -- any website that really wants to have any kind of share on the Web. That said, we have a partnership with them. We build our partnership with them. They are -- and as they make changes, we adjust. And because of the status of our technology, et cetera, we're able to adjust that faster. So this quarter, we haven't seen anything material that changes our trends overall that we haven't talked to you about previously. As far as alternative accommodations go, we're early in the partnership with Home Away. We're very hopeful in the partnership with Home Away. And right now, we're working collaboratively to optimize the pilot going forward. There's some technology work that they have to do and we have to do in order to essentially connect more of their hotels into our system. Right now, there's a minority of their hotels that -- not hotels, properties that are bookable that we can book through Expedia. And the work that's being done, both by their teams and our teams, is to essentially wire up more of their properties. As we wire up more of those properties, I think we'll have a better sense as to how big alternative accommodations can be. But at this point, we're optimistic. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division : So Mark, I just want to follow up. I think you said one quarter -- first quarter results are better than you all had expected, both on revenue and expenses. And on the revenue side, I was just curious, was the better-than-expected due to Travelocity, or just a better overall travel environment? And then a quick follow-up. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes, I would just say broadly across the board, we saw strength in the business. I think Travelocity is, as you probably gathered from our remarks, pretty tough for us to forecast. So that was a bit of it. But broadly, the business has performed a little bit better than our expectations. Brand Expedia we knew was comping over -- starting to lap over the launch of the package product, and that continued to grow at healthy rates, notwithstanding the tougher comp. So it was broadly felt. With respect to the overall travel environment, it's hard for us to perceive the overall macro trends, just given the fact that we operate in a segment of the market which is growing faster than the overall market, and we think that we're taking share in that segment. But broadly, from what we see and read, which is similar to what you can get access to, the travel market remains pretty healthy : healthy in the U.S.; Europe continues to be, I would say stable to improving; APAC and Latin America are mixed bag. But broadly, we'd say it's a healthy travel environment. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I guess, Ron, putting it the other way. When you look at last year, we had some pretty difficult headwinds with Hotels.com and Hotwire. There were negative surprises that we had to scramble to recover from. And I think in the second half of the year, we recovered from them pretty effectively. And so far, this quarter has been a pretty boring quarter as far as surprises go, which we're quite happy about. And if the trends continue on a go-forward basis, I think we're set up for a pretty good year. I think that we're going to see lots of competition on the brand marketing side, especially for the summer booking season. So we're certainly prepared for that. But so far, so good. But it's just 1 quarter and we have a long year ahead of us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Following up on, I guess, the Home Away. Are you seeing any pushback from either hotels and/or regulators regarding that business? And secondly, you put out, or at least Expedia put out a survey for what's expected at Memorial Day, air up 5%. I was just wondering if you could also give us what you expect European rooms to be up and what you expect rental car prices to be up in U.S. and Europe. And related, what -- are you seeing any changes in rental car availability in the U.S. in -- for the second quarter? Dara Khosrowshahi : Absolutely. So as far as Home Away goes, we haven't seen any pushback from our hotel partners or regulators. I know that there's been a significant amount of controversy around Airbnb and regulators there. I think Home Away has been in business for a much longer time. And from at least what I'm aware of and what we're aware of, has their regulatory marks right on target and isn't seeing any significant push one way or the other. So for now, we're quite happy with the partnership and we hope to build that partnership. We think that complementing our hotel inventory with a vacation rental inventory is only going to be good for consumers. And that's really our goal, is when a consumer searches for Orlando, to give them the most complete set of listings possible. And we think Home Away adds to that and adds to the consumer experience. As far as our -- the surveys, et cetera, those surveys are largely consumer-oriented in order to get kind of consumers looking and booking for travel. As it relates to earnings and financial performances, we typically don't make those predictions. So the general prediction or general observation that I would make is that the travel business, on a global basis, there are ups and downs, obviously. Locally, the travel business has recovered nicely. Most of the airlines that are reporting, the hoteliers that are reporting, the car rental companies that are reporting, are doing well, and we are doing well with them in partnership with them. As far as car goes, in general, we're seeing our car trends improve on a year-on-year basis, kind of Q1 was better than Q4. And we are seeing the suppliers try to up prices a little bit on the car side and with some success. And in general, we're seeing pretty good trends on the car side, at least as it relates to our brand scope. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : When you say pretty good, it means good demand, lots of availability? Dara Khosrowshahi : I'd say good demand, good availability, good transaction trends. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Andrew D. Connor - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : This is Andrew Connor on for Mike. Dara, I know you guys have had a lot of success with mobile. Your rankings in the App Store are very good. Are you guys able to give like a mobile bookings penetration number? And then I had just a quick follow-up. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. In general, as far as our mobile penetration goes, for the brands who are active in mobile, we have in excess of 20% of our transactions on mobile. Hotwire is actually trending up very, very significantly, over 30%. So I'd say the penetration numbers and the trend numbers in mobile are good across the board and are improving across the board. We're very, very happy with the quality of our apps. We continue to drive app downloads aggressively. And we're interested in driving our mobile app business, as well as our mobile Web business, on a global basis. And so far, mobile has been a very nice tailwind for us. Andrew D. Connor - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : And have you guys seen the behavior sort of shift toward longer lead times? Dara Khosrowshahi : At this point, mobile still continues to be largely a last-minute type of activity -- not all last-minute, but last-minute is a very significant part of our mobile activity, continues to be. Tablet looks a lot like the PC. So tablet is certainly not last-minute, but the handset continues to be fairly last-minute focused. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with SIG. Brian Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I've got 2 questions. First one, Dara, I know in the past, you've talked about Hotwire stabilizing this year. It sounds like there's still a little bit of work to do in Hotwire. Can you just give us an update on how to think about Hotwire for the year? And when you say stable, do you mean flat or is there still more work to do to kind of keep that booking or revenue trajectory from declining this year? Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes, Brian, I'll take that one. Hotwire essentially experienced, through Q1 and through Q2 of last year, what we would call a reset. It was a reset towards the new reality of the car industry that's more consolidated, new competitive reality with a large competitor introducing a comparable product. Since that reset, if you will, the business has stabilized and they are working towards implementing the strategy that we think is very sound. And you can see it with some of the mobile numbers that Dara shared with you. But it still faces difficult year-on-year comps until Q3. So it was down in -- it was down last quarter. It was down year-on-year this quarter. We would expect to see something similar, but easing in the second quarter. And then things will start to look a little bit better on Q3 and Q4. And on a full year basis, what we've said is we're not counting on Hotwire to contribute to our EBITDA growth story. Brian Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Got it. And then the one other one I had is any help on how much of the sales and marketing growth came from the Travelocity WebShare payment? Mark D. Okerstrom: We haven't disclosed that. But the bulk of the sales and marketing growth continues to come from our core businesses, plus trivago. trivago, again, you've seen and we've disclosed on an inorganic basis, they added about 800 basis points to our sales and marketing growth. So that was a big driver. Travelocity was a factor, but then our core businesses, Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, on their new technology platforms, are spending aggressively, really funded by the discipline we've got around our overall cost base. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just a follow-up on Travelocity. You mentioned that it contributed 3% to room night. Given that's the first quarter, how fully ramped is that? I know you're just rolling out in Canada now. Should we expect that contribution to be similar next quarter? Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes, the hotel path was live for the majority of the first quarter. We implemented that through the end of the fourth quarter. There was some optimization in the first quarter. That's going to continue, actually, throughout the year. So it is hard for me to -- yes, it's hard for me to know for sure whether that's a good proxy. I would call your attention, though, to the fact that in a ramping business, we do see a disproportionate impact on gross bookings than we do on the revenue or stayed room nights, which is the room nights we report. And therefore, the 3%, possibly, could be on the lower side, again, to the extent we're able to have [ph] those stays, and they will happen over the course of subsequent quarters. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Great. And then on advertising expense, you talked about competition in brand advertising. Can you give us any more color on how you're thinking about advertising expense growth for the rest of the year? Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as our advertising expense growth, I think what you will see is pretty similar to what you really saw last year and the last couple of quarters. From a timing perspective in Q1, typically, we spend up very aggressively and some of the revenue comes in Q2. And this year, it will be, call it, augmented by Easter and the timing of Easter. But in general, all of our brands are aggressively marketing in the variable channels. We're growing our brand marketing as well. The variable channels, in general, are less efficient than the other direct channels. So we do expect to continue to see sales and marketing growth higher than revenue, especially with trivago being part of the family. All that sales and marketing activity, we think, is net profitable overall. And we have also talked about the financial model, where we use the leverage of our fixed costs, et cetera, to be able to deliver profit growth, even as we're aggressively investing in sales and marketing. So that formula continues, at least for the first quarter of the year. And hopefully, it's something that we can deliver for you for the foreseeable future. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Alan Pickerill for closing remarks. Alan Pickerill : Okay, yes. Thanks, everybody, for your interest in Expedia and for joining us on the call today. A replay will be up on the IR site shortly. Dara, any closing remarks? Dara Khosrowshahi : No, just thanks, everyone, for joining. And thank you to the Expedia Inc. employees for a good start to the year, and we've got lots of work ahead of us, but looking forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Expedia Q1 2014 Earnings Call. Thank you very much for your participation. And at this time, you may now disconnect.",

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And at this time, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill : Thanks, Lori. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Expedia, Inc.'s financial results conference call for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014. Pleased to be joined on our call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 31, 2014, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense, and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. With that, let me turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. Q2 was an excellent quarter for our company. We drove top line trends above our expectations, and through disciplined control of our fixed costs, saw a good majority of that outperformance drop to the bottom line. While Easter timing helped and soft top line comps flattered our results year-on-year, I couldn't be more pleased with how the teams are executing and about the strong results that we're seeing as a result. From a brand perspective, we saw strong performance pretty much across the board. Brand Expedia and Hotels.com continued to perform very well. The Travelocity implementation went smoothly, and that business is performing better than we had expected, amplifying both top line and bottom line growth rates. trivago continued with heavy investment in selling and marketing, driving ongoing revenue strength, as that brand continues its global expansion. Egencia continues to drive for share gains with its disruptive approach and superior customer value proposition. We have seen some additional downside from Hotwire, and the team continues to work hard to put their new strategy into action and to get the business positioned again for future growth. From a product perspective, our strong hotel room night growth benefited from the continued ramping of the Travelocity business and the tailwind from Easter shifting into the second quarter this year. In addition, acquisition of new hotel supply continued at a faster pace with our global hotel count, including eLong's inventory in China, up almost 50% year-on-year. We set aggressive targets for revenue from newly acquired hotels this year, and the team is delivering against those plans. We also have a very positive story around the car rental business on Brand Expedia this quarter. We shifted the complete car path to the new platform and saw very strong, nearly immediate improvements in conversion of volume trends. The team will continue to test and learn on the car platform to drive additional improvements, and we're optimistic about the potential. We believe this is another strong proof point of the technology advantages gained through investments that we've made over the past years. In addition, we recently completed the acquisition of the Auto Escape Group, which is made up of 2 European car rental brands, Auto Escape and Car del Mar. This business will join our CarRentals.com team, and we expect the acquisition to help our efforts to drive growth in our global car rental business. From a geo perspective, we saw solid growth in all of our major regions. International bookings growth of 21% and international revenue growth of 30% reflect good near-term results against the backdrop of an excellent long-term opportunity. And in early July, we announced the agreement to acquire Wotif, a leading online travel agency in Australia. This deal fits squarely into our stated objectives of driving international growth and aggressively growing our hotel business. According to Euromonitor estimates, the Australian retail travel market is roughly $32 billion in annual travel bookings -- gross bookings, while the overall hotel market in Australia is around 15% -- $15 billion per year, with about 36% estimated to be online. So the market itself is quite attractive, not to mention the opportunity for inbound and outbound travel in the region. Now regarding Wotif specifically, since it's a public company, you can see a lot of details about their history and recent trends in their public filings. But our deal is currently under regulatory review and Wotif still needs shareholder approval of the transaction. So while we can say that we're looking forward to welcoming Wotif to the Expedia family, we're limited in what we can share about any specific future plans. We expect the deal to close in the fourth quarter of this year, and we should be able to share more at a later date. Again, thanks to the team for all the hard work so far this year. We're seeing a very competitive summer booking season as we move through Q3, and we're not resting on our Q2 laurels. We know that we have a ton of work ahead of us, but we feel good about our ability to deliver as we enter the second half of the year. With that, let me turn the call to Mark for some brief comments on the financials, and then we'll open it up for Q&A. Mark D. Okerstrom: Thanks, Dara. Financial results for the second quarter were quite a bit better than we had expected. Over the past couple of years, we worked very hard to position the business to have strong discipline in our fixed costs to fund aggressive investments in selling and marketing. In this structure, revenue outperformance tends to have strong flow-through to profitability, and that's exactly what we saw this quarter. In hotel, the revenue growth of 23% year-over-year was driven primarily by room night growth of 28%. Domestic room night growth was 24%, and international growth was 31%, both about 4 percentage points faster than in Q1. Travelocity added just over 4 percentage points to global room night growth versus just under 3 percentage points in the first quarter, and we estimate that Easter provided a tailwind of around 150 basis points. Aided by 2 percentage points of growth in average daily rates this quarter, revenue per room night was down 4% year-over-year. Notably, this quarter, the revenue per room night decline was driven primarily by inventory expansion efforts and the impact of our loyalty programs and discounting, with no real impact from the international mix component that we've been noting for a while. We believe that global size and scale drive real competitive advantages in online travel. And given the size of the global opportunity ahead of us, we'll be happy to continue to trade unit economics for greater volume over the long term. Q2 is our first completely clean comp on the trivago acquisition. In this quarter, we posted growth in advertising and media revenue of 54% on continued strength for trivago and our Media Solutions group. And on a gross basis, including intercompany revenue, trivago grew revenue robustly at similar rates to what we've seen since we made the acquisition. trivago continues to grow in importance as a traffic acquisition channel for travel advertisers across the globe. Importantly, our own online travel brands are finding trivago to be an excellent source of leads and are happy to participate in the significant clip volume growth that trivago is generating. Note that as trivago gets larger and as we lap the aggressive push into the U.S. in the back half of 2013, we do expect to see deceleration in the rate of top line growth for trivago in the back half of this year. Air revenue grew 22% on ticket growth of 28%. Both gross bookings and revenue continued to be helped this quarter from the Travelocity book of business, which represented 18 percentage points of total ticket volume growth. On the expense side, we saw solid leverage this quarter in cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses, with each growing at rates nicely lower than revenue. As expected, we did see a sequential increase in the pace of growth of our technology and content expense, and we expect to see that accelerating trend continue as we move through the rest of the year. Overall, these expense trends were right in line with our target P&L and gave us ample room for selling and marketing investments, which grew just a bit faster than revenue in the quarter. The net result was an expansion in our Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin, which, although a nice result, is not something we're solving for on a recurring basis. From a capital allocation perspective, we repurchased 3 million shares since our last earnings call, bringing our year-to-date total to 5 million shares for $362 million or approximately $72 per share. We're also happy to announce today a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share, representing an increase of 20%. Turning to our financial expectations for 2014. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 16% to 19%. With the benefit of the strong Q2 outperformance, we've decided to make some additional discrete investments in the back half of the year, pushing down the pedal a bit on selling and marketing and adding staff to our supply organization to drive an accelerated pace of hotel supply acquisition. With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : It really seems like fundamentals are inflecting up. And I assume a lot of that is due to just improved execution at the company. But, Dara, would you call out any other broader trends, factors, increasing impact of mobile changes in consumer patterns, behaviors or supplier shifts, something else other than better execution, which is boosting these results? Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Mark. One is that the travel [Audio Gap] is a healthy category to be in. Travel spend, in general, is growing nicely faster than GDP. And then we've got the online tailwind behind us. And then we've been growing pretty aggressively internationally, as you know. So you kind of have 3 tailwinds behind you : you're in a good category, more is going online and mobile is accelerating. And for us, international remains a great opportunity that's very, very underpenetrated. As far as the particulars of our execution, I'd point out a couple of things -- and I would say that, listen, Mark, this is an execution ground game. And you have teams here executing quite well. A couple of things that I'd point out is one is Hotels.com is really coming on strong for us. That team is executing very well. The Captain Obvious campaign in the U.S. is doing well. The website is converting at a higher rate than it has been in the past, and that's the result of good work on the product and technology side. And I think one area that we don't talk to a lot is that the Welcome Rewards program, which is the simplest program out there, you buy 10 rooms, you get 1 free, is really building up a core of consumers who are loyal to the Hotels.com brand. And display behavior, repeat behavior, that's pretty exceptional as far as how often they repeat and what channels they repeat through. So you have -- now, as you're increasing that supply base, the initial investments in Welcome Rewards is negative. But then the repeat rate turns it positive over a period of time. And Welcome Rewards is really starting to scale, which I think is helping us out. Brand Expedia, I think, continues to execute well. It's been a consistent story. And I think one area that we're seeing with Brand Expedia, you see the air volumes are now positive. But we are now able to -- increasingly able to upsell our customers into multiple transactions, buying more than one item at a time, which is particularly profitable for Brand Expedia because we've got to sell a consumer once. And your revenue per consumer, as a result, goes higher. And you only have a single marketing cost against that. So I think that's the second factor. And then a third factor for us is hotel supply. We have -- we spent the last couple of years getting our systems into shape, getting our processes into shape, getting the ETP machine up and we stepped on the gas as far as hotel acquisition. And we're seeing greater revenue, significantly greater revenue from new hotel acquisition this year than we did last year. I'd add to that a couple of macro factors, which is Easter and then Travelocity being a part of the family. So when you put all those factors together, you get a pretty good result, and it's a result that we're quite happy with. Operator : It's from Justin Post at Merrill Lynch. A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : In your prepared remarks, you mentioned a lot about competitive dynamics, and we know marketing spend is up in the industry. Can you tell us how you're able to maybe offset that competition? Are you improving your ROI on your spend or moving up the search ranking results and maybe better placement on mobile? Talk a little bit about that. And then also on the competitive front, TripAdvisor with their insta-book, I don't think you're directly participating. But your thoughts around that, and do you see that maybe as a competitive headwind? Dara Khosrowshahi : Well, I think the competitive dynamic that we've seen in the business has been pretty consistent over the last year or 2, especially -- and I think it ratcheted up, especially with Booking.com and TripAdvisor spending dollars offline, where they hadn't in the past. So you're in a situation where there are more voices competing for the consumer attention. And you just have to execute better than you have in the past. And we've invested pretty aggressively in technology, product, et cetera. And I think it's those investments that are helping us compete in this marketplace. In general, we are seeing the price of reaching the online consumer, in particular, increasing on a year-on-year basis. Prices, in general, higher. We're able to offset some of that with the conversion improvements, et cetera, and leveraging the fixed cost base of the business. But in the online channels, we see things getting more expensive, not less expensive. The teams are consistently looking for pockets of demand that we don't have a lot of competition in. And sometimes you find those pockets and you invest in those pockets. We're also quite interested in some of the newer social channels, Facebook, Twitter, et cetera, to see whether we can drive volume at reasonable prices. And I'd say we've had some limited success there, chiefly because those areas haven't scaled. But we're very, very interested in scaling them. As far as Trip instant book, that's a product that's been out there for a couple of quarters now. We're not participating in the product. It's not a channel that is of interest to us. I don't see that changing. And at this point, we don't really see any effect on our business, as you can tell by the room night growth, et cetera. Operator : And we'll go to Ron Josey at JMP Securities. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division : Just a real quick question on hotel growth. And clearly, things are going very well, Dara, with what you are saying. But I wanted to ask about the progress in cross-selling I guess, Travelocity's business. Maybe that's more air-centric to hotels. I think that was something that was an opportunity that you all mentioned prior. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think we're pleased with both the hotel performance and the package performance for Travelocity. We're not -- we don't control the marketing spend there. But in general, hotel and package performance have been quite good. I'd say, overall Travelocity performance is pretty good, and we're pleased with the results. Operator : And we'll go to Mike Olson at Piper Jaffray. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Some of the other players in the online travel ecosystem are getting more aggressive in peripheral areas beyond travel bookings, obviously like restaurant, event and attraction bookings. What are just your general thoughts about the opportunities in those peripheral markets, your potential participation there? Dara Khosrowshahi : Well, I think that the travel market, in general, is a pretty big, broad market. And there's plenty of product to offer and market to our consumers. In particular, if you look at Expedia, Expedia is really the only global multiproduct, broad online travel agency out there left, right? The only one that's really trying to build a global presence. It is a challenge to build a global presence across a number of product : air, package, hotel, car, destination, services, et cetera. And we believe that we're just getting started. We're investing in it very, very aggressively. And so we think we've got a pretty broad remit already. And at this point, we're not looking to broaden it further. We want to get much, much better at what we do, and we think that we've got a long way to go there. And really, that's what we're focused on. Operator : And we'll go to Eric Sheridan at UBS. Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Maybe about the implied guidance for the back part of the year and the comment around marketing dollars and sales force investments. I want to know if we can get any more granularity about what those dollars might be used to invest in, and then sort of how we should be looking for payoff on those investments as we exit '14 and move into '15. Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. Well, I think we've put ourselves in the position over the course of the last number of years that by and large, the investment cycle in, call it, the platform, the websites, et cetera, the rollout of the Expedia Traveler Preference program, largely, that big investment cycle is behind us. And that's in steady-state now. And what we're focused on now is really driving more volume over the platform. And we do that by driving more aggressive sales and marketing on the consumer side; and on the supply side, by signing up more hotels and really trying to drive as much volume into those new hotels as we can. So the investments that we're going to be making are really to those ends, reaching new pockets of consumers, screaming a little bit louder to get their attention; and then on the supply side, signing up new hotels, really, around the world. If you look at our total hotel count of just over 300,000 and compare that with the number of hotels listed on TripAdvisor or trivago, which is 700,000 or 800,000, there's just tons of room left for us. And so we're going to be putting those dollars to work to continue to penetrate into both the consumer side and the supply side of the platform. The payoff for those, I think, is a little bit more predictable and a little bit more short term than certainly large replatforming efforts. But it's not all in year, it does build a long-term asset. Some of it flows through in period. But also, a big portion of it will flow through to future years, 2015 and beyond. Operator : And that is from Michael Millman at Millman Research. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Could you talk a little bit more about ETP, in particular the signings you're getting? Are those typically new client hotels? Or are they existing? And is there a difference in terms of choosing where they came from, agency or merchant, between the new and existing? And also, on the rental cars, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about -- you indicated that [indiscernible] integrated, how that's actually working out, if indeed you're seeing some of the suppliers want to get more involved in understanding your platform. And then what the availability of cars has been for Hotwire and what the pricing looks like in the second quarter. And to what extent all the recalls have affected the industry. Sorry, for this long -- this message. Dara Khosrowshahi : No problem, Michael. Thanks for the question. As far as ETP and sign-ups that we're getting, I'd say, in general, because we have a very significant, call it, base of hotels out there, the majority of the ETP sign-ups, so to speak, are hotels that are already in the fold. I think those hotels, they see a couple of things, which is higher conversion from consumers when they're given choice. And often, average length of stay can increase because consumers don't necessarily have to pay upfront. So hotels that are looking for more share within our marketplace, existing partners, usually our market managers go out there. They pitch them ETP. And it's a pretty good pitch, and the hotels that have been signing up have been quite happy about that performance. So that's been route one as far as extending ETP, and it's -- and it continues to be a higher and higher percentage of our volume. It has also allowed us to be much, much more flexible when we go out there and sign up new hotels. There are some hotels who may want to work on an agency-only basis, who aren't looking for a bunch of promotion, who aren't looking for long-stay package bookings. And we can offer them a simple agency product there that's nicely integrated into our systems, and it's all one platform versus multiple platforms. And there are some hotels in Asia, for example, or Latin America who might prefer the merchant, a merchant model. And again, we can offer those hotels a merchant model and offer them the ability to get carriage on Expedia, on Hotels.com, et cetera. So ETP has really given us a lot of flexibility. And the market managers are using that great tool to go out there and sign hotels, and we're seeing it as far as revenue from new hotels really improving significantly on a year-on-year basis. As far as the rental cars goes, the -- we're quite happy with the rental car trends. Our days -- car days that we are now marketing, and transactions have accelerated pretty consistently. So Q2 was better than Q1 and Q1 was better than last year. And in general, pricing is pretty solid. Our revenue per day is up on a year-on-year basis at modest amounts, but it is up. One area of pressure that we have seen is that as it relates to Hotwire, a lower percentage of car rental bookings are opaque this year than last year. As demand has improved, the percentage of opaque sales has gone down a little bit, and that has proved to be a bit of a challenge for the car business inside of Hotwire. But overall when we look at rental cars, we like what we see on the Brand Expedia side. And then within car rentals and the Auto Escape Group, et cetera, we think we have a ton of potential and we've got a growth business ahead of us. Operator : It's from Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs. Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I caught the ticket number that you gave in terms of the impact of Travelocity, but any sense that you can give us on the impact on room night growth would be helpful. And then you've talked about sort of the way that you're viewing the instant-booking product at TripAdvisor. At the same time, Tingo, which is participating in that product, is leveraging your network. Is that something that gives you some leverage to that product? Do you see that as something that gives you leverage to the success in instant bookings should they have it? Or does that also sort of fall into your view of it not necessarily being something that you're looking to participate in from a network side of things either? Mark D. Okerstrom: Right. Thanks, Heath. So Travelocity contributed about 400 basis points of global room night growth this quarter. That's compared to about 300 basis points roughly last quarter. And then I'll turn it over to Dara to answer the Tingo question. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. As far as Tingo goes, listen, they're one of many, many suppliers who hook into our EAN inventory. EAN powers literally thousands of websites. And we believe fundamentally in an open marketplace. We make our inventory available to lots of players. It's profitable for us. So those players don't have as many margin dollars to invest into marketing as, let's say, Brand Expedia or Hotels.com does. And in general, as long as those players aren't doing things that are unacceptable to us or unacceptable to, for example, our supply partners, or illegal, we make the inventory available to our EAN partners, and then the EAN partners make whatever decisions that they want with their marketing dollars. So -- and our philosophy has been open marketplace, make it open to competitors. We -- and I think that we will continue to in that manner. But as it relates to our brands, Expedia, Hotels.com, et cetera, we don't see those brands participating in TripAdvisor, we -- in TripAdvisor instant book. We just don't see the value there, the strategic value. And so at this point, I wouldn't expect to see those brands show up within that product. Operator : And we'll go to Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Two things. Mark, first, you talked about having most of the investment cycle behind you at this point. So just as we look out a little bit -- and I know, of course, you're not really talking about '15 here. I mean, is it just reasonable to think that we'll continue to see leverage in the business? Is there anything that could derail you from that investment perspective? And then the second question, just on trivago. Can you give us some more color there just on how effectively the brands are using trivago and how you think about the efficiencies that you're getting there relative to other sources of marketing? Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. So with respect to the investment cycle being behind us, we're really running the business towards the target P&L that we laid out at the time of the TripAdvisor spinoff. And the formula is essentially for us to continue to have discipline in fixed and overhead costs. And as a group, have R&D, G&A, cost of sale leveraging nicely. And there'll be different bumps between the categories. But broadly, those will be growing slower than revenue. And then really, pushing for, really, the next marginal dollar on revenue based upon pushing sales and marketing as much as we can. So overall, P&L expansion is not something that we're solving for. We're solving for bottom line growth. And to get there, we do expect to be leveraging our fixed costs, and that's certainly our intention. So with respect to trivago, listen, it's been really good for our brands. trivago itself is a very fast growth business, as we've shared with you. And it's also aggressively pushing into markets in parts of the world where either we're strong right now and are looking for channels of growth or parts of the world where they're very strong and we're underpenetrated. And both Hotels.com and Expedia, as well as some of our smaller brands like Venere, have found just being -- working closer with trivago incredibly helpful. It's enabled them to just piggyback the channel growth that trivago has seen. For example, in the U.S., as trivago has grown pretty nicely and aggressively in this market, we've been able to grow in that channel across all of our brands pretty nicely. And then just in being closer to the trivago team and helping hone our own skills in being a good third-party bidder in that marketplace, it's enabled us to take share in markets where trivago is already mature. And perhaps, we're less strong, places like Europe, for example. So it's been a really good acquisition or at least investment for us. It's a welcome addition to the family. And I think all of our brands are quite happy to have them as part of the team. Operator : And we'll go to Ross Sandler at Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just 2 quick questions. Mark, first one on the guidance and then one on the international room night growth. So given the strong 2Q performance, I think the midpoint of the updated guidance assumes that EBITDA growth will slow down a little bit in the back half to below the 16% level. Is that just conservatism? You mentioned some planned investments. So can you give us a little more color there? Or is it potentially some seasonal aspects of Travelocity that may have kind of moved it first half, second half? And then on the international room night growth, this is very solid, 31%. Can you just talk about how the growth looked in Europe versus APAC? And what do you expect there, given the supply additions that you mentioned earlier as we look out a couple years? Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. Yes, so there's a few factors that are impacting our guidance and our outlook for the second half. And really, just for context, I think the first half of the year, in total, when you look at our first half of 2013 and you add in the addition of Travelocity, I would call it an easier comp than the back half of the year. So as we move into the second half, we are facing tougher comps. The business started to perform much more solidly in the back half of 2013, both in the top line but then also it's a difficult comp for us on the bottom line, too. Because as you can imagine, we weren't overly joyed with our performance last year. And our performance compensation adjusts nicely, given the outperformance so far this year. If that continues, it should go the other way. So it puts some pressure on our comps. The investments also are incremental. So again, those are things that will not, in their entirety, have in-year payoff. And then as Dara mentioned, we did have some disappointment or some downside in Hotwire. And so we're not expecting anything extraordinary from them in the back part of the year, too. So that does put a little bit more pressure on the growth. With respect to international room night growth, I would say that with the exception of pockets, Europe and Asia were broadly consistent with trends that we have seen for a fairly, fairly long time now. Europe growing nicely. APAC, given our mix into China and South Korea and some of these other higher-growth markets for us, growing a little bit faster. There was some disruption in the quarter, continues to be disruption in markets like Malaysia, given what's going on in that country, as well as Thailand. But broadly, I would say, consistent trends with what we've seen historically. And we don't see any immediate reason, absent changes in the geopolitical climate, to expect anything different in the future. But it is difficult to predict. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : If I could ask one quick follow-up to the first one. So if we take the back half run rate, stripping out any contribution from Wotif, is that the more reasonable way to think about how this is going to look going forward? Like, is Travelocity contribution going to grow in 2015, do you think? Or is it too early to tell? Mark D. Okerstrom: It's too early for us to start talking about 2015. I think that we generally produce a minority of our adjusted EBITDA in the full year in the first part of the year. So we still got a long road ahead of us in 2014. So we're not ready to talk about 2015 yet. Operator : And we'll go to Manish Hemrajani at Oppenheimer. Manish Hemrajani - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Can you talk about mobile here a bit? What was mobile share of total bookings? And any color you can provide regionally where you're seeing better traction with mobile? And also, how do conversion rates on mobile compare with the desktop? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as mobile share bookings, it continues to be in excess of 20% and it continues to grow much, much faster than desktop. And this is true -- on a worldwide basis, really, it's grown quite fast in the U.S. Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, pretty consistently there. I'd say in general, we have excellent traction, where -- especially on downloads on iOS devices. And we are building up our download base in geos where you have Android dominating as an operating system. And I think one of the muscles that we have to work out and flex is, is how to drive Android downloads, in general, at scale effectively. I'd say, we're very, very good on the iOS side. I think we can get better at Android. But the teams are working quite well there. China, of course, mobile and mobile downloads are growing incredibly fast and we think will continue to grow. We've got over 150 million downloads now across the EI family. We're also -- we also believe that we can improve on mobile web. The app world is one -- is a great one in which you can get loyal customers who come back to you with a nice frequency and can come back to you direct. But we think mobile web -- we see lots of consumers turning to mobile web. And we are continuing to optimize our sites to be more effective on mobile web. And in general, I think that our mobile web optimization has only just begun. We are at the beginning-to-middle stages of that. And I think we can expect a lot of improvements on a go-forward basis. In general, conversion rates on mobile tend to trail conversion rates on desktop, if you look at the same booking window, and we've -- and as a result of that, we think that there's plenty of improvement there. Length of stay, obviously, for mobile, is much, much lower than desktop. So a mobile click, so to speak, in general is worth less to us than a desktop click. But we're very -- we're working very, very hard to build conversion and to increase our ability to pay for those mobile clicks on a global basis. Operator : And we'll go to Kevin Kopelman at Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So you called out the Welcome Rewards loyalty program. Is that a situation where you saw performance hitting an inflection point this quarter? Or is it more just a continuation of what you had already been seeing? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. It's really a continuation of what we have been seeing. Welcome Rewards has been a very significant investment in really marketing dollars that Hotels.com has been making. They took it international. I think it was a little over 2 years ago. And so the member base as of, I'd say, 2 years ago really started accelerating. It continues to grow. And in general, if you look at the Hotels.com business, the growth that we see from repeat customers and Welcome Rewards customers is quite impressive. And those customers tend to be, as I said, quite loyal and they tend to come through much more direct channels. So it's a great battery that's being charged up and it's getting to be of significant scale within the Hotels.com business at this point. Operator : It's from Brian Fitzgerald at Jefferies. Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Maybe 2 quick follow-ups. One on the -- on ETP mix, what percent of it is Hotel Collect room nights stayed, as it stabilizes, or does agency continue to grow higher? And then the second follow-up is on Travelocity. Now that the rollout is complete, you've mentioned before, you're going to fine-tune it and you also have new products. Wondering if we could get a little bit more color on where the focus is there between new products and fine-tuning? Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. So with respect to ETP agency, hotel room nights continue to grow at rates significantly faster than merchant. We're continuing to see the trend in terms of upward mix, as you might expect, in agency as a percentage of our total bookings. So broadly similar trends, as we've seen in prior quarters. And again, we're very happy with the results of that program so far and continue to be pretty excited about how it's performing and what it means for our business. With respect to Travelocity, listen, I think we're still a bit a ways from tuning it perfectly. That said, we have been very happy with the performance so far. We think that the Travelocity marketing team, from what we can tell, has done a really nice job adjusting to the new platform and getting their bidding algorithms and models built up in a nice form. But I don't think we're quite done yet. And I think it'll be several quarters before we get to sort of the full year optimized rate. Operator : And we'll go to Brian Nowak at SIG. Brian Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I have 2. The first one is to go back to Travelocity. It sounds like it's going out better than expected. Could you talk to how user conversion is trending compared to the old Travelocity platform? And how are you thinking about Travelocity EBITDA contribution under the new higher guidance? And then the second one on trivago. Could you help us on trivago kind of post-intercompany EBITDA contribution either for the quarter or year-to-date? And then for the back half, how do you guys think about kind of managing investing for more top line growth versus letting the incremental margin advertising dollars flow through? Dara Khosrowshahi : Just starting on Travelocity. We don't have access to perfect data as far as user conversion at Travelocity goes. So we've got access to our own data. We don't have access to historical Travelocity data. But we believe that conversion, especially on the hotel and package path, is up year-on-year and up significantly. But we don't have perfect data on that. Mark, do you want to talk about the other questions? Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. So with respect to EBITDA contribution, we're not providing an update on the guidance we've given previously. I would just say that the ramp-up has gone better than we expected in terms of the replatforming effort. And I think the Travelocity marketing team has done a great job ramping up their side of the equation. And I think that's been in excess of our expectations as well. So it's -- we're not going to give a full year number. But I would say the first half of this year has been ahead of our expectations, really as a result of things ramping up to, call it, full potential at a steeper curve than we had anticipated. With respect to trivago, just a couple of things that I would say. We continue to invest behind what is an exceptionally well-executing company with a very talented management team that has a pretty consistent formula. And we've got expectations for them that we will have at least some adjusted EBITDA growth this year. But we're really investing for the top line. And really, the shape of the year is as we've said previously, which is pretty steep sales and marketing investments in the first part of the year. And then we see that starting to pay back in the back half of the year. As I did say in my prepared remarks, though, the back part of this year, we do start to lap over their ramp-up in the U.S. last year. And so we should see a bit of slowdown in the top line. But we're pretty happy with what we're seeing and continue to see great signs from that business. With respect to our investments, listen, we set objectives for ourselves in terms of what bottom line performance we expect on an overall basis, what bottom line performance we expect from each of our different business units. We're very happy to have outperformance and we're very happy to have outperformance, a portion of which we do end up dropping to the bottom line. That said, we've been pretty consistent that we are a player that's looking out on the long term. And so we're always balancing the short term with the medium to long term. And when we see opportunities to invest dollars with real, material payback, it may shift money from 1 year to another or 1 quarter to another. Generally, as long as we're hitting our objectives on the bottom line that we've set for ourselves and set for our brands, those are investments that we look pretty closely at. And I think 2014 is one of those years where we see some of those investments. We've looked at them pretty closely. And we feel pretty comfortable in the payback, but it does mean that we would drop less to the bottom line than we might otherwise, had we just been running this thing for quarters or for an annualized year. Operator : And we'll go to Naved Khan at Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Just a quick clarification on the guidance and how the acquisition of the Auto Escape Group is impacting that? And then I have a follow-up on Hotwire. Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. So there should not be a meaningful impact from the acquisition of Auto Escape, positive or negative, in this year. So next question? Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Yes. Just -- so Dara, on Hotwire, I think you mentioned that you saw some additional weakness. Can you just talk about it a little bit more and give us some more color on it? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think the most significant factor for Hotwire, we believe, is -- one is the competitive environment, where Priceline has introduced Express Deals, which is essentially a copy of the Hotwire product. And obviously, they're executing well. They're advertising aggressively, as they have in the past. The second factor is really the travel cycle. If you look at the travel cycle, this is a -- we started the call saying how the -- how travel, in general, is performing well. And in upwards travel cycles, you have opaque channels typically underperforming retail channels. And as a result, the kinds of pricing and the kinds of discounts that an opaque channel is able to deliver consumers in a less strong environment becomes challenged in a strong environment. The discounts are lower. The prices in general tend to be higher. And you've got a group of customers who's quite price sensitive. So one of the moves that Hotwire has made is to bring down pricing within the Hotwire system. So that this year versus last year, Hotwire is making less revenue per transaction because Hotwire is still trying to deliver very, very significant value to its customers. It's a right call to make long term. But short term, because you're making less revenue per transaction, without a real offset, it provides some revenue challenges and profit challenges. So as Hotwire has been reducing margins, we've been seeing some challenges with the P&L. But the team there is adjusting quickly. They are -- we talked about a pivot -- an aggressive pivot to mobile. They've got a new iOS app, which looks great. And they're also working on driving better supply and also better website conversion in order to offset some of the margin challenges and the pricing challenges that they've seen. So we're absolutely optimistic that the team can turn it around, but we're not assuming anything heroic [ph] for the balance of the year because we know that these margin challenges are going to continue at least through 2014. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : So as far as the guidance goes, does it assume further weakness or further weakening or sort of continued performance at current levels? Dara Khosrowshahi : I think it assumes that current trends don't change. And in general, current trends are a bit challenged for Hotwire. Even though the team is doing all the right stuff, at this point, we're not assuming that current trends change significantly. Operator : It's from Dean Prissman at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Dean Prissman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Dara, you indicated you're seeing the cost to reach the consumer online up on a year-over-year basis. Can you comment on the degree to what you're seeing this both in North America and Europe? And then are the Expedia and Hotels.com rents fully represented as advertisers on trivago. Or said another way, to what degree do you see an opportunity to increase their representation and thus offset your marketing spend? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as the cost to reach online consumers, I'd say geo, in general, it's up fairly broadly. The FX in Europe was a tailwind, both for revenue and marketing cost, to some extent. APAC kind of went the other way. But in general, this is something that we're seeing on a global basis. And we continue to obviously execute through it, but we don't expect it to change, at least for the balance of 2014. As far as our brand's participation in trivago, on a year-on-year basis, trivago is the fastest-growing, I'd say, significant customer acquisition channel for our brands. So whenever our folks talk about it, they talk about it with a smile on their face. And we've been able to grow our participation in trivago at efficiencies that are quite good. And the quality of the traffic is quite good, in that whenever we look at any channel, we look at -- a channel may get a customer to book immediately. So trivago -- if we get a click from trivago, that customer could click in that session or that customer might be shopping and they might come 2 days later or 5 days later or 10 days later. And trivago will get some kind of credit for that as well. When we look at the pattern of the trivago transactions, it's a very high-quality pattern. Those consumers, they're real shoppers. They're very much engaged. And they are booking and booking quickly, which makes it a very high-quality click. So whenever you've got a marketing channel that's big, that's growing quickly and is driving high-quality clicks, it's a marketing channel that you pay attention to, and it's one that you invest into. And I'd say, so far, so good for us. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes. Dean, the only other thing I would add to that is we still have a significant opportunity in trivago, just with respect to the hotel acquisition focus that we have. If you look at our total hotel count versus the number of hotels that are advertised on trivago, there are a significant number of, call it, auctions that are happening in trivago that we simply just don't have a horse in the race for. So as we build out our hotel inventory, which is something that we mentioned we are doing on a much more aggressive basis, it will provide an opportunity for us to participate more broadly in the trivago channel and gain share versus where we are right now. Operator : And gentlemen, I have no further questions. At this time, I'll turn the program back over to you for any additional or concluding remarks. Alan Pickerill : Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. The webcast replay will be up on the IR site shortly. Dara, any closing comments? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. Just a thank you to the team EI for a really, really strong quarter. Mark and I get to talk about it, but it's the team who's actually doing the work. So we appreciate it. And as far as our investors go, we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom: Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference. I'd again like to thank everyone for joining us.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill : Thanks, Tina. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Expedia Inc.'s financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2014. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, October 30, 2014 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense, exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. The third quarter was another good one for Expedia, in what is turning out to be a very good year. Gross bookings growth of 29% and revenue growth of 22% continue the healthy top line trends that we've seen throughout 2014. Strong fixed cost discipline allowed us to invest aggressively in selling and marketing, while continuing to grow the bottom line, with adjusted EBITDA up 20% and adjusted earnings per share up 35% year-on-year. As a group, our core OTA transactional businesses continued to perform well on a global basis, with Brand Expedia and Hotels.com delivering strong top and bottom line growth, augmented by our Travelocity marketing agreement. We continue to invest aggressively in expanding our trivago brand worldwide and are very encouraged with the scale and growth that we're seeing in the U.S., Canada, Australia and certain Asia Pacific markets, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. trivago growth also helps our core OTA growth. While TripAdvisor is a our largest metasearch partner overall, trivago continues to gain share and deliver more clicks to Brand Expedia than TripAdvisor did in the third quarter. As such, we anticipate continued investment in share gains for trivago for the balance of the year. The market in China continues to be very dynamic and fiercely competitive, with a number of players making significant and increasing investments. This has led to challenges and competitive headwinds for eLong, which has been aggressively competing and generally taking share over the past number of years. As such, the plan is to increase investments there, which we expect to lead to increased losses for eLong beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2015. We intend to build a big business in what is expected to become the largest travel market in the world and we believe our investments there will lead to substantial value creation for our shareholders over the long term. Meanwhile, Egencia is in full execution mode, scaling nicely, signing new business at an unprecedented pace, investing in innovation and moving VIA clients on to its online platform. What we're seeing environmentally is a healthy overall travel market, along with ongoing competitive intensity worldwide and shared generally accruing to the bigger global players, who can compete aggressively across the marketing channels, attract new travelers and deliver in a way that creates a significant base of loyal customers. We're seeing strong growth in variable channels, where the cost to acquire customers continues to increase. We've also increased spend on brand advertising across our brands in a space that's quite competitive, with key players pushing hard to get their brand message heard by travelers around the globe. These dynamics put pressure on our overall marketing efficiencies, but we feel good about our ability to continue to profitably gain share on a global basis through best-in-class consumer experiences and ever broadening travel supply. In terms of our overall hotel business, we continued to see healthy trends of room night and revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to ramp up hiring in our hotel supply organization and are seeing excellent results in terms of the revenue contribution from newly added hotels, up nearly threefold year-over-year. From a technology perspective, work is ongoing to improve supplier-facing tools, so that we can increase engagement with hotels and at the same time, improve their self-service capabilities. We believe that combining a bigger team with better technology should help us grow our total business over the long term. Overall, 2014 is shaping up to be a good year for Expedia. We've made a lot of progress in the last few years, but competition is not sitting still and we know that there's a lot of work ahead of us. We have a good strategy in some very clear focus areas that we think will continue to drive growth and create value over time. These include focusing on our core technology and conversion improvements; continuing to build out our global hotel supply and making the right investments to do so; leaning in on marketing to drive traffic and downloads; investing in key, long-term growth market, such as China; building a big media and advertising business; and lastly, employing smart, capitalized allocation that includes opportunistic M&A and share repurchases to augment organic growth. Each of these factors adds up incrementally to a strong business that we believe can deliver balanced and sustainable long-term growth, through a constantly improving search and booking experience for travelers, both leisure and corporate, all over the world. With that, I'll hand it to Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom: Thanks, Dara. Hotel revenue growth of 21% year-over-year was driven primarily by room night growth of 24%. Domestic room night growth was also 24%, consistent with the rate of growth posted in Q2, while international growth decelerated to 24%. The deceleration of international room night growth is explained entirely by trends in China and excluding eLong, international room night growth was essentially consistent quarter-to-quarter. Travelocity again added about 4 percentage points of growth to global room nights. Aided by almost 5 percentage points of growth in average daily rates this quarter, revenue per room night was down 2% year-over-year. The gap between ADR growth and the revenue per room night decline remained pretty consistent with the second quarter. Decreases in our room night unit economics continue to be driven primarily by inventory expansion efforts and the impact of our loyalty programs and discounting. Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, has become quite large and has delivered just about $450 million of net revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 29%, net of intercompany amounts. On a stand-alone basis, trivago grew revenue a healthy 50% year-over-year. Air revenue grew 21% on ticket growth of 30% and a decline in revenue per ticket of 7%. Air gross bookings and air revenue were helped again this quarter by Travelocity, which represented 18 percentage points of the total ticket volume growth. Revenue per ticket was down after the renewal of certain airline deals. And we expect this trend to continue in Q4 and into 2015. We also saw nice contributions from our car and insurance products. On the expense side, we saw solids leverage this quarter in cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses, with each growing at rates nicely lower than revenue. Cost of revenue benefited from increased automation and continued scale of our global customer operations and support platform, as well as favorable trends in merchant credit card fees, as more of our hotel business moves to agency and on reduced levels of fraud and charge-backs year-over-year. The pace of growth of our technology and content expense was consistent with that of the second quarter and a bit lower than we expected. In the fourth quarter, we do expect a faster rate of growth. Selling and marketing expenses grew faster than revenue, as we compete aggressively on a global basis and as we ramp up our supply teams to accelerate hotel acquisition. For expenses overall, I would also remind you that we have a difficult comp this year for incentive compensation in both Q3 and Q4. The net result was a healthy 20% growth in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Briefly, you'll notice that our effective tax rate was lower this quarter, driven primarily by the release of tax reserves after the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain federal tax years. We continued to expect an effective tax rate of around 25% in future quarters. From a capital allocation perspective, we repurchased 1.5 million shares since our last earnings call, bringing our total year-to-date to 6.5 million shares for $492 million or approximately $75.30 per share. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow totaled $1 billion, which has allowed us to return substantial capital to our shareholders while also allocating capital for global growth. This is a key strength of the company and one we intend to continue to take advantage of. Turning to our financial expectations for 2014. We continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 16% to 19%. Our year-to-date performance has been quite strong and we plan to invest into the strength in the fourth quarter. Our core OTA transactional businesses and Egencia continued to perform well and our expectations for their Q4 performance have not changed dramatically. For eLong and trivago, given the investments we've described, we now expect their combined adjusted EBITDA contribution to be down by roughly $15 million to $20 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter, a more significant investment than we had contemplated on our second quarter call. Given the huge opportunity in front of us, the dynamic and highly competitive nature of the industry and the clear long-term benefits of size and global scale, we believe that we are effectively balancing the delivery of near-term profits against the strategic objective of investing in the business to fuel long-term growth. Our current expectations assume no change in foreign exchange rates, which at current levels, represent a headwind for adjusted EBITDA growth in Q4, relative to our prior guidance. To be clear, our guidance does not include any financial impact from the pending acquisition of Wotif. We will build those factors in after the transaction closes and expect to include the impact from Wotif in our 2015 guidance on our Q4 call. I would note, however, that if the transaction closes in the fourth quarter between transaction fees and the impact to purchase accounting, we would expect a small but negative impact to adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to line up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : A couple of questions. First, maybe you could comment a little bit about the travel environment in Europe. People are wondering about potentially a market slowdown on a macro front. And then, just overall travel conditions there. And then, also, in your press release, you talked about growing loyalty programs and couponing. Does that mostly apply to China? Or are there other areas that you're getting pretty aggressive with those programs? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Thanks, Justin. As far as Europe goes, we haven't observed, I would say, a big macro move in the environment. Obviously, with the euro getting weaker compared to the U.S. dollar and it's not just unique to the euro, it's also common to a lot of other currencies out there, the strength of the dollar is going to be a headwind for us in a number of these markets. And as Mark mentioned, is going to be a headwind for Q4, at least as we -- compared to where we were in Q2. So I mean, when we look at euro -- when we look at Europe, the first thing that we look at is the strength of the euro. Some airlines are dealing with strikes, some labor issues, but we've -- through our industry, we've seen lots of unrest in different parts of the world. And because we do have a global scope, the business doesn't seem to move significantly as a result of local issues. But we'll watch Europe. Obviously, the economy there is not as strong as we would like it to be and most companies would like it to be, but we haven't observed any significant macro trends there. As far as the -- your question on loyalty. I'd say there are 2 significant factors there. One is eLong, which has been couponing for some period of time, continues to coupon aggressively, especially on mobile and a higher and higher percentage of their traffic is going on mobile as well. And then the second in general is -- has to do with Hotels.com and also, Expedia, to some extent, in that a higher percentage of Hotels.com's bookings, especially, are rolling over members who are Welcome Rewards members. And to the Welcome Rewards, cost is kind of an upfront cost that we recognize. And the benefit that we get is that we have higher repeat rates and typically welcome Rewards Members come to us direct versus other channels. So the benefit is delayed, while the cost is recognized upfront. And as a higher percentage of our bookings come over Welcome Rewards, it's a wonderful thing. But essentially, we're building a long-term asset of loyal customers and paying for it upfront. So that's another factor as far as what we talked about with our loyalty programs as well. I'd say the last factor, when we talk about discounting, is that, we are, in general, pricing more aggressively on Hotwire. This is in good macro environment, opaque channels and opaque supply in general takes a step back. And the Hotwire team has elected essentially to move some of their margins over to their customers. And we're seeing some pretty interesting trends there. And I do think that that's something that's going to continue. Operator : We'll go next to Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Just a quick clarification on trivago growing faster versus TripAdvisor. Can you talk about the ROI you're getting on trivago and how it compares with TripAdvisor? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I'd say the ROIs are roughly comparable. We've been able to -- the EI brands in general, I think, are growing share within the trivago marketplace. trivago is growing a lot of share as far as overall traffic to, call it, travel websites. And the good news is that we are able to get this growth within the trivago marketplace at ROIs that are good and they're roughly comparable with ROIs that we look in general for the meta's channel. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Great. And then sticking with meta, you talked a little bit about Google Hotel Finder and what do you see there in terms of opportunity as a channel, as well as a -- maybe a thread as the launch limited offers? Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as Google Hotel Finder goes, we're seeing increased traffic coming through Google Hotel Finder. It is -- it's clearly getting more exposure. And in general, I think that the product continues to improve. And Google has invested in it, we'll continue to invest in it. I think, from our standpoint, we're happy to play in any market that Google puts out there. And I think, over a long period of time, we have proven an ability to get our fair share in the Google marketplaces, whether to bid at marketplace, whether it's CPC, whether it's SEO and I think the same will be true of Hotel Finder as well. I think Google, in general, is introducing a number of technologies, retargeting technologies, not just against Hotel Finder, but other parts of their site. We're experimenting with them and we are seeing some potential wins there. And we'll continue to work with Google to kind of create win-win situations, where we can spend more and make more. Operator : We'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Dara, big picture question for you. There's a 3-year trend here, maybe 4 years, of deleverage and marketing costs for Expedia. But Priceline, Orbitz -- really across the board. How do you think this all plays out? I mean, I assume that sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue isn't going to keep rising forever -- or maybe it will. Is there -- are there 1 or 2 trigger points or things that can either happen, I don't know, if it's technology solutions, or I don't know, what would it be that would cause those marketing cost to finally kind of normalize out? And do you think that's realistic in the next 2 to 3 years? Dara Khosrowshahi : Mark, I think it's a great question. That is something that we talk about a ton here. I think one of the significant factors, as it relates to our specific P&L, is that marketing and -- sales and marketing efficiency will continue to have headwinds against it, as long as we are aggressively growing our international points of sale. And we intend to continue to aggressively grow our international points of sale. We don't think we're close even to midstream there. We have a very, very strong position domestically, but -- and we're improving in Europe. We're improving in Asia Pacific. We're improving in Latin America. But we're talking years and years of continued investment and growth and growth. So as long as we're able to find more pockets internationally to grow, in general, that growth will come at higher cost than domestic and will hurt our sales and marketing percentage as a percentage of revenue. Now if you look at each of those countries themselves, in general, as our different points of sale mature, they do tend to get more efficient on a sales and marketing front. But then we typically take a good amount of that sales and marketing and then we reinvest it in a new country or we invest more aggressively in a country that is less mature. So we think that formula is going to continue for some period of time. And the formula that we do have is that we combine that -- the pressure on sales and marketing with very disciplined structure on the fixed costs. And for a long period of time and I think it'll continue, we are going to leverage our fixed costs, our cost of sales, our G&A, even technology, at this point, so that we can afford to make those marketing investments and we can afford to keep growing at the bottom line, cash flow, earnings per share, et cetera. We think, as long as we can do that, we will be a share gainer in what is an enormous industry. So at this point, while we ask ourselves the same question, it's not a matter of life and death. This is the growth formula and so far, it's working for us. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And can I just -- a quick follow-up on China. It sounds like that's a -- maybe at the margin picked up as investment area of focus for you. Maybe that market is becoming more competitive, maybe not. But could you maybe just remind us about how material China is? And then how would you describe that market in terms of its competitive intensities? Is there something you're seeing that makes you think it's a more attractive market, therefore, more investments or more competitive markets and therefore, more investments? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I think what we've observed in the China market are a couple of factors. One is that, with the advent of mobile, China is going online and it's mobile very, very fast. The overall market is going very quickly. And as a result of those 2 factors going online fast, going mobile fast and in general, travel being a very, very big category, it is a -- it's a very attractive category for companies to invest in. And we have seen more investment coming in from, not just Ctrip, who's our primary competitor, but other players in the metasearch category. There was news, for example, that Alibaba is launching a site as well. So it's an attractive category. It's a big category that's going online fast. And as a result, we are seeing more capital come into the marketplace. And we built a very nice, big business with eLong with a really, really strong management team and our plan is to keep investing behind that. Mark D. Okerstrom: And Mark, just with respect to mix. If you look back over the course of and they haven't announced yet, but if you look over the course of the last number of quarters, as a percentage of revenue, they've been in and around 3% or 4%. So relatively small part of revenue for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies & Company. Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Two quick questions. In September, you expanded your partnership with Home Away. In general, what level of interest are you seeing towards vacation rentals from travelers? Do you -- is it an all incremental demand? Or is there some degree of cannibalization going on there versus regular hotel bookings? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as Home Away goes, there's -- we have been slowly turning on exposure to Home Away inventory. And more recently, as Home Away piped in more inventory into Brand Expedia, we have -- we kind of the increased the exposure to our customer segment. So I will be able to answer that question much better over the next couple of quarters. In general, we are seeing interest. I'd say it's interesting interest, it's not huge, but it's certainly interesting. There is a cross-sell going on. There is some cannibalization. I would say that our instinct is that it's net positive, but it's too early to tell. So if you ask me the same question next quarter, I'll probably have a better answer. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I guess, Dara, first, I'm wondering if we can get an update on your thinking about Trip Instant Booking, thinking about that as another distribution channel through that marketing vehicle in terms of generating leads going forward and how you think the industry might evolve their view about that? And then, Mark, maybe the second question. You quantified the impact from the investments in Q4, but I don't think you quantified the impact from FX. Didn't know if you could give us a little bit of guidance there on what the dollar amount of the FX impact would be? Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Eric. So I'll start with Trip Instant Booking and that our thinking pretty much remains the same as far as trip instant booking goes. Obviously, Trip is a big partner of our, so we're interested in what they're doing generally. We decided not to participate in instant booking because we didn't think that it was in our strategic interest to do so. And certainly, we didn't think it was profitable enough, short term, to do something that wasn't necessarily strategically interesting for us. So as we've seen instant book develop, we haven't seen the -- we haven't kind of changed our position. And at this point, we don't think that will change our position. We are anticipating some headwinds on the top line because of that as TripAdvisor rolls out Instant Book more expansively, we will have less access to TripAdvisor clicks, so to speak, but we certainly think that's manageable. And in general, TripAdvisor is one of our less profitable channel. So we think that the bottom line is going to be quite manageable, even if TripAdvisor expands Instant Booking significantly. So Mark, do you want to take on the other one? Mark D. Okerstrom: Absolutely. Eric, so with respect to FX, at the current rates, we think they're somewhere around 300 to 400 basis point impact on Q4 adjusted EBITDA growth. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : More specifically on China, can you give us a sense for what increased investment eLong will look like? Like, would this potentially include both increased couponing and higher marketing spend? Or is it more increased expense on mobile development or all of the above? Dara Khosrowshahi : I'd say it's more all of the above. And the China market is moving very fast. It's quite entrepreneurial. And at this point, it's a battle across multiple fronts. Couponing is prevalent there. Everyone is -- the mobile penetration is moving very fast. So everyone is developing aggressively for mobile and marketing aggressively with mobile as well. And also, we are aggressively investing on the technology and supply front. So it's a multi-front investment and we're quite confident that the eLong team can build value there. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : All right. And then, I get the sense that you guys believe there's enough fish to fry in the core travel market without really expanding into a lot of other peripheral areas, like tourist attractions or restaurants, et cetera. Is that true? Or how would you describe how narrow or broad your focus is? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. Listen, this is a trillion-dollar global marketplace. And Mark and I are never bored, as is anyone here. We've got plenty to do. We think, as a company, we're executing better, but we think we can execute much better going forward. And we think, as a result, staying focused on what we're doing now is going to give us plenty of opportunity and it's going to keep us pretty darn busy. Mark D. Okerstrom: And I would just add that with respect to tourist attractions, we've actually got a decent sized business, we call it our local expert business. It's a large business. It's something that we'll be increasingly focusing on. And it's something we think, that mobile creates specific opportunity on. So I think you might hear more about that business in the coming years. It's something that we've got already in-house and it's something we can build nicely organically. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. And we have moved over that business on to some of the newer technology platforms that we had previously moved our hotel business, air business, et cetera. And we are very optimistic about the increased capabilities that we can build there. So it's an existing business. We're not getting into a new business. We've got a strong management team there and we think there's plenty of organic growth in that category. Operator : We'll go next to Tom White, Macquarie. Thomas Cauthorn White - Macquarie Research : I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned strong growth in all variable channels, but costs to acquire were kind of increasing. I was hoping maybe you can just give us a little bit more color. Are there particular channels where you're seeing sort of the biggest pressure? Or is it kind of across the board? And then, also, I'm not sure if you give any sort of updated metrics on the rollout of ETP, but any update there? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. In general, as far as the variable channels go, the 2 most significant variable channels that we have are Google SEM and metasearch. And in general, we are seeing CPCs, or cost-per-click, in both of those channels increase on a year-on-year basis. Some of it is because ADR's increased in general. You're going to see CPC increase. But some of it, we believe, is because of increased competition, we are seeing more of a supplier-direct presence in some of those channels that we had seen in the past. But the good news is that we're still able to innovate. We're still able to optimize in those channels and in general, grow those channels. But it is getting more expensive. Mark D. Okerstrom: And with respect to ETP. As a reminder, it has really become business as usual for us. We continue to see great traction and a positive response from both consumers and suppliers. We are up to well north of 50,000 hotels that are now on the program and it's growing nicely. We recently signed up Choice Hotels on the ETP deal. And there's very few of the major chains that are not participating. Most of them and certainly, a vast majority of the large ones are involved in the program. And again, we continue to be very happy with what we see there. Operator : We'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Two things. Dara, you talked trivago and just how important to the channel it's become. Can you just talk more, how much further you'll be able to push things there? Just trying to understand if you realize kind of a lot of the benefits early on as you brought it into the fold and whether you can still stay on the same kind of trajectory there in terms of helping the rest of the business. And then, secondly, also as you move closer to lapping Travelocity, can you talk about how you think about the growth from that vehicle going forward? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as trivago goes, when we originally acquired trivago, I would say that our share in the trivago marketplace was lower than our natural share in other meta marketplaces. And I think, as we have optimized against the trivago marketplace and it's been a really good marketplace to allocate capital into, even if it were a third-party, we've been able to grow our share inside the marketplace. And then the trivago team has been very aggressively investing in marketing and building that brand on a global basis and doing it successfully. And I think, at this point, they have moved from, call it, their core European, their European core, nicely into North America and are now experimenting in markets in Asia Pacific, markets in Latin America, et cetera, that are pretty interesting markets and we're starting to see some pretty good trends in. Obviously, as trivago is getting bigger, they're not going to be able to grow at quite the growth rates that we have seen historically. But we do anticipate that trivago is going to be a nice growth driver for us over the next couple of years. I think the other factor with trivago as well is that one of their fastest growing markets has been the North American and Canadian markets and those are markets in which our inventory is really, really strong and our brands are really strong. So that has helped our share within the trivago marketplace as well. So Mark, you want to take the other question? Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes. Doug, on Travelocity, obviously we got a nice boost from adding that business into our P&L this year. And that will create a more difficult comp for us next year. However, as a reminder, Q1 of this year was a partial quarter. So we still will have some baked-in benefit going into 2015. And also, just as a reminder, I mean, the Travelocity business is on the Brand Expedia platform and that's a platform that continues to innovate. And the Travelocity business will be a recipient of the year-on-year gains that Brand Expedia has been able to consistently turn out on that platform. So we continue to think that, that can be a growth business and we will obviously bake in our expectations for that business into our 2015 guidance, which we'll give you on the next call. Operator : We'll go next to Dean Prissman with Credit Suisse. Dean Prissman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So looking at the 500 basis points of year-over-year growth for ADRs, can you share some color on how much of this relates to broad cyclical strength in the lodging industry versus what sounds like a smaller contribution to room nights from eLong? And then, separately, with regard to your CapEx spend, how should we think about the mix in terms of growth versus maintenance? And then looking out over the next 12 to 18 months, can you talk about some of the key initiatives that are nearing completion versus some that are more nascent? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I'd say, as far as the 500 basis points of ADR growth, I'd say the majority of that ADR growth was related to, call it, core ADR growth. That is the cyclical recovery that we have seen in the hotel sector. Obviously, FX, on a go-forward basis, is going to be a headwind there, especially in the European, Latin American and some of the Asian markets. So my guess is, the ADRs for Q4 are going to come down, at least for us, in U.S. dollar terms, compared to where they were in Q3. There was some mixed shift with eLong, but the majority of it was kind of core global ADRs. Mark D. Okerstrom: And with respect to CapEx. I mean, the biggest portion of our CapEx is capitalized software development. And the portion that we capitalize is generally all-around new features and innovation as opposed to pure maintenance. So the big picture answer is that most of the CapEx is around new products. It's mostly about innovation. And really, with respect to big initiatives, they might be nearing completion. I mean, we have largely moved this business away from big initiatives. The Brand Expedia replatforming is largely done. ETP has been rolled up -- rolled out. And really, we're in a spot now where the things we're working on are a lot of small things that together, add up to nice conversion benefits. And so we don't expect there to be a significant roll-off, if anything, in the future that would slow down the trajectory we're on right now in terms of our tech and content expenses on a cash basis, which have an impact on CapEx. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. And just adding to something that Mark said. We -- our businesses operate on lots and lots of different platforms. And those platforms, different parts of those platforms or different platforms, age over a period of time. And we are constantly revitalizing different platforms that affect different parts of the business. And what we don't want to get into is a situation where we were 5, 6 years ago, where we were really under-investing and had a bunch of catch-up to do. And I think, at this point, we've got the right kind of balance of, as we see a platform that needs to be revitalized, we can make that investment without it causing huge shifts in our technology spend or CapEx in general. It's a much more healthy spot to be. Operator : We'll go next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division : Two, please. Maybe a follow-up on Travelocity. Could you provide any update on maybe pushing, or I guess, the partnership between 2 companies, maybe there's any additional insight in what Travelocity's planning on the marketing spend to help plan the overall business? And then, separately, Dara, I think you commented that very healthy travel environment, ADRs are up. I think occupancy is close to record highs. So I'm wondering if this is among the best macro environments you've been at least here domestically. And is this one of the reasons why maybe the AMR and other airlines provided lower overall -- or suppliers pushing back on pricing, I guess, is the question. Dara Khosrowshahi : I'd say, on Travelocity, as far as an update on the partnership, I'd say the Travelocity team and our teams are working closely. We don't control the Travelocity marketing plan. They've got a very, very strong marketing team there. And in general, they continue to build their brand, which is a very strong brand. And they are developing, really, the variable channels, which have become more available to them now that they have a platform that is -- that can convert well and a supply base that is a -- that's kind of a best-of-breed supply base, especially in North America. That said, we don't have, I would say, very significant visibility into their plans or spend. That's a separate company. They are competitor of sorts with us. So there is a bit of a Chinese wall there. And as a result, we would have a hard time giving you real insight as to what their plans are for Q4 or for 2015. As far as the travel environment goes, I have a relatively -- we've been here for a long time, but I feel like I've got a short memory. But this is -- this is a pretty darn strong environment and it's strong broadly. And the strength is also augmented by the fact that there's very little supply coming into the marketplace. You don't hear about -- much about increased supply for, certainly, the domestic airlines. And in general, hotel supply growth, which trails kind of cyclically slow, other than a couple of markets. New York was an exemption, for example, last year. Hotel supply growth has been muted as well. So that creates a very, very strong environment for our supply partners. And it's a great tailwind for us as well, as far as ADRs go. So I think it's an environment where you can have win wins. I do think that in strong environments, intermediaries like us have to work harder because suppliers have -- the alternatives for suppliers improve. And I think, as a company, we know we have to get better. There are certain parts of our business, the opaque parts of our business, for example, Hotwire, or the package parts of our business, that take a bit of a nick as far as the quality of the inventory goes, or the quality of the discounts. But it's unquestionably good for the retail part of the business and the retail part of the business is growing very, very nicely. So all in all, when we look at the environment, we're happy about the environment. And frankly, we don't want it to change. Operator : We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just -- I had 2 questions. Mark, so if we look at the advertising and other line, up 29% versus last quarter, 54%. I guess that explains the shift of clicks within trivago to Expedia properties. So how do we think about that going forward? Is that a one-time step-up? Or will it continue to kind of creep higher? And I think you called out 50% gross revenue growth for trivago. Can you just remind us how that compared with prior periods on a gross basis? And then, looking into 4Q, what kind of domestic room night growth are we -- do you think we can expect to see in the fourth quarter? Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. So the advertising and other line, up 29% versus last quarter, 54%. There was a little bit of a slowdown in our ad and media growth, our ad and media business, the Media Solutions business. But there certainly was a continuation of share gains by particularly Brand Expedia and Hotels.com in trivago. I think the teams are continuing to look for ways to gain more share in trivago. And I would just say generally, that trivago is a channel that really reflects what's happening in the broader industry, which is the global players are generally taking share from the smaller players. So it's hard for me to look into crystal ball and tell you whether share gains will continue forever. But I do think that that's a very real possibility. In terms of the sequential growth rate in trivago. We said in the last call that it had been growing broadly in line in the second quarter, as it had since the time of the acquisition. So this is a bit of a slowdown from that. Certainly, something we are anticipating largely because they were lapping over a pretty aggressive push into the U.S. through 2013... Dara Khosrowshahi : And euro weaknesses is also going to, obviously, affect trivago growth. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes, definitely, as well. With respect to room night growth outlook for Q4, we're not going to give a guide on the overall room night growth trends. But I think, if you take a look at the past number of quarters and you normalize for Easter and you normalize for some slowdown we saw in eLong this quarter, it's been pretty consistent. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Two questions. First, I was looking at -- or to what extent are you seeing any travel changes related to Ebola or terrorism in terms of where people are going or where they're not going or how they're going, or when they're going? And then I have a question on U.S. car rental. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as Ebola, terrorism, et cetera goes, we do see local changes in travel patterns as a result of local events. So for example, Russian ADRs came down with the trouble there. The Hong Kong market has softened a bit as a result of the troubles there or the protests. And travel to West Africa is down on a year-on-year basis as well. So we certainly see local effects. It is tough, at this point, to assess out whether there's been a global effect with Ebola. We've done some analysis, but honestly, we haven't spent much time on it. So while Ebola might be having some effect, we don't think that it's a significant effect. And if it were significant, it will be something that we would -- we bring up in this call. We just don't see it yet. It could change if the news gets worse, but at this point, there's not a big macro effect that we're observing. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Just a follow-on on that question. When you're seeing these changes, Hong Kong, Russia, West Africa, are these -- are people traveling -- having alternative plans or staying locked in their bedrooms? Dara Khosrowshahi : It's tough to tell. I'd say the local people maybe are staying more in their bedrooms. But there's always some place exciting to travel to. In general, the price of getting to destinations, flights other than the U.S., has come down. It's become quite available with low cost carriers to the general public. So it's our feeling that the demand just shifts from one market to the other and doesn't suffer in a significant way on an overall basis. Mark D. Okerstrom: Michael, on car. I would just say, generally, in the overall U.S. environment, particularly, no real change to the story. Fleets remain tight, access to inventory remains a bit of a challenge and I think that's something that we're certainly expecting to continue, just given the consolidation that we've seen in that industry. With respect to our performance in car, we've seen some very nice results, Brand Expedia putting the car business on the new technology platform has really helped us out there and they're seeing great trends. Obviously, with the addition of the Travelocity business and to a lesser extent, the Auto Escape business, our recent acquisition has helped us. RPDs are relatively flat year-on-year, slight growth primarily on mix. And we are seeing some revenue margin pressure principally with respect to mixed shift away from the Hotwire or opaque business and some more discounting there as well. So I think, overall, it's a healthy story for us. But the challenges remain in the U.S. car rental industry more broadly. Operator : We'll go next to the Ken Sena with Evercore. Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : So just going back to the comparison of TripAdvisor versus trivago and the fact that you're seeing more clicks from trivago. Is there anything -- having worked with those companies now for as long as you have, that you can maybe provide to us as far as the consumer experience being provided on each of those platforms that might be leading to that higher conversion and those additional clicks? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I think as far as clicks go, the volume of clicks isn't dependent on conversion. That's a volume of clicks that essentially click off that a trivago will send us or a TripAdvisor will send us, but it certainly wasn't a comment on conversion. I would say, in general, while this isn't a comment on consumer experience, trivago traffic tends to be more domestic based and TripAdvisor has a greater international mix of customers, which makes some sense. One of the strengths of TripAdvisor is their reviews, et cetera. So maybe if you're flying off to France and you're looking for some place to stay in the South of France, TripAdvisor can certainly add a lot of value there. trivago seems to add very significant value for a price conscious consumer who wants to find, who -- kind of a power user who wants to find the absolute best pricing and availability out there. So maybe that's a reflection of the mix. Both products are very, very strong products and both products continuing to grow and take increasing share of travel search. Operator : We'll go next to Manish Hemrajani with Oppenheimer. Manish Hemrajani - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Can you talk about mobile here a bit. What was mobile share of total bookings? And any color you can provide geographically where you're seeing better traction with mobile? And also, how do conversion rates stack up on mobile versus desktop? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, as far as mobile share goes. In previous calls, we talked about mobile being, I'd say around 20% of room nights across our various brands. And that share continues to grow as our mobile channels, I'd say, across the board, are growing faster than our desktop channels. And that's both in terms of traffic and in terms of room nights as well. On the conversion rates on mobile, that's not something that we talk about, for competitive reasons. But certainly, we see in mobile, as you would expect, very significant, last-minute activity. We also see significantly shorter length of stay. Again, to be expected. In general, while mobile is a very, very nice growth story for us, our ability to acquire customers across mobile channels profitably is challenged. So mobile, I'd say, is a revenue, is a great revenue tailwind and is a sales and marketing headwind for us. But one thing that we are seeing that's very encouraging is that the pattern of use from mobile bookers on our apps, et cetera, is very, very strong. These are really good products that we are introducing and innovating and Hotwire has won a bunch of prizes for their product. Brand Expedia introduced a great new mobile app experience, et cetera. And the various brands are also launching on wearables. So our ability to invest and innovate, I think, creates an advantage for us. And as a result of that, we think, over a long period of time, mobile is going to be a very, very significant opportunity for us. I would say, internationally, what I've said, applies internationally everywhere. China, in particular, is seeing a higher percentage of mobile adoption than, I'd say, elsewhere in the world. And a very high percentage of that mobile activity is on apps versus mobile web. Operator : We'll go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just a quick one. Hotel supply. Can you just give us some color on what kind of hotels, in which geographies, your new investments are having the biggest impact in? In terms of your hotel supply investment? Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure, happy to, Kevin. I would say that we are adding hotel supply everywhere. We're still very much at the early stage here. But again, just for context, this quarter, we ended up at about 365,000 properties, including eLong. And if you compare that to the 700,000 or 800,000 or even more that's on trivago or TripAdvisor, there's just a ton of headroom left. We think there's headroom and pretty significant headroom still remaining in the U.S., for example, one of our most mature markets and secondary and tertiary markets. We think there's a big opportunity for us in Europe, particularly in the Expedia Traveler Preference Program. It's certainly opened that up for us. So we are -- we're adding everywhere and we would -- I would expect that the pace of acquisition is only going to increase from here. And I think as Dara said, this year, year-to-date, we've got 3x the amount of revenue from new hotels than we did last year. So the results of what we're doing seem to be working and we're going to continue on the path that we're on right now. Operator : And we'll go next to Scott Devitt with Stifel. Ansel Parikh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : This is Ansel Parikh in for Scott Devitt. I just had a quick question regarding Travelocity. Previously, you guys kind of provided the contribution, the percentage contribution, Travelocity provided to total room nights growth. I was just wondering if you could give that out this quarter. Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. It was about 400 basis points again this quarter. Operator : We have no further questions in the queue at this time. Alan Pickerill : Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Dara, do you have any closing remarks? Dara Khosrowshahi : No, just good -- thank you to the Expedia, Inc. worldwide employee base. We had another good quarter and let's keep our eyes on the ball and let's keep executing. And thanks, everyone, for joining us. Operator : That concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. 2014 was a terrific year for Expedia, Inc. We delivered healthy top line growth with gross bookings up 28% and revenue up 21% year-on-year. Room nights grew 26% for the year, air tickets were up 28% and we grew our ad and media business including, Trivago, by 50%. At the same time, we made significant investments in areas that will position us for long-term growth, ramping up our hotel acquisition efforts, scaling our global technology platforms, and making key investments to drive growth at Trivago. In total, we were able to balance our near-term profit objectives and long-term investment priorities and deliver full-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%. As we move into 2015, we like to talk to you about four distinct businesses in our portfolio : the core OTA group, eLong, Trivago and Egencia, each of which has its own market opportunity, good drivers, competitive dynamics and ultimately value creation potential. Our core OTA group is led by our two flagship global brands, brand Expedia and Hotels.com, and also includes regional or segment brand leaders such as Hotwire, Venere and CarRentals.com in our affiliate business and now Travelocity and Wotif. Over the past several years, we've made significant investments and improved our execution across our online marketing platforms, customer facing technology and supply facing platforms. And while the work is never done, this business is performing well and we are seeing the benefits show up in our operating results. On a combine basis, our core OTA business generated approximately $43 billion of gross bookings in 2014, up about 30% year-on-year. This growth is significantly faster than the industry and we believe we are gaining market share in every major geography. Additionally, we are finding key commercial deals and acquisitions that enable us to leverage our existing technology and operations infrastructure to amplify our growth, such as the deal to power and now own Travelocity, and the acquisition of Wotif. Our platforms and operational processes now allow us to acquire businesses, integrate them predictably and quickly, and realize meaningful synergies while creating improved experiences for our customers and our supply partners. As the performance challenges we've seen at Hotwire demonstrate bumps in the road will always arise in this highly competitive segment. However we believe we\u2019re executing well and are positioned better than ever. Staying with the theme of challenges, eLong incurred a $27 million adjusted EBITDA loss in Q4 as the highly competitive environment that we talked about during our last call was more than true. We manage our 65% eLong stake independently, and eLong has its own capital so we are not making trade-off investments in other businesses to fund eLong. While we aren't counting on the competitive environment getting any better in 2015, we know that the market opportunity in China is huge, we're confident in the execution capabilities of the eLong team, and are very confident that we're building real value there. As is true in any geography in which we compete, we aren't dogmatic about our approach and will drive towards one simple goal, long-term value creation for Expedia shareholders. Turning to Trivago, we've owned a majority stake in Trivago since March of 2013 and the business continues to grow at impressive rates. If you watch any TV at all in the US, you've no doubt seen the Trivago guy pitching the site as an excellent place to find the ideal hotel at the best price. On a standalone basis for the full year, Trivago generated revenue of over $410 million, up 68% year-on-year and EBITDA $4 million. Note that this includes revenue from all of the other Expedia, Inc. brands. Our focus for Trivago has been on growing the top line rather than profitability and we've been reinvesting profits from core markets at Trivago to fund worldwide expansion. While we expect Trivago to generate adjusted EBITDA growth in 2015, we will continue to trade-off near-term profits for long-term value. Turning to Egencia, we have a terrific corporate travel business here, which exceeded $5 million of gross bookings in 2014. Egencia is growing at healthy rate signing up new business at a fast pace, while integrating platforms in key acquisitions over time. With this business, we're mostly focused on industry disruption, bringing more new products and services and better technology to corporate customers. And although they remain much larger than Egencia, we see the big legacy players on their back foot trying to figure out how they deliver technology and tools to compete effectively with Egencia and other online offerings. We believe this business can grow nicely on an organic basis, but we will continue to look opportunistically at acquisitions to accelerate growth and further scale the business over time. In closing let me say this, while we celebrate a job well done in 2014, we are by no means standing still. Our products and service, while better, have miles of improvement ahead of them. You won't find a single person across Expedia, Inc. who tell you that we are executing to our full potential, but we are finally seeing the arc of the possible. With that, I'll hand it to Mark. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Dara. In the fourth quarter, we again saw strong performance from our core OTA group, Trivago, and Egencia, and although the profitability was negatively affected by sizable investments at eLong, negative FX trends and significant due diligence and other deal costs, we are happy to exit a terrific year with good momentum. Top line growth was driven this quarter by robust unit growth pretty much across the board. Room nights and air ticket growth helped drive gross bookings growth of 24%, 27% excluding the impact of foreign currency and revenue growth of 18% or 22% excluding FX. Hotel room night growth accelerated to 28%, with a healthy growth seen across all major geographies. Travelocity and Wotif together contributed around five percentage points to total room night growth. Room night economics on the other hand continued to be lower year over year with revenue per room night down 10% on flat ADRs. The impact from foreign currency was the larger driver this quarter than in prior periods and we estimate that the negative impact on our revenue per room night was roughly 5 percentage points with a portion of this hedged off and recorded as other income. The other main drivers of the declining unit economics remain relatively consistent with prior periods. We continue to reduce our hotel margins to enable an accelerated global build out of hotel room inventory and availability. We also continue to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs along with coupons and other incentives which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We will continue to push these levers throughout 2015 and as such continue to expect the revenue per room night to decline. Air revenue grew 18% on ticket growth of 26%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 6%. Air gross bookings and air revenue were helped again this quarter by Travelocity, which represented approximately 12 percentage points of the total ticket volume growth. Revenue per ticket was down, as expected, as a result of the renewal of certain airline deals earlier in the year and we expect this pressure to continue into 2015 as we annualize these contracts. Our advertising and media business, which is made up of Trivago and our Media Solutions Group, has become quite large and is growing fast. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 38%, net of intercompany amounts. We also saw healthy contributions from our car and insurance products. On the expense side, we saw solid leverage this quarter in cost of revenue as the team continues to drive for global efficiencies in our customer operations platform and on reduced levels of fraud and charge backs year over year. General and administrative expenses grew faster than the revenue, due primarily to over $8 million of deal costs, without which the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and nicely leveraging versus revenue. The pace of growth of our technology and content expense was a little bit faster than the growth we saw in the third quarter. Selling and marketing expense growth was also broadly consistent with prior quarters. Deleverage in selling and marketing versus revenue continues to be driven primarily by success in variable marketing channels as we continue to execute well and expand across the globe. The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% excluding eLong and 3% on a consolidated basis. As I mentioned, our Q4 results were also impacted by negative FX trends over $8 million of deal costs and eLong losses, all of which exceeded our expectations at the time of our last call. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA growth for the full year 2014 would have been at the top end of our guidance range. You will also notice $26 million of restructuring and related charges in Q4. These consist primarily of costs associated with the integration of our Wotif acquisition but also includes some other efficiency related initiatives, including the migration of our Venere business onto our Hotels.com platform as well as platform consolidation in our CarRentals.com business and Egencia. We do expect $10 million to $15 million of additional restructuring costs in 2015, the majority of which you will see in the first half of the year. Note that these expenses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. From a capital allocation perspective, 2014 was an active year. We delivered over $1 billion of free cash flow and allocated $561 million for its acquisitions and $85 million in dividend and repurchased 7 million shares for $537 million. Now, I would like to spend some time on our financial expectations for 2015. Please note that our format for providing guidance is a little bit different this quarter. As Dara mentioned, the Chinese market remained highly competitive and dynamic and because of this we are not going to provide any specific adjusted EBITDA expectations for eLong for 2015. Directionally, we think the adjusted EBITDA loss of $27 million that eLong reported in the fourth quarter is a good baseline and we would expect the quarterly losses to be larger than this as we move through 2015. eLong is so well capitalized NASDAQ listed company with a distinct public market valuation and we encourage you to value our eLong position and its impact on our consolidated results on a stand-alone basis. For the rest of the business excluding eLong, we are currently expecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the 10% to 15% range. Note that this includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 5 percentage points at current rates. Against a general backdrop of strength across our business and our continuing efforts to balance near term profits against investments to drive medium and long-term growth, I would call the following regarding our expected performance in 2015. We are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth in 2015 on headwinds from Travelocity implementation, further impact from the reduction of our hotel margins, the negative impact of foreign currency and the continued success of our loyalty programs. These are partially offset by the tailwind of adding the Wotif business. On the expense side, while we continue to manage the business toward our target P&L, we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth especially in the first half of the year as we digest recent acquisitions and [indiscernible] our core technology and infrastructure stack for the increased pace at which we\u2019ve been building global scale. From a seasonality perspective, we are not expecting any meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter and expect the bulk of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. In terms of an effective tax rate on a consolidated basis, we are expecting an elevated rate in 2015 primarily as a result of non-deductible losses that we are anticipating on the back of increased investment levels at eLong. One final quick housekeeping item before we begin Q&A, as Dara mentioned, we plan to increasingly discuss our business in four distinct components : the core OTA group, eLong, Trivago and Egencia. In this regard we will break up the results of these four businesses beginning with the first quarter of 2015, so that our investors can have the appropriate level of visibility to be able to model a specific value reflecting the unique opportunities and valuation considerations inherent in each business. With that, let\u2019s move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to ask questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Great. Two questions. First, EBITDA guidance, 10% to 15%, how much will the acquisitions of Wotif and the Travelocity deal help next year on your outlook? And then since it looks like you're pushing people looking at the four divisions separately, could you just go through the EBITDA for each group in 2014? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, Justin. So first on guidance, again I would just remind everyone that the 10% to 15% does include 500 basis points of FX headwind. With respect to your specific question on acquisitions, couple of things I would just note. We certainly are expecting to get a year-on-year help from those acquisitions, but a lot of the numbers that are available publicly are probably not the best source to look at for the purposes of coming up with those estimates. When we acquired Wotif that was a business that was facing some pretty significant challenges, again it's going to see pretty significant FX headwinds as we move through 2015 and we are also in the middle of an integration and we don't expect to see a meaningful uptick in the performance of Wotif until we get that business onto our platform. Now we are making progress on that, we moved international traffic onto the brand Expedia platform in January, we do expect to get the rest of the business onto the platform in the first half of 2015. But in the meantime, you got a business that is undergoing a very significant restructuring on a base momentum that is declining and so you've got a bit of a headwind certainly versus what you would have seen more publicly available. Travelocity, we do think that there could be some upside there, it's very difficult for us to put the precise value on that for you right now. It's really going to depend on how effective we are in really marketing this business. The Travelocity business didn't spend a lot of money on brand advertising in 2014. That is something that we are going to want to do very likely to reinvigorate that brand, which is a great brand. So I think the acquisitions are going to be a tailwind, but I wouldn't rely on public numbers. Lastly I would just say that our philosophy is one where our EBITDA outcome is one of careful management and one of careful decisions around what upside we see and what investments do we have available to us to drive medium and long-term growth. And so \u2013 but we do have some tailwinds from acquisitions and we did have some last year for Travelocity, we are constantly looking at investments that we can make that respect the EBITDA guidance and the EBITDA target that we set for ourselves, but also set ourselves up for more sustained growth. So with the respect to EBITDA, let me just go through the numbers for you. So for eLong, the EBITDA for full year 2014 was $27 million loss, okay; for the Egencia business, its $60 million; for Trivago its $4 million; and then you can back into the core OTA business with the rest. Operator : We will go next to Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of macro concerns out of Europe as well as Russia. Can you guys speak to the business trends that you might be seeing in those markets? And then I have a follow-up. Dara Khosrowshahi : We are certainly seeing, I would say, the more significant trend that we see in those markets is the foreign exchange trends. So when you look at our revenue per room night for example, the revenue per room night for international was down significantly more on a year-on-year basis than domestic. Europe is a part of that, but frankly Asia-Pacific is a part of that as well, the foreign exchange trends on a year-on-year basis are significant. And if nothing changes and at this point we don't anticipate anything changes, changing, it will continue to be significant as we go through the year. As far as the relative strength of the European market et cetera, one trend that we have observed is that due to the strength of the dollar, we are seeing are lower balance of European demand coming into the US, because the US looks more expensive. In general, we are seeing stronger demand from the US to Europe and I think in general across Europe and APAC we are seeing higher concentration of demand locally, now part of that is because we have better local supply and I think we got better local marketing, but in general our domestic room night growth in most territories exceeds international room night growth. We think it's a good trend, it hurts ADRs and hurts length of stay, but we think it's very, very positive factor in our growing business on a global basis. Naved Khan : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow up, now that you guys will be owning and operating Travelocity and Wotif, at Expedia what changes do you expect to make to the marketing and to audience reach? Dara Khosrowshahi : I think it's a little bit too soon to make that call. What we have seen with Travelocity for example is that conversion rates for hotels for Travelocity on the Expedia platform are higher than the conversion rates that they have previously, it's a combination of the quality of supply and quality of product and technology that we have. With Travelocity in house, the Travelocity team will have kind of the full profit dollars invest in order to drive growth, for example, in variable marketing. So I think we will have the ability to invest more aggressively in variable markets. We haven't quite figured out exactly what our strategy is and how we set up the P&L for the long term, but we certainly have that potential. Wotif we are really in the middle of an integration as we speak, we are going to take the Wotif side, put it on the brand Expedia platform, but really its heads down working on that integration. Once we get it onto the Expedia platform we see how it responds, we understand what the conversion rates are et cetera, we will start making marketing decisions. We're just not there yet. Naved Khan : That's helpful. And then just on Wotif, I understand the entities on the revenue side but what is the low-hanging fruit when you look at the cost synergies there? Mark Okerstrom : I think the low-hanging fruit is on the technology and platform side. We can put them on the brand Expedia technology, they don't need to maintain totally separate stack, we bring them all the benefits of the global tech stack that we have, then the testing and learning that we are constantly doing and the Expedia global tech stack benefits from additional volume that Wotif brings to it. I think another piece of low-hanging fruit is the supply, Expedia, Hotels.com, et cetera, customer now was going to get out to us to the terrific Wotif supply in Australia and New Zealand marketplace and Wotif customers are going to have access to much better global supply for their out bonds. So we are really looking to get the best of both worlds on the technology side and then really we are finding also lots and lots of talent and people within the Wotif organization, on the supply side, on the technology side and we think bringing their talent together with our talent you are going to have a net positive. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, guys. A couple questions. Have you seen any tangible impact on travel from the declining fuel prices? And based on your experience, when do you expect any potential savings to trickle down and start to impact travelers, if you have a point of view on that? And then really quickly on the advertising side, the Captain Obvious campaign, quite successful. But off-line ad channels tend to be lower ROIs. And so now that you've anniversaried the launch a bit, can you give us some color in terms of impacts on new customer growth, retention, repeat rates, et cetera, from Captain Obvious? Mark Okerstrom : Brian, just on the lower oil prices, we haven't seen any profound impact, it's going to take the airlines a while to actually put that through on average ticket prices and it's doubtful they will put all through and that would be one of the things that drove increased travel pattern. The other thing is just more disposable income for consumers and we've seen estimates of anywhere from $500 to $1000 extra in the pockets of the average American household. And on a typical trip, hotel stay part of that trip, it will be around $300, so that could actually drive more volume and more consumer demand around the world. It's not something that again that we've seen right now, but we are optimistic that could be tailwind in 2015 perhaps to offset some of the headwinds we are seeing from FX. And Doro, do you want to take that? Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as Captain Obvious goes, it's been a very, very successful campaign for us. And if you look at Hotels.com in general, the trend in room night growth for Hotels.com has been consistently positive and improving. Q4 room night stays for Hotels.com have been higher than they have been really all your this year and last year. So the trends at Hotels.com continue to be very strong and the trends at Hotels.com domestically are very strong as well. And we see new customer acquisition growth in general increasing and because of the Welcome Rewards program for Hotels.com we see very strong repeat rates. Welcome Rewards now has over 15 million members on a worldwide basis and essentially the Hotels.com model bringing in new customers, introducing them to the Welcome Rewards program, serving them very, very well and then keeping them and having them repeat is a formula that's working quite well for us and it's something we want to build on. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the questions. Two bigger-picture strategic questions, one with respect to China. Obviously, understand the point that eLong is a separate entity and you're not necessarily giving it capital today. But how do you think about the role eLong might be able to play if the market in China consolidated and how you could redeploy that capital into other areas of the business if that opportunity presented itself versus the opportunity for eLong as a standalone entity long term? And second one you've obviously done a fair bit of acquisitions over the last 18 months in the OTA space broadly with Wotif and Travelocity. What do you think the pathway forward is to do more acquisitions in the OTA space, especially to leverage on some of the technology investments you made over the last couple of years? Thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as eLong goes and redeploying capital et cetera, we are not short on capital, right, this is the business that grows off of $1 billion of free cash flow, eLong has plenty of capital, they've got over $300 million in cash and the reason why we are saying we are not trading of eLong investments against other investments is because we don't have to. So we will disclose them to you and from our standpoint we are very confident of the eLong team, they have built a big, big business that and we think that eLong will be very creative for Expedia shareholders over a period of time and we are just heads down on maximizing that value from a long-term perspective. As far as acquisitions go, acquisitions are a part of our game plan. We've had a number of acquisitions over the years and I would say that our technology platforms now and our operating practices now are at a different level where we are good at and have a very strong practice at bringing in and consolidating acquisitions and realizing synergies. We have our hands full with Wotif and Travelocity, but the travel market is enormous, it's $1.3 trillion travel market, we're one of the biggest players out there with only $50 billion less than 5% of that market and we do think that consolidation is going to continue. We think that the big global players in general are going to gain share and we will look for consolidation opportunities if they make sense for our shareholders and if they give us a higher return then buy back our own stock. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler : Thanks, guys. Just on the guidance question, maybe not talking about the contribution from Wotif, Travelocity, but can we just talk about what is baked in, in terms of organic growth in the core franchise relative to the 18% or, call it, mid teens ex Travelocity in 2014? And then a question on the unit efficiencies. Given the trends with revenue per room night, and then the marketing spend that's flowing through Trivago, is the right way to look at the growth rate of marketing or direct marketing relative to your room night growth? Or how do we think about the rate of marketing deleverage, how much of that is Trivago versus some of the contra revenue items you mentioned versus just industry dynamic? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. On guidance, listen, I would say that I would think about our guidance as being largely an organic story, again we will get some helpers from the \u2013 for those acquisitions, we got harder headwinds this year just lacking over the Travelocity acquisition. So the guidance I would take as really representing strength in the core of the business and not a lot a net help from anything other than that. With respect to unit trends and sales and marketing deleverage, again we are deleveraging sales and marketing essentially for what we think are really great reasons which really two major drivers, one is that we are just having much more success in variable marketing as we continue to improve the conversion on our website and we are getting much, much better and that on a global basis. And of course, no matter how efficient those channels are, there are always going to be more expensive than freak, which is what the direct type of traffic is. And so when we are driving growth in the channels in which we are right now, you're going to continue to see deleverage on the P&L there. Secondly it's just global expansion and of course that's happening across all of our brands, we continue to push into international markets on a more aggressive basis and those markets, even though themselves get efficient, more efficient over time, they are generally less efficient than ever core domestic market. So those are the big drivers. Trivago is certainly a piece of it, but I think now you will see in 2015 we are completely clear of that acquisition. So we've got clean comps and that wasn't the case for all of 2014, we had a tougher comp in Q1. They are going to continue to be a driver, but really it's the core business that's driving a lot of that story now that we are annualizing over the Trivago acquisition. In terms of how to look at it, I think looking at direct sales and marketing per room night is a decent way to look at , a lot of for the marketing spend does go against our hotel business. I think you will be able to back into a number that at least approximates what you think Trivago spends on marketing, you could back out and estimate on that. But I think that could give you a reasonable way to look at it on a go forward basis. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. This is [indiscernible] on for Doug. We were wondering if you could provide more color on the big gap between the 28% hotel and room nights growth and the 15% hotel revenue growth. Obviously FX is part of it but could you help maybe walk us down from 28% to 15%. And how much of that was maybe going to supply and promotions, and if you expect that to continue. Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : So by and large the biggest driver there was foreign exchange trends, about 500 basis points of that 1000 basis point, or 1500 basis point delta came from that impact. I will say a portion of that is hedged off and it's in our other income item, but if you're looking at just hotel revenue, it's not in their number. The other drivers are just very consistent with what we've spoke about on prior quarters. One is that we continue to adjust our hotel margin to make sure that we are competitive for the local market conditions and that's pretty important for us as we continue to aggressively build our hotel count and really drive for great rates and availability with our hotel partners. Secondly is the impact of our loyalty programs and Doro mentioned Hotels.com, Welcome Awards program, been very successful, more and more of the Hotels.com business is really coming from that repeat loyal user base. It's nicely efficient for us on our adjusted EBITDA basis, but in our P&L, it's showing as a contra revenue item as supposed to sales and marketing and that puts pressure on the metrics as well. And then also call it that bucket of loyalty is couponing and discounting that we do from time to time. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman : Thank you. I want to go back a little bit regarding the currency on actual travel. Could you talk about the numbers in terms of profitability or revenues from maybe more US traveling to Europe? Europe staying in Europe? What this might also mean in terms of places like Russia that has poor currency situation? Any help would be very beneficial in quantifying some of these. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think I will try to be helpful, but there are so many crosscurrents in general and currencies, now we are close to 70 countries, I don't know how many countries we operate in, there is no simple answer, I'm going to try a simple answer to your question. In general, the volumes that we see from the strength of volumes from the US to international markets and US is about 50% of our volume, is offsetting the weakness of international markets coming to the years. In general, those two are offsetting in big picture terms. We are seeing significant negative headwind is, foreign exchange, we are seeing for example, average daily rates this year being negative because of foreign exchange, that's the translation of the foreign currencies to US dollars. And in general we are seeing more domestic travel on a worldwide basis, so our Russian volumes are more staying within Russia, and almost every single country we are seeing more travel locally, part of this is because of our expanding supply and becoming more relevant to local customers, and part of it we believe are because of uncertainty around currency movements et cetera. So currency is going to be a pretty significant headwind for us for the year, we baked it into our numbers so to speak, but we know it will be a challenge. Michael Millman : So, I assume that US hotel stays, more profitable for you than Europe hotel stay. If the numbers may cancel out, does the bottom line cancel out? Dara Khosrowshahi : I would generalize the international hotel stay is the most valuable because it tends to have longer length of stay, it tends to have lower cancellation rates. On a year-on-year basis, you're right, because of the dollar US stay this year is going to be stronger than international stay. And it's that foreign exchange that's putting a lot of pressure on some of those international stays, which is a headwind. That's a net headwind and it's going to hurt our finances going into 2015, so we have worked it into our forecast. Michael Millman : And switching to the oil prices, are there some places that the economy's been hurt so badly that it's affecting travel? Dara Khosrowshahi : You know what, once we are starting to see the signs of the impact of oil prices, we think is in the Nordic region and we've got a pretty big business in the Nordics under our Egencia business and we can see some signs of weakness there. And then certainly our Hotels.com business has got a really big presence in the Nordics. So far the volumes look decent, but the Norwegian currency has just taken a pretty significant hit recently, so on an actual dollar basis, it looks a lot worse. And that can persist for only sometime before you start to see some impact on leisure travel. So we're starting to see some signs, we're not exactly tied to oil and gas, there are certainly some FX issues there. But certainly there is something there. Operator : We'll go next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Andrew Boone : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Andrew Boone on for Ron. Just a quick question on Wotif. How long do you expect it to take to implement new Expedia's new booking tool at Wotif? I know you guys said 1H, but any more clarification there. And then just wondering if you guys are planning on continuing to charge a booking fee. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as the implementation goes, we are going to move over gradually. So for example, if you perform an international search on Wotif, that is already being covered by the Expedia technology platform. So we are making the front end technology implementation as we speak, but more importantly we are also integrating the supply platform and recontracting with some of the Wotif hotels. So it will be sometime in the first half, my guess it will be sometime in the second quarter, we can't be more exact than that. As far as booking fees et cetera, we haven't made final plans there. So nothing to speak of at this point. Mark Okerstrom : I would just add a quick point that if you just look back to the Travelocity implementation as well that once we get the business on to the new platform, there is also a period of optimization that you go through in sales and marketing and just on the site as well. And that optimization process will continue even through the second half of 2015. So just keep that in mind as well. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then when Mark was talking about the technology cost, for example, we are essentially paying double technology cost right now, we are integrating the Wotif technology at the same time the Wotif stack is up and running, so that relates to some of the trends that Mark talked about in his guidance. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital. Rohit Kulkarni : Great. Thank you. This is Rohit Kulkarni filling in for Mark. Just a big picture. Can you talk about how you are viewing your auxiliary or octagonal travel opportunities, be it vacation rentals or any new services, incremental services to travelers or hotel? And as a sub question, can you provide any updates or color around how your Home Away relationship is progressing? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, I'll say Rohit, we're very focused on our base business and we have more than enough on our plate. And we are very comfortable that the business is that we are in now, the core OTA business, the corporate business, the Wotif business, eLong in China, all have very long runways ahead of them. So right now, we are pretty squarely focused on the businesses at hand. Now, we are testing and learning. So for example, we're certainly testing and learning with Home Away, we are getting more and more bookable properties on to Expedia, we are giving the Home Away inventory more exposure. And at this point we don't have a final call on what it means, but it looks like the inventory is certainly attractive and it just looked like certain segment of our population and customer base likes that inventory and appreciates our showing them that inventory. At the same time, one new area that we are working on and I think in much better at is to upsell various parts of travel to our customers, so when a customer comes into by an Expedia air ticket, I think we are getting much better about upselling a car or upselling destination services, ground transport to that customer, ticket to a theme park et cetera. So all of these other travel opportunities, many, many of them are opportunities that we are servicing now and our focus is how can we cross sell those customers more stuff because those cross sell is typically our very, very high margins because you don't have to kind of reacquire those customers through third-party channels. So we certainly want to [indiscernible] but it's within the set of products that we are offering now and we are seeing very, very good experience there. Our are attached type revenue growth for us is really at record highs and we think there is much, much more to go. Rohit Kulkarni : Okay. And if I could ask one more. Any view on a lot of market cap is created in the private markets and the sharing economy space in particular. Do you have any view on whether you view them over the long term over the next two, three years as a potential partner or something that you would need to have a product in that particular space? Dara Khosrowshahi : I think we will look to partner up for that product at this point, obviously things may change, we may have a different viewpoint. For example, Home Away is an example of, well, it's not sharing product to some extent, it is a rental product, it's people sharing in one way and we are testing and learning actively and have 150,000 Home Away properties now offered on Expedia and understanding what the best treatment of that kind of inventory is. So we will be actively testing and learning, with think it will continue to be a compliment of our services and we will look to build those partnerships over time. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Hi. Thanks. First, could you talk a little bit more about your investment in supply It looks like you added, I think, ex eLong, maybe about 7,000 hotels this quarter and 5,000 last quarter. Is that a pace that you are happy with? And what do you expect that to look like going forward? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. We continue to, I would say, accelerate our acquisition of hotels. So you did observe an uptick. When you look overall on a year-on-year basis, we ex eLong for example, we increased our supply base by a little over 10%, which is not as fast as our room night growth. So we're sending more concentrated supply into our set of hotels. I think if you look forward to 2015, we do expect the year-on-year pace for new hotels added to the system to accelerate. Kevin Kopelman : Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up on the previous question, I think it was about vacation rental, just to clarify, you are saying you would rather partner in vacation rentals, in general, than build it out yourselves. Dara Khosrowshahi : Listen, I think it's too soon to tell. We are \u2013 really what we're working on right now is building up our core hotel inventory and in general we will look to augment that in inventory and partner up with additional inventory that creates value for our customers. If we find that there is a particular inventory type that's highly attractive that we should secure directly, we will look to do that. But at this point it's not a core part of our strategy. Mark Okerstrom : We have over the course of last number of years actually done some direct contract in vacation rentals around ski and deep destinations and of course we are concentrating that in areas where it's professionally managed online bookable, and really the only change of the story here is that we're testing with stuff that's a little bit more by owner and to the extent it works. We've got expertise in being able to market that on our websites. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Mark Okerstrom : Is there another question operator? Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Alan Pickerill : Alright, let\u2019s wrap it up. Thanks everybody for joining the call today. The replay will be available on the IR site shortly. Dara, any final closing comments? Dara Khosrowshahi : No, just thank you for joining us and big thanks to the Expedia, Inc. family for really, really good year and big welcome to the Travelocity, Wotif group et cetera. We\u2019re really excited about building these brands and building these assets with you. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Expedia Q1 2015 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President, Investor Relations at Expedia. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Expedia Inc.'s financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, April 30, 2015, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. With that, I'll hand the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. Expedia's off to a strong start this year, and we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver another year of solid results in a healthy travel environment. Aside from the worsening impact of FX translation on our results, our expectations for what we can deliver this year haven't changed. I'm particularly happy with our unit growth this quarter : global room nights up 32%, air tickets up 18% and car rental days up over 35%, all representing share gains in the overall travel market. The major brands in our core OTA segment are executing well and delivering good results. Revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by organic growth of Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and EAN as well as nice contributions from Travelocity and Wotif. I'm also pleased that the pace of hotel acquisition has accelerated in 2015. Excluding eLong inventory, we added almost 14,000 hotels on the first quarter, which represents a pace of acquisition more than twice as fast as the fourth quarter of last year. We expect to continue to grow our marketing management team and significantly increase our rate of innovation and supplier technology to drive ongoing acceleration of hotel property additions. The migration of the Wotif site onto the Expedia platform is substantially complete, a process that has taken less than 6 months end-to-end. We had many an employee give up late nights with their friends and family to make this happen, and we're thankful to all of the contributing Expedia Inc. employees, especially our new colleagues on the Wotif team for their efforts. Wotif is not yet a meaningful contributor to the bottom line due to negative FX trends, purchase accounting adjustments and elimination of certain consumer booking fees. However, we're pleased to have broadened Australian consumers' access to our global inventory. We're seeing early positive conversion trends as a result of our integration programs and expect the business to contribute more to profitability as we move through 2015 and into next year. We've also welcomed the Travelocity marketing teams into our business and are making good progress on migrating tools and approaches. In the near term, we plan to ramp up selling and marketing spend to build momentum for this brand, which is likely to put some pressure on adjusted EBITDA contribution from Travelocity this year. We are seeing double-digit transaction growth year-over-year and are pleased to see the strength of the Travelocity brand in action. Now I'm sure you're all interested in an update on the announced Orbitz transaction. The DOJ made a second request, and we're cooperating with them to make sure they have the information they need to enable them to complete their review by the end of the year. We believe the global travel market is huge and competition is fierce and that the transaction will benefit both competition and consumers. Beyond that, we don't have any additional information to share at this time. trivago continued to see very strong growth, generating stand-alone revenue of $119 million in the first quarter and $449 million on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to aggressively invest profits from more developed markets to drive brand recognition and global expansion in newer markets. Of particular note, trivago continues to gain in size and strength in the U.S., which now represents their largest market in terms of revenue generated. As a result of the increased investments that we made -- that we mentioned last quarter, eLong drove an acceleration on year-over-year room night growth in the first quarter compared to the growth rate in Q4 2014. Efforts in mobile and supply additions are bearing fruit with mobile growing triple digits overall and representing more than 65% of eLong brand room nights for the quarter. We're very supportive of the eLong management team, are pleased to see our investments start to bear fruit and remain confident that we can create real shareholder value through this asset. Lastly, Egencia saw very good year-over-year unit growth this quarter, essentially consistent with the pace of growth in Q4 and with strength in both the U.S. and Europe. Our new product introductions, such as our iPad app, have been met by enthusiasm by our existing and potential clients. Egencia continues to win new clients at an impressive rate on the back of its industry-leading technology, and we remain confident in its ability to continue to make share gains in the large and attractively managed corporate travel segment. Note that Egencia has a big European business and thus, is disproportionally impacted by FX headwinds. You can see that impact reflected in their reported gross bookings and revenue growth. In closing, while we're pleased with our early momentum, the year is young, and as usual, we have plenty of challenges to navigate. We're clear about our strategy and are fully in execution mode. With that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom: Thanks, Dara. Overall themes for Q1 performance are very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Once again, we saw strong performance from our core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia, offset by negative FX trends and ongoing headwinds on unit economics. As expected, the eLong team continued investing aggressively in China, which did put pressure on the consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Top line growth was again driven by solid unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth accelerated for all of our major brands relative to Q4 growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 32% year-over-year. Domestic room nights grew 23% in Q1, while international room nights were up 41%. We did get a 4 percentage point tailwind to global room night growth from the inorganic impact of Wotif and the consolidation of the AirAsia joint venture. Note that we also comped over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial agreement during the first quarter, so Q2 will be our first clean comp for that business. Revenue per room night was down 13.6% this quarter, while ADRs were down 2.5%. Roughly half of the decline in revenue per room night this quarter was driven by the negative impact of foreign currency. The other half included the impacts of the deliberate reductions in hotel margins to accelerate our global build-out of hotel room inventory and availability as well as efforts to drive consumer engagement and repeat business through our loyalty programs and other incentives. These are very consistent with the factors we have discussed in the past. Air revenue grew 9% on ticket growth of 18%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 7%. Ticket volume growth decelerated this quarter as we comped over the rollout of the Travelocity commercial deal in Q1 of last year. This headwind was partially offset by a 2 percentage point tailwind from consolidation of the AirAsia joint venture. On a normalized basis, air ticket growth, excluding Travelocity and AirAsia, accelerated nicely in the first quarter. Revenue per ticket was down as a result of foreign currency headwind, geographic mix and the renewal of certain airline deals in 2014. Our advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group has become quite large and is growing fast. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated over $0.5 billion of net advertising and media revenue, up 35% year-over-year. For the quarter, advertising and media revenue grew 23% net of intercompany amounts. We also continued to see healthy contributions from our car and insurance products. On the expense side, excluding eLong, we saw expense leverage across cost of revenue, selling and marketing, people cost and technology and content expense. Direct selling and marketing expense grew faster than revenue as expected. As was the case for Q4, general and administrative expenses also grew faster than revenue due primarily to about $8 million of due diligence and other deals costs, without which, the growth would have been more in line with previous quarters and leveraging nicely. The net result in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA growth of 25%, excluding eLong, and a decline of 5% year-over-year, including eLong. Note that adjusted earnings per share was negatively impacted this quarter by an unfavorable effective tax rate. As we mentioned on the last call, due to eLong losses for which we are not recording a tax benefit, we are forecasting an elevated effective tax rate for the full year. Specifically, assuming eLong losses continue at this quarter's level or higher, we expect the tax rate to be in the mid-30% range for the full year. For illustrative purposes, had we applied that rate to this quarter's results, adjusted EPS would have improved by approximately $0.08 per share. In terms of financial expectations for full year 2015, as Dara mentioned, with the exception of foreign currency trends working against us, we're happy with our year-to-date performance and remain optimistic about the year. As such, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, in line with our prior guidance range of 10% to 15%. Note that since the date of our Q4 call, we estimate that FX trends has worked against us by another approximately 200 basis points of full year adjusted EBITDA growth. And as such, we are a bit more cautious about where we will finish in this range. With respect to the shape of the year, again, specifically for Expedia, excluding eLong, I would like to reiterate that we expect the vast majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year. As we move into the balance of the year, we are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth on headwinds from lapping the Travelocity implementation, which are only partially offset by tailwinds from recent acquisitions. And our organic revenue growth rate remains subject to the unit economic pressures, which we have discussed. On the expense side, we continue to expect elevated technology and content expense growth as we digest recent acquisitions and invest behind further fortifying our core technology and infrastructure stack. In the second quarter, specifically, we'll have added pressure on adjusted EBITDA growth as we ramp selling and marketing expense to drive summer season revenue, a good portion of which will not be recognized until Q3 and beyond. Now moving away for guidance for Expedia, excluding eLong, to focus specifically on guidance for eLong stand-alone. ELong's adjusted EBITDA loss of $33 million in Q1 is indicative of the size and scale of the competitive efforts and investments required in that market. We expect the quarterly losses for eLong to be as large, if not, larger than the first quarter loss on a go-forward basis. eLong is a well-capitalized, publicly listed company with a distinct public market valuation, and we continue to encourage analysts and investors to model, analyze and report on eLong separately and to value our eLong position on a stand-alone basis. With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It looks like EBITDA for Expedia x eLong came in better than you guided a quarter ago. So just wondering, do you feel better about your organic trends? Or were there any onetime benefits in this quarter? And then secondly, certainly, your room nights accelerated. And then secondly, can you maybe help us a little bit on the factors that will drive EBITDA between the core growth, the Travelocity, AirAsia and Wotif? Just kind of walk us through how those will be plus and minuses this year. Mark D. Okerstrom: Sure. So in the first quarter, we did have good strength in the core business. It was a little bit better than our expectations. But as a reminder, Q1 is a super small quarter. We don't manage the business by quarter, and so from quarter-to-quarter, we can have the shift of some ad spend. And certainly, that happened in the first quarter. With respect to factors that'll drive core EBITDA, excluding eLong on a go-forward basis, really, the big driver there is strength in the core OTA business. This business lives or dies by the strength of Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, EAN, and really, that's the big driver. I mean, we will get some help from Travelocity and Wotif, but as Dara mentioned in his remarks, we don't expect Wotif, for example, to be a big driver or a driver really until the back half of the year. And with our plans for ramping up sales and marketing to build momentum at Travelocity, in addition to the momentum they've already got, we do expect again that benefit to largely come in the back half of the year as well. Operator : We will go now to Tom White with Macquarie. Thomas Cauthorn White - Macquarie Research : I guess, if I look at the take rate in your core OTA segment, it looks like the declines on a year-over-year basis sort of moderated a bit in the first quarter. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how we should think about that over the next year or 2? And then just a follow-up. EBITDA at trivago, it looks like there was a nice little EBITDA profit in the first quarter. Has that business kind of scaled to a size where we can expect kind of positive EBITDA in the first couple of quarters of the year? If I recall, typically, they've kind of generated the bulk of their EBITDA later in the year. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes. So in the core OTA segment, we did see the model work, and again, we're not really managing this business to adjusted EBITDA margins. That's not the goal. But we did see those margins level out quite nicely, and really, that's just the model and the target P&L working, control on fixed costs and really driving as much marketing contribution as we can through that part of the business. I would just caution everyone again that a quarter does not a business make. It's a highly seasonal business, and I think, particularly in Q1, it's hard to draw any conclusions. In terms of trivago, we did have a nice profit in Q1. A few things driving that. One is the business continues to perform very well, both in its core European markets, but also in the U.S. And the performance, at least on the revenue line, did exceed the expectations a bit in the first quarter. And there's also, with trivago, as you can imagine given the amount of -- particularly television advertising spend that they do, they can also be heavily influenced from quarter-to-quarter by the timing of spend. And there was a bit of timing-related goodness, if you will, in the first quarter as well. Dara Khosrowshahi : Tom, this is Dara. In reference to your question as well, if you're asking about revenue margin and the comps Q1 versus Q1, remember that last year we were just ramping up Travelocity. So we were having bookings come in, and revenue was being recognized in Q2. This year, we had bookings from Q4 staying in Q1. So we didn't have kind of that negative revenue margin factor working this year. So it's really more of a comps issue than any other fundamental issue one way or the other. Operator : We go to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : You said you've largely completed the migration of Wotif onto Expedia platform. Was the cadence there as expected? I know you said you worked really hard at getting it done. And then can we extrapolate analogous timelines for integration, Travelocity systems and tools? And would Orbitz look the same if and when that occurs? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as Wotif goes, it was, I'd say, a little bit better than expected. I think the team performed very well and really worked hard to get it done, and kudos to them. Note that we moved over Wotif.com, but their elements of the business, such as lastminute.au (sic) [lastminute.com.au], Asia Web Direct, that haven't been fully migrated yet. So there is still some work ahead of us, although that work is also very much on a good track. As far as Travelocity goes, the Travelocity migration in general is by no means simple, but it is simpler in that the site has already been migrated. Now what we're doing is really wiring up the marketing systems data, et cetera, so that the Travelocity team can work with the same analytical and marketing tool sets that we have available to our other brands. That work is moving along nicely and should be largely complete within the month. As far as Orbitz goes, no real update one way or the other. Obviously, we're in the middle of the DOJ process, so the amount of information we have and plans, et cetera, are not fully fleshed out. I would also remind you that the Orbitz business is a considerably more complicated business. There are a lot of different business lines, Orbitz for Business, et cetera, so it's a more complex business. And we think that some of the capabilities that the Orbitz business and team have are pretty impressive. And so I think that it's going to be really taking the best of breed and combining some of what they do really well with some of what we do really well. So I think that one will probably be a longer process, and it deserves to be a longer process. But first, we have to get there with the DOJ. Operator : We go to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Two questions please. I think it was Mark. You had said something about you were seeing x eLong leverage in sales and marketing. Could you put some context around that for us and say whether we should expect to see leverage in sales and marketing x eLong going forward? And then secondly, could you talk about -- or Dara, could you talk about the impact on bookings, the transactional impact on bookings on FX? And what I mean by that is given these currency moves, so you're just seeing the same sort of demand, but just, European travelers are going to Greece instead of Manhattan. Is that the kind of shift you're seeing, so the dollars are still there? Or are you actually seeing an impact on transactional demand, like just cutting back of vacation package spending? Mark D. Okerstrom: Mark, specifically, what I was referencing was sales and marketing people. Sales and marketing in total is deleveraging, and direct sales and marketing specifically is deleveraged -- deleveraging. And I would actually say, in terms of sales and marketing people, it's not something that we are expecting nor planning to leverage on particularly this year. The -- one of the large components of that line item is our hotel market management team, and we are ramping up that team pretty aggressively and also lapping over some ramp-up last year. Dara, do you want to take the other one? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. As far as the transactional impacts go, we are definitely seeing a very nice acceleration of U.S. volumes to international markets. That is those numbers were quite positive and continue to accelerate, so Q1 was a very strong quarter for Americans taking advantage of the strong dollar and exploring the world so to speak. And as far as international mix goes, we absolutely do see a higher mix of Europeans taking vacations in Europe. Our beach market package business, for example, is up quite significantly, and we're seeing the same thing with our Asian consumers. In general, we are seeing a mix shift to more local hotels, lower-star hotels, which are typically kind of more domestic-type travelers. Length of stay comes down a little bit. But in general, those trends are, I'd say, positive for us because we are starting to penetrate into domestic and regional travel market, where I would say we are relatively underpenetrated. The biggest negative factor that we see obviously with international bookings is a translation effect. And that's just the negative on revenue, and it's a negative on earnings. And it's something that so far we've been able to overcome, but it will be a challenge for us. Operator : We go to Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Can you talk a little bit about Hotwire and how that business is performing? And then second question on mobile. Can you provide some incremental insight into either bookings growth there or installed base in terms of apps that you have out there? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as Hotwire goes, I think no significant trends to call out there. The business continues to be challenged. Traffic trends are, in general, looking better and more positive. Revenue per transaction is challenged, especially on the hotel side, where we have -- had to take out some margin dollars in order to give consumers the kind of discounts that they expect in a -- what's a strong market. We are seeing -- we have moved over the Hotwire air path onto the Brand Expedia platform, and we are testing out the Brand Expedia retail hotel platform on Hotwire. And we're seeing some early positive signs there, so that makes us hopeful. And we are launching a new ad campaign for Hotwire in Q2. It will be an EBITDA headwind, but we are quite positive about the ad campaign and expect it to introduce more consumers to the Hotwire brand, which we think fundamentally is still a good brand and a good product. So we're hopeful, but at this point, the business is still on a negative trend from a profitability basis, obviously, made up by some of our other brands. As far as mobile goes, I'd say no necessarily incremental insight one way or the other. It's -- the teams are executing. They continue to execute. Mobile app installs are on a nice trend for all of the brands. In general, mobile web for us now is growing at very significant levels, and we are expanding our mobile product as well. So for example, car rental product is now available on the Expedia mobile app. Hotwire continues to improve its car rental product on the app as well. So the app has turned into a really important channel for us, but it's more business than usual than anything. And of course, we are all excited about the Apple Watch, et cetera. We've got our presence there as far as apps go, and we'll be tracking that and hopefully, talking a bit more about that as we gather more data. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : And just a quick follow-up. With regard to the investment in Decolar in Latin America, how does it affect your presence in that geography on a stand-alone basis? Dara Khosrowshahi : Well, it's not going to have any impact on us on a stand-alone basis. The Hotels.com team, as far as our owned and operator brand, has the strongest presence in South America, Brand Expedia gone in a few years ago. And Decolar and Despegar are -- it's our having a stake in a set of very, very strong brands, the strongest brands in what's a very large marketplace. It's $100-plus billion marketplace. The LatAm marketplace, obviously, going through some near-term difficulties, but we think long term, it'll be strategic. And the investment was about lining ourselves up with a great management team and a great brand. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes. I think the only thing I would add to that is that Decolar, Despegar does have a great and growing supply base in Latin America, and we do expect at some point here over the next year or so to start sharing inventory more actively and potentially getting access to that inventory. And I think that could definitely help our stand-alone prospects in the region as well as well as help Despegar, big win-win. Dara Khosrowshahi : And of course, we are powering Despegar, the Despegar hotel business in the Americas and international, and we think that volume will be a welcome addition to our hotel partners, especially, for example, in markets like New York and Miami. Operator : We'll go now to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Two things. First, just the room nights growth accelerating, so obviously, healthy here. Can you just talk a little bit more about how much loyalty programs are driving and then also, to the extent that you continue to use lower hotel margins as well? And then secondly, Mark, could you just clarify on the 2Q sales and marketing spend, is there anything else that's different here than what you typically do during this busy quarter beyond the pickup in Travelocity spend? Mark D. Okerstrom: Thanks for the question, Doug. The loyalty programs, particularly the Hotels.com loyalty program, is a big factor and a growing factor in terms of the volume of business that they're getting from that program. That obviously shows up as a contra revenue line item, and you can kind of back into some rough, rough numbers based on some of our disclosures in terms of impact on revenue per room night. And so that's a great piece of business, however. It's business that generally involves high-spending, loyal customers who come through more direct channels, and ultimately, when we look through to the bottom line, we would say we definitely want more of that business as opposed to less of that business. In terms of our hotel margins, listen, the -- there's certainly going to be an impact of lower hotel margins on room night growth. Of course, we have no idea what in fact that impact is. But as a reminder, we are lowering our hotel margins to essentially just be competitive with the local market conditions, and that encourages new hotels to sign up with us and our existing hotels to give us more attractive inventory because they view us as a more attractive channel to distribute through. And in return, that just gives our customers much better product essentially and opens up different marketing channels for us. So there's definitely a connection there. It's hard to draw it completely. With respect to 2Q sales and marketing spend, as I mentioned, there was some timing shift between Q1 and Q2, a little bit of trivago and a number of other brands as well. Travelocity is going to be a factor. Wotif may also be a factor in the quarter. And then, of course, you do definitely have to be ordinary issue of in a growing and particularly accelerating business you have a mismatch between sales and marketing spend and revenue, and it can create some mismatches in profit from quarter-to-quarter. Operator : We go to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So 2 maybe. One on the property additions. Wanted to understand a little bit better there, maybe some color on what drove the acceleration in property additions across all of your brands and how you're thinking about that from a global landscape going out over the next sort of 1 to 2 years. And second, maybe on the marketing side, coming at it from a different angle. The ROIs you're seeing from your marketing dollars today, maybe how you see those evolving by channel, where you might be pushing in or maybe pulling some marketing spend back as you see those ROIs evolve not only across channel but maybe even across regions. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as property additions go, listen, this is part of the, I'd say, formula that we have been setting up. We knew that there will be an upfront cost to hiring the headcount, training the headcount and the field sales force, and to some extent, we bore those costs last year. And now you're seeing a combination of those market managers being trained up and effective. We have improved and invested in our technology so that we can onboard hotels faster when we sign them up and also, linking up that onboarding to our marketing channels, especially our variable marketing channels so that we can produce for the hotels that we signed up even more quickly after a sign-up. So the acceleration was expected, and this is something that we continue to expect to see for the balance of the year. And as you know, there are thousands and thousands more hotels that we can wire up on a global basis, so we think that this is just the beginning of a multi-year journey. As far as marketing ROIs go, I would say that there hasn't been significant shifts one way or the other as far as overall ROIs. We continue to, on variable channels, bid on the various channels based on expected revenue from those channels. Foreign exchange trends in U.S. dollars has, in general, taken down the amount that we can bid, let's say, for foreign demand because average revenue per transaction is coming down in U.S. dollar terms. But from an efficiency standpoint, we are just as aggressive as we have been in the past. I'd say that some of the channel shift that we had seen in the past over the 2, 3 years of the variable channels growing as a percentage of our direct channels, some of that channel shift is slowing down a bit. Our variable channels continue to grow quickly, but our brand channels, Mark made the comment on loyalty previously, the repeat part of our business is growing faster now than it was growing 2, 3 years ago. So the mix shift that we talked to you previously is probably easing up a bit. That's not necessarily good or bad news because we always want to be able to allocate as much marketing money as we can efficiently to the variable channels. But it certainly is good to see the direct channels growing faster than they have been historically, and hopefully, it'll keep going. Operator : We go now to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : It wouldn't be an Expedia quarter if I didn't ask the organic growth question, so I'll just make it a tradition here. So it seems like there's 4 things impacting the growth for -- x eLong. The -- there's Wotif, the second part of Travelocity, the acquired portion, AirAsia and then the negative $5 million from the restructuring. So do I have those all right, a? And then, b, can you just walk us through the contribution to EBITDA, if at all, from those 4 in the quarter? That's all. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes. Thanks for the consistency and the question, Ross. The inorganic impact from acquisition this quarter was actually slightly negative. We had purchase accounting adjustments where we were unable to recognize prebooked merchant revenue essentially that we required, and that happened at Wotif, Travelocity as well as AirAsia. I would then sort of lump into that the $8 million of deal costs, and it puts it solidly into the negative. So the story that you saw in Q1 was indeed an organic story, and as we said in the prepared remarks and Dara mentioned subsequently, again, we don't expect there to be a significant tailwind on profitability, if you will, from Wotif and Travelocity really until we move through the back part of Q2 and into the back part of this year. So it's -- our story this year, despite the headlines on acquisitions, very much is an organic story. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Q2 will have some more purchase accounting as well, so Q2 won't be a \"clean quarter\". And the second half, you'll see the EBITDA come through more cleanly. Operator : We go to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division : I wanted to ask more of a high-level question, maybe to Dara just talking about Expedia's overall core strategy given the investments in the U.S. and Asia with Wotif and AirAsia and then LatAm with Decolar and the Despegar. So wondering if you think -- what else is needed here, maybe trivago is the answer in Europe. But do you think you need more things in Europe? Or are you just still in -- or now you're in execution mode given you've got so much supply? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think -- listen, there is no \"need\" at this point. We are very happy with the portfolio of brands that we have. The core brands, the Expedia, the Hotels.com, trivago, Egencia are global in nature, and essentially, we will want to operate everywhere in the world with those core brands. And we're complementing those core brands with some more local brands, right? The Travelocity brand is going to be a mostly U.S. entity, and Wotif is going to be an Australian entity, et cetera. So the strategy for us is set, we will always be opportunistic from an acquisition standpoint. We definitely want to get bigger in the corporate travel segment, and we're doing so organically with Egencia. But we will continue to look for acquisitions in that segment. We think it's a terrific segment, and we have a great team and a great technology. But in general, we are very happy with our portfolio, and Mark and his corp dev team will continue to sniff out opportunity and strike when they see one. Operator : We go to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : So following up on some related questions about your accelerated new hotels. Can you talk about to what extent you have, I guess, a fear of a middle man being squeezed? And to what extent do you have a fear of Amazon and Google and then maybe others getting involved? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. Listen, you always fear, to some extent, when you have entities like Amazon and Google somewhat involved in the business that you're in. You'd be stupid not to worry about it. That said, Google has been in the travel business for a long time, and they have been a partner of ours for a long time. They certainly have market power, and the European entities are talking to them about that market power. And that's something that should be addressed. But we are a middle man that adds value or a middle person that adds value. These are -- the hotel business is incredibly fragmented. We are making global demand available to these hoteliers through our marketing channels. We think on the technology side, we can add very significant value as far as building great consumer experiences. And at this point, we are seeing our transactional growth and unit growth accelerating, so from my standpoint, we are a middle person who is getting more valuable and certainly not getting squeezed. Now that said, as we scale and as the Internet becomes more ubiquitous, we do have to drive our cost of operations down, and so you are seeing that in our revenue margins. It is something that is tough to execute. It is tough financially. But we've done it for a number of years, and the team understands the task at hand. And the lower we drive those margins, the harder we make it for third parties to get into our business. Fat pigs get slaughtered. And I think that we're in pretty darn good shape, and we're going to get in better shape on a go-forward basis. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : And to touch on something, maybe the competition on the car rental. To what extent in the U.S. is the opaque business gone? I mean, companies keep talking about not offering up any opaque. And to what extent can you offset that with non-opaque reservations? And to what extent you're seeing your car availability now? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think that to say that the opaque business is gone would be a giant exaggeration. But specific to the car rental business, the percentage of bookings that are opaque, as a percentage of our overall bookings, are down on a year-on-year basis. We are seeing an offset to that on the retail side. Our revenue per transaction on retail in general in car is lower than opaque, so that does provide a bit of a revenue headwind. But we're making the adjustments. And end-to-end, we are about marketing product to our consumers however they want to consume that product. Sometimes, it'll be opaque during certain cycles. Sometimes, it'll be retail, and we're making the adjustments that we need to. Operator : We go to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Could you just like give us an update on your thinking on vacation rentals? Do you think this is -- vacation rentals are an important market for Expedia to be in? If so, how are you addressing it? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. I think -- listen, I think vacation rentals are an important market. It's an important product in many, many markets. As to whether it's important for Expedia to be in, that remains to be determined. We have a good relationship with Home Away. We're actually pretty excited about adding their inventory on an international basis, especially in Europe, where that business in general or that product is a bit more popular. And we continue to test and learn with them, and we're hoping that we hit upon a vein and are able to really up our volume in the vacation rental side of the equation. At this point, it's something that we're testing and learning, and we haven't quite hit that vein yet. So is it growing? Yes. But is it significant in our portfolio? Not yet, and we'd like it to be more significant going down the line. Operator : We go to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : In some of the industry data that's come out over the last -- I mean, really last few months but even the last couple of days showing strength in ADRs in Europe, curious how directly that is -- you see that impacting the business. And as you look at the drivers, at least within your business, behind that, whether that seems to be more a function of Europeans staying local, inbound traffic either from the U.S. or Asia taking advantage of the currency. Would appreciate sort of any insight you can share there. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes, happy to, Heath. Listen, generally, I'd say that strength in ADRs is a great thing for our business. Now as it relates to Europe right now of course, for us, being a U.S. reported issuer, it's well offset by the FX impact in terms of our results. But I think there are a few things that are possibly driving that. We certainly are seeing, as Dara mentioned, more traffic going from the U.S. into European destinations. We are also seeing more Europeans staying in Europe but then also staying in their local country. So you've essentially got everyone descending on Europe, and I think that's just creating, obviously, more demand for the product. Dara Khosrowshahi : I'd also add that from an Egencia standpoint, we're seeing the European business spend actually pretty healthy. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think the weak euro is definitely a nice element for European business spend. And again, from a translation basis, as Mark said, it doesn't look so good, but you talk to the Egencia local team and other than, for example, Norway, which is being hit by the oil prices, they feel very, very good and the business is doing quite well. Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And so as Europeans -- I mean, I guess, to the extent Europeans are staying local more, are you seeing -- and Americans are taking advantage of lower currency benefit, are you seeing less travel into the U.S. or an impact on the U.S. side of business at all? Dara Khosrowshahi : The European volumes to the U.S. are positive, but they're growing slower than U.S. volumes into Europe and even U.S. volumes into the U.S. Now -- and that's a key for us, which is U.S. to U.S. even is pretty strong. The U.S. consumer feels pretty good. Obviously, our businesses are gaining share. U.S. to Europe is going very well. Europe to U.S. is losing share but still positive. Operator : We go to Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : The first one, I guess, just to go back on the strong room night growth. You said accelerating across all 4 brands, and then you mentioned loyalty. Any other factors you would call out that's driving that acceleration? Are you seeing conversion change? Any other things you'd call out to drive the acceleration? And then the second one, just on the lowering of the hotel margins to be more competitive. Can you just talk us through a little bit the strategy kind of process there? Is it a situation where you were previously priced above the local player and now you're coming in line with them? Are you undercutting the local player? Just kind of run us through the strategy there. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. As far as the room night growth and acceleration goes, the key here is that there's no magic bullet. It is the combination of a number of different activities going across the business and essentially everybody doing their jobs well. If you really want to simplify the core of room night growth, it's dependent on 3 factors : how much traffic are you bringing in; how are you converting that traffic; and really, what your repeat rate is. And our -- the traffic growth for the businesses is healthy and in general, has been either generally healthy and/or improving. Conversion has -- continues to increase both for Hotels.com and Expedia, and that is a better website, in general more repeat customers and stronger supply, including the new hotels that we're adding on a local basis. So conversion is positive. And then repeat rate, in general, is positive as well as a higher percentage of our bookings come from repeat customers. We're essentially going out, acquiring new customers, converting them to repeat customers through either their experience, which is a good experience or through loyalty programs. And then you rinse and repeat. And you use those profits to go out and acquire new customers. So it is all of those factors coming together to combine for a healthy room night. Q1 was certainly a number that we're happy with, and hopefully, we can keep our room night growth growing at healthy rates on a go-forward basis. As far as the hotel margins go, in general, we were at higher levels than our competition, especially in Europe and some of the Asia-Pacific markets, and we've moved our margins to be more competitive with some of the local players there. And as we've moved the margins to be more competitive, the hoteliers, the local hoteliers are talking to us, and obviously, they know our brands. They see the amount of demand that we're bringing into the country. They see the amount of foreign travelers that we can bring in, and as a result, the sales calls are more successful, a higher percentage of the time than they were. And we have more feet on the street. So it was, again, an investment that we had to make, kind of an upfront investment. We had to make a bet that the volume will come, and so far, the bet is working out well. But we have a lot of execution to go forward to keep making it work. Operator : We go now to Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Couple of questions. First, on the -- in your company eliminations, I think that was 39% of trivago in the quarter versus about 29% last year. Can you just talk about that increase? And are you shifting marketing spend away from other channels to trivago? And second, if you can just clarify maybe if you have it, the international organic FX-neutral bookings growth. Mark D. Okerstrom: Yes, Aaron, thanks for the question. The driver of the, I guess, share gains of the Expedia brands -- and trivago is a combination of a few factors. I would say the primary driver is really the factors that Dara explained. It's core execution by our businesses that enable them to do better in variable channels. And I think if you look across a number of channels, trivago included, generally, our brands, the big brands are doing better and are able to take share in those channels. Another factor there is as we continue to build out our hotel base and we add more properties, one of the first places you could see that pickup is in meta-search channels. We're able to drive traffic directly to those properties. I think the third factor is trivago has been expanding very aggressively into the U.S. And Dara mentioned in his prepared remarks that the U.S. is their biggest market now by revenue. And that plays directly into our strength. We have great brands in the U.S. We've got great supply, and so it enables us to do very well in that channel. In terms of FX impact on international gross bookings, it's about 15 percentage points, and we're not going to break out organic versus inorganic at this point. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Pickerill, to close the call. Alan Pickerill : Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. A replay of the call should be available shortly on the IR site. Dara, any closing thoughts? Dara Khosrowshahi : No, just thank you very much to all the Expedia Inc. employees who made the first quarter happen, and we're looking forward to hosting you next quarter. Operator : This concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation.",

LLC Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar Research Operator : Good day, and welcome to Expedia's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President, Investor Relations at Expedia. Please go ahead. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Expedia Inc.'s financial results conference call for second quarter ended June 30, 2015. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations. The following discussion including responses to questions reflects management's views as of today, July 30, 2015, only, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on the call today are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck. Please note that we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale, in order to allow investors to compare our results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results. Our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense also excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation expense, and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. And with that, let me turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Alan. Second quarter was another solid quarter for Expedia. We once again saw healthy unit trends across products, with global room nights up 35%, air tickets up 26%, and car rental days up 35% year-on-year. We were pleased with the revenue growth of 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% for the quarter. Our core OTA segment continued to perform well, led by strong top line growth for brand Expedia and Hotels.com, our two biggest businesses. We also saw healthy revenue growth from Travelocity and EAN, along with an inorganic tailwind from Wotif and our AirAsia/Expedia joint venture, which we now consolidate as a result of increasing our ownership stake to 75%. Of particular note, we continue to see very good growth rates for Travelocity even as we anniversary the ramp-up of that business last year. We're also optimistic about Wotif's potential to grow organically over time, despite near term FX headwinds, now that it's fully integrated into the Expedia platform and with the team starting to iterate on the site and on marketing channels. As was the case last year, we continued to see strong progress in new hotel property acquisition around the world with approximately 27,000 additional properties this quarter, including some recently integrated Wotif properties. This is a significant milestone as we now have added more properties in the first half of 2015 than we did in all of 2014. We've got a very long runway here and we expect to spend the next several years building out our global lodging inventory. From a technology perspective, we recently completed a move \u2013 a project move, Venere, onto the Hotels.com platform. This is similar to our efforts in the last few years to extend the Brand Expedia platform to brands such as Travelocity and Wotif. We now have a global full service OTA platform in brand Expedia and a global merchant agency standalone hotel platform in Hotels.com, each capable of powering additional brands. Based on our experience thus far, we believe that these two platforms represent unique competitive assets which can be leveraged to draw further top and bottom line growth going forward. We continue to invest heavily in our technology capabilities to round out our service offerings, adding car rentals and activities to the Brand Expedia mobile app, adding the cruise product on to the new platform for Travelocity and innovating a supply facing technologies such as real-time reviews, which allow our hotel partners to receive feedback from travelers live during their stay to improve the overall guest experience. Regarding the announced Orbitz transaction, we don't have any significant additional news to share today. We continue to cooperate with the DOJ, providing information and answering questions. We continue to believe that the transaction should be approved and then close in the back half of the year. trivago continued to see very strong growth, generating standalone revenue of $143 million in the second quarter and $487 million on a trailing 12-month basis. trivago generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of about $9 million in Q2, pretty consistent with the second quarter of last year, as we continued to invest aggressively in selling and marketing and as we moved into the busy part of the travel shopping cycle. We expect to continue to invest profits from higher margin markets into developing markets in order to grow trivago globally. A note on China, although we did sell our ownership stake in eLong in the second quarter, I want to be clear that we're still participating in the huge long-term growth opportunity that China represents. We have ongoing commercial agreements which give us access to the outbound Chinese travelers of Ctrip and eLong and expect both to bear fruit over the near and long term. Hotels.com and EAN are growing fast in China, although off of a small base, and Brand Expedia has a presence in Hong Kong with more to come in the region. We expect to continue to invest to build our long term prospects in China, and although our exposure to the domestic Chinese travel market is reduced for the near term, we were pleased to be able to draw substantial value creation for our shareholders through the eLong transaction. In closing, I'd like to thank our teams around the world for all of their efforts and in doing so celebrate for a moment a very good first half of the year. We must remain focused on driving strong execution and great innovation. There's still a lot of work ahead of us and competition remains as fierce as ever. With that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Dara. One quick note before I get started. As mentioned earlier, we sold our 62% stake in eLong on May 22. Financial results for eLong are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date. To aid in comparability and to focus on the parts of the business that will be ongoing, our comments today focus on Expedia Inc. results excluding eLong. The overall trajectory of the business remains very strong, as has been the case for some time now, with the second quarter results broadly consistent with Q1 trends and a bit better than we had expected. Strength across our breadth of leading brands and across geographies continues with rare exception. Our core OTA segment, trivago and Egencia are all having solid years with strong execution and good financial results. Top-line growth was again driven by robust unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth remains strong for all of our major brands relative to Q1 growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 35% year-over-year an acceleration from 32% growth last quarter. Domestic room nights grew 24% in Q2, while international room nights were up 50%. The inorganic impact from Wotif and the consolidation of the AirAsia/Expedia joint venture added approximately 7 percentage points to global room night growth this quarter. For comparison, last quarter excluding eLong, inorganic impacts drove over 5 percentage points of room night growth. Revenue per room night was down just under 16% this quarter while ADRs were down almost 6%. The factors influencing our room night economics are largely the same as they have been for quite a while now. Foreign currency accounted for a little less than half of the decline in revenue per room night, while deliberate reductions in hotel margins and the impact of our loyalty programs and other incentives accounted for the rest. We continue to be happy to trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and scale. Air revenue grew 14% on ticket growth of 26%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 10%. We saw a significant acceleration in air ticket growth from Brand Expedia this quarter on the back of the consolidation of the AirAsia/Expedia joint venture, along with continued strong performance as the team innovates on the platform. Excluding inorganic impacts, ticket growth would have been 20%, a nice acceleration from Q1. Our Advertising and media business, which is made up of trivago and our Media Solutions group, continued growing nicely with trivago growing standalone revenue 37% and net revenue after intercompany eliminations 25%. On a standalone FX neutral basis, we estimate that trivago revenues were up 67% year-over-year. On the expense side, we saw significant leverage and cost of revenue and technology and content expenses. Note that technology and content expense growth was lower than we expected, largely due to lower-than-forecast head count, higher capitalization rates, and to a lesser extent the timing of some R&D tax credits. Going forward, we are expecting more elevated year-over-year growth in tech and content expense. General and administrative expenses grew faster than revenue, primarily due to about 6 percentage points of growth from increased M&A related costs and an additional 7 percentage points from the inorganic impact of recent acquisitions. Absent these impacts, G&A would have grown about 11% and leveraged nicely. Direct selling and marketing grew faster than revenue as we continued to invest aggressively to drive global growth and ramp spend ahead of the busy travel season. Indirect selling and marketing costs grew slightly faster than revenue as we continue to scale up our lodging supply team. The net result was adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% for the second quarter. From a cash and capital deployment perspective, we issued a \u20ac650 million bond at a coupon of 2.5% in the second quarter, with an eye towards financing a portion of the pending Orbitz transaction. We are also happy to announce a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend, payable in the third quarter to $0.24 per share. Our approach to capital deployment remains the same, and we will continue to balance the allocation of our cash flow between opportunistic M&A and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In terms of financial expectations for full year 2015, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for Expedia excluding eLong in line with our prior guidance range of 10% to 15%. Though Q2 came in a bit better than expected, we plan to put that upside back into the business mostly in Q3 to drive continued growth. And as a reminder, our guidance this quarter comes with the same caveats as last quarter. We remain cautious about where we will fall in our guidance range, due primarily to significant remaining foreign currency headwinds, which have gotten slightly worse since our Q1 call. Please note that other than some heightened legal and professional fees we are currently carrying, our financial expectations do not take into account material impacts of the potential Orbitz transaction. In addition to integration costs, consolidation of Orbitz's results could result in a negative near-term impact on our consolidated financial results, due to the impact of purchase accounting rules which disallow the recognition of deferred revenue which is on the books of the acquired company prior to closing. Finally, I will also note that primarily as a result of selling our stake in eLong, we were able to lower our expectations for our full-year effective tax rate to a more normalized mid-20% range. With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to line up for questions? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. Maybe two questions. First, it looks like you've really been able to accelerate room nights, and is that primarily just your tech platform generating higher ROI or better conversion rates? Anything you want to kind of call out there, maybe supply is helping. And then, on the competitive side, a lot of noise out there about TripAdvisor and Google taking bookings, how do you view that? Can you participate? And do you see that as a potential headwind down the road? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Justin. As far as the room night acceleration, I'd say it's a game of inches and a lot of inches coming together. It certainly starts with the websites and the websites' ability to convert. If you don't have a great website that's very easy to use, easy to understand, you're nowhere in this business. So it does start with that. But we have our marketing teams always looking for new demand veins that we can reach on an affordable basis and it's really the website and those marketing teams working together that have been able to get us to a state of accelerated room nights growth for some period of time. And we have no reason to think that that's going to change. I think the other two factors that you would add to it that are a bit more recent are obviously the addition of new hotel supply, 27,000 hotels. As we are going down the line in bringing in new hotels, on average they tend to be smaller hotels, so the contribution per hotel is something that we would expect to come down over a period of time, but obviously the number of hotels that we are adding has increased. There's some cannibalization in larger markets, but we think the new hotels are certainly a nice positive for us. And the last factor that I discuss is that we are seeing an increased percentage of our business in general coming from repeat customers. We've been investing very aggressively in our loyalty programs and our customer service to keep customers coming back. It is those repeat customers that account for the majority of the profit of the company. And that repeat customer base has been growing as we've been investing in those customers as we've been growing our loyalty programs and increasing the benefits there. So every part of what I described plays a part in the growth. It's about the site, it's about marketing, it's about supply and it's about repeat. And when you get it all right, you get a pretty good formula. For the time being we have it right and we have to very much stay on our toes to keep competitive in this marketplace, because there are a lot of players competing for that customer attention. As far as TripAdvisor and Google building out booking capability et cetera, listen, this is nothing new. It's something that has gone on for some time, as you know, as far as TripAdvisor goes. We do participate in the TripAdvisor marketplace as an advertiser. We are not participating in trip Instant Book. So from a theoretical standpoint, we are getting a smaller addressable market in the TripAdvisor marketplace and my guess is a lot of that market is going to the hotels direct. That's not new. And that's a headwind that we've been facing but it's a headwind that we've navigated pretty well and we're hoping to navigate on a go-forward basis. And in general, our business with TripAdvisor is growing. We do see Google make some moves in the area. And I'd say one difference that we see with the Google treatment of the bookings is that the Google treatment tends to be much more clear that the booking is actually with the OTA and Google is not the merchant, et cetera. It's really making the payment process easier rather than trying to own the customer one way or the other. So we do anticipate testing out with Google and testing out some of the other treatments and seeing how it affects our customers and our customer satisfaction and our economics in general. Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Next to Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Yeah, thanks. TripAdvisor spoke about seeing some CPC weakness in its international geographies. As ad buyers you should be seeing a net benefit of that. So any comment you can provide there would be helpful. And then, I had a question on in terms of travel conditions in Europe and what you are seeing there. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Naved. Listen, we \u2013 if I just focus on Europe, we're not seeing real changes in the local currency CPC environment. Most major geographies are seeing CPC increases. When we look at trivago, they are seeing broadly speaking across Europe, CPC increases. Certainly the foreign exchange impact makes those look worse on translated basis, but again in local currency we continue to see a healthy environment. CPC is up, ADR is up, occupancies look strong. And really that rolls into the travel conditions in Europe. We are continuing to see similar trends to what we mentioned last quarter, which is we're seeing an increased mix of European travel staying in Europe and the addition of an increased propensity of Americans to travel into Europe and across the board, I think with a few obvious exceptions in Southern Europe, we're seeing a lot of health in the European market. Thanks. Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : And then, anything to add with respect to better ad efficiency on TripAdvisor? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: We don't like to comment on specific efficiencies in specific channels. I would say that we continue to be broadly happy with the efficiencies we're seeing across all channels and we haven't seen a marked change really across the board. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Maybe happy, maybe broadly unhappy or happy. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Instantly mildly unhappy. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, it continues to be a competitive marketplace. Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : We go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Dara, you talked a little bit about the China outbound opportunity and Expedia is still part of that. Could you talk about how interesting of a market that is, call it in the next three to five years? Is that the largest outbound market that a global travel provider like Expedia is likely to look at and frame it as an opportunity for us? And then, just talk briefly about vacation rentals, any new updated thinking on that opportunity for Expedia? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. Sure. As far as just the sheer scale and the size of that market as an outbound market, it's one of the top markets for us and I think for any travel provider out there. I think that the Chinese customer is quite different in what they're looking for in their behavior and their device mix. So I think that it is a market that in general has been difficult to reach for Western companies. That doesn't make it impossible, but it has been difficult to reach for Western companies. And as a result, we see our exposure going forward being partially organic through the building up of some of the brands that we have there and then through partnership. Partnership with eLong and Ctrip in certain aspects of the business and then our EAN business going out and offering our global inventory, both on a standalone basis and on a package basis. And you can imagine that the Chinese outbound business is quite package-related and our ability to offer package inventory on a global basis with the kind of scope that we have has proven to be quite interesting to local Chinese travel providers and we see the partnership opportunities there already pretty strong and we think we've got a lot of runway ahead of us. So this is not a one-year thing. It's a multi-year thing. And we won't be competing as much as we had in the past for the local Chinese customer, but we are very much involved in both the Chinese outbound business and inbound business going into China as well. I think on vacation rentals, listen, I think we continue to test and learn. We have a partnership with HomeAway. We're expanding that partnership into Europe and we're testing and learning in certain European markets and we're very excited to do that because the vacation rental market tends to be quite strong in the European market, so we absolutely want to be there and we're happy to be there with the HomeAway team. I don't think that we've hit kind of on a magic bullet at this point, so we don't see the additional inventory at this point materially increasing our revenue per shopper, but we think the customer experience at this point isn't what it needs to be and we think we can materially improve the customer experience and we're hoping that will add to our customer satisfaction and also help our revenue per shopper. And we're working with HomeAway on that front and we'll look to bring in additional inventory as well. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question? Operator : And we go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. A couple questions, are there any near-term or long-term impacts on the business in your view from the recent rate parity changes in Europe, noting that they don't go into effect until August 1? And then, Dara, in terms of your comments around integration efforts with Wotif and the Venere consolidation, are all those fully bolted on or do you still have small tasks or tweaks you need to do in terms of getting them onto common platforms? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, I think as far as the near or long-term impacts from rate parity changes, I'd certainly say from a near-term standpoint, we don't see a change. The fact is that customers come to our site looking for the best availability and the best prices. Any hotelier is free to list on our sites as long as they treat our customers well, as long as they meet certain standards. And the hotel partners would give us the most attractive inventory both in terms of pricing and availability. Those partners are going to be the ones who do best because the customers are going to pick that inventory. It's as long as the customers can find cheaper prices and they can find great availability, they will tend to move towards those partners and we don't see that changing. It's happened for many, many years and we think it'll continue for many, many years. From a long-term perspective, we think this normal economic law will take care of itself. But I think it's too soon to make comments on the long-term. This is something that is new. We're comfortable with it and we'll look to manage it on a go-forward basis. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: And, Brian, I'll just take the integration question. Wotif, Travelocity, Venere really all fall into this bucket. All of them are substantially complete with respect to the technology migration. Venere is now fully on the Hotels.com platform. Wotif, Travelocity is fully on the Brand Expedia platform. What's left to do there is really around the areas of marketing optimization largely. We've got to build a track record of performance on these websites in order to train our online marketing models, and there's also some back office type stuff. But I would think of them as substantially complete with optimization yet to come. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question? Operator : We go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Two if I may. First, just kind of big picture \u2013 in the markets where you're kind of coming in as a new entrant behind competitors already in the market at lower take rate, makes a lot of sense to move take rates lower to build supply in new markets. Just curious, can you talk about what's happening in the markets kind of where you are more established? How you feel take rates are progressing and where you think it will go in the future? And then, a second one, just on the supply growth in the quarter, it looked really strong. Curious how much of that came from the SynXis kind of 20,000 properties that they have versus some of those may have already been ones where you had a relationship \u2013 can you just give us a little color there? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as our take rates go, while every market is different, I would say the lowering of our take rates in general to both secure new inventory and secure better inventory for existing partners has been broad. So our take rates have come down in the U.S., they've come down in Europe, they've come down in Asia, whether we're a new entrant or not. And we don't necessarily see that changing. We've adjusted our business model to be able to reduce costs to our marketing partners while able to drive good economics for our shareholders, and that's our job and we feel comfortable that we can continue to deliver on that. As far as long-term position et cetera, it's very difficult to tell. The only thing that I know is that there's lots and lots of different distribution channels for supply partners on a global basis. And in order to continue to be competitive as a distribution partner you have to be good and you've got to be cheap. And I don't see that changing. And we're prepared for that world. We think we've been able to grow in that world and we're comfortable with it. As far as the supply growth going, the majority of the supply growth came from kind of call it organic acquisition. We have been investing in our market manager force pretty aggressively and that investment has led us to be able to go out and sign-up hotels on a direct basis. So I'd say the direct sign-ups have been the majority of the increase in supply growth. We had a bit of a nice bump from Wotif. Thank you for that team for bringing those hotels on board. And then we are also signing up hotels through some third parties, but that is the significant minority of the sign-ups that you saw at this point. We're hoping to accelerate it on a go-forward basis. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. Dara, just kind of curious, what would it take for international revenue growth to start to match up with hotel room night growth again? Is there just sort of a business model shift that has to be annualized through here or is there more to it than that? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Hey, Heath. It's Mark. I'll take that one. Really the big drivers for international revenue growth lagging room night growth so significantly are really two-fold. One is just the overall drag in revenue per room night we've seen, which is the biggest component, has been, or a substantial component, has been us taking down our hotel margins. That is a business model shift that'll work its way through over the course of the next few years. Over the course, though, of the last year or so particularly we have seen just a huge impact from foreign exchange and it's largely foreign exchange translation. And so, as we move to the end of Q4 and hopefully into next year, we would expect that to subside a bit as well. Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: All right. Thanks. Next question, please? Operator : We'll go next to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Please go ahead. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. Can you discuss Ryanair? Are they having any impact on trying to get everyone to follow their lead out of OTA or are we hearing more talk than actually what is going on? Where do you see that going in Europe and do you see any of that in the U.S.? And then I have another question. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, we haven't seen any significant effect from Ryanair. They're a very strong company. They tend to be vocal, but I don't think they're necessarily representative of the industry. We've got very strong long-term contracts with the vast majority of our air supply partners and I'd say that those relationships are getting stronger, not the other way around. One of the pretty important initiatives for us is to move from really just being a commodity provider of air product as far as just showing, call it, the lowest price and schedule, to becoming a value-added player in selling air. So if you look at our air product now, we have more content on the quality of the flights through a partnership with Routehappy and we are adding features such as branded fare, so that \u2013 while we will show you the lowest price, you can get some more flexibility. You might be able to get, be able to choose your seat, et cetera, and essentially sell in ancillary type revenue, which is very, very important revenue. If you follow the airline industry the airlines have done remarkably well with ancillary revenue. And we are building out features to be able to assist our airline partners in marketing those ancillary services and revenue such as seat choice, for example. So this is a really important initiative for us. We're seeing nice traction from our air partners and right now I'd say the relationships with the majority of our air partners are most definitely on the upswing. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : So, this is in the U.S. and Europe? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: This is on a worldwide basis. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Okay. And on U.S. rental cars, Hertz has just come back, it seems, in the market talking about how its fleet is down, and enterprise seems to have finished repositioning. I was wondering what effects you were seeing from these actions? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Well, I would say we're generally happy with our overall car business. As we said, great unit growth, we're innovating on the platform, car rental days were up 35% in the quarter. So we're seeing generally pretty good strength. We have seen little bits of incremental opaque inventory come back into Hotwire, which has been a great thing. But I can say no dramatic changes from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to be reasonably happy with what we see. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Are you seeing any changes in pricing? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: What we're seeing on our side is relatively flat pricing. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Okay. Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Next question? Operator : We go next to Ken Sena with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI : Hi. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about Expedia and the cross-sell and maybe the package capabilities in tracking the new supply maybe versus price, and perhaps how Expedia, then I think from that perspective is a differentiator, I think as far as how you expand and maybe it's driving some of that growth? And then also if you could comment maybe a little bit more just on the traction that you're seeing within the loyalty program? That would be great. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as cross-sell goes, we're very happy with our production in the cross-sell area. We measure the percentage of Expedia bookers who buy more than one item for us, bundle item for us, and that number has been consistently increasing over a period of time and it allows a couple things. One is, it often allows us to deliver a discount to the consumer by buying multiple products in one purchase. It's like your cable bundle. You buy your internet and your phone service, and your TV service together, you get a discount. We are offering the internet bundle for online travel and consumers are increasingly taking advantage of it, and they're taking advantage of the discounts there. From a supply partner basis, it also helps and that these transactions tend to be longer dated transactions, so that the supplier can kind of fill up their window, their inventory on a long data basis and they carry with them lower cancellation rates because the consumer was booking multiple things, multiple items, typically is a more committed consumer as well. So, it's proven to be a great value proposition for our consumers. It's a differentiator versus the other standalone players out there, and it's a nice differentiator for our hotel and air partners as well. It's been a nice win-win and that business continues to track along well. I think a coming benefit in that area is going to be our increasingly merchandising mobile offerings to consumers while they're on their trip. So you can imagine that if you've gone to \u2013 we know that you've flown into New Orleans, and you download the Expedia app, we can offer you activities in New Orleans. If you got to the airport and don't have a ride, we can offer you a ride to your hotel, and we probably have a bunch of intelligence as to when you're getting to the airport, or where you need to go in your hotel. That is a nascent business. But we think it can really delight our customers, and to the extent that we're selling more stuff to our customers, we can invest more in acquiring those customers, or we can invest more in keeping those customers through loyalty, through other benefits, through better service. So we are very excited about the opportunity we think we're in the early to mid-innings. I won't say that we're in the absolute early innings, because the team is making traction and they're doing good work. As far as our loyalty programs, we continue to see very nice traction there. Hotels.com has got the biggest in the family as far as loyalty goes. There are over 18 million now, Hotels.com rewards members around the globe. I think that of those 18 million members since the program started, I think they stay in 4.5 million hotel rooms for free. So you can have an idea of how much we are reinvesting in these loyal customers, and a higher and higher percentage of our transaction mix and our revenue mix is coming from these loyalty members. The Expedia loyalty program, the Expedia+ was mostly a U.S. program. It's now expanding globally. We're now in 18 points of sale. We're over 10 million members and that business continues, or that loyalty customer base continues to grow as well. This is another differentiator for us and something that we're pretty excited about and something that we think we can extend and grow. Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Ron V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow-up quickly just on margins. I think Dara you said we are at the longer-term process, but where are you in the process in terms of having these commissions in those markets come down? Are they down enough, or is there still room to go? And then, I guess the real question is around reviews. I think, Dara, you mentioned reviews, real-time reviews, hotels are using them to improve the quality of stays. Can you just talk about the importance of hotel reviews to Expedia, just noticing trivago highlight that in some commercials? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks Ron, it's Mark. I'll take the first one and then I'll turn it to Dara for the second one. With respect to margins, listen, what we're doing is essentially bringing our margins around the globe down to what we would say our sort of market parity type locally appropriately \u2013 locally appropriate margins. We've been at it for, I would say, the better part of 2.5 years to 3 years. We're going to continue to make adjustments through the end of 2015 and could slip into 2016 before we see ourselves really at parity or where we want to get to. And then you've got to annualize those. So, I think you are into 2017 nicely before you see the revenue per room night pressure from the deliberate margin actions recede. Dara, you want to take the reviews? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, as far as reviews goes, it's a very important factor in our travelers' decision as to which hotel they pick, second only to pictures I believe. So we are very actively continuing to collect more reviews on our hotels. Our higher-rated hotels tend to do best in the Expedia marketplace, so I think there is a nice incentive for hoteliers to make sure that the Expedia or Hotels.com customer gets a good \u2013 gets treated well because not only do those hotels perform better in the marketplace but then over 50 million, 60 million other consumers are reading those reviews as well, so it's very important to treat those customers well. The value that we bring with real-time reviews is that, if you look at our reviews in the past, the customer value for those reviews was that they were all real reviews, right? You knew that a customer stayed at that hotel, they're 100% dependable. We got some complaints from some hoteliers saying, listen I wish I knew about this customer's poor experience. I wish I could do something about a review other than comment, I'm sorry about your experience. So now with real-time reviews, we are asking the customer when they are in the market how the experience was. We are then sending the comments from those consumers either good or bad. We will highlight the bad because you can do something about it to our hotel partners through our Expedia partner tool, which by the way is going mobile as well so that if someone didn't like the room, if someone didn't like their view, if someone did not have towels in their room, the hotelier can do something about it on a real-time basis. And you can imagine that being just a delightful experience if the hotelier does something about it without a complaint coming directly. So we think it's a great tool for hoteliers and we think it could be a terrific experience for our consumers as well. It's early innings, but we're pretty excited about it. Ron V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Super helpful. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. Next question? Operator : We go next to Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking my questions. Elimination as a percentage of trivago revenue decline sequentially. Is this a big function of the auction becoming more competitive or are there other factors you can point to? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Jed. Well, I would say it's up and down quarter-to-quarter based upon competitive factors. I would say the trivago auction is competitive, has always been competitive. Some of this also can be influenced by the geographic mix because foreign exchange is a big factor here and we did see probably a higher portion of international business that had a higher portion of essentially FX headwinds against it in the quarter. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question please. Operator : We go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin C. Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks. First, could you just give us any more color on your marketing plans for the second half? You said you're reinvesting some of the upside from Q2. Should we expect kind of the levels of advertising spend to accelerate or will it be around the same as what you spent in the first half? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Kevin. So we do plan to step on the gas in sales and marketing in the second quarter, particularly in the third quarter, which is a pretty important one for us. We also had in June some spend that we held back on and shifted into Q3. So, I would expect levels to be elevated through the back part of the year, and I think it's a good factor to keep in mind as people are shaping their models. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Kevin, I'd also add that, we don't know how much we are going to spend for the majority of our marketing spend going into a quarter, right? The majority of our marketing spend are essentially it's variable spend. We don't know how competitive the auction is going to be and essentially in some of those marketing channels, the more we spend the better, because we are acquiring more new customers as long as you can do it in a competitive manner. So, when we talk about shifting marketing spend, that's for plan spend, that tends to be offline. And then things can change pretty darn materially, when we are in quarter, and I think our teams have handled it well and they operate within kind of their efficiency formula, so to speak, but marketing spend is not something that we necessarily want to keep predictable one way or the other. We're really about the core economics and we're not about the quarter. Kevin C. Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC: That's great. Thank you very much. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question? Operator : We go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for taking the question. Dara, I was really interested in your comment around Travelocity that as you are coming up on anniversarying the deal, you are seeing continued strength in the property, and then maybe going forward the property could even be stronger than you thought. So in terms of how you are thinking about properties like that that you bought, what are you seeing in Travelocity? How should we think about the tail for growth that's potential of a Travelocity? And how much of that has to do with marketing spend and how much has to do with integrating it into the tech platform that you guys spent a number of years investing in? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Eric. I think it goes to what Mark was talking about as far as the Wotif integration, the first benefit that we got from the Travelocity integration was higher conversion, because Travelocity was able to piggyback off of a substantial investment that we made on the Brand Expedia platform. There's a second benefit that it got, which is cost efficiency. We didn't have to carry a bunch of secondary cost building out features that had already been built up, probably in a better way. So those two come pretty quickly. And then the teams start optimizing on the marketing side in various marketing channels, and at that point they've got to burn in a bunch of algorithms and a bunch of decisions that have to be made, one, based on the conversion of that site in various channels and two, based on the lifetime value of its customer base. And those factors, while conversion has improved, the conversion of a Travelocity customer, let's say, in the trivago marketplace and the lifetime of value there is going to be different than Expedia. It's going to be different from Hotels.com. So you start moving through a period of optimization in these marketing channels, and I would say it takes a good six months, if not more, for you to start getting these marketing channels to work in the way that they should. And then, if you have a good site, if you've got good marketing, if you've got a great brand, which you see with Travelocity, you tend to have an entity that can grow. And that's what we're seeing with Travelocity. The thing that I would add is that we don't take 100% of those savings to the bottom line. We take some of the savings on overhead and we re-apply them into the brand. So if you look at the Travelocity brand spend this year versus last year, it will be up. We think that's a good thing. And we think the combination of better conversion, better, variable marketing, higher brand spend, that's a formula that you need to grow a business, and our intention with Travelocity is to grow the business. It's been a year. We hope we can do it for multiple years. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question? Operator : We'll go next to Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. Just to go back to the Travelocity one for a second, it sounds like the business is really humming along. Any help at all on how many points Travelocity added to the domestic room night growth this quarter? And how should we think about it, Dara, as you kind of continue to experiment on the advertising side and kind of get more efficient in the Travelocity marketing channels going forward? And then the second one, the CapEx was pretty high, I think it was about $366 million. I think that's more than you guys spent in all of 2014. What are the major areas you're investing in, and how should we think about that flowing through tech and content for the rest of the year? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Brian. I'll sort of deal with the Travelocity question. It is doing well. We did start to lap over the hotel revenue side of that business in Q2. As a reminder, we started lapping over essentially the gross bookings part of it in the beginning of the year and then revenue lags, and that cleaned out in the back part of the second quarter. So there was some impact, but it's in and around call it the 100 bp type of range. It's not a very significant number for us. We think it can continue to grow quite nicely as we optimize the sales and marketing spend. With respect to CapEx, the biggest thing this quarter was the closing of our transactions for the new Seattle headquarters. And that was a number that hit CapEx pretty significantly. With respect to the rest of it which is largely capitalized software development, I would say just look at the past for a decent predictor of what to expect into the future and just specifically on the real estate purchase is about $229 million of that CapEx was just for that. Okay, next question please. Operator : Next to Dan Wasiolek with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar Research : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So you guys have been quite active the last several months with expanded partnerships and acquisitions. At this point, are there particular regions or verticals within in the travel industry that you would like to strengthen either through partnership or acquisition? Or at this point are you guys kind of comfortable with your current portfolio and growing organically from here? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Hi, I think for the time being, we've got plenty on our plates. We are going to be opportunistic and I'd say especially outside the U.S., we think we have potential. We want our revenue outside the U.S. to be bigger than our revenue in the U.S. So I think to the extent we look for partnerships or acquisitions, it would tend to be outside the U.S. and we think we certainly have our plates full here and we have plenty of work ahead of us for the next couple of months. Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar Research : Makes sense. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : And at this time, there are no further \u2013 I'm sorry, please go ahead there are no further questions. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. So thank you very much for joining us this quarter. Really good work to the Expedia Inc. team and let's keep it up, the year ain't over. And to our investors, we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President Investor Relations at Expedia. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody, welcome to Expedia's financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. Pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP Operations. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, October 29, 2015 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise the information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release which is posted on the Company's IR website at IR.ExpediaInc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck. As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015 which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. But in order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis. Finally, unless otherwise stated all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. With that I would like to turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. The third quarter was another strong one for Expedia building on the very good results we saw in the first half of the year. It all starts with the unit growth and ours was excellent -- room night growth of 36%, air tickets up 31% and car days up 30% year-over-year. Excluding Orbitz gross bookings grew 18%, revenue was up 15% and adjusted EBITDA grew 17% with our performance nicely above what we had expected when we last spoke. Note too that we achieved these results despite considerable foreign exchange, revenue margin and deal expense headwinds. Our teams are executing well. Let me quickly cover a few other key matters I'm sure are of interest to all of you before handing it over to Mark. We were pleased to have closed the Orbitz transaction on September 17. The teams immediately began integration planning, working quickly to determine how best to bring these two leading travel companies together. As we've said before orbitz Worldwide is a global business and as such is significantly more complex than our prior integrations. The bulk of the integration work is expected to take place over the next nine months with certain businesses such as Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business pushing out to a year or more. That said, we're off to a strong start and the teams are working hard to bring the companies together as quickly and as efficiently as possible, making sure that our travelers and supplier distribution partners are all taken care of in the process. We have decided to move the Orbitz.com and CheapTickets businesses onto the Brand Expedia platform and we will look to look for leverage opportunities across the Orbitz portfolio brands. Mark will cover the near-term financial expectations for the Orbitz business in his remarks. Our hotel supply position continues to improve and this year we added 14,000 properties to our inventory, now up 29% year-over-year. We continue to invest in people, processes and technology across our supply organization and are on boarding new hotels in record time at higher quality than we ever have. We expect to see some variation in seasonality quarter to quarter and expect property additions in Q4 to outpace Q3. We continue to have aggressive plans for property growth over the long-term. Now I'm sure you have questions regarding any potential impacts arising from recent developments in the TripAdvisor instant book product. To the extent that Priceline's participation accelerates instant book global penetration, we would anticipate additional volume pressure in the TripAdvisor channel. While certainly not a positive, TripAdvisor has been a shrinking share of our overall demand pool for some time. Note too that TripAdvisor is one of our lower margin channels, so the impact on profitability will most likely be muted. Lastly, I will tell you that we're very happy to have Trivago, one of the fastest-growing major global hotel meta-brands, as part of our family. You have seen us invest aggressively in that brand; you should expect the same moving forward. Now a fundamental part of our strategy is to continue to develop our marketing and product efforts relating to our proprietary direct channels. There are three areas that I would like to highlight today, loyalty, mobile and attach. On loyalty we continue to see good progress in terms of customer loyalty and repeat behavior. The hotels.com rewards loyalty program which recently surpassed the 20 million member milestone, continues to see strong growth and in fact is one of the fastest-growing marketing channels for that brand. Our Expedia Plus rewards program now has over 12 million members and has launched in 27 countries just this year with two more to come by year-end. Turning to mobile, mobile web for us is about new customer acquisition and app is about cementing those new customers into loyal repeat users. We see great traction in both channels, especially on the conversion and product side with our OTA brands seeing a range of 40% to 60% of traffic and 20% to 40% of transactions booked on mobile overall. I think it is safe to say that mobile has transitioned from being a profit headwind to a key component of our core offerings and a channel and product where we see significant potential going forward. Last and certainly not least we have in our portfolio now the preeminent full-service OTA brands such as Brand Expedia, Travelocity, hotwire, Wotif orbitz, CheapTickets and eBooker's and that means lots of air shoppers. Today, not including Orbitz, we see over 7.5 billion annual air searches which is likely to increase over time and drive real opportunities to upsell into ancillary air product and fair offerings as well as cross-sell into hotels apartments, vacation rentals, rental cars, car hire, local tours and activities, insurance and more. We have just scratched the surface here in an area where we believe we have a substantial lead and a strategic advantage. Next on the agenda is to execute this very same playbook with rail. We're coding up a new rail product as we speak which we plan to launch next year. The vast majority of our profits come from our direct channels and efforts like these represent the strategic growth drivers of the Company now and moving forward. We have had a terrific year so far and I would like to take a moment to thank our employees for all of their hard work and for a job well done. Tremendous effort is going to improving our capabilities in our business each and every day. With that I will hand it to Mark. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Dara. One quick reminder before I get started. We sold our 62% stake in eLong on May 22 and financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date. To aid in comparability and to focus on the parts of the business that are ongoing, our comments today focus on Expedia, Inc. results excluding eLong. The overall trajectory of the business remains strong with the third-quarter results broadly consistent with the trends we have seen throughout the year. Strength across our breath of leading brands and across geographies continued with rare exception. Our core OTA segment, Trivago and Egencia are all having solid years with strong execution and good financial results. Top-line growth was again driven by robust unit growth across all major geographies. Room night growth remained strong for all of our major brands relative to first-half growth rates, leading to global room night growth of 36% year-over-year, a slight acceleration from 35% last quarter. The inorganic impact from recent acquisitions added approximately 8 percentage points to global room night growth in Q3. Note that due to purchase accounting rules we don't recognize revenue or the related room night volume from acquisitions which was booked prior to the close date and therefore the impact on hotel revenue and room night growth from Orbitz was de minimis. Domestic room nights grew 25% in Q3 while international room nights were up 50%. Revenue per room night was down approximately 15% this quarter while ADRs were down 6%. These metrics are similar to those we've reported in Q2 and the factors influencing our room night economics are largely the same as they have been for a while. Foreign currency accounted for a little more than half of the decline in revenue per room night while deliberate reductions in hotel margins and, to a lesser extent, the impact of our loyalty programs and other incentives accounted for the rest. We continue to be happy to trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and global scale. Air revenue grew 19% on ticket growth of 31%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 9%. We continue to see fast ticket growth from Brand Expedia on the back of the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture and the benefit of innovating on the platform. In addition orbitz contributed 6 percentage points to air ticket growth this quarter. Excluding all inorganic impacts air revenue would have grown 4% on ticket growth of 19%. Our advertising and media business which is made up of Trivago and our Media Solutions group continued growing nicely with Trivago growing standalone revenue 27% or approximately 49% currency neutral. Media Solutions also grew at a healthy rate and Orbitz contributed 2 percentage points to ad and media growth this quarter. We continue to drive to a P&L that reflects aggressive sales and marketing investment around the world to expand our global reach and drive long-term growth, while gaining scale and leverage in other key expense categories. Excluding the impact from Orbitz, the P&L we delivered in Q3 was consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing growing a bit faster than revenue, low cost of revenue, technology and content and G&A growing slower providing leverage. Importantly, our results for Q3 also include the layering in of the Orbitz standalone financials for the 14 days of the quarter that we owned the business. As we told you to expect on our Q2 call, the impact from Orbitz on adjusted EBITDA was indeed negative in Q3, primarily as a result of purchase accounting impacts which when taken with approximately $7 million of deal and integration costs, resulted in a negative impact of approximately $17 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. At the top line Orbitz contributed $421 million of gross bookings and $19 million of revenue. Now I would like to cover our financial expectations for full-year 2015. I will give some color on our expectations both excluding the impact of the Orbitz transactions or on an apples-to-apples basis with prior guidance, as well as including the impact of Orbitz so you can fully understand the relevant impacts. Given performance to date and the trends we're seeing we're now forecasting full-year consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding eLong, of 12% to 15%. On an apples-to-apples basis relative to prior guidance for Expedia excluding eLong and excluding all impacts of the Orbitz transaction in Q3 and Q4 we're forecasting full-year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth to come in near the high-end of that range. On the other hand including all impacts of Orbitz for both Q3 and Q4 which were not included in our prior guidance, we expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to be near the lower end of our range. In total we expect a full-year negative adjusted EBITDA impact from Orbitz of over $32 million with approximately $15 million coming in the fourth quarter. This includes integrated related costs as well as Orbitz operating results which, as mentioned, will be negatively impacted by purchase accounting rules. Although we plan to give you more color on our Q4 call regarding the likely impact of Orbitz for 2016, I'm able to share some additional perspective today. Based on the current trajectory of Orbitz on a standalone basis we believe the business would have delivered full-year 2015 adjusted EBITDA of roughly $135 million which we think is likely lower than Street expectations. However, with the benefit of a more detailed integration planning we have been able to do since the closing of the transaction, we now have a better view on synergy realization timelines as well as run rate synergy potential. Though there is still much work to do and details to iron out, what I can tell you is that we now believe that there is meaningful upside to the $75 million in run rate synergies that we projected at the time we announced the transaction. We expect these synergies to layer in slowly in the first half of the year, ramping to near run rate by the end of 2016. With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Two quick questions for Mark, one for Dara. Mark, how far are you from ending the margin reductions on the hotel side? Like when do you think you will get to parity or where you want to get to? And then that 36% growth in room nights, you said 8% was from acquisitions, you compared it to 35% last quarter. Can you just give us the apples-to-apples comparison versus last quarter, i.e. ex acquisitions, what that growth rate would have been? And then, Dara, big picture, you know the question is coming up. Airbnb, can you just talk about what kind of impact that is having on your business, material or not and how you think about them -- competing with them or if they are going forward? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : In terms of margin reductions we do expect them to continue through 2016. They will start to mitigate in the back part of the year. And then you have got some and realization of that. So I think we will be well into 2017 before we see ourselves in a position where that is no longer a significant headwind for us. With respect to room night growth, I'd say listen, on an apples-to-apples basis organic around 28% really for both quarters this quarter and last quarter. So we really see really consistency in the strength of just the core business. Dara, do you want to take the Airbnb one? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, as far as Airbnb goes, you can tell by the results that any effect that Airbnb has had on us is immaterial at this point. We don't see it in the business, it is not affecting us directly at all. If anything we think that Airbnb may be getting a new class of consumer into travel. It is typically a lower price point, it appeals to millennial's and we think that, based on different occasions, sometimes some consumers will opt for rental type inventory and sometimes they will opt for hotels and we think the hotel product is a great product and it certainly shows up in our numbers. That said, it is adding supply into the market, into the lodging marketplace. And that supply is addressable to a certain portion of the population. So our belief is that it will put pricing pressure in certain markets where you see a significant amount of Airbnb inventory. We have heard sporadically from some of our market managers that there are certain periods that would be absolute peak periods where a town would totally sell out -- where it is not quite selling out. And actually that translates into goodness for us because we wind up having hotel inventory to sell and market to our consumers during a time where previously we wouldn't have that inventory. So, so far when we talk to call it the crew on the ground who really knows what is going on in the business, they view it as a positive versus a negative. It is clearly product that is important for a certain group of people, so we will look to build out our rental product over time. First order of business is the traditional hotel product, but we're adding apartment type product and we will continue to add it. I think incrementally it will become a more important part of our mix next year and going into the following years. Operator : We will go next to Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : Dara, a couple questions that might help us think about the next couple years. First, OTAs have been around 15 years and yet you are growing domestic room nights 25%. Can you talk about the penetration of online bookings in the U.S. and then we'll think about international later, but two or three years into it? Priceline arguably was nine years into their purchases of some of the booking.com platforms, but how much more room do you have to improve conversion or other things with that tech platform? Or do you think you might be running out of room? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as the OTAs go, I just think that anyone now who is looking to travel or looking to research or book travel is going to look at OTAs. And I think we have become mainstream. The numbers that we see as far as online penetration are in the 40% to 50% range. And while there is some, you have to believe in the law of large numbers that online penetration is going to slow down. I think our brands are becoming more relevant, our supply is getting better, our sites are getting better and faster, our service is improving. So it really does look like we're taking share from some of the smaller players who can't make the kinds of marketing and technology and customer service and loyalty investments that we can. So I think at this point it is a game of not just online penetration increasing, but also our gaining share versus a number of other players. Keep in mind that we're still just a single-digit percentage of total room nights in the U.S. So we really think we have a long way to go and the teams are executing well. This is the teams that are accomplishing this. On the tech platform, we look pretty carefully at what we call our win rate. We're obviously running thousands of tests that are powered by thousands of hypotheses by our product teams. And we look at our win rate versus call it neutral or a loss rate. We look at the average size of win; in other words if we have a win is it -- what does that look like on a percentage basis versus the base case. And our win rate and the average size of win continue at rates that are pretty darn attractive and conversion continues to be a tailwind. So while theoretically we think that there is a high watermark that we might be hitting, we haven't seen it. I do think that our increasing our supply and increasing the quality of supply and just the number of hotels is kind of a new tailwind that we hadn't seen in the past couple years. So I think the conversion is not only a factor of the product and the tech platform, but it is also a factor of the good work that our supply team is doing. I would add just one thing about the tech platform is that -- one thing that really touched me about the tech platform is step one was the platform was about the user experience, was really about the website experience that the consumer saw. That tech platform now is going down the stack and, for example, our hotelier experience, the tools that we're offering our hoteliers are improving rapidly. We're arming them up with so much more data. Our hoteliers can look up how many people are looking at their hotel, how many people looked at their hotel and booked on arrival hotel. They are able to do it on a website, they are able to do it through an app, etc. This tech platform is -- the benefits that we're getting from the tech platform are much broader than just the consumer. And we think that we're just getting started on the other parts that typically don't get headlines but are quite valuable. Operator : We will go next to Naved Khan from Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan : I have two questions. One sort of related to [indiscernible] and Priceline's decision to participate in that. How do you see your own participation change on the Google hotel product? And how do you see Priceline's participation change in Trivago maybe? And then I had a question on China. Are you seeing any kind of changes in demand in China outbound? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, as far as the instant book product goes, we have worked with Google very closely on their hotel product, various parts of their hotel product. And I think we talked about previously that it was our intention to test and learn with Google on the book on Google. We thought the branding, the clarity that they sent to consumers was right on. So it is our intent to test and learn with them and we will let the data and what our consumers tell us essentially drive the long-term decision there. As far as Priceline participation on Trivago, it is unknown. Trivago is now pretty aggressively testing out a product that looks like Instant Book. We think that there is a lot more clarity again on where the consumer is booking their travel. Trivago is simply trying to optimize that path versus let's say gather consumer data to upsell them other stuff. So they are very, very focused on just optimizing that consumer experience in that moment. The test is happening in Germany and so far we like what we see. And many of Expedia brands are participating and I think the Trivago team is excited about rolling out that product. We will see if Priceline participates or not. Mark Okerstrom : And specifically on that they're on -- 90% of their traffic on desktop in Germany is live with the product, 50% app. And they are looking forward, based on the encouraging results they have seen, to starting to roll this out to English-speaking countries over the course of next year. So very promising. I will take your China outbound question. Listen, I'd say no major change for us. It is hard with a country that big which is growing travel so fast, for us to perceive different movements either way. Again, we're participating in China both through our Expedia affiliate network business that powers a lot of the leading players in China with our international hotel inventory, also through hotels.com, also through Egencia and Trivago is putting its toe in the water I would say in China. And we're looking forward to implementing the broader commercial relationship that we have with Ctrip through the back part of this year and the beginning part of next year. And so we do think, at least for us anyway, China outbound remains a very big opportunity and we continue to like what we see there. Operator : We will go next to Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies. Brian Fitzgerald : You have mentioned before there are kind of two stages of leverage as you step through an acquisition integration. One is getting the brand onto the common platform. And then two comes as the data starts to flow and you can learn and optimize. So, just curious on the second point with recently completed integrations where are we? And then with the Orbitz integration it sounds like the optimization timeline is consistent with these prior endeavors. You get it on the platform and then the optimization comes over the course of one to two quarters. Is that the right way to think about it? Mark Okerstrom : Yes, I think you have broadly got it right. The two that we're nearing the end of that process with are of course Travelocity where we did the tech integration really through last year and we started the marketing integration that you speak of this year. We're probably three quarters of the way through the process with Travelocity right now and we like what we see. That is a brand that has continued to be a growth brand lapping over everything. So very encouraging. Wotif is probably a quarter through. It is on the platform, we're training the marketing models. They've just launched a brand-new brand campaign in Australia which we're pretty excited about, it is one of their biggest ever and that is really aimed at returning that iconic brand to iconic status. And I think, listen, those are good parallels for Orbitz generally. That said, as Dara said in his prepared remarks orbitz is a bigger business. Orbitz is a more global business. Even if you look at Orbitz and CheapTickets, I mean these are businesses that have been, I would say compared with Wotif or compared with a Travelocity, a little bit closer to optimization already. And so, I think for the Orbitz business, even though the playbook is the same, the caveat is that we could see, when we flip it over to the platform, actually a moment where conversion might degrade and we actually have a little bit more of an optimization period to go through. So I think that is the caveat that we really don't know the answer to yet, but aside from that I think it is a very similar playbook. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I think the other thing to add with Orbitz is that whereas with some of the other brands Travelocity, Wotif, we put them on our platform and that was it, there are some very interesting things and technologies and processes that the Orbitz teams have developed. We love their loyalty program, so that is a feature that we will look to build on our platforms, but it is their idea, their conception, etc. And there are technologies that they have built around air search, around connectivity with various providers. Those are, again, super interesting technologies that they have built. The talent there is really good. So, I think while Orbitz will move on to the Expedia platform, we're going to look for Orbitz to improve the Expedia platform as well. Operator : We will go next to Tom White from Macquarie. Tom White : You talked a little bit about attach rates for air. I was just wondering have you guys seen sort of similar inflation in CPCs for air queries like we have seen in hotel over the past 12 to 18 months, be it from maybe the air carriers and consolidation in that space? Or is air query still just a cheaper way for you guys to get traffic and hopefully cross-sell it? And then just maybe an update on Trivago profitability. Can you kind of give us a sense of your view on long-term margins for that business and maybe a timeline for when you might be able to scale back the investment there a bit? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. As far as air queries go, in general air CPCs tend to be lower than hotel CPCs and air revenue per unit tends to be significantly lower than hotel revenue per unit. We have not to date aggressively participated in variable channels in air because of the revenue and profitability per unit that air has had historically. We think that we're in a position now to participate more aggressively in some of these variable channels. And the growth rates that we see in those variable channels are very significant, but off small bases. So, air tends to be much more of a direct business, so the attach revenue tends to be higher-margin revenue so to speak. But we're very much looking forward to participating more aggressively in variable channels on the air side. There are some variable channels such as meta in the U.S. on the air side where we can't participate based on some of the kind of deals, agreements that the meta channels have with some of our air partners. So, while I think there is growth in the variable channel for air, it is not going to quite look like what we see in the hotel product, but it is nice upside versus where we're now. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then Tom, just on Trivago, listen, I think what we look for in terms of the long-term profitability or what we look at when looking at long-term profitability is what we see in their major mature markets, markets like Germany, the UK, France, Italy. And what we see there is a margin structure that quite frankly looks a lot like TripAdvisor essentially, it is a big media business that is growing nicely with attractive margins. The phase we're in right now however continues to be that we're able to take those profits and put them into new opportunities. The story continues to be told in the U.S., Canada and Australia. The growth rates in the U.S. continue to be very impressive and U.S. awareness is now up to one in every second American has actually heard of Trivago coming from a point of obscurity in 2012. So we're really still in that investment mode. We do think that the U.S. market will start to mature probably into next year, but then we look at some of the other markets where they have entered recently. I mean Japan, for example, we're seeing revenue actually quadruple year-over-year, fivefold in Brazil, in the Middle East it is sevenfold in some places. So there still continues to be pockets of real great opportunity for Trivago and we continue to be very willing to invest in that. But again, the thing to keep in mind here is that we do have the model where we can actually see what long-term profitability looks like. We're just in a mode right now where we just have too many attractive investment opportunities to drop that to the bottom line. Mark Okerstrom : We could very easily turn that business into a profit business and it is really about the incremental opportunity that we have for our next investment dollar. And at this point Trivago has been very strategic for us. Operator : We will go next to Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric Sheridan : A bigger picture question again coming back to marketing channels. Appreciate the color on trip and book on Google, but how should we be thinking about the relative ROI you are seeing today across your marketing channels? How are you thinking about how that might develop in the coming years or what that might mean for marketing leverage in the business? Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. In general, our ROI in the various channels has been fairly consistent this year versus last year. The amount that we can bid in certain geographies such as Europe has gone down on a CPC basis because of foreign exchange. But our efficiencies, sometimes they will go up, sometimes they will go down based on the bidding dynamics of the auction on a local basis. But when we look at our overall efficiency this year versus last year in the larger channels and Google and trip and Trivago and some of the social channels the efficiencies haven't changed much. What we do look for is channels that are significantly call it new customer acquisition channels and then our capability on moving those new customers into repeat customers through call it direct channels. The more we're able to convert those customers the higher kind of toll we're willing to pay for those new customers. And it has been a formula that has been going on for a while and it is pretty comfortable. So I would say right now things are pretty stable. The only I would say notable new factor is that the mobile channels for us are beginning to become more affordable so to speak. We had to -- call it two, three years ago when we were bidding into mobile we had to go in at substantial loss in order to build up volume, in order to test and learn, in order together data so that we could optimize our product. Those losses now have been significantly mitigated. And while we're still in investment mode on mobile, it is a nice story on a year-over-year basis for us. Operator : We will go next to Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : I just want to circle back on Instant Book. It seems like some participants recently -- some of the hotels and then OTAs who have recently joined, they are seemingly getting more control over their brand in messaging and perhaps customer service than was originally contemplated in the service. So just try to understand still I guess why it is not appropriate for you and if there is something in the dynamic that could change that going forward. And then also do talked about the platform some in terms of the Orbitz synergies. Can you just outline more the biggest sources of upside versus what you were originally expecting there? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : On the Instant Book basis we think that the trend of let's say participants getting more control over their brand of the better customer experience of not being confused about where they are booking -- we think that is a positive trend. TripAdvisor continues to be an important channel for us and we're in constant discussions and dialogue with TripAdvisor. So, based on how we see the treatments of Instant Book we will make our decision. At this point we're not in, but from a long-term perspective this is certainly a product that we have the option of participating in and we will keep that option open. There is no reason to close it one way or the other and we will keep revisiting it. At this point obviously you can see that our growth rates are very, very healthy despite let's say the short-term stance that has hurt us which we think is a good long-term stance. Mark Okerstrom : And then, Doug, just on Orbitz synergies, one of the big pivotal decisions that we made recently which opens up incremental opportunity was the decision to put Orbitz.com and CheapTickets.com on the Brand Expedia platform and that opens up a bunch of opportunities that go beyond what we said on the call initially which was really access to our global hotel footprint, access to our technology platform potentially and reduction of some corporate costs. And really what has opened up now is that once Orbitz and CheapTickets are on the Brand Expedia platform, not only do they get access and get to ride on the test and learn machine that Dara has spoken about frequently around just all the testing we do and the product getting better and better. But they instantly get access to our global footprint of not only just global hotels but air, car, vacation packages, activities, etc. So the product envelope gets widened. The other pieces of this though are that as we have dug into the business we have seen that they did have and they spoke about it, fraud and chargeback problems. That is something that we can help them with instantly as part of the program. We do have a global customer operations team which has truly global scale and has huge amounts of efficiency benefits. They will immediately go onto that. And then the cherry on top of all of this, as Dara said, is that they do have some great technology around some of the air technology they have built, some of their loyalty technology that we use to make our overall product better as well. So those are all of the things that add up. Of course we don't know the exact amount yet, we're not ready to update the exact amount. What we do know is those things add up to what we think is some meaningful upside. Operator : We will go next to Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : Sticking with the Orbitz and the synergy theme, can you just give us a sense -- I think you said $135 million in standalone EBITDA had Orbitz kind of been independent. It seems like that would imply a pretty quick improvement on the fraud issues they were facing. How much of that will be -- kind of require be platform transition and how much can you do even ahead of that? And then as a follow-up to that, can you just give us a broad sense for how much of the synergy, maybe either using the 75 as a baseline or your revised projections, just how much will come from the revenue side on better terms from hotels or better air terms and how much of that is going to be coming off of the operating expense side? Clearly they had a lot of non-marketing operating expense that would seem to be able to come out of the business. What are the kind of pockets there that we should be thinking about? Mark Okerstrom : Sure. I will give you a bit of information now and then on our Q4 call we will be able to give you some more detail because, of course, there is still a fair bit of detail for us to work through. On the $135 million, listen, I'd actually say that the Orbitz team has taken some very positive steps to stave off the fraud problem that they have been facing, but we think we can help them significantly beyond that. So, I think they have stemmed a lot of the losses. But again, we think we can do that plus keep the conversion benefits that sometimes get hurt when you take certain steps to stop fraud. In terms of how much firm revenue, how much from cost synergies, we're not going to provide a ton of detail on that at this point again. We're still working through the detail. Obviously there is a cost component around public company costs, etc., that we mentioned and there are some redundant teams if you will, but we're not really getting into too much detail. I would tell you though that we --even though we think there is a cost reduction opportunity that will create synergies on paper for the deal case, it also presents a huge recruiting opportunity for us. We have about 1,000 open positions at Expedia that are in our base operating budget that we guide you to. But we just have open positions. And what we find at Orbitz is a very talented team. We're looking to place people that may find themselves redundant in as many of those roles as we can. We do think we're going to have some meaningful technology and product capabilities in addition to Orbitz teams located in Chicago. And we think this is a win-win opportunity across the board. Operator : We will go next to Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : I guess one just sort of housekeeping question. Are there plans either through an 8-K or some other disclosure to cover the Orbitz results for the part of the quarter that wasn't included in your results? And then looking at the gross differential between bookings and revenues and I know you guys have touched on this a couple of different ways, is there a path that you could see that would lead to those numbers converging over time? Largely thinking is there a way that as the business stabilizes you start to see revenue growth that looks more like your bookings growth? Mark Okerstrom : Sure, Heath, so I will take that. We're not going to provide at this point information around the part of the quarter that was not part of our results. We will be putting in our investor presentation a page that lays out the impact of Orbitz on our results for the 14 days that they were part of it. And we will also outline the guidance update that I gave on this call. But we aren't going to provide anything beyond that at this point. There is some pro forma data in the Q that you can see tomorrow that can give you a little bit more color. In terms of growth differential between bookings and revenue, listen, the big driver there continues to be what we have been doing on the hotel side, it is reflected in our revenue per room night. A big chunk of that is foreign exchange but also just the deliberate margin reductions we're doing. So as I said to Mark on the kickoff question, I think we're really well into 2017 before we expect to see those pressures abate. And I think at that point you could expect to see those growth rates converge. And then I would also say the bigger that Trivago gets that can be a tailwind for it as well because of course they are not in gross bookings at all, they are just a net add to revenue. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think revenue mix between air and hotel and then revenue mix between media and hotel are also separate factors. Mark Okerstrom : They will get better if our air volumes slow down which doesn't seem to be happening at this point. Operator : We will go next to Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman : So following up on some previous questions. First, on China, does the acquisition have any effect on outbound? And on inbound, have you seen yet a pricing effect? Also, following up on --. Mark Okerstrom : Michael, to be clear, what acquisition are you talking about? Michael Millman : I'm talking about Ctrip's acquisition or combination with [indiscernible]. Mark Okerstrom : You mean Qunar which was a sub of Baidu, is that correct? Michael Millman : Yes, thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Okay, just want to be clear. Michael Millman : And secondly, can you talk maybe a little bit more detail regarding your growth in repeat customers is accelerating, not accelerating, maybe some numbers? And relatedly, are you seeing growth or accelerated growth in conversions as well? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. On China it is really too soon to tell as to how the Ctrip and Qunar transaction will affect how those respective businesses are run. Our admiration for the Ctrip team has only increased with that deal. We think it is strategically super, super smart. James and Jane and team are clearly executing not only well on the ground, but also strategically. And I think you also heard that the changes in the one child policy that I think James supported for a long time. So that team is executing well on a number of fronts. We have very strong relationship with Ctrip as part of the eLong deal with eLong. And also we have been doing business with Qunar as well for a long time on the outbound business. So we think that our outbound volumes will continue with them, it is just too hard to tell at this point as to whether the deal that was announced will have any effect on those volumes. We don't think so, but you never know until you know. As far as inbound volume goes I would say the same thing, there is plenty of inbound volume going to China as well. We haven't seen any material change since the announcement, but it really is early at this point. As far as the growth in repeat customers, we don't disclose a bunch of data there, but I would certainly confirm that the growth rate of our repeat customers, if we look at it this year versus where we were three, four years ago is much more healthy than it had been. And it is a natural factor in that we're bringing in more new customers from the variable channels and so there is a mathematical factor in that a certain percentage of them turn into repeat customers. And the activity that we have in our core product, loyalty, etc., is also improving our repeat rates which is a very nice contributor to call it the core profit engine of the Company. So the trends that we see there are certainly good trends and it is something that we're much more focused on now than where we were call it three, four years ago. Three, four years ago it was about product conversion, reaching into variable channels. Now it is not only those machines but also increasing our supply base and then increasing our repeat customer base as well. And then I think you asked a question on conversion as well. Conversion continues to be a positive factor. We don't disclose how positive one way or the other, but it continues to be a nice tailwind for the business. Michael Millman : Can you disclose relative how positive, is it accelerating positive? Mark Okerstrom : It is good. That is all we will disclose. Operator : We will go next to Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Can you just give us an overall update on your tours business and how the latest TV campaign has been doing? And then another big picture question, can you just touch on your overall vacation rental strategy? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, sure. We're very, very, very and just in case you didn't get it, very excited about our tours business. It is growing at triple-digit rates and it is -- the product has improved, that team has worked for a long time on improving that product and it is a product front to back. And the product, as you know now, is available in mobile, we feature the product on TV. And this is, as far as the technology revamp, etc., this product was really revamped and launched into the marketplace based on the new tech platform really this year and the team has been optimizing aggressively. And it shows in the results. And I think we're very early, we think we have got many, many years going forward of our tours product improving substantially and we're just starting. But I'm really excited for the team and I can tell you the team is pretty pumped right now. As far as our vacation rental strategy, we touched on it. We think that it is an important product. At this point we're more focused on our core hotel product, it is kind of order of operations. And as you have seen this year, we have accelerated bringing in incremental new hotel inventory. And as we go down the path, especially going into next year, we think that we will start adding more vacation rental apartments, etc., inventory because we do think that fundamentally it is a type of lodging that clearly customers are interested in and if customers are interested in we will look to offer it to them. Operator : We will go next to Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Ron Josey : Dara, I wanted to get your thoughts on just rate parity requirements. Some European countries and France were talking about specifically if hotels can offer lower prices than Expedia or Venere how do you compete with that? And then also just quickly on your 50% room night growth in international, I wonder if there's anything specific that is driving that. So meaning is there -- are you focused on any one particular geography or is this just better overall execution? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as rate parity goes, we're comfortable with where we stand and we agreed not to call -- kind of enforce rate parity provisions that we had in our contracts and I think we're generally in a good place with the EU regulators. Listen, our hotels can list their product in our marketplace for free, it is an on-demand marketplace, they can be in it, they cannot be in it, they can put their inventory in, etcetera. And what we found and our hotel partners have found is that the better inventory they put into the marketplace the better they perform and they are completely free to do what they want. What we have seen is that hotels want volume. And in general there is kind of a good self-reinforcing mechanism going on and our marketplace, as you know by our volumes, has gotten stronger. Our relationship with our hotel partners in general has gotten better. And when we look at the quality of our inventory, the quality of our inventory has increased, not decreased, since some of these issues have come up. So, we absolutely want to be supplier friendly. We want to be on-demand. And I think that as our partners experience our marketplace more it is a marketplace that is they want to participate in more and I think our price decreases don't hurt either. Mark Okerstrom : And then Ron, on the hotel room night growth, I would just remind you that the impact of the Brand Expedia Asia joint venture consolidation and Wotif are both tailwinds to this metric on an inorganic basis. That said, we're seeing pretty broad organic strength in a bunch of places, Eastern Europe is strong, Africa is strong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia. I mean, these are all places that have growth rates that are high-double-digits, in some cases triple-digits. So, it is a mix of things. But just keep in mind the acquisitions do bolster that number. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think one interesting note on our international room night growth is that we're seeing an increase in international-to-international destination and especially call it travel closer to home. I'd say we're a great platform for international travelers, but our APAC-to-APAC, our Europe-to-Europe business, our in country business is the strongest segment of our business on a room night basis. On an ADR basis that actually puts a little pressure on our ADRs which is as you start to move into business that is less international and more domestic you tend to move into categories that are lower ADR. So we think that this long-term, this kind of shift in demand and supply is going to be a long-term room night positive but we will put some pressure on our ADRs. But we think overall that is a more healthy marketplace. Operator : We will go next to Ken Sena from Evercore. Ken Sena : So, in looking at the Trivago revenue and also the inter-segment elimination, it seems as though over the last year reliance on Trivago has increased quite a lot in terms of the Expedia portion. First, are we correct to think about it that way? And second, as you look at Priceline's entrance into instant book can you say how or if it changes the calculus at all for you in terms of thinking about joining them maybe more broadly as just meta platforms become more end to end? How does the dynamic change in terms of reliance as far as OTAs on meta? If you could maybe sort of look out a few years that would be very helpful. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, Ken. So on Trivago, the Expedia brands and really sort of all the big brands in Trivago are generally gaining share. It is an analogous situation to what you see in the broader industry. I would say though particularly one of the things that drives Expedia's share gains in Trivago is the fact that they are expanding into markets where we're exceptionally strong, markets like the U.S., Canada, Australia for example. And so, that just plays naturally into our strengths. But again, beyond that, our performance in Trivago is dictated by the strength of our platform, the conversion benefits we're driving as well as the capabilities of our teams and the full teams across those function are doing pretty darn well. Data, do you want to take the second question? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. As far as Instant Book goes, listen, Priceline is our largest competitor. They are a very strong competitor. As you know, they are awfully smart. So we look at everything that they do with a great degree of interest and we would be stupid to act otherwise. So we will take a look at how they participate in Instant Book and they will certainly enter into our calculus. I just can't tell you what the answer is going to be. Ken Sena : And then maybe just look out in terms of meta players being tethered in some way or another to an OTA and does it change the dynamic over time, we're going to be looking at experiences that go more end-to-end where it really is about the exclusivity of the supply that you have? Dara Khosrowshahi : I think that in this industry you are getting various players and various experiences roll into each other in a way that is, that has changed and you are not going to have kind of these clear delineations between experiences the way that you had. Reviews is something that is very big on our site now. We talk about our review content, we talk about reviews and how it affects our conversion. Review used to be something that was only in Trip Advisor's bailiwick, now it is a big part of TripAdvisor, but it is something that is core to our product just like it is something that's core to their product. They are more involved in the booking path. You have seen us and various players test with meta-like product on the OTA path. So I think a lot of these experiences are getting melded together. This is an industry that we had a young person who recently joined our Company and I would like to spend some time with them. And he said, God, your industry has so many people competing with each other and working -- there is more competition in your industry than I have ever seen. And sometimes when you are in the middle of an industry you kind of don't have that perspective. A lot of these experiences are coming together. We don't know exactly where it is going to shake out, but we're trying to optimize for the customer experience and our partner and supply experience. And I think so far what we're doing is working, what TripAdvisor is doing is working, clearly what Priceline is doing is working. And I think the bigger players are going to keep growing. This is a hugely fragmented marketplace and I do think these experiences are coming together. We just don't know exactly where it is going to shake out. Our interest is pretty simple in keeping our consumers and partners happy. Operator : We will go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Could you just touch on how you are thinking about the rail opportunity and what you are working on with the new rail product that you mentioned? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : The product hasn't been launched and I think you know by now that we test and learn this stuff. So fundamentally rail is an incredibly important way -- a transport mechanism for consumers all over the world, it is super important in Europe, it is very important in the APAC regions. We're hoping it will be more important in the U.S. but it is not as large a factor in the U.S. So this is just really important product. I think that it has been typically underinvested in as far as online travel agencies go because there isn't much money in the product itself. But I think that as we have built out our attach platforms, having context as to where the consumer is going I think is going to give us lots of upsell opportunity. And then increasing the frequency of touches with our travelers we think is going to really increase loyalty, especially on the mobile side, both of which are really good things. So, we don't know exactly where this journey is going to take us. But we think that it can add to this theme that you have heard from us which is air gives us terrific context as to where people are going, gives us lots of opportunity for delighting them. And I think rail which is a pretty commonly used product can be something very big over the next three to five years. We're going to start small but we're getting started now. Operator : We will go next to Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Aaron Kessler : A couple questions. First, just on Trivago, looks like [indiscernible] about 37% last quarter to about 27%. Anything specific there or is it just rule of large numbers? And second, on Orbitz, traditionally they have been softer or a little weaker in international and on the hotel side. Anything you are going to do or is it just really being on the Expedia platform will help Orbitz out on both of those areas? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : So Trivago, I would just say it is a little bit of a law of large numbers. I mean the U.S. is now their largest market. They are well deep into clean comps into the U.S., so that is a big factor. And remember, foreign currency is just a big headwind on this business. They are a euro denominated business and foreign currency neutral 49% year-over-year growth. So we're still pretty happy with that. If that's a slowdown, we're okay with that. On Orbitz yes, they are traditionally weaker international hotel, etc. and also product mix. Definitely that is something we can help them with. Having access to our global footprint of now over 270,000 hotels around the world, having access to our international air and car and soon rail content can only help the Orbitz business. I think as Dara mentioned, we've become pretty darn good at attaching hotel to air tickets. And one of the great things about Orbitz is they have just got a ton of air traffic. So we think that is a good opportunity which should help them on the hotel side as well. Dara Khosrowshahi : We certainly saw a strengthening and a product mix shift with Travelocity when they came onto our platform. And we expect to see a similar shift -- I think Orbitz on balance was stronger in hotel than Travelocity was. So maybe we won't see as much upside, but we saw it happen with Travelocity and hopefully we will see it happen with Orbitz as well. Operator : And with no further questions in the queue I would like to turn the call back over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President Investor Relations. Alan Pickerill : Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today. Dara, do you have any closing comments? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, just a big thank you to our employees for another great quarter and to our investors. You should know that this is a team that is not satisfied with where we're. We always want to do more, we will always want to do better. We want to give better service to our customers and we're not done by a long shot. It is not a bunch of people here who are sitting comfortably in their seats. So we're looking forward to further travels with you. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President Investor Relations at Expedia. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill : Thank you good afternoon, everybody and welcome to Expedia's financial results conference call for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31st, 2015. Pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP Operations. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, February 10, 2016 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release which is posted on the Company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck. As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015 which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. But in order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis. Finally, unless otherwise stated all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. With that I would like to turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. I wanted to start right upfront thanking our employees all over the world for another strong year for Expedia Inc. Mark, Allan and I get to tell you about and take pubic credit for the success of the company, but it's the amalgamation of everyone's dedication and good work that adds up to the figures that we\u2019ll review today. And figures tell a consistently strong story. Gross bookings for 2015, up 24% to $59.7 billion and total revenue up 19% to $6.6 billion. Our customers bought 35% more airlines tickets, 36% more room nights totaling more than $200 million for the year and 37% more car days in 2015 versus 2014. We delivered nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year, impressive in its own right, but specially so when you consider the huge headwinds from foreign currency, the significant investments we are making in resetting our contracted marketing structure with our hotel partners and the deal related costs that we incurred in connection with our busy year of M&A activity. Speaking of M&A 2015 was an unprecedented year for Expedia as we completed over $6 billion of strategic acquisitions which included Travelocity and majority stake in our AirAsia joint venture. A significant minority investment in Decolar, Orbitz Worldwide and most recently our largest acquisition ever in HomeAway.  These transactions have consolidated and scaled our U.S. operations, extended our international reach and have opened up a new leg of growth in the alternative accommodation sector. We also divested our stake in eLong for a nice profit and entered into a long-term alliance with Citra. Briefly on Orbitz the integration is progressing well with nearly all of the direct type in traffic of Orbitz.com and CheapTickets already on the brand Expedia platform. It's early but results so far are promising. The migration work will continue to the first half of 2016 followed by optimizing the sites and tuning our variable marketing channels post migration. We\u2019re also actively working on other parts of the Orbitz business, including eBooker\u2019s, Hotel Club, Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business. Our goal is to migrate the vast majority of our Orbitz for Business clients onto Egencia platform before year end. We\u2019re also in active dialog with our OP [ph] and private label partners on expanding our relationship with them and we see these efforts carrying through 2016 and into 2017 for certain partners. Moving forward, we\u2019re planning to invest aggressively in our private label and partnership capabilities and consider this area highly strategic for our company. I\u2019ll also add that we\u2019re very pleased with talent level and execution capability of our Orbitz teams all over the world. The people and the brands we\u2019ve added to our family will play an important role in our future success. It\u2019s very early, but we\u2019re encouraged with HomeAway\u2019s Q4 performance coming in a bit ahead of our expectations and have been consistently impressed with the level of talent there. HomeAway will be operated largely as a standalone business and will serve as the end-to-end vacation rental and a home sharing platform for Expedia, Inc. family. That said, we plan to be highly involved with the HomeAway team helping them expand aggressively and move from their traditional listings model to a fully online transaction model. The team is beginning to introduce of service fee to travelers and we expect that it will be fully launched on its U.S. vacation rental listings in the coming months slightly ahead of schedule. Around the same time, we\u2019re rolling out lower supplier commissions for paper booking listings as well as a book with a confidence guarantee, which is designed to encourage travelers to book on HomeAway and give them increased piece of mind when they do. We started an integrated marketing campaign in some of our major markets and intend to reinvest incremental upside from traveler fees back into the business. Particularly in product technology and marketing, we remain confident in our estimate of 350 million in adjusted EBITDA for HomeAway in 2018. We continue to see strong growth for Trivago into Q4 and in fact for all of 2015. We\u2019ve had some investor questions in regards Trivago\u2019s core growth and profitability and we\u2019d like to share some numbers for European markets versus the rest of the world. To take out the noise created by foreign exchange fluctuations, the numbers here are stated in euro. Trivago delivered 2015 standalone revenue of roughly \u20ac490 million, up nearly 60% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA of a few million euro. Now within these numbers, their most mature European markets collectively had revenue of over \u20ac250 million, up 20% year-over-year and with the contribution margin after direct marketing costs of about 25%. Trivago\u2019s rest of the world markets had revenue of \u20ac235 million, up nearly 130% and contribution margin just above breakeven. Know also that overhead cost for Trivago have been running in the neighborhood of 10% of revenue. While we expect Trivago to achieve healthy top and bottom-line growth in 2016, we\u2019ll continue to reinvest profits from core markets to further scale in expansion markets on a worldwide basis. The Trivago seems first rate and we believe that the global growth run rate for this brand continues to be substantial. Lastly, underpinning our active M&A strategy in investment in high growth businesses is a core organic business that has never been stronger. Brand Expedia, Hotels.com or Expedia Affiliate Network business all had terrific years delivering healthy room night and adjusted EBITDA growth. Egencia our corporate travel business had another excellent year, signing up over 1.1 billion of new client business and delivering 12% adjusted EBITDA growth. Supporting all of our brands, our lodging supply team is also firing on all cylinders signing up nearly 60,000 new directly contracted hotel properties in 2015, up over 30% year-on-year. Since I opened my remarks with our accomplishments of the company, I\u2019ll close with some thoughts about key challenges. Competition for consumer attention is as strong as ever, as our competitors and in some cases our partners invest and innovate aggressively. We\u2019re also jumping into the alternative accommodation space where there is already a sizeable competitor and where we have a significant business model transition to undertaken at HomeAway. And as I described, we have heavy integration work with Orbitz. These matters along with the volatile global macro-economic climate together create a very dynamic and challenging environment to say the least. That said, our businesses and our teams no strangers to these types of challenges. We\u2019re focused, we\u2019re hungry, we have an establish execution and capital allocation record and we take these challenges ahead on and with confidence. With that, I\u2019ll hand it to Mark. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Dara. One quick reminder before I get started. As was the case last quarter in order to help with comparability, our comments today are focused on Expedia results excluding eLong. Since we sold our 62% in eLong last May. Financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through that date of the sale. We are quite pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015 excluding an estimated headwind of $10 million to $15 million from the impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the negative impact of HomeAway in the quarter, not contemplated in our prior guidance. Our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth exceeded the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. In the fourth quarter, top-line growth was driven by solid unit growth across products, geographies and major brands. But first we are getting a boost as we consolidate Orbitz, but despite the law of large numbers, our organic growth rates continue to be very healthy and comparable to the rates of growth we\u2019ve seen for the last couple of years. In hotel revenue grew 24% on room night growth of 39%. The inorganic contributions to hotel revenue and room night growth were 14 and 15 percentage points respectively. We estimate the negative impact on Paris with around 300 basis points for both measures. Revenue per room night was down 11% in Q4, and a 5% decline in average daily rates. Note that the gap between revenue per room rate and ADR has narrowed this quarter compared to Q3, principally on reduced foreign exchange impacts. We do expect to see continued year-over-year pressure on revenue per room in 2016 if you trade some of our unit economics to drive volume in global scale. Air revenue was up 61% on ticket growth of 70% partially offset by decline in revenue per ticket of 5%. Expedia continue to grow ticket volume at a healthy organic rate, along with the sizable contributions from recently acquired companies. Excluding acquisitions Air revenue grew 6% on ticket growth of 22%. Key to our strategy is to grow additional travel products alongside air tickets and room nights. We are pleased to see some good examples of this in Q4, including 66% transaction growth for our local activities business and 43% revenue growth for insurance product. We also continue to see solid growth in our advertising and media business with Trivago growing standalone revenue 27% or approximately 43% currency neutral, fairly consistent with the year-over-year growth we saw in Q3. Media solutions also grew revenue nicely with the boost from the addition of Orbitz. HomeAway finished 2015 strongly and a bit ahead of their plans as measured on a standalone basis. For Speedy Inc. HomeAway contributed revenue this quarter for approximately $20 million which has been classified as other revenue in our product classification. We are breaking out HomeAway as a segment, so you will be able to see their standalone performance on an ongoing basis. Because HomeAway is in the process of moving to an online booking model and a fair bit of the bookings still occur outside of the platform we are not planning to report gross bookings or unit growth for that business at this time. Although the seasonality for business can cause the shape of our P&L to vary quarter-to-quarter we continue to drive to results that use leverage achieved in key expense categories to fund aggressive selling and marketing investments around the world. In Q4, excluding the impact from Orbitz and HomeAway the P&L we delivered was largely consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing grew a bit faster than revenue, while cost of revenue in G&A grew slower providing leverage. Our technology and content expenses did grow faster than revenue and nearly 6 percentage points faster than Q3, on the combination of higher people costs along with lower capitalization rates. We continue to scale up our core infrastructure and brand Expedia technology teams to support organic growth and to drive the integration of our new OTA brands. And as such we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth at least through the first half of 2016. Importantly, our results for Q4 included the first full year of Orbitz and the layering in of the HomeAway standalone financials for the 17 days of the quarter that we own the business. The operations of Orbitz for the full quarter along with deal related and integration costs resulted in an approximate break-even adjusted EBITDA contribution for that business in Q4 which included a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $27 million. Overall the Orbitz results were a bit better than we had expected on a combination of lower integration cost and better overall performance. HomeAway had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of $14 million in Q4 not contemplated in the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. This included the results of the business the negative impact of deal related costs and a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $6 million. Briefly as we enter a new year I would like to remind folks of a few keys aspects of how we manage the business. We are committed to stricken a balance between delivering healthy profit growth in the near and mid-term, while making key investments in our business that will allow us to grow sustainably over many years to come. From a practical perspective this means that we only see certain upside and/or outperformance for month-to-month, for quarter-to-quarter including from acquisitions. We have a bias to reinvest at least a portion of that upside back into the business. As part of this approach we do not guide to quarterly results and investors should not expect to see the full amount of organic over performance or M&A related windfalls drop immediately to the bottom-line. This is an important tenant for how we are running our business and we want investors to fully understand this approach. Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. On a consolidated basis including all the businesses we own today, and excluding eLong, we are expecting full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 35% to 45% year-over-year. The contribution to this result from a full year of Orbitz and HomeAway combined is expected to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. In terms of the shape of the year, we are expecting particular pressure on Q1 adjusted EBITDA. Due to the seasonal nature of our business back end loading of adjusted EBITDA dollar growth is not unusual but we do expect the impact will be especially acute in 2016. This is due primarily to integration of Orbitz and the timing of synergy realization which will ramp in the back half of the year along with the transition at HomeAway. As a further reminder, note that we lapped our acquisition of Wotif in the fourth quarter 2015 and we\u2019ll lapped booked the Travelocity acquisition and the consolidated of the AirAsia-Expedia joint venture in Q1 which will create tougher comps. Further the roll out of TripAdvisors instant book product will also likely continue to be a small headwind on room night growth in 2016 with an insignificant impact on profitability. From an expense stand point including Orbitz and HomeAway while we will see leverage in costs of revenue and general and administrative expenses in 2016, we expect technology and content expenses to grow faster than revenue primarily driven by integration efforts and the inorganic impacts of our recent acquisitions. Regarding taxes as you might imagine, there is lots of moving parts, especially related to newly acquired companies and our international versus domestic mix. However, we currently expect effective tax rates in the mid-20% range. Finally, some directional color on our CapEx trends. In 2015, we saw significant CapEx growth with about half of the dollar growth attributable to the purchase of our future headquarters. Spending for real estate in general also was elevated as we continued to grow our market management team aggressively and built out new office space around the world. In addition, we invested heavily in servers and other hardware in anticipation of future organic growth and upcoming integrations. To a lesser extent an increase in capitalized software development costs also contributed to year-over-year CapEx growth. For 2016, we expect a much more moderate pace of CapEx growth, most of which will be driven by the inorganic impact of recent acquisitions. With that, let\u2019s move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Thanks. Maybe two quick ones for Dara and one for Mark, housekeeping. First Dara, can you talk about the macro environment? Obviously a lot of fears with some of the RevPar data out there? What you\u2019re seeing in maybe U.S. and Europe. And then the S4, a lot of us have read it, really interesting commentary on the HomeAway acquisition. And there is a 2018 number of 2.34 billion in EBITDA. Can you comment on that number at all, how important that is, is that something a target or how you think about that number? And then Mark just to confirmed your guidance. Is the number you\u2019re suggesting 35% to 45% growth, is that off the 1165 or the 1103 and EBITDA this year? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. Thanks Justin. As far the macro environment goes we listen to the same news that you do and certainly the new suggest that the macro environment is pretty uncertain and the stock market downright scary. That said, when we look at the macro environment and how it effects our business one important factor and our business is the air business. And air ticker prices are down pretty significantly year-on-year, it\u2019s obviously some of the savings of oil prices that are being passed on by the airlines to consumers. And that\u2019s an unambiguous positive for us, the more lower air ticket price is go, the more, the leaser traveler tends to fly and more the leaser traveler test to fly, we have a bit of what we think is a strategic investment, strategic advantage on air side. And the more leaser travelers we have flying for more opportunity we have to sell hotels and insurance and cars and everything else to them. So to some extent weakness in oil and air side is a pretty big positive for us. On the hotel side, while we have seen ADRs weaken a bit between call the beginning of the year and Q4. When we look at Q4 trends into January, we don\u2019t see anything of note one way or the other. There are some spot issues obviously Paris is weak, which is perfectly explainable. New York ADRs continue to be down year-on-year, although they improved over Q4 and that\u2019s European travelers really traveling into the U.S. and affected foreign exchange. In Asia, we see certain markets like Hong Kong and Macau down as far as ADRs ago. But again no significant shifts when we look at Q4 trends into January that are of note. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll watch and to the extent that we see anything, we\u2019ll certainly share it with our investors. But we\u2019re not seeing any material moment one way or the other right now. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then Justin, on your question on 2018 consolidated EBITDA that was contained in the S4. Listen at the time of the acquisition, we put forward some forecast for what we believed or possible outcome for consolidated Expedia, Inc. results over the course the next three years, did not account any upsides or any significant investments, it\u2019s a possible outcome. So I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of weight on that. That was then combined essentially with the HomeAway projections and we did not at that time contribute to the combination of those results. Listen I think you can look at it as a possible outcome, but it certainly not something that I would use as guidance and I think as you know we make discrete discussions for month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. So there is a lot that can change between now and 2018 and we\u2019re just really focused on continuing to have a business where we can deliver consistently strong growth rates over a long period of time. In terms of the guidance, the 35% to 45% growth is off of the 1,165 which is the Expedia, Inc. full year 2015 number excluding eLong. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark S. Mahaney: Thanks. Two questions, I wanted to follow-up on Justin\u2019s question. So if you do that 35% to 45%, it kind of imply that the core business is going to grow, your guidance imply something like 9% or 10% at the low end and to 19% at the high end, so call it 10% to 20% just to round here and that\u2019s obviously a little bit more aggressive than the kind of guidance for the core business you gave going in the '15 so it does sound like all in business conditions are getting stronger of Expedia, but just want to make sure I\u2019m interpreting that numbers and stating that right. And then secondly in terms of the -- you guided for revenue per room night continuing to come down in '15 and the question I want to ask is, will it come down at the same pace, or accelerated pace or less of a strong pace. In other words what we saw in the quarter was that 11% year-over-year was a little less than we had seen in last couple of quarters, are we starting to see a fade down in that pressure you are seeing on revenue per room night? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Mark I'll let Mark take most of that question, but one thing I will remind you as far as the core business is that foreign exchange was a really, really significant headwind for our core business this last year, and while they will continue to be a headwind in Q1 and Q2 it ease up in the back half of the year. So all things being the same that will be a benefit in 2016 versus 2015. I'll let Mark answer the others. Mark Okerstrom : Yeah. I\u2019ll just say, just again to clarify on the guidance. I would take that as core implied guidance so of course to 8% to13%, I would take the high on the Orbitz-HomeAway impact and subtract it from the high on the total and the low from lower side. I wouldn\u2019t take our guidance as being up to 19%. And then also our revenue per room night, we've been saying for a while that the gap between revenue per room night, you can think about that as call it the 300 to 800 basis points range and it moves around. I think what you will see in 2016 is you are going continue to see that range of movements towards the back half, I think there is possibility as we start the comp over some of the margin reductions we did this year, that start to ease and then I think you'll start to see I would expect some more easing in that as we move through 2017. And again this is with regards to the gap between revenue per room night and ADRs. Of course ADRs are one of the biggest drivers of overall revenue per room night movements. Operator : We go next to Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan : Yeah thanks two questions. Just on the HomeAway, I know it's still early days for the transition to the online booking, but can you just talk about what kind of penetration rate you think you can reasonably get to by the end of this year in terms of the percentage of booking happening online versus enabling the business. And then I had a follow up on the guidance, so I think Mark you called out the contribution from the two acquisitions Orbitz and HomeAway to the EBITDA numbers, but I think previously you talked about Orbitz seeing synergies of up to or in excess of $75 million, is there any update to that number? Mark Okerstrom : Sure, why don\u2019t I take the last question first and then Dara can chime in on HomeAway. So just again on $275 to $325 of adjusted EBITDA contribution for the two acquisitions combined. First of all I'll just remind people that are on standalone basis we had said Orbitz was on track to do around a $135 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2015, it came in a little bit ahead of that, but I think that as a decent base in HomeAway, little bit better than $120 million and adjusted EBITDA from 2015. They will both have purchase accounting headwinds in 2016 both around $10 million each. So, you can think about that it\u2019s about $20 million combined. So take that as your base and then the way that we get to obviously the higher number is synergies, and a lot of that is going to come from Orbitz and it's going to come in the back half of the year. In fact in the first part of the year we are going to be in a position not unlike where we were with Wotif where were essentially carrying almost double cost, we've built up teams to support the integration of the Orbitz businesses on to the brand Expedia platform for example, at the same time is maintaining the Orbitz existing platform and that is really once we get the platform transition done which is really happening in the first half of the year for the big consumer businesses that\u2019s when you start to see synergy realization come in and that\u2019s really starting again in the back half of the year and we're hopeful that by the end of the year we should be pretty close to a run rate number, but we are not going to be even close to that in the middle of the year and we'll probably be sub that, there will be a detriment in the first part of the year. Dara Khosrowshahi : And as far HomeAway goes as of the end of the year we had about 60% of our total listings online bookable we don\u2019t disclose the actual percentage of bookings that run through our listings and we are going to be working on increasing the percentage of online bookable listings in 2016 and get it much closer of 100% as much as we can. Really, we're going to be pushing online booking, offering it to our partners and that along with the book would confidence guarantee for travelers, we think it's going be a win for the travelers and it\u2019s as also going to be win for our supply base as well and that\u2019s really the focus of the business. We will try to obviously drive the online booking volume. But that is really much more of a long-term goal for us as a company and I think 2016 is going to be about kind of setting the base, making sure the technology infrastructure is right and making sure that we\u2019re taking any and all kinks out of the online booking process to make it incredibly easy for travelers and incredibly easy for our subscribers as well. We don\u2019t have a specific target for percentage of bookings going over the trends so to speak for 2016. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Tom White from Macquarie. Tom White : Just first on room night growth, you talked a little bit about headwinds from the booking.com instant booking implementation. Could you maybe comment on what sort of headwind that was to room night growth in the quarter. And then just a follow-up on HomeAway and moving ahead with instating this consumer booking fee. I guess when HomeAway was independent, we could see how that extra margin would really help them from the seat, would be really helpful in terms of competing and investing against Airbnb. But now that\u2019s part of bigger Expedia. How do you guys sort of weight the benefit of that booking fee in terms of increased monetization versus the possibility that it negatively impacts the consumer experience? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks Tom. So I\u2019ll start with the room night growth and then turn it over to Dara on HomeAway. So there were a few headwinds for us on room night growth in the quarter. We had about a 400 basis points harder comp partially on the back of lapping over some pretty strong growth in Travelocity with the commercial agreement implementation. And then also Wotif which we were lapping over in the quarter. We also had about 300 basis points of room night growth impact from the terrorist attacks, we estimates -- so both of those were pretty significant headwinds for us. In terms of the instant book impact. I think, if you talk about that in the 100 to 200 basis points range that would be a good barometer. And then just in terms of expectations for 2016. We are expecting to see some deceleration in room night growth as we move through the year. We\u2019re also copying over acquisitions and consolidations again in 2016 Travelocity for example ramping up Wotif on variable marketing channels, the integration of Brand Expedia Asia. So just keep those in mind and then to the extent that TripAdvisor roles out instant booking more broadly which we currently do expect them to do. And we continue to not participate in that that could be an incremental headwind and think about that as larger than 100 to 200 basis points, it could be 200 to 300 basis points. But again insignificant from the perspective or profitability. Dara Khosrowshahi : And as far as HomeAway and the booking fee goes. We\u2019re going to be watching it very closely we obviously want the consumer experience to be great and we are obviously going to be watching the percentage of bookings running over the system. We think with the book with confidence guarantee, we are going to give our consumers, our travelers a lot of confidence as far as booking with HomeAway and making sure that they get what expect, making sure that if they have any issues regarding quality or the deposits, et cetera, they\u2019re taking care of. And then we will be watching other metrics such as the traffic to the sites. The conversion rate of consumers coming and who look at listings, the renewal rate of our subscribers. So there are a host of other metrics that we are going to watch and meter in order to measure kind of what is a balance approach, which is, we do think that we are under monetizing relative to our volume and making sure that as we move to call a market monetization rate, we are providing great experience for travelers who are coming and looking for a great place to stay on HomeAway and we are bringing great value to our supply as well. I will also remind you that the booking fee is something that has been widely expected as far as Airbnb and TripAdvisor go. Airbnb is always had a booking fee, TripAdvisor introduced the booking fees last year. Those transitions have gone very, very smoothly. Our pricing is going to be quite competitive. So this is something that has already been market tested and we feel pretty good moving into this model based on the competition already being that. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks guys. I want to ask a little bit these kind of second derivative affects you have. You\u2019re talking about an integration. So first you connect the infrastructure and the plumbing and then the machines and the [indiscernible] would glean to that and learn and then you apply those learning and optimize. Specifically with maybe Orbitz or maybe in even away if that process is going on there too. Is the process lengthening at all just on the sheer scale or size of those integrations or maybe how is this process playing out currently? Dara Khosrowshahi : I\u2019d say Brian, on the Orbitz side actually, while we haven\u2019t gone through the full process. I would anticipate that Orbitz would actually be a bit quicker than Travelocity and Wotif, because the Orbitz team that was already employees, they had an online marketing team that was very sophisticated, they have an analytics them that is just excellent. So, a number of the folks have been there with Orbitz, they understand these optimizations, this is something they've done before, we are just hoping that as we move them over to our supply base and as we move them over tech stack they\u2019re just going to have a machine that is much smoother and better than the machine that they had to work with in the past. So, we don\u2019t anticipate any hiccups, as it relates to Orbitz you never know. And at least the trends that we\u2019re seeing early on are encouraging, I things most will be on track. HomeAway is a very different animal, HomeAway is not an integration that team is going to be largely independent and activity with HomeAway has been to make sure frankly that that team is not distracted as being part of Expedia. I think we\u2019re freeing up a bunch of their time to focus from call a public company activity, to value added activity, building a great consumer experience, building a great subscriber experience and because we are very, very familiar with this transactional model our product and technology teams are already working with them to make sure that the road maps are what they should be I think the second area where we can add value is making sure that as this volume comes online or as these listings come online, we are not only pushing HomeAway traffic to them but also Expedia and Hotels.com traffic to them which I think is a significant value both for the HomeAway subscriber base but also for the Expedia and Hotel.com consumer base as well. Mark Okerstrom : Well I'll just say one thing on Orbitz, since that we do have in addition of the Orbitz, to CheapTickets business which is the big consumer business. We also have a numbers of other businesses that are going to take a little bit longer to integrate Orbitz\u2019s partner network for example. We\u2019re super excited about that business and we\u2019re taking the steps necessary to do that right making sure we work with partners and come to the right outcome for example, Orbitz for business is another one we\u2019re pretty excited about the speed at which we are going able move that those clients over to the Egencia platform, but again it is going to take a little bit longer and both of these transitions are new and that we haven't done a lot of these before unlike the core consumer business. So, in terms of synergy realization I would just keep in mind that until those businesses are migrated you don\u2019t get to see the full platform of retirement benefits that you would if it was only Orbitz, CheapTickets and eBookers that were transitioning over. Operator : We move next to Mike Olson with Piper Jeffery. Mike Olson : Hey good afternoon. Just two questions here. You mentioned TripAdvisor in support impacting room nights in 2016 at the extent that you don\u2019t participate. So could you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the model or other similar models in why Expedia may or may not be interested in participating? And then secondly, do you expect the impact of the Paris attacks will continue beyond one or two quarter time period or is that relatively short term issue that you wouldn\u2019t expect to impact the business beyond Q1? Mark Okerstrom : Hi Mike I'll answer the second one first which is you never know, historically these kinds of attacks have resolved fairly quickly. I\u2019d say Paris in general, we saw immediately kind of an effect on broader European destinations. That effect looks like it disappeared, but there is certainly is, continues to be an effect in on Paris t\u2019s getting better, but trends in Paris are certainly poor compared to the trends that we had seen before Q4 of last year. I think that Paris is going to continue through the year, it was horrific event and I think it was the kind of event that stays in people's memories. So, I think that there will be some effect going into the balance for the year and we\u2019re going do our best to make up for, we\u2019re going to do our best to work with our partners over there and really continue to promote Paris as a wonderful destination that it is. So, hopefully it won't last long, but my personal feeling is that there will be some effect going into the balance of the year. As far as the trip and instant book and how we view that channel. We've been very consistent about how we view any variable channel including in some book in that we look at the economics of a channel based on called the immediate transaction and then we look at the economics of the transaction based on the right sum of value of the customer both in terms of customer repeat rate and the percentage of the time in which those customers repeat directly with us second third time around. Obviously the latter is much, much more valuable. The initial let's say version of instant book was I think quite unsatisfactory as far as branding, et cetera, and representation of where the customer was really transacting with, and the latest iterations that we've seen with booking.com and with some of the supply direct partners, for example Marriot look a lot better they looked much more clear. So, I would say at this point instant book looks better to us than it did when instant book was initially launched. But we don\u2019t have any comments as to what the ultimate decision is going to be down the road. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] for Doug. Thank you for taking our question. I have just a follow-up on the HomeAway. So on HomeAway, you guys mentioned the traveler fee will roll out in the next coming months. But could you clarify a little bit more on the timing and the roll out plan a little more. And then could you comment on your marketing approach for HomeAway in 2016 and what drives the confidence on the 150 EBITDA number in 2018? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I think as far as HomeAway goes, we are rolling out now in the U.S. and the speed of the rollout is going to depend on the reaction of customers, conversion rate, how it\u2019s working out with subscribers, et cetera. So the rollout will move quickly to the extent that we see things working out and we will be debugging actively. We will then once we\u2019re done with the U.S. or once we\u2019re well underway with the U.S., we\u2019ll look at the rest of the world. But listen these rollouts are live rollouts and we don\u2019t want to hard code a specific rollout cadence. Obviously we want to roll it out as quickly as possible, making sure that our customer experience and our subscriber experience is terrific. As far as the marketing approach for HomeAway. We do plan a significant year-on-year increase in Brand Marketing and HomeAway for 2016 that\u2019s included in the numbers that Mark related to you. It\u2019s the marketing campaign is already started and the early signs and we\u2019re about five markets in the early signs as far as visits to the HomeAway sites look really good and we\u2019re encourage by the trends that we see. Once online booking really starts to expand, we will be able to throw up variable marking channels as we get variable economics on the revenue side. One of the issues with the subscription listing product is that, you don\u2019t earn money on every single transaction, your earning money on kind of annual subscription. So you can\u2019t necessarily bid for the incremental transaction.  Once we have online booking extended along with the traveler fee and volumes rollout there. We do think that we will be able to increase variable marketing channels. But we think that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to happen in the back half of the year as opposed to the front half of the year. On the question of the confidence in the 350 million EBITDA in 2018. We made those estimates based on a set of assumptions, early set of assumptions and so far in the couple of weeks that HomeAway has been a part of the family. We are more impress than we were when we made those assumptions. It\u2019s 2018, it\u2019s a long time from now, but I think what we wanted to communicate is that, you kind of go into a company, you meet to people, you take a look at the look at the technology stack and the product roadmaps and either it\u2019s good news or bad news and at this point with HomeAway is good news for us. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : A couple if I can. First forgive me if I missed this, but when you talk about the 2016 contribution from Orbitz in a way of 275 to 325, what is embedded in that in terms of the deferred revenue that you won't recognize? I know in the S4, you said HomeAway alone could be as high as 107, but is there an assumption that you can share with us around how much is excluded from that? And then second if I can, just curious if you could give us a sense for what you're seeing from early beta hotels on the accelerator bided [ph] take rate product and when do you think that might rollout more broadly and what kind of impact it might have on revenue per room night headwinds you've been seeing? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Sure Lloyd, I\u2019ll take the first one and then turn it over to Dara. On the 275 to 325 there is about $20 million of purchase accounting impact embedded in that. About half of its Orbitz, half of its HomeAway. The bulk of it will unfold in the first quarter with some of the HomeAway stuff taking a little bit longer to bleed off. It is -- the HomeAway impact is a fair bit lower than we had anticipated/feared at the time of the acquisition. We dough in very deep with our auditors and advisors and came to the conclusion that there was a significantly larger portion of it that we can recognize than we had anticipated, so good news on that front. Dara Khosrowshahi : And as far as accelerator goes, it\u2019s a very, very early. We are training our market managers who are now going out there and explaining the accelerator in the market. And we\u2019re seeing in certain markets, we are seeing engagement with our hotel partners, the partners who have engaged with accelerator products are pretty darn happy, which is great. You want client who like the product. And so we see accelerator starting to contribute to our overall numbers. In general accelerator is a move in the direction of having much more of a marketplace model for our margins. So that hotel of yours can bid up when they need volume, they can go to base bid when they don\u2019t need volume and also along with kind of bidding you get the quality of content of the hotel, the high lease Hotel, treat our customers to the quality of service, et cetera. And user reviews all mixing into a combination of the best hotel for the best customer and also economics that hotelier want to bid at and obviously hopefully economic that work out for us. So, we are very early on this journey, the signs that we\u2019re seeing with accelerators so far are encouraging, we are not making aggressive assumptions in our 2016 plans for accelerator, but if any of our market manager teams are listening, we expect you to do better than the conservative plans that we have. So, we are hoping for the best, we are not counting the best. Operator : We go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : I noticed Barry Diller recently gave an interview saying that Expedia was far from done on M&A. So, Dara, one for you would be on capital allocation, how you think about the mix of assets you have now, geographic, as well as sort of capabilities under the broader Expedia, Inc. umbrella, and so how you think about allocating capital going forward towards M&A and continuing the strategic vision. And then number two would be, there's been a lot of comments of late from some of the inventory side like Hilton and Marriott with respect to lower commission rates and last room availability. Wanted to get your take on how the industry dynamic is playing out around lower commission rates, more stable commission rates versus last room availabilities as a theme. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, as far as the M&A front, we will be opportunistic as far as our capital allocation goes. I think that the team is more inwardly focused right now looking to go out and aggressively acquire although we have a terrific corporate development and strategy team who are constantly talking to anyone and everyone. When we look at the portfolio of assets that we have especially with HomeAway as part of our family we feel like we have a full portfolio, we feel like we don\u2019t have any competitive holes and if we don\u2019t engage in any M&A for the next two, three years we'll be perfectly happy. That said, we do want to extend our international coverage I think we are in general too U.S. dependent, at this point it\u2019s really good thing because the U.S. economy is the strongest economy in the world. So it is positive now but five to ten years from now, shame on us if we haven't grown significantly more outside of the U.S. and in all the markets Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Europe etc.  Second area where we absolutely want to grow in scale is, in the corporate travel market. Obviously we are very strong in leisure travel, corporate travel we think it's an enormous opportunity. It's a higher yield customer sets that our suppliers favor. The demand patterns are quite complementary of leisure demand patterns and we want to get bigger, we want to scale and we see growth ahead for Egencia that is a combination of organic as well as inorganic growth and we think that\u2019s going to continue for some time going forward. And then we\u2019ll also look for kind of innovative new companies out there. Trivago obviously was a terrific one and it's a very, very value part of the family, we've made some investments in Alice for example on the supply technology front. So, we will be opportunistic wing as far as transport goes we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic, we\u2019ll continue to shoot bullet, so to speak, and see when opportunity is out there in the world. That said the business throws off a lot of cash flow and historically I think before this year there was a fair amount of Capital allocation going to buybacks and to the extent that we don\u2019t see anything external and to the extent that we like our own stock and typically we have liked our own stock. We will look to allocate some capital internally as well. So, it's kind of the world is our oyster and we're throwing off a lot of cash and we will try our best not to waste it. As far as the noise and the chatter with the chains, et cetera, we continue to be strong partners with the hotels, in general our volumes with independents and chains have grown significantly and our strategy with our chain partners is no different than our overall strategy which is to lower our base commissions, so that there is very little friction in working with us. And then really any hotel, whether they are a chain or independent can compete in our marketplace for share and this is a big marketplace, the marketplace is only growing and if you got competitive pricing and you got great content and you treat our customers really well and you provide excellence availability along with margins you will do well in the market place. So I think that the ultimate call it performance of the chains and the relationship with the chains and the volumes that we do with chains is really going be based on kind of chain bidding in our marketplace against independents and in general we see our chain volume, they've been healthy for a number of years and we expect to see them healthy on a go forward basis. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jet Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Can you touch on what HomeAway subscriber churn has been since the acquisition, and what is your current plan around subscription pricing? And then a follow-up. Have you seen an increase with vacation rental CPCs, particularly in regards to home -- to Airbnb closing its recent funding route? Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as the one that I can make a comment on is that renewal rate in Q4 actually improved and where the highest renewal rates for the year. So we are very happy about that. As far as an increase in vacation rental CPCs, we haven\u2019t see any one way or the other. So I can\u2019t really comment on that. Operator : We\u2019ll next to Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Dara, you continue to very quickly add supply to your property portfolio as you adjust your fee structures. So setting aside the removal of about 20,000 indirect relationships for the fourth quarter, I think you added about 73,000 in 2015. So just wondering if there's a way for you to accelerate the pace there? Additionally, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the type of incremental properties you are adding. Are these larger properties, smaller properties, and is the room count per property similar to what's already on the platform? And secondarily, I almost hate asking this question, but directionally, are you seeing any impact from steps on countries maybe taking Europe to tighten their borders due to the refugee crisis? Thanks Dara Khosrowshahi : Okay. As far as a supply question and the pacing of our supply adds. We\u2019re pretty happy with the pacing. So we tend to accelerate the pacing of ads to the extent that we see higher penetration in certain markets. A higher penetration means that we\u2019re sending plenty of demand into a specific market, which means that we can acquire more hotels. And at this point, we are seeing kind of the growth of demand into the marketplace and the growth of supply be about right. So I would expect the same in 2016 and as we are adding more supply and as the new inventory contribute revenue into our marketplace, we then go on a higher more market managers. It\u2019s a formal that we\u2019ve add in place for about 18 months and I see no reason to change it certainly looks like it\u2019s working. As far as the kind of supply that we are adding, as we are adding more supply, we are attending to add supply in secondary and tertiary markets and the average number of rooms per hotel is going down. So when we look at contribution from new hotel ad, it\u2019s not something we disclose, but it certainly that we certainly look at internally. The contribution per hotel ad is going down and it\u2019s going down because if kind of supply that we\u2019re adding and it\u2019s kind of working exactly to formula, so it\u2019s exactly what we would expect to see.  As far as the impacts from countries and the refugee crisis, et cetera. We haven\u2019t seen significant impact other than travel to I would say broad areas that are expected by the refugee crisis or directly affected, it is obviously down. But we haven\u2019t seen kind of second orders stuff, so travel into Europe in general has continued to be pretty healthy and we\u2019re not seeing any significant step changes and demand patterns there. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Ron Josey : Just wanted to follow up on two, please. Dara, you may have mentioned I think on Eric's question around hotel commissions and really the readiness of the marketplace. I wanted to understand a little bit more as commissions come down, as the marketplace takes into account how that relates relative to your comment on the accelerator program being very, very early. And then also, just another follow-up on Orbitz and the contribution to EBITDA, could you quantify maybe, Mark, or help us understand the cost savings related to the charges you took around 130 million to 150 million related to employee severance and comp benefits that were announced in November on Orbitz? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as the comment on accelerator program being earlier. It\u2019s literally because we\u2019ve just launch the program. So this is a product that we co-complete on it in Q4 and we\u2019ve been working with the market managers and hotel partners on launching it officially and that something that will kind of continue as we move through the year. It is a bidding type of product. So as you can imagine this marketplace type products tend to grow over a period of time. As you get more players engaging in them. So it\u2019s early, we like what we see, but again we\u2019re not making any heroic assumptions financially as it relates to tourist accelerator program. But it certainly a good start and we think it\u2019s a terrific product that is going to be a real winner for our hotel partners. Mark Okerstrom : And then Ron just on the restructuring charges and how that flows through to EBITDA contribution. I would just say that in the $75 million run rate synergy estimate that we initially put out. A big chunk of that was headcount related cost reductions essentially, there is a little bit of revenue in there as well. But predominantly headcount related. So I would look at the severance changes as being related very closely to that number. I would also say that in the overall big number is a fair bit of equity related compensation which does now show up in adjusted EBITDA obviously so it\u2019s harder to translate and add them to adjusted EBITDA impact and lot of that related to senior team that\u2019s not there. So, hope that\u2019s give you little bit more color. Operator : We will go next to Ken Sena with Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thank you this is Connor [ph] on for Ken. Just to clarify was there a FX impact disclosed for the adjusted EBITDA guidance? Thanks Mark Okerstrom : Yeah Conner, there wasn\u2019t. But direction I could say that it is a bit more than the impact to revenue, I\u2019d think it about 600 to 700 basis points range maybe a little bit higher. Operator : We move next to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman : Following up, I guess, on an earlier question you discussed the outlook for travel and for leisure travel, what's the outlook for business travel in the US, particularly thinking in the oil country ought and outside the U.S. Also, one thing that hasn't been discussed is car rental. What do you see is the impact of Uber on the car rental business in the U.S. and Europe? And finally, just I kind of missed the 35%, 45% EBITDA guidance is compared with what particular number for 2015? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Sure as far as the corporate travel and the trend that we are seeing. We got some caution, I think the teams are cautious about client sales in general because of the macroeconomic environment, the most clear trend that we can point to relating to oil pricing is in terms of our business in the Nordics as you know we acquired Via and integrated into Egencia and we do see volumes in the Nordics regions in general weak and that is very much related to oil prices is being down significant on a year-over-year basis. In general transactions, corporate transactions look good, we're not seeing call it very significant spent cuts one way or the other like we saw a couple of years back, We are seeing some trading down. So the revenue per transactions or gross booking per corporate transaction is down a bit and we think that\u2019s just cautious practice from some corporations out there trading down call it from premium class to economy class or taking a train instead of taking a plane. But those are I would say on the edges, we\u2019re not seeing some big theme one way the other as far as corporate travel changing significant one way the other.  As far as the car rental and impact of Uber. You know our car rental business is we think very early in its development. The volume in car days is up very significantly on a year-on-year basis, over 30% on a year-on-year and most of that business is in the U.S. and we think we have a ton of potential as far as our car rental business in Europe goes. So, I just think we are on a growth path at this point that is not going to be effected by Uber we are not going to feel call it market numbers one way the other just because the growth rates that we have are so high. If I were to generalize in Q4 other trends that we saw on the car business on the hotwire side we saw a higher concentration, I\u2019ll call it, agency booking versus opaque bookings. We tend to make more money on opaque bookings. So, that was one trend that we saw but otherwise nothing to say, hey this is Uber who is having a material effect on the business, to speak off. Mark you want to talk to the other question? Mark Okerstrom : Yeah Michael on the guidance, the 35% to 45% full year, year-on-year growth including HomeAway and Orbitz is in relation to the $1.165 billion and adjusted EBITDA for 2015 which is Expedia Inc. excluding eLong. Operator : At this time we now set your limit yourself to one question. We go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Stabler : Dara, a high-level one. On loyalty programs, obviously Hotels.com and Orbitz have pretty high profile offerings. What kind of appetite do you have for further investment behind those programs, and should these programs be expanded, or are there other platforms in the Expedia family where you should roll further ones out? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, absolutely. I'd also add that Expedia has pretty significant loyalty program and I think between Hotel.com, Expedia and Orbitz we are running pretty close to 40 million loyalty members on a global basis and I would say our appetite here is unlimited and way to explain that is that the variable economics behind these loyalty programs are all working. In other words, look at the points costs, we look at the ultimate redemption value of those points to the percentage of people who are using the point, our customers who are using the points and when they use them. And then we look at the behavior of the consumers and like-for-like consumers, who are in the program versus behavior of consumers who are not in the program and how that behavior changes in terms of repeat characteristics and in terms of channel mix. When we look at those factors and compare it to the point costs. These loyalty programs work. So as long as the factors are now changing, as long as these repeat characteristics aren\u2019t changing, as long as the channel mix isn\u2019t changing and as long as the ultimate redemption value isn\u2019t changing, then we will look to expand these loyalty programs as aggressively as we can on a global basis. There are some countries where the programs work really, really well. For example, we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprise in the Asia-Pacific regions where loyalty has really taken off and for example on a welcome rewards basis, it\u2019s got the highest penetration, I\u2019ll call it welcome rewards or hotel rewards. Excuse me, it\u2019s got a high differentiation hotel rewards bookings as a percentage of the overall customer base. So we see some customer bases, who love these programs in the Asia-Pacific regions. But in general, the variable economics look good and we will continue to invest aggressively in these loyalty programs on a go forward basis. The other reminder that I would put forward is that the points cost that we take are upfront, the benefits from these loyalty programs or trailing benefits so to speak. Because you get the repeat benefits, you get the channel benefits down the line. So as we\u2019re growing these member basis, typically we\u2019re paying an upfront costs and we\u2019re building of a pretty substantial asset. We think this is a great competitive moat that we\u2019re building around our brand and we attempt to keep investing behind that moat. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : I wanted to ask about Airbnb. There's been a lot of discussion about how Airbnb is impacting the hotel industry. Can you give us some color on what you are seeing in your hotel business from Airbnb and how you are thinking about that as the year goes on? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : We were debating Kevin when we would get the Airbnb question. So thank you very much for that. Listen we\u2019re not seeing -- we don\u2019t see significant effective Airbnb on our business. I would relate it to the answer I gave with car. Our growth rates are substantially different from industry growth rate. So just because we don\u2019t see, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not happening. We have said that Airbnb in general and HomeAway are adding inventory in the marketplace, launching inventory in the marketplace and it\u2019s becoming more and more clear that there is a certain set of customers, who sometimes we\u2019ll stay at a hotel, sometime we\u2019ll stay in an Airbnb or HomeAway home.  So anytime you increased supply, you will put pressure on pricing. So we anticipate pressure on pricing, we do see it sometime during periods in which there is Super Bowl let\u2019s say or events happening in city that users to sell out, we have absorb that it sometimes get harder for a hotel yield up during those events and sometimes whereas in the past, we would not have inventory for those events, we intend to have inventory for those events. So in some way you could consider a positive as it relates to our marketplace. And then finally anytime you have more supply you put pressure on pricing. You as an intermediary meeting us, want to have access to that supply and whereas before HomeAway was part of the family, we didn\u2019t have significant asset to that supply and our goal was to build out that access to supply on an organic basis. Now that HomeAway is part of the family, we have access to that supply and we will continue to build access to that supply on an organic basis. So we think now that HomeAway is part of family Airbnb effect is going to be a positive factor for us, but it\u2019s very early in this evolution. And at this point, other than those spot circumstances when markets are kind of sold out because of big events, we\u2019re not seeing it affect our specific trends. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin Patterson : Just wanted to touch on Trivago. Appreciate the disclosures you gave earlier on the call on the mature markets versus the rest of the world. Could you talk about just how you are thinking of reinvesting in the rest of the world and when we should see that growth rate start creeping up to the contribution margin of the mature markets? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Sure Justin. It\u2019s hard to give you precise numbers around timing of when we might expect to see better contribution in the rest of the world. This is a business that operates on a very quick cycle time. We invest, we see return and we see return we like, we continue to invest. I think the big change that will ultimately drive better rest of the world contribution is the ultimate penetration or maturity of the U.S. business. It\u2019s an absolutely huge business now for Trivago, but still growing very strongly and they continue to see pocket of availability to invest into the U.S. At some point over the course of next three years, maybe it's this year, maybe its two year from now, maybe it's three years from now that market will get so big that they are fully penetrated and it does start to look from a profitability perspective anyway like they\u2019re more in mature markets, but at this point it's really too difficult for us to give you color on when that\u2019s going to happen. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I just want to underline what Mark was saying as far as the decision making for the company, if you look at our technology infrastructure and upgrader tech infrastructure, from a design element we\u2019re going from much of a call a batch data design to real time design. Batch data is data comes in and goes into some data warehouse, analyst come in, analyze it, a decision is made and based on that decision you take actions, real-time is a total flow of data coming in, you are analyzing the data on a real-time basis and you make decisions real-time and that kind a same idea, that tech design idea is something that we\u2019re taking to our business. And we are making, we don\u2019t want to be making a decision on Trivago marketing investments based on something that someone put on a piece of paper as part of our annual plan because then the paper is kind a running your business. We are instrumenting our businesses so that we are making the right tomorrow and the day after and the day after, and the day after and whatever the result is then that\u2019s an optimized result for real business purposes and for the purposes of our investors, then an optimize result to hit a number on a piece of paper. We take our annual guidance with you seriously but there are lot of different adjustments that we are making with our businesses and we make those adjustments real-time we don\u2019t make it because someone put a target on a piece of paper. Operator : We move next to Dan Wasiolek with Morning Star. Dan Wasiolek : Just wondering what percent of your total bookings are coming via direct and maybe how that's trended over the last year and any commentary on how you might view that trending over the next few years? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Carefully guarded information, but I'll give you some directional color on it. One is that, obviously as we have built these big loyalty programs both in Hotel.com and at Brand Expedia and certainly Orbitz does have this benefit as well with the Orbucks program. You do build on your direct business that\u2019s one of the core strategies of having those loyalty programs. So, as those programs mature and they are getting big we do see an increasing amount of our bookings coming direct. So, that\u2019s the first point I\u2019d made. Secondly, as in our mature markets like U.S. we do see a significant amount of our business coming to us direct type in responding to email using the app for example. And in less mature markets where we don\u2019t have establishment the vast majority of traffic actually comes to us from variable channels and the goal is over time and we do this as we enter new markets and as they mature over time is to acquire these new customers and have them turn into repeat customers and build a business in places like Vietnam and Korea for example, that look a lot like the U.S. I think Dara had has made some comments over the course of last couple of quarters calls that one of the trends that we have seen is that the growth rates of our direct channels and the growth rates of bookings from our indirect or variable marketing channels were starting to get close together and I think that\u2019s a trend that we had continued to see, and we are hopeful that something that can continue over a long period of time as we built these loyalty programs and as our international markets mature. Operator : At this time I turn the call back over to our speakers for the additional or closing remarks. Alan Pickerill : Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today. Dara, do you have any closing comments? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, just great job to the Expedia team on the world wise basis and in particular to the teams that are working on the Orbitz migration, it's a lot of work we appreciate it and a big welcome to the HomeAway team. So, thank you very much. Look forward to an exciting 2016. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President Investor Relations at Expedia. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill : Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Expedia's financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. Pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP Operations. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, April 28, 2016 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release which is posted on the Company's IR Web site at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content including today's earnings release. As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015 which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis. Finally, unless otherwise stated all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. With that I would like to turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. We are off to a solid start in 2016 with our financial performance coming in a bit better than expected pretty much across the board. This was underscored by continued strong momentum in the unit growth with global room nights up 37%, air tickets up 52%, car days up 48% and advertising and media revenue growing 44%. Results were strong in Q1 across all of our major brands , resulting in organic room night growth of 24%, consistent with last quarter despite about 500 basis point harder comp. Brand Expedia and Hotels.com each saw healthy room night growth across all regions with Hotels.com accelerating in Q1 versus Q4. Expedia Affiliate Network delivered room night growth above 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter, continuing to gain share versus our competition. And Egencia transaction growth accelerated in Q1 compared to Q4, although we saw signs of corporate travel spend tightening in the form of lower average booking values per transaction. Going forward through 2016, we expect overall room night growth to moderate due to harder comps and law of large numbers largely offset by decrease in headwinds on revenue per room night. The Orbitz integration is going well with Orbitz.com and CheapTickets now on the Brand Expedia platform. We are particularly pleased with hotel conversion and room night production on both Web sites, which are benefitting from the upgrade of technology platform along with a depth and breadth of our hotel inventory. We have completed the move of hotel club traffic and customers over the Hotels.com and we expect the eBooker\u2019s migration to be complete this summer. Integration affords for Orbitz for Business and Orbitz Partner Network are on track that will take us through 2016 and beyond in certain cases. Today we announced some significant changes at HomeAway as we continue to accelerate the transition of our platform from advertising to transactions. In the U.S., we\u2019re moving to a single and simple subscription model of $349 annual for listings that are online bookable and $409 for those that aren\u2019t. This will allow us to begin to optimize the sort and the properties consumer see by matching their unique travel preferences with the right listings while driving booking volume for owner and manager communities. With booked transactional revenue up 170% year-over-year in the quarter, we took the opportunity to more than double our direct marketing investment, in order to drive more traffic to our sites and partners, while also offsetting some weakness that we\u2019re seeing in Google SEL volumes for some of our brands. These model changes and marketing increases along with investments and product and technology talent, will pave the way for an improved strategic and operational footprint in the category that\u2019s becoming more and more popular with travelers all around the world. We are also seeing encouraging volume trends in the alternative lodging category for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, which bodes well for a future state when we fully interweave supply and demand across all product categories within our global lodging marketplaces. Lastly, Trivago is off to a terrific start in 2016 with standalone revenue of 176 million, up 48% year-over-year. Trivago\u2019s core European markets grew revenue 33% on a euro-denominated basis and acceleration from 20% we saw in 2015. While the top-line for the rest of the world grew 69%. The team continues to refine and improve its marketing methods and products in a way that not only benefits advertisers but should also improve Trivago monetization margins over the long-term. Now I will turn it over to Mark on the financials. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks Dara. We were pleased with the results for this quarter, that were a bit better than we expected. We saw solid execution across the board and also benefited from some timing differences. Easter shifted into the first quarter this year and we also deferred some marketing spend planned for Q1 into Q2. Together, we estimate these factors shifted just over $20 million of adjusted EBITDA into the first quarter from the second quarter. Organic unit growth rates across our core brands were again healthy and on a consolidated basis, the addition of Orbitz and HomeAway along with the final quarter of inorganic contribution from the consolidation of the AirAsia/Expedia joint venture boosted total growth rates. In total, excluding eLong, adjusted EBITDA was up 31% year-over-year in Q1. Orbitz and HomeAway together contributed 35% percentage points or $44 million of growth. In line with the usual seasonality of our business adjusted EBITDA for the rest of Expedia, Inc. was down 4% collectively as our brands, but marketing spend to work and incurred other variable costs to drive bookings ahead of the heavy travel season and for which revenue will be recognize in future quarters. The anticipated acceleration in the growth rate of technology and content expense did impact materialize and was also a factor impact in the bottom-line growth rate. In terms of product line performance, hotel revenue growth of 25% was driven by room night growth of 37% partially offset by decrease in revenue for room night of nearly 9%. Acquisitions added 13% percentage points of room night growth resulting in an organic growth consistent with last quarter. The gap between an ADR decline of just over 3% and the decrease in revenue per room night was about 540 basis points and consistent with that in the fourth quarter. Ongoing reductions to our contracted hotel commission rates around the world, which are aimed at expanding the breadth of our global lodging inventory and the impact of our fast growing and successful loyalty programs continued to be the main drivers here. We continue to see solid performance in both our air and car products as well. Air revenue grew 54% year-over-year and 52% volume growth. Car revenue was up 39% and 48% growth in car days partially offset by 6% decline in revenue per day. Orbitz added about 34% percentage points and 27 percentage points to air and car volume growth respectively. Added media revenue was up 44% year-over-year in Q1 driven by strong performance at Trivago and good growth from our media solutions group. Orbitz added about 4 percentage points of total ad and media revenue growth. The overall shape of our P&L this quarter was generally consistent with ongoing goal of using leverage in key expense categories to fund aggressive selling and marketing investments around the world. As I mentioned earlier, technology and content expense wasn\u2019t exception in Q1 for a quite bit faster than recent trends on an organic basis, this faster rate of organic growth was driven by Trivago or ecommerce platform group and Brand Expedia along with increased data center costs. Note that we continue to incur additional costs in our core business to support the integration of new Orbitz brands. Additionally, we were pleased to be able to fill a number of open technology rules in the core business with talented teams from Orbitz as they rolled off their Orbitz duties. This is a great outcome from a strategic and operational standpoint, but did accelerate overall hiring into Q1, which otherwise would have occurred on a more metered basis throughout the year. Note that all of these is within our previously communicated expectations throughout 2016 would likely play out and we expect to see these elevated levels of tech and content expense growth through Q3 with growth in the fourth quarter moderating. Against the backdrop of a strong start to the year, I don\u2019t want to remind you that we continue to strike a balance between delivering healthy near-term profit while also investing to position the business for continued medium and long-term growth. In that regard, when we see outperformance or windfalls either from our organic business or from acquisitions, we have a bias to reinvest at least a portion of that back into the business. This is part of the reason that we do not guide to or place undue emphasis on one specific quarter\u2019s performance and this quarter is no exception. Turning to our financial expectations for 2016, we are reiterating the guidance we gave to you on our Q4 call. On a consolidated basis including all of the businesses we own today and excluding eLong. We continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 35% to 45% year-over-year, included in that growth we continue to expect that Orbitz and HomeAway combined will deliver adjusted EBITDA of $270 million to $325 million. I would also like to remind you about the relative shape of our year. Despite a strong Q1 we do expect the vast majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth will come in the back half of the year. And I would remind folks that certain tailwinds in Q1, such as the Easter shift will be headwinds for Q2. As such I would encourage you to take close look at quarterly phasing with our Q1 beat largely unchanged first half guidance and completely unchanged full year guidance in mind. The usual seasonality of the organic business will be amplified by recent acquisitions with integration and transition investments for both Orbitz and HomeAway in the first half of the year, expected to make way for synergy realization in the second half. Finally in terms of capital allocation, we are pleased to have repurchased 2.9 million shares for $312 million so far this year. We will continue to balance capital allocation between M&A, share repurchases and our dividend. Now let me hand it back to Dara for few last comments and then we will take your questions. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks Mark. Just a few closing comments to frame where we on the bigger picture before moving to Q&A, over the past several years, we position Expedia Inc. to be the most comprehensive travel distribution platform for the world was ever seen. We have organically built on unrivaled geographic reaching awareness for our flagship brands Expedia and Hotels.com. We have invested billions of dollars in our technology platforms and establish Expedia Inc. at the forefront of product and technology innovation in the travel industry. An advantage will continue to press for years to come. Like many industry disruptors, we haven't only invested to creating offering with superior price transparency selection, ease of use and value for our travelers. But we have also been systematically reducing the cost of distribution for a travel supply partners. Lastly, with addition of Trivago, Travelocity, Orbitz and most recently HomeAway, we have deployed capital to not only make ourselves strategically complete. But more important top set up the opportunity for significant shareholder value creation over the coming years. Our teams are motivated, excited and hungry and if we do our jobs, I think you will be very happy shareholders. All of us, here at Expedia are absolutely up for the challenge and the journey, we hope you are too. With that let's move to Q&A. And operator, will you remind participants how to queue up? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instruction] We will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Hi Dara, two questions please. First, on alternative accommodations, you mentioned that as a promising growth area. If you could talk a little bit about the operational challenges that would allow -- that Expedia has to overcome. Do you think about them more as inventory, marketing, user interface? Just talk about how you break through that morass to tap into what is a large market. And secondly, you made this comment about moving away from organic search. Is that a reasonable way to think about how you are thinking about marketing in the future? It seems like what Google has done is forced people away from it. It probably plays to some of your competencies. But just talk about the balance of organic versus paid search for your business going forward? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as alternative accommodations and the challenges there go, we are trying to actually not think too many big thoughts here. The main activity is behind HomeAway, and the HomeAway team has an incredible knowledge of the homeowners and managers and what they need and it's build up an incredible tools out there. And we want to combine that knowledge with the kind of knowledge that we have on the Hotels.com and the Expedia side as far as what travelers want. And when you combine those two you can create a pretty powerful platform. We obviously done on Expedia and Hotels.com side so we know what has to happen and right now the HomeAway team is heads down and really building up the infrastructure that you need in order to build a global transactional travel platform and it's a bunch of technical work being done, design work being done what we have done it before and actually we have -- the HomeAway opportunities is so attractive that a fair bit of talent from the Expedia teams are moved over to the HomeAway teams to help out, one and also because they see just an enormous opportunities. So that is really is just day to day execution on the HomeAway front. And I think on the Hotels and Expedia front, once we get the HomeAway inventory -- higher percentage of the HomeAway inventory, online bookable, once we feed it into Hotels.com and Expedia and Orbitz and Travelocity in an integrated manner, all signs point to that inventory producing very well. We have been adding some apartment inventory mostly in urban centers etcetera on Expedia and Hotels.com and it is producing and it\u2019s producing very well and it\u2019s clearly kind of inventory category that our users want. As to your search question, we are seeing some of the moves I\u2019d say broadly from Google, for example they\u2019re adding a fourth paid search link, move a higher proportion of traffic from free to paid. Unfortunately, we are a company that has built up some pretty strong capabilities on the paid search side. So we\u2019re able to kind of bring in the volume any way, it is probably a next headwinds for us on the margin side, but this is a headwind that we\u2019ve been living with for a number of years and it\u2019s a headwind that we\u2019ve been able to grow through and so it\u2019s nothing new. We seen this kind of we\u2019ve heard this song before and we\u2019re up for the dance. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome, next question? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Two questions, maybe one for Dara. How has HomeAway gone since you\u2019ve added the booking fee? How has that effected booking growth and what are you seeing there? I know you gave a metric on the call. And then maybe, Mark, you could talk about the implied margin growth in your guidance for the year with a lot of EBITDA in the back half either maybe talk about by brand or what really has to happen to make those EBITDA numbers work out? Maybe you could talk about the synergies and other things? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I\u2019ll start with the HomeAway. Listen, the results that we\u2019ve seen, the early results of the booking fee, as you know we launch a booking fee a bit earlier than we had anticipated. The early results have an excellent and transaction booking growth is up very big 170% and that will be revenue that we recognize kind of down the pike in Q2, Q3 based on a stay. So you don\u2019t see that revenue coming yet, but we\u2019re very, very optimistic conversion general has held up very well, actually better than we have plan. Listings growth is actually very healthy and certainly healthy compared to historical trends. And we are taking a very significant portion of our services, revenue and putting it either back to customer. So for example with the guarantee and we are putting in marketing money to make sure that we\u2019re driving traffic growth on a global basis. So I\u2019d say at this point, while there is certainly going to be some questions from homeowners in the community et cetera, I think the HomeAway team is executing very, very well in the plan. We still have a long way to go, but so far, so good. Mark? Mark Okerstrom : And then Justin on your question around, I think you\u2019re really getting at why they backend loading and how aggressive is the ramp. Listen, we feel pretty good about it, I mean one of the reasons we feel pretty good about it is, it\u2019s largely a cost story, which is, we\u2019ve got some pretty modest expectations on the top-line and the organic business comps are going to get harder there, we\u2019re not expecting anything herculean. And really what we\u2019re doing over the back part of this year is a couple of things. One is that, we are going to see a ramp up at HomeAway with the traveler fee and that\u2019s just going to build as the year goes on. We feel good about that, we already see progress. On Orbitz, we are getting that business onto the Expedia platform, already got Orbitz and CheapTickets on the rest will come through most of this year with the laggards. And once we get those businesses on, we can start to shave off some of the excess costs that we had in the first part of the year. So that\u2019s a cost story. And then I would also just go back and revisit, some of the one timers that we had a Q3 and then also particularly in Q4, if you recall, we had some very significant purchase accounting impacts from Orbitz we had some purchase impact from HomeAway. And then in both cases pretty significant deal and integration cost in Q3 and Q4 that just aren\u2019t going to repeat themselves. So again, we feel pretty good about it. It\u2019s a cost story and we think it\u2019s very much achievable. Justin Post : Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You\u2019re welcome. Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan : Yes, hi. Thanks. A couple of questions, Dara, can you, or maybe Mark can quantify it, can you just talk about Europe and any impact from the Brussels bomb and if you saw anything in your business? And then on Trivago\u2019s performance, the business [indiscernible] and the core European market accelerated. What was driving that? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. So with respect to Brussels, anything time something like this happens and we hope never to see it, but it does happen from time-to-time. We do see an impact to the precise area that was challenged. And certainly we saw that with Brussels in the form of higher cancellation rates, certainly lower bookings into that region. Because we\u2019re such a big global business though, on an overall basis, there is really no meaningful impact from the Brussels attack as far as we can see. And this was very different from Paris. When the Paris attack happened what we saw was a overall tone of feat that not only hit Paris, but also hit number of other major investment centers. We didn\u2019t see a similar thing with Brussels and of course Brussels as a destination is just significantly smaller than Paris. With respect to Trivago in, sorry not as big as Paris. Yes with respect to Trivago, the business is just performing really well. One of the things to keep in mind when you are looking at the reported results is that foreign exchange is the big impact on Trivago that eased significantly this quarter. But FX neutral it did accelerate and I would just put it down to just strong execution, the business is doing well, they have been tuning their algorithms and really getting to marketplace tuned to matching what's best for the consumer with what's best to monetize for them and it's working. Mark Okerstrom : And I think just the one possibility what we haven't exactly pulled this out. You can imagine that the core Trivago markets had much more than affect as result of the Paris attacks in Q4, which obviously we didn\u2019t feel as much this year. Naved Khan : And then a quick follow-up, on the accelerator, can you provide us any kind of update there? How extensively it has been rolled out and what's the response that you are seeing from the hoteliers? Mark Okerstrom : Yes, it's very early the roll out has happened on a global basis. We have got 1,000 of hotels now participating in the accelerator program and the number increases on a weekly basis. I would remind you that a hotel can't just build up with accelerator really know if they don\u2019t have high quality, if they don\u2019t have great reviews, if they don\u2019t have really good conversion. So the first that our hotel partners have to get right they experience and to have terrific converting site with terrific pictures, then really accelerator becomes available to them as a tool. But we have seen very strong engagement and it's been a positive both for our supply partners as well as our consumer, so, so far so good. But it is still early in the year. Naved Khan : Great thanks. Mark Okerstrom : You\u2019re welcome, next question. Operator : And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We will go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian Fitzgerald : Thank you. This question is around Egencia. You said -- Dara, I think you said the bookings accelerated. You cited several new agreements in the press release. Is there any inflection going on there and how do you feel about the pipeline in terms of Egencia's deals? And then also are you seeing any benefits from the integration of Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business? Is that impacting there also? And related to that, any reason why the timing or path of a business-oriented synergy realization would differ from a consumer facing segment like CheapTickets? Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as the Egencia deal, listen the Egencia team has consistently been executing and gaining share in the corporate travel marketplace over a number of years. This quarter wasn\u2019t any exception, I think that one new factor in Egencia's growth is that it is become a very, very credible choice for the largest of companies out there to use. So we have always been very strong in the small and medium business segment, that makes us quite attractive to our supply partners because a lot of let's say is the big chains and some of the Airlines have a hard time reaching into the small and medium businesses. But as Egencia has build out a more robust toolset for CFOs on the cost side, on the care side. You have some very big businesses such as P&G using its toolset. The volume goes online, consumer love it compared to the traditional players out there. And it's a win-win. It's a cost win, it's a consumer win and just kind of Egencia continues to march along. And you certainly see some of the pressure there, there has been a fair amount of them leadership turnover and some other competition and Egencia team has been together for many years and they continue to execute on a consistent basis. And I do think that\u2019s the product roadmap, the technology roadmap that Egencia looks better than it ever has and I absolutely expect the pace of innovation there to accelerate if nothing else. As far as the Orbitz for the OPN business or Orbitz for Business to be clear. Orbitz for Business is going to be a part of Egencia and we are going to be rolling over Orbitz for Business customers on to the Egencia platform throughout the year. We are off to a very, very good start there. The Orbitz partner Network business is kind of the private label business, we have got some big clients such as American Express, that group is going to go into our Brand Expedia team and our EN team or Expedia Affiliate Network based on the nature of those relationships, those integrations take longer because they are quite -- they can be much more complex and as soon as a result that integration work is going to go into kind of late this yearend and in some cases even into 2017. Mark Okerstrom : Brian, I would just add to that, when you take Orbitz for Business out of the Egencia segment, we saw acceleration as well. So it wasn\u2019t just the inorganic impact. It was healthy across the board, both room night and ticket growth accelerates in Q4 into Q1. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks Mark. Thanks Dara. Mark Okerstrom : You bet, next question. Operator : And we will go next to Mike Olson with Piper Jeffery. Mike Olson : Overtime, revenue generated from the HomeAway booking fee could be pretty significant, obviously. And while I'm sure some of that is going to fall to the bottom line, it sounds like you'll plow a lot of it back into the business. What are you investing that incremental revenue in? Is it primarily HomeAway marketing or does it migrate into accelerating other growth initiatives for quarter Expedia or other segments that we may not be factoring in at this point? Dara Khosrowshahi : I\u2019d say there are three areas. One is certainly product and technology is going to take some significant investment to build out a global transactional infrastructure. Second is marketing, both on the brand marketing side, but also building out more robust variable marketing platform. Because HomeAway was, HomeAway revenue was much more based on subscriptions and to some extent not related to traffic and conversions. HomeAway couldn\u2019t bid on variable channels the way that some of our other brands can, more traffic means and higher conversion means, more transactions means, you can bid more on variable channels. HomeAway didn\u2019t have that factor and any time you bid up into variable channels typically your margins initially are lower and then you optimize to get to a higher return place. So certainly product, certainly marketing, we are going to reinvest a fair amount of the fees also to the consumer experience to make sure that they\u2019ve got a great experience, to make sure that they get the home that they expect. So I\u2019d say those are the three big factors. Another factor to be aware of, and it\u2019s an announcement that we made today is on a go forward basis, we are going to simplify the subscription product, which is going to take away some of the premium tiers that we had sold previously. And that\u2019s going to be a revenue negative, which we do believe is going to be offset by transactional revenue, but we are taking some revenue out of the system, which then we have to replace through transaction. Mike Olson : Right, makes sense. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome, next question? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Tom White with Macquarie. Tom White : Intra-quarter there was some increased I guess news or commentary from some of the large hotels about trying to drive more direct bookings and taking some steps to try and make their rooms and rates look more competitive versus what is shown on the OTA sites. And maybe just brief comments on whether you are seeing any impact or expect any impact from that on your business, and then just a clarification on the Egencia commentary, so the transaction kind of the unit growth was strong, but tightening of booking values. I\u2019m just curious how that has related to the leisure business historically? I mean is that a leading indicator ever or anything we should read into maybe what might happen in the leisure space? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. Let me take that one first and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Dara. So we saw strong volume growth, but we did see a reduction in average ticket prices, average daily rates. We think some of this was essentially trade down activity, particularly we saw this in Europe so people are still taking their trips they are just looking for a more cost effective way to do it. We certainly do look at the corporate travel business as a leading indicator of what is happening in the overall economy. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching very closely. That said, we don\u2019t see any real impact of any softening of the economy in our leisure business at this point. Beyond what\u2019s happening more broadly with pricing in the market. Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as the hotel chains driving direct bookings, listen, I think it makes sense for any player out there whether an e-commerce sector or in the travel sector, to make sure that you have a balance source of traffic and revenue. It is very early at this point, but we are not seeing any significant effect on our volumes. What we are seeing is that the hoteliers who provide us with the best pricing, with the best inventory are gaining share on a relative basis in the marketplace and they gain share two ways. One just directly through bookings, and also remember that they also gain audience share, because they\u2019re higher up in the sort order and very often consumers are kind of clicking from our results and going and checking out the hotel direct. So I think the players who are giving up the best inventory are gaining both booking share and audience share within our marketplace, our marketplace has been a marketplace that has been growing within the overall travel market, we have been gaining share for many years, I don\u2019t see that changing in the volume trends at this point, don\u2019t suggest that that\u2019s changing. So listen every player is going to make their own decision and I think that the supply partners, who are play well with us, who really provide a traffic experience for our customers over a long period of time are going to gain share in our marketplace and we\u2019ll build a traffic partnership together over the long-term. Tom White : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome, next question? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : A couple on HomeAway, first, just it looks like some of the changes you are not going to enforce the online book ability with one of the new subscription plans. And then it looks like you are adopting almost an accelerator model for HomeAway. So hoping you can comment on the philosophy behind those two changes. And then a second question on HomeAway, if I can. There\u2019s been some speculation in the industry that some of the changes in traffic have been the result of just SEO snafus at HomeAway blocking Google from crawling parts of the site, suggesting that when they are fixed some of the traffic could come back quickly. But wondering if you could just give us some clarity on what some of those issues might be on the SEO side, how permanent are they, internal, self-inflicted versus Google driven? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, absolutely, as far as HomeAway and the philosophy there goes is listen we want to create a marketplace that is flexible but also provides the right incentives and what is very-very clear as it relates to our travelers is that, they want unlike online booking, so the subscription price for one of our partners, who is providing online bookings is significantly lower than someone who is not online bookable so to speak and we think that kind of provides the right incentives in order to create a healthy marketplace that works for both sides. From a philosophical standpoint we do want to build out toolsets, that allow our supply partners and this is that Expedia or Hotels.com or HomeAway to have a very low entry base price and then to be able pay when they need to the bit demand or when they want to demand, it\u2019s a very flexible model, it\u2019s easy to get into the marketplace and then if you want to optimize to the marketplace, you can absolutely optimize to it and those are tools that we have built that on Expedia and Hotels.com. So I think those of tools that we anticipate building out with HomeAway as well. And HomeAway being part of our family definitely gives us an advantage there because we have done it before. On the SEO side I don\u2019t want to get into too many specifics, there are some SEO effects that are structural, such as in general some of the search results being moved down the page or the free search results being moved down the page, some of the SEO results are results that we can optimize around and we can kind of build technology around but so I would say that the HomeAway team is definitely not standing still and we\u2019re hoping to improve the SEO trends in the meantime though our direct traffic trends are super-super strong and the team is more than making up for it. Operator : We will go next to Ken Sena with Evercore. Ken Sena : So you mentioned for HomeAway that you are doing more in the way of moving it from an ad model to something more transactional and subscription-based. We're certainly seeing through TripAdvisor and through Google where more is being done in the case of login and also assisted booking capabilities, trivago had a great performance, but could you maybe walk us through how you see that platform over time? And whether or not you might see more there too in the way of logged in and assistant booking, instant book and so forth? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think on the trivago side, listen the trivago team is very focused on what they are good at and very focused on kind of providing the ideal hotel for the consumer in the best way and so they are, I think the core of trivago which is, find the right hotel for you at the very best price is a great, great proposition and clearly one that\u2019s working on a global basis. Trivago visits in are up 17% on a year-on-year basis, I mean the business and the brands are growing incredibly fast. With trivago team is experimenting with assisted booking capability, they are testing it in Europe, we based on the test we expect it to expand, I would say that the approach for trivago has been one in which it\u2019s not about keeping the consumer on the site, it\u2019s about optimizing the consumer experience based on however the consumer wants to book. If the consumer wants to stay on trivago they can, if they want to go to a partner site, if they want to go to booking.com or if they want to go Hotels.com or Expedia, they can. So it\u2019s much it\u2019s very consumer focused then and I really commend the trivago team to for they are always solving for the consumer first and we\u2019ll see how the results go there they are very data driven but we do expect this booking capability to expand on a meter basis over the year. Ken Sena : Great and just maybe if I could, just one quick follow-up, organic room night growth for domestic and international, any chance of you providing that? Dara Khosrowshahi : No we are not going to do that on this call. We\u2019ll do whatever we have done in the past. Thanks. Operator : We will next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ron Josey : I want to ask a little bit about Orbitz. And I think you mentioned Orbitz.com and CheapTickets have been migrated over and those sites now have 130,000 more hotels to users and you also said you were pleased with more improved conversion of hotels and room nights. So can you talk about the speed at which you saw those conversion rates improved? And I believe, just to confirm are you on schedule with the overall migration onto the Expedia platform? I know you talked about 2Q and into 2017 maybe for Orbitz for Business. But I'm asking as it relates to the synergies that you all have laid-out and I think, quote, unquote meaningfully greater than that $75 million, so one on hotel conversions on Orbitz and the second is just the timeline please. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, so I just say that we\u2019re very much on track we\u2019re pleased with the conversation rates we\u2019re seeing, they are definitely in line with what we were expecting there is a benefit from having more hotels absolutely but we\u2019re not yet at a stop where we are really accelerating the growth of that business, that\u2019s something that is going to come over the course of the reminder of the year, because one of the challenges is we do have to get traffic growing again and we have to get that top line moving but, we are encouraged that we do have the conversion rates to actually do that. By and large, we are on schedule. In fact, Orbitz CheapTickets went over a little bit ahead income schedule, eBooker\u2019s is on track. HotelClub is now, has been migrated over Hotels.com. Many of the Orbitz for business customers have been migrated and the vast majority will be migrated over by the end of this year. The remaining piece that will be working on that will stretch into 2017 will be the Orbitz Partner Network. We\u2019ve got some big partners, some great partners there that have got some unique performance and will be working on transitioning those partners or alternatively just finding the best solution for them on the hosted platforms that we\u2019ve got. So all-in-all, we\u2019re on track and I think again we\u2019ve reiterate what we said on the synergy side 75 million was the original number, we do think we\u2019ve got meaningful upside to that. Ron Josey : Great, thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Dae Lee : Hi, this is Dae Lee in for Doug. Thank you for taking our question. My question is on TripAdvisor instant booking. Could you guys give us an update on the impact from the TripAdvisor instant booking rollout and whether you see any material change from three months ago? And then as a follow-up on trivago, you guys mentioned that with the instant booking rollout trivago is becoming a bigger channel in terms of traffic volume. Is there any update on that as well? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Sure, so on trip instant book, I would say no meaningful change from our last call, we said think about it in the 100 to 200 basis points impact on room night growth still in that range to the extent that they continue to rollout globally and that other largest global OTA participate globally, it could be bigger and it could get as heavy as 200 to 300. But so far quarter-to-quarter, we haven\u2019t seen a meaningful change from what we saw last quarter. As a reminder from a bottom-line perspective, no, we\u2019re not expecting any meaningful impact from at all. With respect to trivago, listen, the express booking product that trivago is rolling out still very much in the early stages and we certainly like what we see and we do think it\u2019s going to be a bigger channel for them in terms of volume. It\u2019s not yet at the spot where it\u2019s driving a meaningful difference for trivago. The core trivago product, the meta-search product is still driving that business. And really they\u2019re going to be a spot where they rollout instant booking at a rate that is commensurate with the consumer benefit and the advertiser benefits they see and that\u2019s going to, we expect, transpire through the rest of this year. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I think if the question was, is trivago becoming a bigger channel for us, because of trip instant books, our getting less traffic from trip instant book? The short answer is yes, because of that and also because trivago just growing really darn fast? Mark Okerstrom : Yes. Dae Lee : Great, thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Next question? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : On HomeAway, as you remove the subscription tiers, factoring in the page rankings, how do you plan to balance the individual owner being able to compete in the page ranking algorithm against the professional property managers that are using more sophisticated software and managing multiple listings? Dara Khosrowshahi : Well, I think, listen that\u2019s a great question. And the HomeAway team is very focused on making sure that they have a marketplace that individual owners can play in, because those individual owners, those kinds of FRBO listings are the heart and soul of HomeAway. And having a marketplace, we\u2019re obviously the professional PMs can operate in as well. And listen, it was true that professional PMs and individual owners were buying different tiers of subscriptions et cetera and they were figuring out ways to play in that marketplace. So I think that the rules of the marketplace are changing, they will be a bit more favorable through travelers and traveler preferences. So the owners who are updating their calendars, the owners who have great reviews, the owners who have traffic pictures and who put up pricing and are online bookable we\u2019ll attend to get more share in our marketplace and we\u2019ll make sure that we\u2019re making tools available for individual owners to do it, we\u2019ll make sure we\u2019ve got FAQs. We\u2019ll make sure that we\u2019re in contact with them, so that ultimately kind of the right product is showing up in front of the right customer. It\u2019s something that the HomeAway team thinks about a lot. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome, next question? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Dan Powell : Hi, guys, this is Dan Powell on for Heath. Just a quick two-part question here, first of all, with hotels going to loyalty-based pricing discounts for direct booking, is there anything in any part of your guidance for the rest of the year that anticipates an impact from that? And then secondly, do you guys see the potential for a model where Expedia could incorporate those loyalty prices into your search results either at Expedia Brand or trivago? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Yes, as far as the first part of that question is there anything in our guidance? There isn\u2019t because we haven\u2019t felt any significant impact one way or the other so our guidance is obviously is consistent with where we were at the beginning of the year and we haven't seen any material impact so it remains as is. Is there potential for Expedia to incorporate those loyalty prices? I think absolutely. We have been working with a number of our partners, chains, regional chains etcetera to work on more flexible ways in which we can work with them. We're testing link offs from our site on to the direct sites of some of our chain partners. We are willing to test promotions where we are -- where we will try to sign up loyalty members for them. Listen, we are a very big new customer acquisition channel for our partners and we want to help our partners gain new customers, and we certainly want to arm them with whatever they need in order to bringing that customer, give them incredible service and then hopefully get a customer for life. Because we don\u2019t that one goes against the other necessarily you got, you got services like TripAdvisor and Trivago who are linking off for a living and are growing incredibly well and we are much more willing to be very flexible and in our business models and we're finding engagement with some players out there and I think those smart players who play with us are eventually going to gain share over the long term basis. Dara Khosrowshahi : Dan the only other thing I would add is that you know we did mention that we are seeing some of these bigger chains that are introducing these rates loose share to independent hotels. Generally the commission rates with our independent hotels can be slightly higher the chain hotels, you know so far it looks like they're often more active participants in the accelerator program, so there could be some margin benefit if we continue to see this mix shift provided we didn't see any impact of volume which is what the case is right now. Dan Powell : Great, thanks guys. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome, next question. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Security. Peter Stabler : Just a quick one on HomeAway and then a follow-up, on HomeAway you mentioned transactional booking growth up 170%, just wondering how that compares to your internal expectations. And then secondly, you mentioned 13,000 properties added to the platform, 23% growth. Could you talk about the sustainability of that growth rate in terms of adding supply? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure as far as the transactional booking growth I'd say it's a bit higher than our original expectation, HomeAway is doing a bit better and we are investing a bit more aggressively. So in general like Mark said we're kind of taking the over performance and investing it back into the business and we think that's absolutely the right thing to do. Mark Okerstrom : And the metric there is transactional revenue on a booked basis, so it takes into account both the volume and the increased monetization on those bookings just to be crystal clear. Dara Khosrowshahi : And typically we don't recognize the revenue until the stay so there's a difference between booking and staying. And then as far as the 13,000 properties which we added to the platform, listen there are I think on trivago there are over 800,000 hotels on a global basis. We are -- we're getting close to 300,000 so I think we've got a very-very long road ahead of us here. Peter Stabler : If I could just -- one quick follow-up, have you said what percent of properties are now online bookable in HomeAway? Dara Khosrowshahi : We have not said that specifically and I will tell you that we are much more focused on driving online bookings versus trying to get every single property out there online bookable at this point. You know there's always going to be a tail, we haven\u2019t exactly kind of figured out a strategy, do we want to go to a 100% or do we want to go to 90%, you know what we want to do is solve for kind of the heart of the business at this point, optimize it, get it transactional, get the flywheel of higher conversion allowing you to market more, allowing you to gain more traffic. Gets that flywheel going and we're not as focused on getting every single listing out there online bookable at this point. We'll determine that over the year. Mark Okerstrom : That is how we did see the number of online bookable properties increase very nicely and that's really the metric we're focused on along with the core metrics that Dara mentioned. Peter Stabler : Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You bet, next question. Operator : Q - Kevin Kopelman : So, first on trivago, I think you guys had an option to increase your ownership stake in trivago. Can you give us an update on that? And then just a follow-up on HomeAway, can you give us a sense of what the dollar value of online transactions is today, either a run rate or last year or something? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Sure so in trivago there is an option to increase our ownership stake, there is a window of opportunity that window is currently open and we are in discussions with the management team there. It's just an absolutely fantastic asset, it's an absolutely fantastic team and at this point we have nothing to announce there is an opportunity for us to buy more, there's also an opportunity for us to do nothing this time around and we'll see which way we go here over the course of the next couple of months. In terms of the dollar value of online transactions not a number that we're disclosing at this point. Dara Khosrowshahi : You welcome. Next question please. Operator : We will go next to Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin Patterson : Two, please. First on HomeAway, just as we go into the summer months here, you've obviously gotten a lot of traction and getting more users to the site and have been investing aggressively here. Occupancy has been down a little bit in the hotel market. We still have low gas prices. Are you seeing any trading over to the HomeAway business now, just based off of your understanding of how that performed last year? And then secondly, this was your biggest buyback in quite some time. Could you talk about how you are thinking about capital allocation for the course of the year given the market volatility? Have you seen bid-asks come in on some of the private companies anymore? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Just on the HomeAway side, this has been a category that has been growing for some period of time and we look at HomeAway traffic and we look at listing counts et cetera. And the growth rates there are consistent with the past or slightly stronger and in some ways is that volume that is moving from hotel for home or is that just volume moving online. My bet is that that majority of that is just offline volume moving online, that\u2019s powered our hotel listing for some period of time. And we think that this category behind where hotels were. So I think it's really the move online that\u2019s driving this business at this point. But HomeAway is young in our family and as we observe the trends over a greater period of time. And as especially as we bringing this inventory into Hotels.com and Expedia, I think we will be smarter about telling you whether there trade all happening or whether it's net new volume, it's just too early at this point. Mark Okerstrom : And on capital allocation, listen in terms of philosophy I would say no change. We have always been buyers of our stock net, but of course we're always weighing that off versus M&A and to some extent our dividend last year obviously was a huge year on the M&A front. So we took a little bit of a break and this quarter we took the opportunity to get back into the market. And I would just say look at our past behavior excluding 2015 is a good indicator of what's to come. In terms of private companies, yes, I think there has been more reality injected into the private markets, to be honest, we were never a company that was that interested in talking to people with the lofty valuations that were flying around for a while. So we still see opportunities around. I don\u2019t think we will have a year active as last year, but we are always open for business and we on the M&A front and we like the fact that valuation seems to be coming back down closer to earth. Justin Patterson : Great, thank you Dara, thank you Mark. Mark Okerstrom : You welcome, next question. Operator : And we will go next to Dan Wasiolek with Morningstar. Dan Wasiolek : Just looking at the take rate in the core OTA business, it looks like this quarter the year-over-year declines lessened by a decent amount. Just wondering if you have any commentary or things to comment as far as the outlook for that take rate at some point maybe starting to stabilize further and potentially start to increase again on a year-over-year basis? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Yes, I think listen, there are few things that went on in the quarter I think one is that we did inject Orbitz into that core OTA segment that actually put a little bit of pressure on take rates that you back that out. Take rates are actually just slightly increased. The increase was caused by a couple of things, one is Easter shift revenue right into the quarter and there is no real bookings there and then also we saw a continuation of the mix shift into hotel away from air, again all of this excluding Orbitz. I would say I wouldn\u2019t expect a big trend there. We are hopeful that it will stabilize overtime certainly as we spoken about if you look over the next two or three years revenue for room night decline should moderate and I think that would be tailwinds for us. But I would say for 2016, there is nothing specific that I would say that it would indicate a change from what are seeing historically. Dan Wasiolek : Okay thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You welcome. Next question please. Operator : And we will go next to Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Perry Gold : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. Are you officially reiterating the $350 million EBITDA guide for HomeAway in 2018? Does anything about your outlook change as a result of the new subscription tiers? And then also, can you provide any color on either app download trajectory by any of your brands or any update on mobile bookings or mobile revenue as a percentage of totals. Thanks so much. Mark Okerstrom : So on HomeAway, we didn\u2019t officially reiterate but I\u2019ll right now, certainly we are happy with what we are seeing and we are seeing no reason to change that guidance. we feel good about the progress is obviously faster work ahead of us that really encouraging sign and the change in subscription revenue -- listen was always the plan that there would have to be some change there and this is certainly in line with what we have been expecting. Dara Khosrowshahi : And as far as mobile goes -- mobile penetration across our brands continues to increase, probably last year we were talking about it doing in the 20s, now it's in the 30s we got brands like Hotwire where mobile penetration is in the 40s now. And so mobile continues to be a very, very strong growth driver for us. In general on the app side, we don\u2019t look as much on downloads anymore as we do into app transactions, if you're just driving for downloads, sometimes you're not focused on retention and retention is pretty power lever and last year was an absolutely dynamite year for us as far as growth in app production, bookings et cetera. The comps get a lot tougher this year, but app bookings continue to grow at healthy, very-very healthy rates. It's just the comps that you're going to get a little tougher. So the teams have a bit more of a challenge ahead of them to keep those growth rates going. Operator : And there are no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn things back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Pickerill : Okay, thanks everybody for joining the call, Dara any final thoughts? Dara Khosrowshahi : It's a good start to the year, but not a great start to the year, we got a lot of work ahead of us as a team and we're very focused. Last year was a big announcement year, this year is a big execution year and the teams are hard at work and I just want to take a moment to thank them for the work that they're putting in. It's a lot to ask and the team is coming through and thank you for that. Operator : Thank you everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alan Pickerill, Vice President - Investor Relations at Expedia. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill : Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to Expedia Inc.'s financial results conference call for the second quarter, ended June 30, 2016. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 28, 2016 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or a similar statement. Please refer to today's press release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release which is posted on the Company's IR website at IR.ExpediaInc.com. I would encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release. As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015 which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. Four GAAP accounting purposes the results of eLong our included in our results through the date of the sale in order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for like basis with our historical results, our commentary earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis. Finally, unless otherwise stated all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology content expense also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. With that, let me turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. The second quarter was one in which the strength and breadth of the Expedia, Inc. range of businesses really shone through. Trivago continued to grow scale and gain share in the global travel advertising market. The HomeAway transition and the Orbitz migration each continued to progress well and deliver ahead of plan. Egencia continue to execute on its near term objectives while remaining on track to deliver on sizable long term potential. And although we delivered nicely against our profit objectives with adjusted EBITDA of 18% to $331 million, we did see room night growth decelerate more than we're satisfied with. I'll touch on each of these factors in a bit more detail. Trivago topped $200 million in standalone revenue this quarter, for growth of 41% or 38% currency neutral. On a trailing 12-month basis, Trivago generated over $660 million of revenue and has become a leading scale player in the travel advertising space while building profitably. A little bit of perspective here. We have grown Trivago revenue nearly sixfold since 2012, when we partnered up with the founding team. And today Trivago's TTM revenue is greater and grown faster than TripAdvisor's when we spun off that company. I'm sure investors are wondering about the call arrangement that we have in place with the Trivago founders, so let me update you now. Neither Expedia nor the Trivago founders exercised their option under the open put/call window this year and we have instead agreed to explore the feasibility of an IPO of Trivago shares with the preliminary and ambitious goal of completing the IPO before year end. An IPO would allow investors to value Trivago as a separate standalone company. Note that this is an IPO and not a spinoff. Expedia does not plan to sell any of our shares in an IPO and there are no guarantees that an IPO will ultimately be pursued or be successful. The put/call window could reopen in March 2017 if an IPO is not completed by then. And due to legal limitations, our ability to comment further on an IPO or future performance is extremely limited. Therefore, we will not be updating or otherwise commenting on our outlook for Trivago for this quarter or beyond or answering related questions on the call. The HomeAway transition continues to go very well. We have now implemented the traveler service fee in all major markets, allowing us to increase investments in technology and products as well as marketing in order to build our brand globally. HomeAway Q2 revenue grew 36% year on year on a pro forma basis, driven by strength in both subscription and transactional revenue. And based on current trends, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. Although this transition is not easy, we believe the pivot from pure classified advertising to a travel e-commerce business is a winning plan that will allow us to create better products for consumers and drive more bookings through our homeowner and property manager partners. In addition, as we move more of HomeAway's business to online bookable, we will be more aggressive in offering HomeAway inventory on our OTA brands which will drive even more bookings volume and will give our huge global customer base more places to stay. The Orbitz migration is running nicely ahead of planned timelines with Orbitz and CheapTickets apps as well as the e-bookers site and app now on the Expedia platform. And the migration of the Orbitz for Business clients on to the Egencia platform is complete. Although we still have some migration work to do with a number of Orbitz partner network customers, something that will continue into 2017, we're pleased that the heavy lifting of the Orbitz Worldwide integration is largely behind us. Orbitz generated a healthy $54 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a margin of approximately 28%. Given the speed with which we have executed the integration, we're incrementally optimistic about the delivery of Orbitz-related synergies in the back half of the year. Now, the good work on the Orbitz front did, however, come at an operational cost with our room night growth decelerating more than we planned. The weight of the Orbitz book of business combined with other recent acquisitions and organic growth in our core business strained our infrastructure and affected network quality and uptime. We have addressed the vast majority of these issues and believe that they are now largely behind us. In addition, given the shift of the team's focus towards integration, our Testerman velocity was not where we wanted it to be and our conversion rate increases slowed on a year-on-year basis versus prior quarters. The result of this included a slowdown in the metasearch channel not only due to continued weakness at TripAdvisor, partially due to Instant Book, but also Trivago, where we saw our click share decrease. With the largest part of the Orbitz integration now complete, the teams are back to core execution mode with focus on regaining momentum on the conversion and marketing fronts. We're operating in a very dynamic and competitive market and are no strangers to speed bumps along the way. And we continue to expect to deliver a strong year for the Company. Now I will turn it over to Mark on the financials. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Dara. The adjusted EBITDA of $331 million that we delivered in Q2 was a solid result. From a brand perspective we saw good results relative to our expectations on Hotels.com, Egencia, Expedia affiliate network and Travelocity. And as Dara mentioned, the profits delivered by the Orbitz brand so far in 2016 have been better than we had expected. The HomeAway and Trivago teams are also executing very well and delivering great results. Hotel revenue grew 14% in Q2 on room night growth of 20%. Orbitz contributed approximately 8 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. In addition to the factors Dara described earlier, lower organic room night growth in Q2 compared to Q1 was also driven by the shift of Easter into the first quarter this year and the small impact from Leap Day in Q1 which, if normalized which have reduced room night growth in Q1 by about 3 percentage points and increased Q2 by about 1 percentage point. There have been a number of terrorist attacks in recent geographies over the past months. When isolated events occur, we historically have seen an immediate reduction in bookings and an increasing cancellations for the impacted destination. Typically, most of that demand get stubborn achieve other destinations. And over time, normal travel patterns seem to return. Though we're hopeful to see the same patterns repeat themselves, the frequency of recent events is giving us reason to be incrementally cautious. This is something that we will continue to monitor as the year progresses. Average daily rates declined less than 1% in Q2 and revenue per room night decreased by about 5 percentage points. The gap between the two narrowed in this quarter, down to 440 basis points compared to about 540 basis points in Q1. We saw continued broad strength in our other product lines with air tickets up 5% and rental car days up 36%. Note that Orbitz and 30 percentage points to take growth and 24 percentage points to rental car days in Q2. Our ad and media revenue grew 42% on solid performance for both Trivago and our Media Solutions group. From an expense perspective, setting aside the inorganic components from HomeAway and Orbitz, we saw leverage in cost of revenue again this quarter as the teams continue to drive efficiencies. You will see that the year-over-year organic growth in direct and selling and marketing expenses was lower in Q2 than in Q1, partially in conjunction with the lower topline trends with variable performance-based marketing making up a large portion of this expense category. We did, however, see an elevated face of growth in technology and content expenses, as we had expected, driven by an increase in costs to support Orbitz integration efforts and growth in the core business, accelerated hiring as we brought Orbitz team members onto our Brand Expedia team earlier this year and expenses associated with the migration of certain functionality to the cloud. We expect the growth in tech and content expense to remain elevated but to begin to moderate in the back half of year. G&A expense grew a bit faster than revenue this quarter on some discrete legal and professional fees. Note that we're expecting to see leverage in G&A expense in the back half of the year. Turning to our financial expectations for 2016, on a consolidated basis excluding eLong, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow 35% to 45% year-over-year. We do think that the contribution to full-year adjusted EBITDA for Orbitz and HomeAway combined will be higher than our previous expectations with the relatively lower contribution from the rest of the business. Please note, however, that we're forecasting modestly improved organic room night growths in the back half of the year and if that does not occur we would likely see full year adjusted EBITDA growth closer to the lower end of the stated range. In terms of the shape of the back half of the year I would just remind you of some discrete items that will favorably impact Q4 results. Orbitz synergies will be close to full run rate and we will get a full quarter benefit from HomeAway in the fourth quarter. We will also be comping the Paris attack, significant deal-related costs and the purchase accounting impacts of deferred revenue for both Orbitz and HomeAway. Before closing, I did want to give a bit more color regarding the buildout of our new corporate headquarters slated to take place over the next few years. In March this year we had indicated that capital outlay for the full buildout could run in a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Since then we have looked more closely at the design with a focus on budget and phasing and we now believe we can have the property ready for use in 2019 for something closer to half of the previous estimate. We expect to share more details as those plans are finalized. With that let's open it up for some questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan : I've got a couple of questions. So, Dara, you touched on the slowdown in the room night growth and how resources being devoted towards more rights could have contributed to that. Can you share some more details on what exactly was affected so that we can get some degree of comfort that this is more of an internal operational issue versus some competitive dynamic? Mark Okerstrom : I'll take this one. Let me just bridge you from the Q4 organic room night growth of 24% down to 12% and give you a sense of it. First of all, at the time of our Q1 call we were expecting a deceleration of somewhere between 500 and 700 basis points. The majority of that was coming from Easter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we were also lapping over some significant ramp up in both the [indiscernible] and Travelocity businesses, Travelocity because we had taken over control of sales and marketing after the acquisition and WotIf because we had them on the platform. And then the law of large numbers, et cetera. So that was what we had expected. I mentioned in a few investor conferences in May that we had seen some slowdown and signaled that we were seeing a little bit more. And really, the majority of that incremental slowdown, we believe, is self-inflicted. There were a couple of big drivers there. One is we did have some network and infrastructure stability issues really focused in the first half of the quarter. A lot of this was driven by just organic growth in the business but also as we moved the Orbitz book of business on to our network infrastructure, it wobbled a little bit and it took us a while to get it stabilized. The good news is that it is now stabilized and the teams have done a great job getting that back on track. The second self-inflicted wound, if you will, was a decision we had made really to divert the vast majority of the Brand Expedia team, tech and product resources, towards the integration effort and to good result. We've actually got the Orbitz brands onto the Expedia platform faster than we had expected and we're seeing the financial benefit of that. The cost, however, was that our test and learn velocity, in terms of the rate at which we were testing and releasing new features, was slower on a year-on-year basis than it would have been the same time last year. And that has an effect on conversion. And when you impact your conversion, it impacts not only the transactions that are coming to you directly but also in variable channels and Dara mentioned the slowdown that we were seeing in the metasearch channel. So that was really the majority of that call it 500 to 700 basis points of incremental slowdown beyond that which we had expected. The rest of it -- it's very difficult to pinpoint. Certainly, we do remain in an intensely competitive marketplace. And any time we stop the innovation pace, we have competitors that are very quick to respond and take share. And we certainly did see that in the metasearch channels. Also, it's really hard to read the news and see what's happening in the overall geopolitical environment, particularly with the terrorist attacks and the frequency of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe. And even though we can't pinpoint an overall impact exactly on that, it wouldn't surprise us if that is having some impact as well. Naved Khan : And then just to follow up on your answer, if I look at the room night growth by geography, it seems like the slowdown in international room nights was more pronounced. Is there anything to call out there? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think, in general, international points of sale have a higher concentration in the metasearch channels than the domestic points of sale, where we have bigger brand traffic. And, of course, the macro environment could be affecting international more. The last is actually a comp issue which is we had brought in or consolidated Brand Expedia, the joint venture with AirAsia last year at the same time, so you are just seeing a comp effect there. Naved Khan : The second question I had was really around the HomeAway integration. I think, Dara, you talked about how you can start to offer up some of the HomeAway inventory into the core Expedia. Can you talk about the timing of that and when we can start to see that? Dara Khosrowshahi : We don't have specific timing at this point on it. The real focus for HomeAway right now is to build up the online bookable muscles. And we're really, really pleased with the progress there, over 1 million online bookable listings, overall listings growing at 20% plus, actually accelerating versus how fast listings were growing there. That's the focus right now is the HomeAway team and then taking some of that revenue and reinvesting in marketing to make sure that our homeowners and property managers get plenty of traffic. We will have more to say about distribution on Expedia and Hotels.com and all of our other brands. So, stay tuned there. And I think, in general, the thing that you should look for is a much deeper integration of the HomeAway inventory onto the Expedia platforms, in general. Prior, when we worked with HomeAway as partners before, the integration was more of a link-off experience. It was a little bit of a shock for users. And this HomeAway inventory is going to be fundamental to our product on a long term basis. So we're making the kinds of investments that we have to, to make sure that the integration is perfect and our clients who are online bookable and especially instant bookable get plenty more traffic the way they want that traffic. Operator : Next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian Fitzgerald : I want to know if you could give us any initial back on the Facebook dynamic adds that I think Trivago is running for travel. Are they running across Facebook and Instagram? And then maybe any initial comments on your traction with the messenger bot? Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as Facebook, the dynamic ads go, we're experimenting and really starting to scale up with Facebook across our brands on a global basis. The spend there is now getting to real significance. And our engineering teams have been working with the Facebook engineering teams in a very productive way. And basically all of the brands are experimenting with Facebook and finding veins, traffic and conversion veins that are awfully interesting. So our spend is up significantly. It looks like it's working and we think that the momentum there will continue. You certainly see it in the Facebook results. As far as the Facebook messenger bot, I think it's too early to tell. It's a promising technology. I think messaging technology in general, whether on Facebook or other platforms, is something that we're quite interested in, both in terms of messaging itself and the platform and in terms of AI and machine learning that we can build in behind it to radically improve customer experience. So at this point, so far so good, but it's not something that we scaled yet. Operator : Next will be Mike Olsen with Piper Jaffray. Mike Olsen : In the HomeAway business, how would you describe any impact that you are seeing on looking rates as a result of the parking fee? Based on the results and the qualitative guidance you gave for HomeAway, it seems that the answer is probably minimal. And then do you believe that you are seeing any impact on either HomeAway for your core OTA business from alternative accommodation sites at this point? Dara Khosrowshahi : I'll answer the second one first which is that the HomeAway results have been pretty great. So we expected to be bringing in a really strong company and we wrote a big check to bring in HomeAway. And I'd say so far the results have been better than expected. So I think that this alternative lodging space is -- it's just a big space. And HomeAway is benefiting from that and obviously AirBnb which is the other player in the category, is clearly benefiting from it as well. The reaction -- when we did bring in the booking fees, etc., we did see a conversion decrease initially. And the great news is that chain, the HomeAway technology team -- now they have got traffic and they are able to optimize the site in a way that they were not able to. So conversion is actually on a year on year basis, because of the optimization work, because of the feature work that the teams are embarking on. And I think that that momentum is going to continue for some period of time. When we look at HomeAway conversion versus, let's say, Hotels.com or Expedia conversion in like destinations, HomeAway conversion is far lower. So, we think we've got plenty of work to do there. And we think that we have got plenty of upside there. The other factor that we want to look at is subscription renewals and subscription renewal rates. And again, things look good there. So I think, anytime you change your model you introduced some uncertainty into the marketplace. We've had to overcommunicate to our homeowners and our workers, but I think now we're settling down and we can both build a great business together. Operator : And the next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : I'm wondering if you can just attribute any of that organic slowdown in room night growth to the hotel effort at loyalty pricing discounts and the ad campaigns supporting those. Are there markets where there may not be enough independent supply to backfill and replace what the chains are doing? And as a follow-up to that, when you take a step back and look at the magnitude of some of the discounting they are doing and you listen to Marriott on their earnings call this morning talking about seeing net pressure on ADRs from what they are doing, how do you guys think this plays out? Do they keep doing this at a net loss to themselves? Or do you think, ultimately, they pull back on this? We'd love your perspective on that. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Listen, it's very difficult for us to speculate as to what the Marriotts and the Hiltons of the world are going to do. These are really smart, big companies and they are making their own decision. I think the question that you asked about is it affecting us is clearly a question that we asked ourselves because we saw the slowdown in room nights. And we have 18,000 statisticians looking every which way at every angle to see whether it has affected us. The short answer is that we haven't seen any real correlation in our performance in chain-heavy markets versus chain-light markets. You would think that in a market that has lots of chains, you would see some conversion degradation or performance degradation to the extent that inventory quality is lessening. But we haven't seen any of that whatsoever. It may happen, it may not happen. But to date we have not seen any correlation at all. What we have seen is we have seen a shift of our bookings from some of the chains that are discounting to independents and/or chains that are not discounting. So there has been, certainly, share shift and maybe that was affecting Marriott ADRs. And the share shift actually, in an interesting way, is giving us some margin upside. So from that standpoint, that has not been bad, although we're not necessarily managing for margin. I think the other perspective as to whether they are going to continue or not is, we attract brand-agnostic travelers as far as what hotel they are staying at or what chain they are staying at. And actually like if you look at Hotels.com on a global basis, the biggest chains in the world, the largest hotel chains, get less than 0.5% of searches on the Hotels.com site. Just to make sure you understand that, someone who comes on Hotels.com, less than 0.5% of them are searching for a specific large brand out there. So these are folks who want a great hotel in Paris and it's a terrific opportunity for great hotels in Paris to stand up and to market themselves to someone who hasn't yet become loyal to a chain. And we have partners who are, at this point, standing up. The economy is a little bit weaker than it has been before.  So we're seeing some promotional activity and discount activity. And so far we're satisfied with the quality of inventory. Now, we will watch this. The big chains are marketing aggressively. So as far as competitive brand marketing activity, probably not good for us, but we haven't seen any direct effect as a result of our actions. And we will work with them because we definitely want to grow up with the chains. We think that's a positive way to grow going forward and we continue to have promising dialogue with them. Operator : And the next question will come from Tom White with Macquarie. Tom White : Just on your comments about the trajectory for room night growth for the balance of the year, I heard some things about you are guiding to improvements but also heard some comments around terrorism fears and the macro, so trying to reconcile those two things. And then just on Brexit and terrorism, could you just give a bit more color on what you are seeing in terms of changes in traveler behavior? Are you seeing increases in cancellation rates? Are you seeing people book travel in other areas? Any kind of color you can give there would be great. Dara Khosrowshahi : So with respect to the trajectory for room night growth, if you look at what I said around the self-inflicted piece of what we saw in the second quarter, half of the call it's around half the 500 to 700 basis points of decel that we had not anticipated is self-inflicted. And the chunk of that is related to the network instability and infrastructure that we have now solved. So we're expecting to, through the back part of this year, work our way and claw back that piece of the business that was self-inflicted, both as network infrastructure issue, also as we ramp up test and learning velocity and get year-on-year conversion improvements back. Against that, I guess, plan, if you will, that we're executing against, things that are in our is this backdrop of just the increasing frequency of terrorism. And to put some numbers on it, historically we have seen these destinations that experience these types of terrible things drop and then they pop back in a matter of weeks if not months. But if you take France as a destination, for example which has had just a terrible go of it, room night growth pre the most recent Paris attacks was in and around the mid-20s. After the Paris attacks it settled out into low single digits. As soon as Brussels happened, it hit negative single digits. And since Nice it has been down double digits, like mid-20s. So, we have not seen the recovery in France. And so, that we're hopeful that we will see a recovery, just the pace of this has got us into uncharted territory. Now, the upside of this is that we're seeing places, particularly places in Spain, Ireland, etcetera -- we're seeing increasing volume there. Clearly, people are shifting the places that they are traveling to. But we're cautious that this could just put a negative tone just on -- overall, least European travel trends. Just to touch on Brexit quickly which was one of the other things you mentioned, the Brexit response was similar to what we see anytime we see currency moves. And it was really currency related.  As soon as the pound devalued versus the U.S. dollar, we saw bookings, particularly into London out of the U.S., increase pretty significantly. But beyond that, we haven't seen a significant impact and I think for now we're not expecting to see one. Operator : And next question will come from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Can you discuss the mix of listings that are incurring the HomeAway traveler fee between professionally managed properties and single-owner units? And is one group outpacing the other in terms of overall bookings growth? Dara Khosrowshahi : I'd say that in general the professional managers group is probably engaged a little more quickly. They've got a bunch of volume and they are leaning forward into the traffic growth that HomeAway is delivering now. But we continue to work with our individual owners. They are an incredibly important component of our marketplace and we see excellent progress in bringing them online and making them online bookable. So it's a process. It's a communication and education process and I would say so far, so good. Operator : And next question will come from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : A couple of questions -- I realize that revenue and bookings are not directly tied together. But curious if you could give us a sense of what drove revenue performance about booking growth -- organic booking growth. Obviously there's a lot of noise about cutting commissions and other things going in the space. So, curious if -- what it was that drove that outperformance. And then on the HomeAway piece, do you have any sense of what kind of an impact, if at all, the booking fee has had on gross bookings on the site? I understand you don't report a gross bookings number for HomeAway, but if you could just quantify for us your best feeling for where that is. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, Heath. So simple answer on the first question is that both HomeAway and Trivago report into revenue and not into bookings. So you've got inorganic at HomeAway dropping directly into that and then Trivago organic revenue growth, obviously very strong and after than the overall business with no bookings offset. So that's the big driver. In terms of gross bookings on the side of the impact of the booking fee, we generally are seeing very strong results there. As a reminder, we now have 1 million online bookable properties, so more transactions are coming online. Last quarter we actually ordered a book to transactional revenue number, just to give you a sense of it. And what that represented is essentially the revenue that HomeAway derives from bookings that have been online, on a booked basis. Recognition happens on stay. That number this quarter was well north of 200% year over year. So we're seeing really strong results there and we're able to actually put that increased volume and increase revenue that HomeAway has back into the business. And one of the most significant investments that HomeAway has been making is not only in product and technology to make the experience better for both owners and managers as well as consumers, but they have put a significant amount of money back into sales and marketing. In fact, the first half of this year, direct sales and marketing spend up over 80% year over year. So we're really creating this flywheel and it just seems the more volume we create, the more attractive online bookability becomes for owners and managers. And we're starting to get real traction there that we're very pleased to see. Operator : And we have a question from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman : Following up on an earlier question, the travel industry has typically argued that people will travel, particularly for leisure, always, regardless. So the question is, is it the -- is this true? Are you seeing it? And if so, where are the people going? Or, to put it another way, who in the industry are winners currently -- which is a difficult way to think of it, but nonetheless-- Dara Khosrowshahi : What I would tell you is that this is an unusual time where uncertainty and the kind of terrorist activity that we're seeing seems to be happening at an unprecedented rate. Historically, whenever we've seen something happen locally, there has been a reaction. There have been significant cancellations and then you have a couple of weeks of call it business running below normal. And usually you see the patterns of travel work around the uncertainty or the interruption. So as an example, presently, we see Spain as a destination been incredibly strong. Why is that? It's obviously because France as a destination is weak. Turkey is weak. A bunch of other summer suns destinations that Europeans used to travel to are down. So, Spain is really strong. Now, with all the activity here, is that having an overall effect on the travel market? I can only say maybe. We don't see it in general. Historically we've seen travel grow at GDP plus 3% to 4% and we've seen online travel grow faster than that. We've got exposure to Asia in some markets which make our growth rate even significantly higher than the overall travel growth rate. And I expect more of the same. There may be a general slowdown. I wouldn't predict it because we haven't seen it before. But even if there is, we think companies like ours, companies that are strong on technology and customer and brand side, can grow through any kind of these interruptions. Michael Millman : So bottom line is you are saying locations may change and the strong will get stronger? Dara Khosrowshahi : Destination is destination. Mix absolutely changes. But usually the person who wants to go on a summer vacation goes on a summer vacation. If there's a general trend that I'd say is that usually when you see periods of uncertainty you see people staying closer to home. So, as opposed to going on that long trip or Americans going to Europe, they will take their summer vacation in the States, if there's any pattern to that. But we're relevant for that and I think a lot of other companies are relevant for that kind of service as well. Michael Millman : So the biggest potential losers may well be the airlines, because-- Dara Khosrowshahi : It's tough to tell. I think right now the airline issue is more about capacity than demand, but I guess the two are certainly related. Operator : That question will come from Chris Merwin with Barclays. Chris Merwin : I just had a couple. Dara, you talked about filling up your ad dollars on Facebook. Can you talk a bit about how the ROIs on Facebook compared to what you are currently getting on Google, maybe just on a relative basis and how we should think about the shift in marketing spend should impact you guys from a margin perspective in the near- or long term? And then secondly, as it relates to the traveler fee rollout on HomeAway, I imagine that's still going in line with your expectations now that the pricing change has fully rolled out. But at some point, does it make sense to also include online payments as part of the lower-cost price option on HomeAway to maybe further accelerate the pace of that traveler fee rollout? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as the scaling up of ad dollars on Facebook on ROI, that's competitive information that we won't get into. But we're working with Facebook on a variable basis. We've got a bunch of data scientists looking at the return and we would not be scaling up our spend on Facebook unless it was getting us more than satisfactory results. We will look to maximize spend on an affordable basis in any variable channel which includes Google, includes meta-search and now, more and more, it's including Facebook as well. As far as the travel fee rollout in online payments, can you explain a little bit more what you are asking about? Chris Merwin : Sure. Just to fully implement the traveler fee, I imagine a listing has to be not only online bookable but online payable. And I believe and correct me if I'm wrong, that people can pay the lower cost option at HomeAway to have their listing online bookable, but it doesn't also mandate that it's online payable which I imagine is a prerequisite for having a traveler fee. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think certainly, the two go together. And we're working to introduce more payment methods, online payment methods, especially on the international front -- PayPal, all kinds of credit cards, etcetera. And we're also looking to build out products like the traveler guarantee for HomeAway that incents travelers to book essentially on system because there are some bookings, obviously, that go off system which is to people talking to each other and writing a check and hoping that the check lands someplace. So we think that we can create a safe and cheap environment for consumers to come together with homeowners within the HomeAway platform and we will be looking to optimize that a go-forward basis. Operator : Our question will come from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ron Josey : I know we have talked about this a little bit. But maybe on the Orbitz integration I'm wondering, Dara, what was different with integration of Orbitz versus that of Travelocity and others you've done, in which you saw the disruption in the core business and took your eye off the test and learn thesis or really process that you've been doing for some time? Just because I was somewhat surprised to see that this quarter. And then, bigger picture, talking about HomeAway, can you talk a little bit more about where you are with adding urban inventory to the mix and when that might come into play? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as Orbitz goes, the Orbitz integration was fundamentally different from Travelocity because, if you remember, Travelocity initially was a technology integration as it related to that asset which was owned by Sabre. So Sabre really had to work with a bunch of the -- had to deal with the headcount issues, the employee issues. And we just had to deal with the technology integration. Orbitz coming in was not only an integrating technology but also took the efforts of lots and lots of people across the company because we were essentially bringing the company in. So that's one. The second is that Orbitz is a number of brands. It's not just Orbitz, it's the EcoFirst brand and we closed down Hotel Club in Asia. We're integrating the Orbitz partner network and Orbitz for Business. So it is a substantially larger and more complex integration than the Travelocity integration. And I do think that another factor is that, listen, we brought on Travelocity. We brought on WotIf and we brought on Orbitz. I don't know what the total time between those three integrations were, but it's three integrations one after the other. And I think that probably each integration maybe not just backed by 5% or 10%. And the 5% or 10% started adding up with the last integration, the Orbitz integration, being the biggest one and the most challenging one. Super, super proud of the Company for getting it done.  We knew that it was a challenge through the second order. And we said, you know what, let's put our heads down to get it done so we can get back to core execution. And we're there. And expectations for us internally are high. We think that we're going to execute. We have before and I think we will again. As far as HomeAway inventory adding urban inventory to the mix, we're looking at adding to inventory all over. I do think that our strengths tend to be in the resource area as far as sun destinations, mountain destinations, etc. But we're adding urban listings as well. And I think that as we integrate more fundamentally with Hotels.com, Expedia, Travelocity orbitz, the pace of urban listing acquisition is going to increase. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Moffat Nathanson. Perry Gold : Are you guys seeing any early upside from your accelerator growth in this point? Is that where the information trajectory in ADR and revenue per room night growth is coming from? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : We're seeing upside. Again, I think it's early. There's still a lot of training to do and a lot of behavior for hoteliers to learn. But we're seeing great uptake. We have got thousands of hotels that are actively using the tool and we expect that it's going to go up significantly from there. The hotels that use that are finding exactly what they might expect which is they are getting incremental volume when they need it at an overall yield which is attractive to them. So we're very pleased with it and I think there's more to come. Not a big factor in the revenue per room night and ADR story at this point. The narrowing of the gap there is really largely due to the reasons that we predicted, is that we're getting to the end of our margin reduction strategy here and we're starting to see just better trends there. And that's something that we do expect to continue here over the next little while. And the last fact that has helped that is something that Dara mentioned which is, we're seeing a mix of our business towards independent hotels that are taking advantage of our marketplace and taking advantage of really a less attractive pricing that in many cases some of the big chain partners are providing to our consumers. Operator : This question is from Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin Patterson : In terms of just sales and marketing, that came in quite a bit better than I think we were all expecting this quarter. And you also mentioned there was some room night growth deceleration around integration efforts. But have you been able to parse out just whether or not backing off the accelerator on marketing expense slowed room night growth? And is there a trade-off between spending for growth here that we should be thinking about? And then, secondarily, on Europe you mentioned the metasearch factors being apart behind the deceleration there as well as the macro part. Is there any changes on the meta side you are perhaps contemplating, given those results? Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So the vast majority of our direct sales and marketing is variable or performance in nature. And in a sense it's autoadjusting which is when we have lower year-on-year conversion gains, as Dara mentioned, we had seen particularly at brand Expedia, we automatically essentially adjusting pullback a little bit because we're very focused on making sure that we maintain the appropriate profitability. And, that said, those channels themselves are the least profitable channels that we have. And so when we do have a slowdown in conversion, it does translate into room night growth. And the first channels to go are the ones that are most expensive. So there's a natural offset or a natural hedge that we see in our P&L. With respect to macro and the challenge we saw in metasearch in Europe and changes, listen, I think the biggest changes that we're very focused on getting our year-on-year test and learn velocity right back up where it should be. We're hopeful that that will improve conversion rates and then we will hopefully see the exact reverse of what we saw in the second quarter which is room night growth accelerating back up and sales and marketing going back up with it, hopefully a little bit less than room nights. Operator : The next question is from Dan Wasiolek with Morningstar. Dan Wasiolek : Just on the HomeAway brand I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the potential impact from some cities coming out and announcing maybe stricter enforcement of home share laws and how that might impact the HomeAway brand. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : From a HomeAway standpoint, we tend to have a more significant portion of our business today in destinations that are not urban destinations and destinations that are mountain/beach destinations. And these are destinations that had had this business around for a long time. The majority, the vast majority of HomeAway's business are whole homes. All of HomeAway's business is whole homes. They are usually second homes and they are usually in destinations where the home rental, the seasonal home rental business has been around for a long time and is a very significant contributor to local economies, etcetera. So we're watching with interest what's going on. Every single municipality is looking at this issue in a different way. We're working closely with those municipalities. And we think, in the end, this is a product that consumers want. It attracts travelers to destinations. Travelers bring jobs, they bring money. And we think that in working with these local municipalities ultimately we will come up with the appropriate laws to protect consumers and homeowners and the residence of those municipalities as well. This is a process that's going to take a long time. But we're in it for the long haul. And at this point, the activity that we see is affecting us less than, let's say, some of the other players out there. Operator : And next question will come from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Rob on the call for Peter. One question, last quarter, you noted some softness I think in the corporate travel environment, in terms of travelers trading down a bit. It seems like your Egencia business actually had a pretty nice quarter and held quite nicely in terms of bookings and revenue growth. So, just wondering if you could give us an update on trends in corporate and also what helped drive the rebound intake rates there. And then a quick follow-up on HomeAway, wondering if you might be able to give us an update on when we might begin to see some HomeAway inventory on other Expedia brand sites. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. So in corporate travel, absolutely Egencia had a great quarter, so to the Egencia teams for good execution there. They did get a little bit of help from the Orbitz for Business integration and they actually completed the migration of those clients now, all of them, on to the Egencia platform. So that was some of what you saw in their numbers. But they did have a great organic quarter. They did, however, continue to see evidence of a trade-down activity, particularly in Europe. Volume held up nicely, but in general transaction values were down year on year. And so there's no significant change on that front. Mark Okerstrom : And I think, just to add on Egencia, the Egencia team now -- they have completed largely there VIA acquisition in the Nordics and now Orbitz for Business as well. So they are a little mini case of what we described on the Expedia front. I think that team finally can look forward to really steering their attentions on innovating and building that company. And we're very excited about their position now competitively. We have invested in their platform, in technology. And if anything, we anticipate acceleration in growth for the Egencia brand in the back half of the year and especially going to last year. So we're pretty excited about that team, where they've got into and even more excited about where they are going. As far as HomeAway and when we might see the inventory on the core Expedia brand, no update as of now but news upcoming. Operator : And this question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jason Mitchell : This is Jason Mitchell here for Justin. I was just wondering if you have any kind of updates on how you are thinking about the TripAdvisor instant platform. And given all the turmoil in the travel market, have you seen any impact on your bookings through Trip? And then just a follow-up on HomeAway -- with the new pricing plan for subscriptions, do you expect it to change your mix at all of properties between subscription and pay for booking? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as TripAdvisor goes, no change as far as our view there. Obviously, we're not in instant iBook at this point. We think the product has improved as far as the brand representation of players who are working with instant book. And so we will be in dialogue with TripAdvisor when we can, although I wouldn't expect anything to happen soon. As far as the HomeAway new subscriptions and the change between PPB and subscription, I think it remains to be seen. I do think that one way or the other, more and more players are going to come online and make their listings online bookable. Whether they want to go through subscription is -- we're fairly neutral to and really we just want to make it easier for our users to become online bookable. And then, once we have become online bookable for obviously over the long term, going to see the majority of demand in that marketplace because it's clearly what our consumers want. And ultimately we think it's going to be a win-win in this marketplace when consumer expectations are met with homeowners and property managers. That's really what this model change is all about. Operator : And our next question will come from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. Kevin Kopelman : I wanted to ask a little bit about hotel supply growth. I think you added 25,000 hotels in the quarter. It was a very big number. Can you talk about key drivers there? Is there any seasonality? Just how we should be thinking about that, thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I told you on that one is it's business as usual as far as adding the 25,000 hotels. It's growth of about 20% on a year-on-year basis and I think that team is just getting to the rhythm. As you know, we invested in our partner service team probably around two years ago. We really started investing in the sales team. And we continue to invest in that sales team and they continue to deliver. If there's any seasonality, I would say that we try to bring on a bunch of hotels prior to the big summer season when travelers are traveling. So usually at the beginning of the year, Q1 and Q2, the team really tries to sign up as many hoteliers and partners as we can. And probably during the summer we're a little more focused on managing rates and managing inventory and managing promotions so that we can deliver as much volume to our partners as we can. But I think you should take the 25,000 as nothing unusual. It's going to be business as usual. And I think every quarter we're going to add some amount close to that number. Whether it's a little bit lower or a little bit higher is it doesn't matter. I think from a long term perspective you should look at supply addition as being a growth factor for this business. And then when we add HomeAway inventory, that will be a little bit of a boost. Operator : And we have a question from Brett Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities. Brett Erickson : Just a follow-up from the previous question on some of the mix shifts you talked about to the independents from larger chains. Given the way you are seeing those channels as targeted ROIs, to what degree might you pursue the independent segment more aggressively to capture outsized growth at the expense of some profitability in the future? Or is it more of a case of growth expectations kind of status quo but with an improved margin profile going forward? How should we think about that? Dara Khosrowshahi : If our business, if the fundamentals of our business had changed as a result of what's going on with the chains, we might react. We just haven't seen any fundamental change. So chain-heavy markets, chain-light markets are really acting the same as they always have. So for us it's about rolling forward with the formula that we have in place which is adding to supply, driving conversion improvements on a site, using those conversion improvements to fund additional marketing and then keeping those new users in the marketplace through leading loyalty programs of that Hotels.com and Expedia. So we will watch it. The margin improvements are probably going to be a financial positive. But there's not really an agenda on the margin side. We're really trying to offer the best hotel at the best rate to our consumers and that's what we're solving for. Everything else flows from there. I would say that in every market we're making sure that we have a wide selection of hotels that are providing us the best inventory at the best price.  So we do look at market by market basis. Sometimes we will even look at neighborhood by neighborhood to make sure that where there are neighborhoods that are especially popular; we have a wide selection of hotels. We work with those hotels on inventory and pricing and promotion and sort, etc. And so far, the results have been good. And it's something that we will watch quite closely. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Pickerill : Okay, great. Thanks, everybody, for joining. We will look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Dara, any closing remarks? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, just that we're very, very pleased with the activity that we see across the portfolio of brands that we have. The new additions have clearly been terrific, the HomeAways, Trivagos of the world. There's a lot of really good work going across the Company. We see the competitive environment as tougher than it ever has. Integration work that we're doing clearly has had some execution challenges in the macro environment. It's a tough one, but this Company has gained share year in, year out, regardless of the environment. And I think with the strategic scope that we have now, with a scope and metasearch, alternative lodging and scale that we have with the many brands that we have within our OTA business, we're better positioned than we ever have been. So we expect excellent execution on a go-forward basis as nothing less. And I wanted to thank our employees for the great work this year and the great work coming up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation today.",

Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to Expedia's Q3 2016 earnings conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President of Investor Relations at Expedia. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Expedia, Inc.'s financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, October 27, 2016, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise stated all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general administrative expense, technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense, and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. With that, let me turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Alan. Financial results for the quarter were solid with gross bookings up 21%, revenue up 33%, and adjusted EBITDA 42% year on year. Now that the Orbitz migration is largely complete, the focus of our core OTA segment has been squarely back-to-business as usual. As we mentioned on our last call, we weren't satisfied with our hotel volumes in Q2 and the teams have now been laser-focused on driving core execution, product and conversion improvements, online and offline marketing and expansion of our supply footprint, all to drive stronger transactional growth. While you don't see the results yet in our Q3 stays, booked to room night trends consistently improved throughout the quarter, especially with our global brands Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, and EAN [Expedia Affiliate Network], our private label business. Our regionally-focused brands, however, are managing marketing spend more with an eye towards near-term profitability versus top-line growth. While it's very early in Q4, October volumes continue to be healthy and it feels good to be back to our operational formula. Egencia is on track to deliver solid year of growth in profitability as it continues to gain share under the managed corporate travel market, innovate and complete key technology projects to set the stage for its next phase of growth. Egencia has set an internal target to double its gross bookings by 2020 through organic as well as inorganic growth, and is positioning itself as the most business traveler and project-centric company in corporate travel. We remain very optimistic about the prospects for substantial share gains for Egencia for many years to come. Team trivago continues to gain share. Q3 revenue growth came in at a very strong 57% year over year, accelerating from an already strong Q2. While year-on-year profitability improved. trivago has seen healthy growth in all regions including its core European markets and the U.S., while reinvesting profits to scale up in major travel markets such as South Korea, Japan, and others. Regarding the potential IPO for trivago, we're not going to be commenting on this call beyond our prior public statements and we do not have any updated information to share on timing. The HomeAway transition continues to progress nicely with standalone revenue up 1% year-on-year and traveler's service fee now rolled out globally. A special thanks to Co-Founder, Brian Sharples, who recently stepped away from his role as CEO, while remaining Chairman of HomeAway to continue to help us navigate through a complex transformation. Brian and team created a terrific company that we plan to build on with long-time Expedia executive, John Kim, who has been at HomeAway since early 2016, now stepping into the role of Company President. We're focused on hitting our long-term growth goals, while aggressively ramping up our investment in product, technology, marketing and customer service to build a very best marketplace for homeowners, property managers and travelers alike. And though we're pleased with the progress, we're still early in HomeAway's transition into scale global leader in the alternative accommodation market. In summary, while we're never quite satisfied, overall results were solid and Q3 was most definitely a step in the right direction for our company. Now I'll turn it over Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Dara. The adjusted EBITDA of $667 million that we delivered in Q3 was a good result and broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Better than expected results across most of our brands more than offset some bottom-line weakness in Brand Expedia and Hotwire. HomeAway and Orbitz continue to perform well and together delivered a solid $150 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Hotel revenue grew 15% in Q3, slightly faster than in the second quarter on room night growth of 17%. Orbitz contributed approximately 6 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. We are pleased to exit Q3 with stayed room night growth of 20% in September, 14% excluding Orbitz. We are also pleased to see consistent acceleration in our booked room night trends each month through the quarter, with strength continuing through October to-date. Note, however, that as we improve execution, results are first being realized in the form of accelerating growth in the high-cost performance marketing channels such as metasearch and search engine marketing. We expect to invest some additional selling and marketing behind these positive trends, which could put incremental pressure on margins in the fourth quarter, a trade-up we're happy to make as we continue to rebuild momentum exiting the year. Average daily rates were up about 1% in Q3, while revenue per room night decreased by less than 2%. The gap between the two continued to narrow down to about 280 basis points compared with 440 basis points in the second quarter. Pressure on room night economics have continued to abate as we lap over previous reductions in our hotel commission rates. We saw solid unit growth in our other product lines with air tickets up 32% and rental car days up 34%. Note that Orbitz added 22 percentage points of inorganic ticket growth and 19 percentage points to rental car days in Q3. Revenue per ticket grew 15% in Q3, due in part to a one-time re-class of certain other revenue into air, favorable economics in a number of supply contracts and certain consumer fee tests. We expect revenue per ticket growth to return to a more normalized level in Q4. Our ad and media revenue grew 50% on solid performance for both trivago and our Media Solutions Group. As you look at your top-line growth expectations for Q4, please remember that we comped over the Orbitz acquisition at the end of the third quarter, and as such, all-in growth rates across our product lines will decelerate significantly beginning in Q4. Additionally, Orbitz gross bookings and revenue have been meaningfully down year over year on a standalone basis, due to our discontinuation of certain brands and site functionality, our pulling back spend in certain marketing channels with an eye to profit optimization, and some churn in Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business customers. This dynamic will put pressure on top line growth in Q4, with a more limited impact on profitability given deal synergies and Orbitz air-heavy product mix. On a standalone basis, HomeAway revenue grew 61% and adjusted EBITDA grew 85% in Q3. We were quite pleased with these results and as such continue ramping up investments in selling and marketing and in product and technology as we move forward into 2017. Looking forward, these investments combined with the phasing out of tiered subscription fees and lapping the rollout of the consumer fee next year will result in slower adjusted EBITDA growth for HomeAway beginning in Q4 compared to what you saw here in Q3. Progress to date combined with the investments we are making give us continued confidence in our ability to deliver our targeted $350 million of adjusted EBITDA at HomeAway in 2018. From an expense perspective on both an organic and all-in basis, we saw nice leverage in cost of revenue, selling and marketing people-related costs, and G&A this quarter. Note that across all expense categories, year-over-year growth was partially offset by a reduction of our incentive compensation accruals in Q3, given the relative underperformance in our core OTA business year to date. Technology and content expenses continued to grow faster than revenue due in part to the year-over-year impact of hiring of talented tech teams earlier this year and our continued employment of transitional resources in connection with the Orbitz integration. Looking forward, as we lap these additions and the remaining transitional resources roll off, on an all-in basis, we expect to see a further deceleration in the growth of technology and content expense to the high 20% to low 30% range in the fourth quarter and further deceleration as we move into 2017. I would note, however, that an additional driver to year-on-year growth in technology and content expense in the third quarter was the continuation of our cloud migration efforts. Though we plan to operate our own data center footprint for core functionality for the foreseeable future, we have initiated a companywide effort to migrate significant portions of our products and capabilities to the cloud computing environment over the next few years. The related expense for full-year 2016 will be over $30 million, of which we have recognized approximately $20 million year to date. Current estimated expenditures on cloud for 2017 are more than double current year spending. While this represents an EBITDA headwind in the near term, we absolutely believe it's the right business decision, and we expect it to be nicely free cash flow positive over the medium to long term as we significantly reduce capital expenditures and other operating costs related to our own data centers over time. Turning to our financial expectations for full-year 2016, on a consolidated basis, excluding eLong, we're currently forecasting full-year adjusted EBITDA growth approaching the midpoint of our 35% to 45% guidance range, with continued risk to the downside. We are pleased to see the improvement in recent room night growth trends and plan to invest behind it. This increase in marketing spend coupled with the book-to-stay lag may negatively impact Q4 profitability, but should set us up well as we move into 2017. We expect the relative contributions of Orbitz and HomeAway versus our organic business to be broadly consistent with our guidance last quarter, better bottom line performance from these acquisitions offsetting relative underperformance in the core business. With that, let's open it up for some questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Dara, just you've now had a chance to digest the slowdown and the issues at Expedia, anything new that you'd like to add on this quarter? It seems like it was more than just Easter and Orbitz. And maybe you could expand on what's going on and what's bringing you out. And was there a competitive shift? And then secondly, just on HomeAway, I just would like to know the consumer reaction to the addition of consumer fees, any new data on that? And how do you think about the consumer fees offsetting some of the subscription revenues as we work into next year? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as the volume trends and the execution of the base business, listen, it's just good to get back to execution on the core. There were a ton of people across the company focused in on the Orbitz integration. They did a terrific job. And note that that acquisition integration came after Travelocity after Wotif. So I think the teams are \u2013 there's a bit of relief for the teams to get back to basics and get back to the business. And I think it's showing up in the numbers. You obviously don't see it in the stays because there's a book-to-stay lag, but the business has been getting consistently stronger, as we expected it to, as Q3 progressed, and early Q4 looks really good. So I think, listen, we expected it. Sometimes when you hit a speed bump, you wonder whether it's structural or whether it's temporal. I think this one is certainly proving out to be temporal. We don't take anything for granted. We are, as usual, when we accelerate into certain markets, the variable channels tend to be very fast twitch channels for us. So you may see some sales and marketing pressure on that front. And then following the variable channels, you get some of the more direct channels. And so in general, I'd say the teams are not taking anything for granted. I think that Q2 taught us a little bit of a lesson in humility that I think everyone can use once in a while. But based on what we're seeing, the formula that we've established for the past five years still works, and there's no reason why it wouldn't work on a go-forward basis, and we're certainly seeing that in the results. As far as HomeAway goes, the transactional revenue has been very strong in Q3 as we've rolled it out on a global basis and as the teams now are optimizing much more aggressively on the conversion front. And so while the transactional fee initially caused a dip in conversion, the teams there are really building out their e-commerce capabilities and muscles, and conversion is a very nice positive factor for us. Traffic continues to build, although Google free search continues to be weak. But on balance, we like what we're seeing, and you see it in the results. I think that as you move into Q4 and especially next year, you're going to see some of the subscription premium revenue that we have stopped selling start coming down. So the transactional revenue essentially has to scale up faster in order to make up for some of the subscription revenue growth coming down. It's something that we expected. And then of course some of the investments that we're making in marketing and technology, et cetera, are also going to show. So I think the team on HomeAway likes where we are, but we know that we've got a big lift ahead of us and the slope is going to get a little tougher, but I think the teams are up for it. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for taking my question. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tom White with Macquarie. Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great, thanks for taking my question. Just a clarifier on the room night trends, it sounds like things are accelerating here, but mostly in paid channels. I guess I am not sure I totally understand why the direct traffic or the direct channel is sort of lagging the faster twitch paid channels. And then just on the HomeAway performance, strong quarter on EBITDA, it was sort of in-line-ish in terms of revenue for us. So can you just remind us on that subscription revenue piece how the renewals phase sort of through the year or what percentage occur each quarter? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Tom. So on the room night trends, basically what happens is when you start getting conversion back working, if you can imagine, everyone on your website right now has a higher probability of converting, and in the direct channel that actually provides higher conversion rates and you get one benefit of that, and you also get it from those visitors that you brought via Google or metasearch. But then with that higher conversion rate, you actually adjust your bidding algorithms to say I now expect a higher expected value from the traffic I'm getting from the variable channels on a go-forward basis. And at that point, you're basically in a spot where you can take up your bids. And it adds an accelerator, if you will, in growth for those channels. So that's basically the impact. And then when you look at the impact of profitability, when you have that type of acceleration, what happens is in the quarter, where you're actually ramping up that spend, you only actually get to recognize a portion of the revenue because not all of the stays happen in that quarter and we recognize revenue for our hotel business generally on the stay. With respect to HomeAway performance, listen, generally the subscription renewals are spread throughout the year. As a reminder, we basically eliminated the tiers last quarter, the beginning of last quarter; grandfathered in a number of the premium players. And those subscriptions that were at premium will essentially start rolling off here on a go-forward basis. And once they roll off, they will either reset at the close to $500 per year subscription or the lower price we've set for online bookable properties. And so you'll essentially see the subscription revenue start to become a more negative headwind as we move through Q4, and then Q1 and Q2, and then you'll really start to annualize it in Q3 of next year. And then as a reminder, in terms of the traveler fee rollout as you're thinking about next year, we launched the traveler fee just towards the very end of the first quarter last year in the U.S. and then Europe was towards the end of the second quarter. Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great, very helpful. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi, thanks very much, so just a couple of questions. Dara, on the test-and-learn velocity, your commentary indicates that you continued to make progress throughout last quarter and it seems like the trend continued into October. Are you at a point where you think you are back in the saddle and even with the competition or do you think you have more ground to cover there? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Naved, I guess I'd compare us to where we were. I think that we have certainly improved, and I think the teams feel good about their execution, but we believe we that we can certainly get better. Can't really comment as to competition and what they're doing. I think that the teams feel better, but they think that they can do better. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. And then just on your plans for integrating HomeAway inventory into the core Expedia. Can you talk a little bit about if you have made any progress on that front? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: The engineering teams are hard at work doing it. As a reminder, we have tested with HomeAway previously. There's a vacation rental tab on Expedia, for example, now, but that wasn't a full integration. That was essentially a link off into HomeAway search results. And what we are talking about is a much more fundamental integrated experience where someone who comes to an Expedia or Hotels.com and is searching for hotels, depending on length of stay, depending on weekday, weekend, et cetera, they are going to get a complementary mix of hotel search results and/or vacation rental results based on a number of different presentations and logic. We expect to be piloting that experience sometime in Q4, and based on the results of those pilots, I think we will be making it a bigger part of our experience late this year and certainly going to next year. And I think it's a great benefit both for Expedia and Hotels.com consumers because they're going to get more breadth and depth of inventory in market, especially in some of the markets where HomeAway is very strong. And then I think for HomeAway, our partner is there, the homeowners, the property managers, they are going to get a significant boost of demand from these terrific travel brands, especially in urban destinations. So we think it's a win for the consumer, and it's a win for our marketplace, and we're pretty excited about the potential here. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : Next question is from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great, thanks for taking my question. How would you assess your international lodging supply sales force and where would you like it to be over the next 12 months to 18 months? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, listen, we've been aggressively growing our international hotel supply sales force. We grow that sales force as we build out our hotel inventory, and as those hotels start selling into a marketplace. So we're pretty disciplined about the build-out of the inventory and then the increase of our sales force. We've been consistently increasing our international sales force and coverage. There's a significant amount of increased activity now in secondary and tertiary markets that are typically markets where locals travel to, not necessarily international travelers. And our growth rates in those markets are typically in excess of our growth rates in primary markets or international destinations. And I think we're going to continue along those paths. Asia-Pacific markets are where we see the most significant growth, but we continue to make investments all over. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : Comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. Two questions, do you think there could be any competitive dynamics impacting room night growth? I realize you just said it largely had to do with temporary issues so the answer is probably no. But maybe you could just share your latest thoughts then on brand.com, metasearch and other OTA competition. And then the second question is just are there any geographies where you are seeing particular weakness or strength right now? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. Listen, as far as other OTA or metasearch competition, I think every single call probably in the past 10 years, we've referred to competition being tough. It's nothing new in this marketplace. And I think it's led to some of the consolidation that you've seen in the market more recently. There have been some players in Europe who are going out of business. So the competition is there. It is always difficult. The competitors are always getting better. And it's not good enough for a company to get better. You have to get better faster, and I think we're on a good path now. And we expect our competitors to be as tough as they've always been. We've obviously seen some activity on the supplier brand.com front as far as some of the loyalty fares that have expanded now versus what we've seen in the past. We've measured pretty carefully our performance in, call it, brand-heavy markets versus brand-light markets. We continue not to see any measurable difference between the two. So it doesn't seem to be affecting our results. What it is doing is that it is shifting more share of our supply to the independents who're growing faster than some of these brands and also to \u2013 there are some brands who are giving us the best inventory. So in general, the players who are giving us the best inventory are growing faster in our marketplace, both in terms of direct bookings and then you would think as far as the traffic that they're acquiring. So, and that shift actually is giving us some decent margin, call it, relief versus what we've seen in the past. So you'll notice that revenue per room night trends are generally improving as the year has gone by and some of it is due to the shift. So listen, we'll be watching it very closely. We obviously want to get the best inventory from all of our partners. The brands are very, very important partners of ours, and our goal is to build our business with them, not shrink our business with them. And we're investing in a number of new interaction methodologies, technologies, to hopefully get there. As far as the markets, the destination markets, I'd say in general it was pretty solid across the board, and as we said getting better, we did see some weakness in some markets in Florida relating to the Zika virus. There could be some offset in Mexico, for example, is particularly strong as that because Miami is weak. We don't exactly know. We were pleased to see Paris starting to grow again off of what was a pretty weak base, but it's great to see Paris now in the positive. The Spain and Portugal were very strong this summer, both in terms of room nights as well as ADRs. And the UK funny enough with Brexit and the pound being weaker London and the UK as a destination has become quite strong. So, I'd say decent results and the macro environment for us remains pretty good. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : We'll go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. We imagine TV was probably particularly crowded this quarter with Olympics and with presidential races. Wanted to know what the puts and takes were and the efficacy or effectiveness of that marketing channel for you. And then a quick follow on, we wanted to ask about social and dynamic product ads for travel on Facebook. Can you give some color as to the efficacy you are seeing there? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: So, Brian, just on TV, we didn't see anything particularly remarkable. There's always something going on. I think certainly the Olympics were a factor, but not a factor for that long. So I'd say nothing particularly we'd call out as being particularly impactful for our business. Dara, do you want to take the social one? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, as far as social on the dynamic travel ads, listen, it's a very, very promising area for us. Our Facebook advertising continues to grow very significantly, and they're a terrific partner. So we're quite optimistic there. Our goal in Facebook is to really get that channel and other social channels to real scale, and what really gets us scale is when you're able to identify intent in a more accurate way. We haven't quite cracked the code there, but we're working very hard with our partners at Facebook and other social networks in order to get there. Retargeting is pretty interesting, and obviously we're investing there. Some debate as to how incremental that advertising is, but we continue to gather data, we continue to increase spend, and the goal is to really scale it to Google-like levels if we can. Next question? Operator : We'll take our next question from Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Can you give us a little more color on what drove the revenue commission and margin upside at Orbitz? Was this mostly seasonal? And then also can you provide a little bit more color on the revenue acceleration at trivago? Which markets in particular have been the most robust? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: So just on Orbitz, are you talking specifically about revenue margin improvement overall? I think \u2013 yeah, basically air ticket prices are down. And generally, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was some feature and functionality that we did not build on to the brand Expedia platform that Orbitz had. And that resulted in us shedding a little bit of the air volume that we would have otherwise had, and that's essentially offset by better than previous Orbitz performance in the hotel business and also the media business. And then at trivago, I think listen, trivago has had very nice results year to date and particularly in the quarter in the U.S. and their core European markets. We'd call out South Korea and Japan as particularly promising markets too. These are big markets where trivago is targeting to scale up. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : Fantastic, thank you. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : The next question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. My questions are on the users of your rewards programs and a breakdown between U.S. and particular countries between business and leisure, if you tend to see the users as having been existing customers of Expedia or not. Are they bringing new customers or are you seeing more hotels or air or other, anything of this sort that gives us a good feel for who and why rewards programs are working or not working. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, we believe they're definitely working for us. We've got over 25 million Hotels.com rewards members, and the base is growing by over 30% a year. I believe Expedia Plus is now close to 20 million, if not over, as far as our members go. And the members, both Hotels.com and Expedia Plus as well as Orbitz Orbucks members tend to come back to us. The repeat rates are significantly higher than non-members. And the direct repeat rates or what we call organic repeat rates are significantly higher as well. So you get higher spend, and you get higher spend over more profitable channels. Now, those behaviors tend to come over the lifetime of that member. So we pay for the member acquisition and we pay for the points up front, which is a pressure on our P&L. You see some of that pressure in our revenue margins, and then we get the goodness as the member and the member base matures. The majority of our members at this point are in the U.S., but growth is very fast outside the U.S., especially in the Asia-Pacific regions. We find that our APAC customers love a great deal, and the Hotels.com rewards program and Expedia rewards program, those are great deals. The other factor that's pretty interesting now is that we are getting more and more inventory through our hotel partners that is now available for members only. So these are discounts that are available only if you sign in, so it's not a retail discount. It doesn't hurt ADR at all. But the hotels who are participating in these kinds of programs tend to gain share in our marketplace without giving up retail rate. So we think it's a win for our members and it's certainly a win for our hotel customers as well. We're in the tens of thousands of the hotels that are making these rates available, so you can imagine it's a very, very broad program, and it's attractive for our member base and it's attractive for our partners. Hopefully, that helps with your questions. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : We'll take our next question from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great, thanks for taking the question. I think you touched on this earlier, Mark or Dara. But given the recent ramp in HomeAway's EBITDA, I think it was around $77 million this quarter. Can you just remind us how that's going to trend or how you think that's going to trend in the 2018 guidance that you have, and really how you balance that margin expansion with reinvesting the profits in the marketing and overall share, which I think you are doing now? But I just want to revisit that and try to understand that a little bit better. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, happy to give more color, Ron. So I think in terms of growth rates, we're looking at Q3 as a high-water mark, if you will. We're in this period where subscription revenue has not yet become a meaningful drag, and you have got very easy comps on the transactional revenue. And so you basically are dropping a lot of profit to the bottom line, and we haven't yet completely ramped up to full steam on sales and marketing, and particularly in technology and products. So those are two areas particularly where you will see us start in Q4 and then particularly in through 2017 ramp investments aggressively. 2017 I will just tell you is not a year where we will be as focused on adjusted EBITDA growth as we are in just building the capability, and that's for HomeAway specifically. And we expect that once we build up particularly the product and tech team to where the size we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage that nicely as revenue growth and ultimately marketing contribution growth continues into 2018. And again, we feel very comfortable with our $350 million adjusted EBITDA number for 2018, but the path there will be one of investment in 2017 and realization in 2018 from a bottom line perspective. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: And I think I just want to make sure that our investors understand the perspective that there are two big players in this space, and arguably a third coming with Booking.com and their activity. But the big player, Airbnb, has a private market cap of over $30 billion. And so we see this HomeAway opportunity as a very, very large opportunity, and we are going to invest behind it as that kind of an opportunity. This is not an incremental project for us. This is a big project for us. Hotel inventory is available very, very broadly all over the world. There are hundreds of agencies, travel agencies, distributors who have hotel inventory available, including these brands that have real scale. That kind of inventory, the alternative accommodations inventory is just not available as broadly. And for us to be able to build one of the count-them-in-your-hands numbers of scale players that are organizing this inventory, which is very, very attractive to consumers all over the world, it's a very big opportunity. So we're investing right behind it as such. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : The next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Following up on HomeAway and looking higher up the funnel, is there an update you can give us on that $15 billion number of annualized bookings that HomeAway drives across online and off-line that they provided at the time of the acquisition and what traveler fee attach rate on that are you guys seeing today? And the second question if I can, when you look at Orbitz on the hotel side as you get deeper into the integration of the core properties from Orbitz on to the Expedia platform, are you guys seeing that traditional uptick in conversion rates that might allow you to step up spending in variable marketing channels around that brand? Or should we expect most of the synergy to come from the cost side there? Any color you could give would be great. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Lloyd. So on HomeAway, the $15 billion number that we quoted, we still feel comfortable with that number. To be honest, we're not too focused on looking at what the total platform derived bookings are at this point. What we're very focused on is taking the booking number that is actually happening on platform and growing it as fast as we possibly can. To do that, of course we're getting properties online and we're now well over a million properties that are online bookable. Then we're very much focused next on making sure that the online bookable listings are actually driving transactions on the platform as opposed to off the platform. And so far, results have been very good. Conversion rates are up pretty nicely year over year. Progress is pretty good. So, again, I think there is a huge opportunity here. I think the total bogey of $15 billion growing nicely because the overall market is growing nicely is absolutely out there. But the way we're getting there is just really focusing on the online piece and driving that as hard as we can. With respect to the Orbitz integration, we're definitely seeing nice conversion results on the hotel product. I think converting that into stepping up in marketing is something that we're still playing with at this point. We have got two very strong global brands in Brand Expedia and Hotels.com. These are brands that we are investing in to build really for the long-term. We think we have got a phenomenal brand also in Orbitz and in CheapTickets and in ebookers and Wotif and Travelocity. But the brands that are more regional in nature, our approach thus far has been, yes, be players in these variable marketing channels where we can, but let's be a little bit more focused on profit as opposed to top-line trend. So I think we're still evaluating our approach here. It's not set in stone. But generally, we're just being a little bit more bottom-line focused with the Orbitzes of the world versus top-line oriented. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Barclays. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, thank you. I just had a couple. So I think last quarter you talked a bit about weakness in metasearch channels. And are you still seeing that or have you really seen improving trends there? And then also any update on partnering with Instant Book or do you feel like you are effectively driving leads through their meta product currently? And then just a second question on HomeAway. I know you are working to improve conversion there. And you feel like you are on track such that you can really ramp up spend and variable marketing there? I imagine the competition with vacation rental keywords is fairly competitive, so just curious how that was trending. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as the meta channels, we have seen an improvement in the meta channels definitely. You'll see it, for example, in our numbers as far as the intercompany spend with trivago has accelerated on a year-on-year basis Q3 compared to Q2. So you could see that in our numbers. And in general, the meta channels are improving. We still think we can do better. So we're not satisfied there. As far as Instant Book goes, we continue to have constructive dialogue with TripAdvisor. No news to share at this point. I think the Instant Book marketplace in general is more mature now, the brand representation is better than it was when that product was initially introduced. So in general, we are more favorably inclined to that product now than where we were before. But we haven't crossed the finish line at this point. We'll see where we wind up in the next couple of quarters. As far as the HomeAway goes, on the conversion front, you're right, we're improving it, and we're on track. The marketing \u2013 the variable marketing channels are going to be an increasing factor, but I wouldn't call them a substantial factor at this point for HomeAway. The teams \u2013 we actually brought a very, very talented executive from Hotels.com on to the HomeAway team. He had been running Hotels.com online marketing for a while and did very, very well. And so he has now joined the HomeAway team. So I think the HomeAway team is now building the muscle. Conversion is going in the right direction, but really has to build muscle to build a very, very strong variable marketing channel and I think it's pretty early there. Also note that as we integrate the HomeAway inventory into Expedia and Hotels.com, Expedia and Hotels.com and Orbitz and Travelocity will also be able to bid more effectively for the vacation rental keywords as well. Who will be the winner, will it be more efficient for HomeAway to bid on those keywords or Hotels.com, that remains to be seen, and we will be testing and learning our way there. But I think it will be a bigger factor next year versus any time in the next couple of quarters. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you very much. Dara, you sound pretty confident on the re-acceleration for the fourth quarter. We have seen some of the hoteliers themselves just lower RevPAR forecasts for the fourth quarter as well as issue pretty cautious guidance for 2017. So just trying to understand how you are thinking through the macro environment at this point in time and investing in the core brand assets. And then just as a second question, mobile, earlier in the year at your Analyst Day you gave 40% of traffic as coming to you through mobile assets. One of your peers is actually approaching close to 50% of bookings through mobile. So, just trying to understand what type of trends you are seeing through mobile today. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as the re-acceleration in Q4, listen, it's early. But we like the trends that we're seeing. There's no guarantee that those trends will continue, so I don't want you to take too much confidence as far as how we're doing. We're just reporting based on how we've done and what we're seeing so far. In general, as we look at the macro environment, I do think that some of the weakness that we saw as it related to our results in Q2 was self-inflicted. We were very open about that. The sites weren't as stable as they needed to be. Some of the experimentation wasn't as strong as it needed to be. So we had to get our own house in order. So I think it's difficult to compare our results and trends to macro trends because we went through a lot of change this year. We are seeing while domestic ADRs have been positive, when I look at daily, weekly ADRs, they are weakening a little bit versus where they were in Q2. So that agrees with some of the trends that we're seeing. Our package inventory is in good shape, and again hoteliers load in inventory into opaque channels such as packages and Hotwire and these member-only deals when they need a little more help and it feels like some of the hoteliers need a little more help, on the Egencia side especially domestically, we're seeing a bit of caution as far as corporate travel spend goes. We don't see it in Europe, but we see it more domestically. So I'd say that on a macro basis, we're seeing some similar signs, which is a hint of weakness. We probably don't feel it as much as some of the other folks just because this online channel is a big growing channel, and we're riding that wave, and hopefully the hotel partners who engage with us on the inventory front aggressively are going to ride that wave with us and hopefully gain some share as we gain share. Mark, do you want to talk mobile? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. So, we feel pretty good about the mobile situation. 40% to 60% of traffic on our big leisure brands generally is coming from mobile. So if you were shooting for 50%, we're probably right in that zone. And then in terms of actual bookings that are happening on mobile devices, we've got certain brands, Wotif, Hotwire at times that are bumping up against mid-40%s to 50% range, Hotels.com is just behind them. And I think just the trend here is that we continue to see much faster growth in mobile than we do in desktop, not surprisingly we are seeing an increased shift of transactions and traffic to smartphone. Tablet is petering out. Mobile web is becoming more significant for us as we get much better at bidding for mobile web traffic in variable channels. So hopefully that will help you with a few of the trends that we're seeing. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you, Dara. Thank you, Mark. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : Comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. I just had a couple of follow-ups on HomeAway to help us with the top-line modeling. I think last quarter you gave us a number of transactional booked revenue growth year over year. Could you share that with us again? And then with an increasing portion of the business being driven by transactional revenue, can you give us a sense of the run rate of online bookings that you are generating at HomeAway? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Great modeling questions. So I'll help you with a little bit of it. We're not going to disclose the online gross bookings number at this point. It is something we were thinking about disclosing in the future. We're not going to disclose it at this point. I will tell you that booked transactional revenue for the quarter was up north of 250% year over year. Again, it's pretty easy comps. So that's the number. And on a sales basis as opposed to recognized revenue, subscription revenues started to decline double digits. So I would expect that to continue and accelerate a bit as we move here into 2017. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: And then overall, our listing count continues to increase at close to 20%. So the engagement of the supplier communities, so to speak, within the HomeAway marketplace continues to be very healthy. So we're pretty happy to see that. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : Comes from Ken Sena with Evercore ISI. Conor McDade - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is Conor on for Ken. Could you just speak a little bit about the take rate stabilization that we're starting to see in the last couple quarters? I think initially you had stated that heading into 2017, we might continue to see that, but it looks like maybe a little bit ahead of schedule there. Are you at a point where you feel you're at parity with the market rates on these things now, or should we expect that to maybe pick up again at some point in the future? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, so generally we feel like we are at parity with the competition in most every market in which we operate. We are in all markets offering a low-cost agency hotel offering, which is really at parity. And the differences I think at this point largely relate to upsell opportunities and our Expedia Traveler Preference program, which allows consumers to choose between merchant and agency and some other upsell value-added products that we are offering to our hotels. I think generally the margin story in terms of its impact on our revenue per room night is largely on track with the expectations we've set, which is that we really expect to be largely done with the big project, if you will, of rebasing margins by the end of this year. There are always tactical ups and downs that are going to happen as we move forward. So we may never be the end. We may never have complete stabilization. But we're really done with the big project by the end of this year, and then you're annualizing what we've done through the end of 2017. Conor McDade - Evercore Group LLC : Great, thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question, please? Operator : It comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. Back on the topic of HomeAway, Mark, the reference that you made towards, I think the term that you used was you were referring to the high point of growth that we are seeing here because of the confluence of subscription and transactional revenues. I guess, one, I want to make sure that we are thinking about that the right way suggesting that the incredible 60% growth that we saw with HomeAway, we should think of that decelerating from here as those comps get more difficult. But then also to the extent you could give us a sense of what's driving that between subscription growth versus transaction growth. And then just finally what kind of adoption you're seeing from subscribers or property owners in adopting online booking and online billing as well. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, so I absolutely meant to say that top line growth rates will slow down from this point forward. And really the driver here, particularly in Q4, is that the subscription revenue will start to be a drag as essentially the monetization model shifts over to either paper booking or online booking fees and also as we start to roll off some of the premium tiered subscription revenue. And then there will be additional factors that will kick in towards the end of Q1 and then again at the end of Q2 of next year as we lap over the booking fee implementation that we had this year. In terms of owners and managers adopting online bookings and online payments, listen, we're really happy with what we're seeing so far. We've got now nicely north of 1 million properties who are signed up and online bookable. A lot of them are taking advantage of the online payment platform that we've got. We're actually looking at ways that we can possibly leverage some of the payments capabilities that we have here at the mothership of Expedia, Inc., which could potentially add some more different payment options than they're offering right now. So, so far we're happy with the traction. Again, it's still early and there's lots of work to do, but so far so good. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Dan Wasiolek with Morningstar. Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you for taking the question, an intermediate term question I guess perhaps, but just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the opportunity and challenges for Expedia around artificial intelligence and virtual reality. And then if I could ask one other question. I'm wondering. You gave the month of September room nights growth rate with and without Orbitz. I was wondering if you might be able to give that September number for the previous year. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as the opportunity and challenges around AI and VR, I think on the AI side, we're testing with some interesting technologies such as on the Facebook messenger side your being able to go back and forth with an AI agent so to speak to book a hotel on Expedia. It's pretty cool. You should try it out. And I think it's a very, very early iteration of what a consumer experience might look like. I personally think that the bigger \u2013 the more significant opportunity in AI near to midterm is with highly repeatable, call it simple tasks that consumers engage in. And if you combine machine learning there with identity, so for example, on Facebook Messenger, we have identity established. I think on the customer service side, you can have some pretty clean great experiences. You're being able to messenger Expedia to change my Thursday night hotel booking to Friday or cancel my San Francisco hotel booking, et cetera, without having to call someone, without having to give an itinerary number, without having to really speak to anyone, just be able to message back and forth with essentially a bot to get your customer service requests done or, for example, we're very, very \u2013 we'd love to work with our hotel partners. Right now you can message our hotels through some of our systems to be able to message a hotel and ask for late checkout or early check-in, et cetera. Those I think are experiences where AI can service you because you've got high volumes, you've got repeatable tasks that a computer can iterate against and learn from. So I think you'll see some of the sexy stuff on the booking side, and then you'll see some of the unsexy stuff on the customer service side, and we plan to experiment with both of them. On the VR side, we are testing with VR rigs as we speak. I think that the potential that we see with VR is to whet the appetite of someone looking at a destination, what experience they can have, and/or a hotelier. So we want VR to be just good enough to make you want to go there, but not good enough for you to avoid the trip. And I think we have plenty of time here. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Exactly. Dan, on the room night growth question, we're not going to answer the September, but I'll just remind you that in Q3 of 2015, organic room night growth was just about 29%. We reported 36% all in. Inorganic contributors were Brand Expedia Asia, which we had consolidated just at the end of the quarter before or two quarters before in Q1 and then Wotif as well with a very small contribution from Orbitz, which closed halfway through September. Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question, maybe a bigger picture one. One of the announcements that took us a little bit by surprise in the quarter was the Marriott Expedia with respect to Expedia being the technology platform partnering vacations by Marriott. Wanted to understand a little bit of the genesis of how that came to be. And, Dara, we've talked a lot over the years on these calls about the technology investments Expedia is making, about how that puts you on the front foot after a number of years to be a broader technology platform for the travel industry. Is this a forerunner for things we could see over the next couple years and how might that impact the business model? Thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Great question, Eric. And I'd say definitely. Listen, the platform that we build both on the Expedia side and on the Hotels.com side have the capability to be extensible. And just as we are using the Expedia platform to power the Orbitz side with different experiences, power Wotif with different experiences, we will be able to extend that capability to a Marriott vacations and other providers as well. We think that there are tons and tons of hotels out there and hotel chains out there, airlines out there, who don't necessarily \u2013 aren't necessarily able to keep investing and keep experimenting and keep optimizing leading sites that can accept payments in every single payment plan known on earth. We can do that. And we can essentially extend our platform into the travel ecosystem, which is something that we're doing. And then on the supply side, we're even tying in now supply from third parties where not only are we acquiring supply directly, but we are piping in supply from other players, and we will present the best choice for consumers based on what that best choice is, based on availability, based on pricing, et cetera. So it is a two-sided marketplace. We're very, very early in this. And then of course we've got a private label business, our EAN business that is actually one of the stars of the show. It's a business that is growing very, very quickly, especially in the Asia-Pacific markets and we're pretty optimistic about. And then lastly, Orbitz did have a very, very big private label business. It had call it more customization capability than what we had built on the Expedia side where we have taken on that team and they're a very important part of our team now and we're building up call it the more \u2013 the increased customization capability on top of the Expedia platform. So, we're investing in this area. You're not done seeing hopefully surprising announcements in the future because I think our capabilities are going to get much, much better here. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for the color. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome, next question? Operator : The next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. This is Rob on the call for Peter. Two questions, please. First, wondering if you could provide an update on Accelerator and what you're seeing there given the current RevPAR backdrop. And then secondly on Orbitz, just wondering if you can provide a little more color on what functionality you've decided not to build into the Expedia platform going forward and just a little more color on what to expect there in Q4. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Rob. As far as Accelerator, we're making good progress there. So Accelerator, the number of hotels that are engaging in the Accelerator product continues to increase. The bidding activity continues to increase as well. We're seeing less engagement from some of our \u2013 the big brands out there. So, smaller hotels tend to engage in Accelerator more aggressively. But we're very, very pleased with the results and every week the numbers get better. It is still a new product, and it's not, I would say, a significant driver of our overall results, but we do see it building and we're quite pleased with the early signs so far. As far as Orbitz goes and one functionality, there was a number of, call it, packages type functionality that we initially dropped off that we're going to be adding as time goes on; ebookers in Europe had certain functionality of what we call Sub Pub where we were price some airfare below pub-ish rates in order to go out and acquire customers. There was some fee technology that both Orbitz and ebookers had built, variable fees especially on the air side that we haven't carried through at this point. These are all technologies that were actually pretty interesting, but whenever you move on something from a technology side, you introduce what we call an MVP, a minimum viable product and then you build on it. So some of this functionality may make its way back, some of it is very, very cool. But we wanted to move Orbitz and e-bookers over as quickly as possible and I think the teams made the right trade off calls, and I think that they have executed quite well Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. Dara, do you have any final thoughts? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Just thanks to the Expedia, Inc. employees for definitely a quarter that was a step in the right direction, and we all know that we're not satisfied so we've got a lot more work ahead of us. And thank you to everyone for joining the call. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation.",

Operator : Good day, and welcome to Expedia\u2019s Q4 2016 earnings conference call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President Investor Relations at Expedia. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill : Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Expedia, Inc.\u2019s financial results conference call for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016. I\u2019m pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia\u2019s CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP Operations. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management\u2019s views as of today, February 9, 2016 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today\u2019s call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and the company\u2019s filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You\u2019ll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company\u2019s IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today\u2019s earnings release and the updated investor deck. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation expense, and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. As a quick reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our full-year 2016 results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, full-year commentary in earnings release and on this call, is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis. Fourth quarter results do not contain any results related to eLong in either year. With that, let me turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alan. 2016 was a year of ups and downs for Expedia. We learned some valuable lessons on things we can do better, but we also chalked up great performances across the portfolio, including from some of our largest acquisitions, brands and businesses that will play a big part of our profits, cash flow and overall growth moving forward. We exited 2016 with nice momentum and we start the New Year from a position of strength. For the full-year 2016, our customers booked over $72 billion of travel products. We delivered full-year revenue of $8.8 billion, up 32% year-over-year; adjusted EBITDA over $1.6 billion, up 39%; and 246 million room nights, up 21%. 2016 also marked the completion of our most significant integration yet. That of the Orbitz family of consumer brands as well as Orbitz for Business. I am very proud of the entire team for the considerable efforts, which paid off in the form of $224 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2016, reflecting synergy realization meaningfully ahead of our expectations, and overall profitability clearly better than what Orbitz could have delivered standalone. As they say, however no deed goes unpunished - good deed goes unpunished, and we did pay a cost related to these migration efforts in the form of deceleration in room night growth in the middle of the year. Our teams are now completely refocused on our operational formula, high velocity product experimentation driving conversion, aggressive optimization of our marketing channels on a global basis, expansion of our supply portfolio and growth of our repeat user-base, all in a continuous and self-reinforcing cycle. We are seeing the output of our operational formula and improved room night growth particularly at Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, EAN and Egencia, with the momentum continuing in to January. In the meantime, we are optimizing our marketing formula for regional brands including Travelocity, Orbitz, Hotwire and Wotif, within eye towards improved marketing efficiencies and a bias towards the bottom line. HomeAway has now been a member of the Expedia family for over a year, and our efforts to transition to a global e-commerce enabled alternative lodging marketplace are on track. We\u2019ve implemented the traveler service fee, announced the elimination of the tier subscription model, and substantially increased our investments and capabilities in online marketing, product and technology. We are on track financially with $163 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2016 and a very aggressive investment plan in 2017, on our way to the $350 million EBITDA target in 2018. The HomeAway team is hitting their marks, conversion growth is healthy, renewals and listings are on track and improving. And we are looking forward to continued success over the long-term. trivago had another great year in 2016, delivering standalone revenue of $836 million, up 53% year-over-year, and accelerating in both third and fourth quarter. Team trivago didn\u2019t miss a beat in their execution cadence even as they completed their IPO. We look forward to continued global expansion, market share gains and improving profitability in the years to come. I will also note that trivago plans to have its own conference call in a couple of weeks, where they will discuss performance and their outlook for their business in more detail. Egencia delivered a solid 2016 with revenue up 16%, and adjusted EBITDA up 18%, aided by the addition of Orbitz for Business. And we are particularly pleased with the strong Q4 EBITDA growth of 97%. Egencia is now a scale corporate travel technology and service provider with $6.4 billion in gross bookings, which the team is aiming to double over the next four years. We know that our corporate travel products and technology are best in class. And we are working to dramatically improve our capabilities on the expense management side. With integrations complete and our leading product offering in place, we plan to ramp up the Egencia sales force over the next few years to gain better global coverage and accelerate organic top line growth. And, of course, we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic on acquisition side. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the momentum that our team built through Q4 and carried into the start of 2017. These are interesting times for all of us, but with the $1.3 trillion opportunity in the global travel market ahead of us, we\u2019re executing with the cadence and discipline that gives me confidence in our ability to deliver a great 2017 and beyond. Mark? Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Dara. We finished the year with a solid fourth quarter that was largely in line with our expectations. Gross bookings were up 8%, revenue up 23% and adjusted EBITDA up 58%. Excluding both Orbitz and HomeAway, these measures grow a healthy 12%, 17% and 15% respectively. Hotel revenue was up 13% for the quarter, driven by room night growth of 15%. Excluding Orbitz, room nights grew 16% with our global brands, Hotels.com, Expedia EAN and Egencia each growing room nights in an even faster rate. Average daily rates were down less than 1% in Q4, while revenue per room night decreased by less than 2%. The gap between the two is just over a 110 basis points, which was better than we have expected as a result of favorable package margins and some favorability in our loyalty program cost in the quarter. Note, that as we look forward into 2017, we do expect that gap to be a little bit bigger. Advertising and media revenue net of intercompany amounts grew 43% year-over-year to a sizeable $807 million for full year 2016. For the fourth quarter, ad and media was up 36% year-over-year, driven by strong performance at trivago. On a standalone basis, trivago revenue grew 65% in the fourth quarter, accelerating from 57% growth in Q3. This is a big brand that is building impressive scale on a global basis. For full year 2016, HomeAway delivered approximately $6 billion of online gross bookings, up 46% year-over-year, driven by over 22 million online room nights. Note that we plan to disclose these metrics for HomeAway in a quarterly basis beginning in Q1 of 2017 and plan to disclose the 2016 comparable numbers ahead of our Q1 call. In the fourth quarter on a standalone basis, HomeAway revenue grew 30% and adjusted EBITDA grew 16% as we started to ramp additional marketing and technology investments. To help you think about how to model HomeAway going forward, I did want to provide some additional color. For full year 2016, subscription revenue comprised just over half of HomeAway\u2019s revenue. And we expect this to decline to just about 25% of the mix in 2017. As a reminder, we lap the elimination of the tiered subscription model at the beginning of Q3 2017. Transactional revenue grew just over 240% in the fourth quarter. As we look forward into 2017, we expect that revenue to - revenue stream to grow nicely, as we continue to benefit from the traveler service fee. Although, we do expect to see deceleration in this growth as we lap the initial rollout. Note also that above 5% of HomeAway revenue represents ancillary services such as advertising and software, which we expect to grow much more moderately. Our expense trends in Q4 moved closer to our target P&L as we began to lap over the impact of the Orbitz and HomeAway acquisition. Cost of revenue grew nicely slower than revenue as we continue to drive for operational efficiency. Direct selling and marketing expenses grew faster than revenue, as we continue to ramp up our variable marketing channels and push for global growth. Growth in technology and content expense remained ahead of revenue growth but decelerated nicely from the growth seen in Q3, and a bit more than we had expected. General and administrative expenses were down year-over-year, as we lap certain deal costs in the prior year. From a capital deployment standpoint, we were pleased to be able to repurchase 4 million shares in 2016 for a total of $436 million and have increased our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share for payment in March. Before I move to our guidance for 2017, I wanted to cover our efforts to migrate certain components of our technology infrastructure into the cloud-computing environment. This is a significant and important effort that began in earnest in 2016 and resulted in total direct cost of approximately $40 million. We have aggressive plans for further migration in 2017 and currently expect nearly $110 million of direct cloud spend for the year. We expect the incremental spend year over year to be largely offset by lower infrastructure CapEx requirements in 2017, and we expect this entire effort to be cash flow accretive within the next couple of years. Although the cloud migration is a profitability headwind in 2017, it makes strong financial sense and will result in better overall performance, resiliency and consumer experiences. Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2017, on a consolidated basis including the ramp up in cloud spending, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 15%. Excluding cloud expenses growth would be 14% to 19%. In terms of the shape of the year, as usual due to the seasonality of our business we are expecting the majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we invest in selling and marketing to generate bookings ahead of the busy travel season with the revenue recognition occurring at the time of travel, and as such we usually see some pressure on earnings early in the year with the upside coming disproportionately in Q3, the busiest time for travel. In addition, the shift of Easter into Q2 this year will result in a negative impact on revenue and profitability in Q1. With sizeable integration work behinds us, we\u2019re pleased to return to business as usual and expect to manage our expenses largely in line with our target P&L. We expect adjusted cost of revenue to grow nicely slower than revenue, while selling and marketing should grow faster as we continue to push for global growth. We expect technology and content expense to grow slightly faster than revenue, as leverage in our ordinary course tech spending will be more than offset by growth in our cloud spend outlined earlier. And, of course, general and administrative expenses should grow solidly slower than revenue in 2017. Now, I\u2019d like to provide some additional color on trends in our capital expenditures. Excluding costs related to our new headquarters, for full-year 2016, approximately 60% of our CapEx was capitalized software development, 30% related to data center and infrastructure, and the remainder related to non-HQ global real estate projects. For 2017, we expect this CapEx to be flat to slightly down with a decrease in data center and infrastructure spend offset by growth in capitalized software development and non-HQ real estate CapEx. Separately, in terms of our new headquarters, we now expect total build cost of around $650 million, of which approximately $30 million was spent in 2016 and less than $100 million will be spent in 2017. The remainder will be split roughly evenly between 2018 and 2019. Lastly, while there are many moving parts, we believe that an effective tax rate in the mid 20% range remains appropriate for forecasting purposes. With that, let\u2019s turn to questions. Dara Khosrowshahi : Camilla, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question, so just a couple. On HomeAway, I think there is some talk about pulling in 20,000 or so of the rooms, and deploying them into the core Expedia. Well, what kind of pace do you expect for 2017? And of the 20,000 that you did pull into the Core OTA, can you share some results in terms of what kind of performance you saw on the conversions and bookings? Dara Khosrowshahi : Hi, Naved. As far as the 20,000 coming into the core Expedia, the overall production within our numbers was de minimis, it was a small number. We very much go forward on a test-and-learn basis. This is - were very, very early days. And as we move throughout 2017, we will add in more properties. We want to make sure that those properties are instant bookable, so to the extent that you are a supply partner of HomeAway that is providing instant bookable properties. You will get more exposure not only on HomeAway, because of their sorts, but also on Expedia. Note that right now the properties are starting up on Expedia and then we\u2019ll roll them into Hotels.com and some of our other brands. So we will be rolling them in through the years. Too soon to tell as to whether they will be a significant portion of our production this year, but we certainly think from a long-term perspective having this inventory as part of our marketplace is a very, very important strategic importance for us going forward. Naved Khan : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, quickly on the room night side, I guess you had an easier comp because of the Paris attack in Q4 of 2015. So if you sort of adjust for that, what kind of trends did you see. And I think on the last quarterly call you did talk about trends you saw into October. Can you provide us of the trends you might be seeing in January or year-to-date? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. In general, certainly Paris was a tailwind for us this year. And when we look at our volumes in Paris and France, they\u2019re up pretty substantially on a room night basis. ADRs are down. So if you noticed, our international ADRs are down on a Q4 basis. So Paris and London were negative on ADR basis, but certainly positive on a volume basis. But when we look at our portfolio broadly the big brands, the Expedias, the Hotels.com, the EANs of the world, continue to perform more strongly in Q4 than Q3, and the trends that we see in January are constructive for us. Mark Okerstrom : Naved, I\u2019d also just add to that notwithstanding the easier comp from Paris, we actually had 300-basis-point harder comp just on the sequential basis moving into Q4. So we view Paris and the harder comp as essentially offsetting each other. Naved Khan : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And any color or commentary on the trends year-to-date? Dara Khosrowshahi : Constructive trends, so in general we saw momentum get better Q4 relative to Q3 and Q2 and January is so far as good. Naved Khan : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Paul Bieber : Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick questions. How should we think about the conversion rate opportunity on Expedia.com in 2017, given your plans for allocating engineering resource at different projects? And then any really takeaways from your test with TripAdvisor? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as the conversion opportunity, it\u2019s pretty similar to what it\u2019s been in the past as it relates to Expedia, Hotels.com, all of our significant brands. And for us, the overall growth opportunity is - it\u2019s conversion, it\u2019s our conversion allowing us to reach into additional marketing channel. So it\u2019s conversion and audience growth combined with supply growth, and repeat growth, makes for pretty good formula, where if you modestly increase each part of that formulae you can get into pretty good room night volume. So we are constructive on conversion. Obviously, the shift to mobile continues pretty quickly on a global basis, so that\u2019s a headwind. And also, the shift internationally for us, in general our domestic brands convert at higher rates because we have a higher percentage of repeat customers than our international brand. So the shift to mobile and the shift to international points of sale, especially APAC is a conversion headwind. But when you reverse those trends out or you look on a same kind of store basis conversion trends in general are looking good. And we think that we can kind of continue on the test-and-learn path that we\u2019ve had for many years. And kind of get going on the same formula that carried us here over the last four to five years. As far as TripAdvisor goes just it\u2019s very, very early. We\u2019ve ramped up on TripAdvisor. I\u2019d say the volumes and the impressions are relatively limited at this point for various reasons. So we are not going to have exposure to call it a 100% of the TripAdvisor Instant Book audience that will be substantially less than that. So at this point, it\u2019s not a significant factor for us, but it\u2019s a positive factor in our volumes early on. And we hope to build on those volumes as the years progress. Mark Okerstrom : And as a reminder, as TripAdvisor was rolling out Instant Book and we were not a participant, the headwind was between 100 and 300 basis points on room night growth. So you can think about that as the possible maximum opportunity on a go-forward basis, should we have full participation, which we are not doing right now. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. We are not going to have full participation this year or next year. Paul Bieber : Okay. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Alex Giaimo : Hey, guys. This is Alex Giaimo on for Brian. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us a little color on your cloud migration efforts; maybe just how much of your operations are moving to the cloud and how far into the process are we? And then maybe if you could some color on the specific cloud providers you\u2019re using? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as cloud migration efforts go, we\u2019re I\u2019d say early to midstream. They are parts of your stack that you can easily take to the cloud and we certainly done that this year. The teams have worked very, very hard to re-factor the code and architecture to make that possible. One of the issues as far as cloud migration goes is to make sure that the applications that you take to the cloud aren\u2019t particularly chatty with your mainline data centers. The big cost becomes the transfer cost of data between your cloud centers and your mainline data centers. So we are migrating keeping that in mind. The teams are really doing a good job of taking parts of the code-base to the cloud, then optimizing them from a cost basis, and then continue to take other parts of the codes to the cloud. The significant increase in movement to the cloud reflects at least the plans for us to lift a significant part of our lodging search stack onto the cloud. Our significant cloud provider is AWS at this point. Although we are looking at making sure that we have not - on overall dependence on one player. So as you can imagine with the volumes that we are running at right now, we have quite a few people kind of calling us and offering their services. And we\u2019ll determine whether we take them up or not. But right now, the AWS team has been really terrific as far as their partnership goes, the engineering teams are working really well together. And I think that over a period of time, this year we will shift pretty significant parts of our throughput to the cloud. Mark indicated the estimate for how much we are going to take to the cloud. These are estimate to this point and we may wind up being successful on taking a higher portion of our code-base onto the cloud or we may not be successful. And at this point, this is a pretty speculative effort, but we just want to give you as much - kind of as much of a look ahead as we can. And we\u2019ll update you on a quarterly basis as to how we are doing. But this is unquestionably a really, really good efforts by our engineers and we think it\u2019s going to result in a consumer experience that\u2019s going to be substantially better. Alex Giaimo : Great. Very helpful. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two things. First, Mark, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the margin trajectory for HomeAway. And particularly you talked about the substantial investments in 2017. Can you just give us some more color on where those dollars are going to go, and then obviously kind of how you come out of that into 2018, as you work toward that $350 million? And then, Dara, just to go back to your comment on Trip Instant Book, just curious when you talked not being a full participation this year, or it sounds like in 2018, and I guess it\u2019s maybe a little bit surprising to maybe just wondering why that\u2019s the case? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Hey, Doug. So in terms of the margin trajectory for HomeAway, I would expect margins to essentially start to contract in 2017 and then rebound in 2018. In other words, I wouldn\u2019t draw a straight line between 2016 adjusted EBITDA, and the $350 million that we laid out. We will be making some significant investments in 2017, which will ultimately then annualize in 2018. The investments are predominantly going into technology and product as well as sales and marketing. And you started to see a little bit of that impact in Q4, and that\u2019s just going to get even heavier as we move through 2017. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think on HomeAway too, when you look at our seasonality, as you know a significant amount of our stays happened in Q3 over the summer period. And I think for HomeAway, you are going to see it be even more concentrated in Q3. So the expenses and the negatives on subscription revenue kind of hit us consistently on a quarterly basis, and that the significant offset the positives on the stays are really going to be focused on Q3. So I think Q1 and Q2 are going to see some margin pressure. And then Q3, we will see a very significant payoff on the investments that we are making there. As far as our Instant Book participation goes, we are testing and learning. Its early results are good. As far as our ability to participate and the volumes there, and I think you\u2019ll have to ask that question to the TripAdvisor team. Douglas Anmuth : Okay. Thank you, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi : You bet. Next question. Operator : Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide a little more color on HomeAway\u2019s performance marketing like what stages are we in terms of being a more of an aggressive advertiser in the U.S.? And how does that domestic progress currently compare to initiatives in other regions? Dara Khosrowshahi : I\u2019d say that we\u2019re pretty early. We\u2019ve actually brought in some excellent talents to really build up that team, some talent from within the company. And I think that HomeAway, as it\u2019s transitioning from a business that whose economics were based on subscriptions and subscription renewals, and there is a certain marketing strategy to drive subscription renewals, to a business and strategy that\u2019s based on driving transactions, that\u2019s our bread and butter as it relates to our OTA brands. And we have some good talent there. We are making some investments in data infrastructure and kind of the tooling necessary to be able to do this at scale. And I\u2019d say, we\u2019re pretty early in the process and we think that there is plenty of improvement ahead of us. The other factor obviously as it relates to HomeAway is that as we move the HomeAway inventory onto Hotels.com, Expedia, we think that Hotels.com, and Expedia, and Travelocity\u2019s ability to bid in these variable channels especially in the HomeAway strength inventory markets improves as well. That should happen late this year towards 2018. Jed Kelly : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question? Operator : Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two please. Just, Dara, can you talk a little bit more about international booking plans for this year? I think you mentioned in the past that was an investment focus for you all, and wondering how you think about jump starting growth there. And then, Mark, I think you mentioned room night on Hotels.com, Expedia, Egencia all grew faster than the 16% organic rate. Any additional color you can provide there like maybe high teens or 20% that would be helpful. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as our international booking plans, as you can imagine with the integration of Travelocity and then Orbitz, there was just a significant amount of work done as it relates to our brands and it was work that was focused domestically. So I think in general when we look at our marketing investment plans and capital allocation plans, we\u2019re certainly going to allocate some incremental capital, that\u2019s international capital. But the fundamental, call it, operating formula that we have in place isn\u2019t going to change. It\u2019s just that we have an opportunity now to focus in international markets, in growth markets, and read Europe and especially the Asia-Pacific regions as being the top two that we\u2019re going to be focused on. We saw decent trends in Q4 and we expect those trends to improve as we go into 2017, based on our expectation of the teams really focusing on these markets and really executing. So it\u2019s not anything substantially different other than the opportunity for the teams to really focus and work through these opportunities. Mark Okerstrom : Ron, on the room night question, collectively the global brands grew a couple of hundred basis points faster than the rest of the portfolio. I would also just call out the room night disclosure that we gave on HomeAway. And if we had included the HomeAway numbers in our 2016 full-year results, that would add another couple of hundred basis points to the overall room night growth as well. Ronald Josey : Got it. Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Next we have Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson : Hey, good afternoon. Couple of questions if I could. Just to clarify on the increased spend in 2017, outside of the cloud migration, does it essentially come down to marketing and product development spend on Expedia, Hotels.com and HomeAway? And if that\u2019s the case, how should we think about the investment you\u2019re making in 2017 relative to impact on room night growth, the organic room night growth to be able to accelerate in the year based on that investment? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Well, to answer your first question those are the primary areas of investment, it\u2019s cloud and then it is continued spend in sales and marketing, both in terms of direct sales and marketing for our Core OTA brands as well as Trivago and HomeAway. And then also with respect to our hotel market management team to continue to scale that up and be able to add new properties. In terms of the impact to room night growth, listen, this is part of the formula. We\u2019re happy with the momentum that we\u2019ve got right now. And our goal is to - if we can do it, do better, but we\u2019re not going to guide on the room night growth trajectory for 2017. Mark Okerstrom : And I do want to be clear on the investments that while we continue to invest in our businesses and drive growth aggressively, we do think that we\u2019re going to leverage nicely on a fixed cost base, plus sales, G&A, even R&D if you don\u2019t include cloud spend should leverage pretty nicely. We\u2019re aware that we\u2019ve invested in these categories pretty aggressively. And I think that now as a business, we are in a nice position to leverage across our fixed cost base. And on sales and marketing whether leverages or deleverages is really a factor of the channels that we\u2019re able to reach into, and whether they\u2019re domestic or international or not. And if anything, we want our sales and marketing to some extent to deleverage. Because it means we\u2019re able to reach into some interesting new channels. And usually interesting new channels tend to be a little less efficient than direct channels. But it\u2019s a key factor in our growing our repeat base. And we think that if we can drive sales and marketing efficiently across these channels and then leverage the fixed cost base of the business we have a pretty good P&L ahead of us. Michael Olson : Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Next we have Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Great. A couple questions. First on - looks like conversion rate\u2019s kind of stalled out. And maybe that was due to Orbitz integration. But can you talk about your pace of conversion rate improvements? And could that pick up this year as you enter the important summer travel season? And the second things is on the cloud migration. I haven\u2019t heard other companies really have to see a big expense ramp as they migrate to the cloud. What\u2019s kind of unique about your ramp and will we see leverage in 2018? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as conversion, we don\u2019t talk about our conversion rates too specifically, but I do think that we were pretty open about our product conversion increases that had been a part of our significant growth that we\u2019ve seen for the past four to five years, not being where we want to be in the middle of the year. So as we have focused on the core product, as we put the integrations behind us, we are in general more pleased with the trends that we\u2019re seeing. They\u2019re early trends, but you can certainly see it in the room night trends in Q4 and - or at least discussion - our early discussion about January rates. And as far as our cloud migration efforts versus other companies, I can\u2019t really speak to some of the other companies\u2019 efforts. I think that many are, call it, the new generation companies, kind of startup in cloud from the very beginning. I think that we are one of the, I would say, few large-scale technology companies that is making this transition very aggressively. That\u2019s certainly what we hear from some of the cloud vendors. So I think we\u2019re little bit ahead of the pack here. And while it hurts our EBITDA as a print, so to speak, when we look at our net cash flows and when we look at kind of the long-term CapEx of the business and operating expenses of the business, we think this cloud migration is going to be very, very important for us going forward and definitely a net positive. Justin Post : And maybe one follow-up, just think about room night growth, you talked about continued growth on Hotels.com and Expedia, and maybe slower growth on Orbitz and Travelocity and few of the other brands. Can you give us any sense of the fast growth mix versus the slower growth mix as a percent of room nights? Mark Okerstrom : Yes. Not specifically quantitative, but yes, but the big global brands are significantly larger. And you can back in to a rough number based upon my commentary around 200 basis points of incremental growth on those global brands versus the overall portfolio. Dara Khosrowshahi : And also keep in mind that the global brands have - are able to participate in Asia-Pacific markets, European markets that are faster growth by nature. So the regional brands are - the expectations are for them to grow to the extent that they do closer to the domestic market which is a little more mature than the international markets. Justin Post : Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Welcome. Next question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Close enough. Can you give us a sense of the traffic dynamics at HomeAway? Some of the third-party reports are suggesting that traffic growth was negative in the fourth quarter, at least in the U.S. part of the business. I guess, first, is that accurate? And second, is there anything structurally or from a market focus perspective that explains that? And I guess, just how do you think about sort of the importance of traffic growth as you\u2019re trying to increase monetization on the platform and more of the inventories particularly potentially moving on to the Expedia platform? And then just any update on what you\u2019re seeing in the direct booking pricing efforts by the hotels? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as the traffic dynamics of HomeAway, we have been obviously measured by third party reports for many, many years. We have attempted numerous times to compare those third party reports with our internal metrics. And I think we gave up about five-and-a-half years ago. So we honestly don\u2019t pay too much attention to those third party reports, certainly within on a quarterly basis. We look at them over a long-term period. But they often disagree with our internal metrics. And I have no idea why. And we are not going to spend a bunch of time trying to figure out exactly why. What I can tell you is that our internal metrics indicate with HomeAway that traffic is up year on year. We have talked about natural search - Google natural search being a headwind in general. And it\u2019s I think a lot of people have talked about that as Google kind of takes more and more of their screen space, and monetizes that screen space. And it\u2019s certainly their right. But players like ourselves don\u2019t have much of a choice because of Google\u2019s market power. So that has been a negative for HomeAway. But we are able to offset that through very effective marketing on the brand side. And in general, just the better service that\u2019s attracting more people into a lodging category that in general is growing. So we are pleased with the progress of HomeAway. We always want traffic growth to accelerate. And we\u2019ll certainly try to make it accelerate over the next couple of years. But at this point, it is positive, and we are satisfied with the results there. And as far as the direct booking efforts by the hotel - by some of the chain hotels, no big news, I think not much significant has happened. You can certainly see from our room night volumes that our results have not been significantly affected by those efforts one way or the other. We do continue to have independent hoteliers be a higher and higher percentage of our overall bookings. We think that is healthy. And we continue to really work constructively with a lot of these hotel companies to really look at value added ways in which that we can work with them, whether it is trying to drive more direct traffics through them, as a marketing channel, whether it\u2019s just to drive bookings, bookings, bookings or it\u2019s actually to work with them on a more core technology basis to help them increase their effectiveness at far, far lower costs based on the investments that we are making in our global distribution stack that they can take advantage of. So I think the conversations are rich. I think things have settled down a bit. And we think that there are certainly going to be many opportunities for us going forward. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : All right, next you have Mark May with Citi. Alan Pickerill : Mark, are you there? Operator : Not hearing anything. We\u2019ll move on to Chris Merwin with Barclays. Christopher Merwin : Hi, thank you. So I just wanted to ask about margins a bit. On a consolidated basis it looks like you\u2019ve got it to relatively flat margins this year at midpoint as you reinvest in the business. But when we think about the Core OTA business, margins had been coming down slightly in the last few years, but finished up in 2016. So how should we be thinking about the normalized margin trajectory of the Core going forward? And then just quickly for HomeAway, you reported online gross bookings of $6 billion. If we assume total are still in the $15 billion range, I guess that\u2019s about 40% in total. Where do you see that percentage going in 2017? And when maybe can we expect to see HomeAway included in room nights? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Chris. So listen, on margins, again 2016 was a bit of a noisy year, and of course with all of the integration efforts that happened with Orbitz, you had double cost the beginning of the year that that then came out. And a lot of the synergies that we ultimately got were cost synergies. So it\u2019s hard to look at 2016 and draw much in terms of conclusions. What I will tell you though is that, we said this before, is we are not solving for adjusted EBITDA margins, we\u2019re solving for adjusted EBITDA growth, adjusted EPS growth and free cash flow growth. And as Dara mentioned, the general theory here is that we are going to keep very, very disciplined on our fixed cost base. And then drive sales and marketing, to really drive to that last - almost last marginal dollar of variable profit. And that is the growth maximizing formula, but it\u2019s not necessarily the margin maximizing formula for us. And we are really going for growth here. In terms of HomeAway room night growth trajectory, and sort of the overall opportunity. I do think that that $15 billion opportunity is - it\u2019s a good proxy. We are not really thinking about it that way and then we are thinking about it as how fast can we grow the $6 billion. And we think the opportunity is pretty rich. And as Dara mentioned, we\u2019re still in the early stages of getting variable marketing ramped up, not only just getting the data infrastructure and the capabilities embedded in that organization. But then, also HomeAway itself is quite early in the product innovation and test-and-learn velocity cycle that has become such a core part of our operational formula in the Core OTA business. And as they ramp up that, that should open up even more opportunities for very strong growth for them going forward. So we\u2019re very optimistic of the opportunity. And again, the team is executing very well, but it\u2019s quite early. In terms of room nights, we plan to beginning on our next call, disclose the quarterly room nights for HomeAway. And before that call, we will disclose the quarterly room nights for 2016 as well to see you\u2019ve got the comparable periods. Christopher Merwin : All right. Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : You\u2019re welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Following up on that last question on the $6 billion, maybe you can give us a sense of what the growth rate was from HomeAway bookings exiting the year, and what percent are carrying a traveler fee, I guess, last year of that $6 billion? And another one if I can, can you just, I guess, give us a sense of the overall health of the travel market. It sounds like you\u2019re seeing a pretty good growth into January, but looking back to last year you had a pretty tough comp in the first quarter and had a very strong quarter despite that. So wondering if there is just anything we should keep in mind as we head into February or March from last year that was particularly strong, or you think it can - the coast is clear through the rest of the first quarter to keep these kind of January growth rates up. Mark Okerstrom : So like the $6 billion represented 46% year-over-year growth. And then we\u2019re not going to disclose the precise percentages. But generally, everything that\u2019s online has the online booking fee or the traveler fee attached to it. So it\u2019s really the question around monetization. It\u2019s not around the traveler fee, but rather whether the supplier or the vacation property owner or property manager is going through - via the subscription model or whether they\u2019re going via a commission model. In terms of comps for Q1 and how to think about it, the big thing I would call out is just the Easter comp, which it moves into Q2 this year. I would just ask you to take a look at our disclosure on the last call when it went the other way, and you\u2019d be able to get a rough idea in terms of what the sizing of that might be? Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Thanks guys. Mark Okerstrom : All right. Next question, please? Operator : Justin Patterson with Raymond James. And, sorry, he is no longer in our queue. We now have Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Co. Kevin Kopelman : Hey, thanks a lot. Just following up on your comment about the subscription model versus the commission model on HomeAway. Where are you there and now you see that trending? And then also on HomeAway ad spend, I think you had planned to grow that 80% in the first-half of 2016. Can you tell us where you ended up on that for 2016 and how you\u2019re thinking about the ad budget in 2017? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : So, Kevin, I think I\u2019m going to pass on both of those questions with apologies. But I\u2019ll give you chance to ask another one. And the reason is that we did want to give you this snapshot of a lot of extra data in my prepared remarks to give you a sort of a jumping-off point to help model. But on a go-forward basis, we continue to want to make sure that the HomeAway team has the latitude to do what\u2019s right for the business and make this transition and not be held to a bunch of metrics that we share with you all. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think the classic media training would tell you to answer the question that you want to answer. So weather here is not very good, Kevin, it\u2019s rainy. Kevin Kopelman : Yes. Okay. Well, no worries on that one, but maybe a different direction then. Orbitz was in kind of a transition year as you made some changes there at the beginning of 2016. Should we think of that as having stabilized and being more in line with your other kind of regional brands in 2017, or what\u2019s the update there? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : So Orbitz, they\u2019re going to continue to have tough comps for - particularly in the first-half of 2017. As a reminder, we essentially took the first-half of 2016 to migrate the vast majority of that business to the Brand Expedia and Egencia platforms. When we did that a number of things happened. One was that we did not build all of the functionality that the Orbitz team had on the Orbitz platform, which was phenomenal functionality, into the Brand Expedia platform. There was pricing matrix and a few other features. We are building that in, but we don\u2019t have it right now. And as a result, our air volume did suffer a bit, and there was growth rates there were a bit depressed. Secondly, for both Orbitz for Business and Orbitz Partner Network, when we made the migrations there were number of partners or clients that either we decided not to migrate, because either they wanted too much customization or they weren\u2019t particularly profitable or they decided not to come with us, so that\u2019s a headwind. And then thirdly, there were some brands such as HotelClub, and some points of sale for other brands such as a number of points of sale for ebookers, where we simply just did not transition them. We essentially shut them down. And so those factors mean that there are top line headwinds for Orbitz until we lap that, those migrations. And that\u2019s, probably, I think about that as a Q3 clean comp. The good news is that underlying all of that, hotel conversion rates looks solid. The teams are working hard to get the air functionality up to parity, and we continue to like the core parts of what we see. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think just adding to that, the technical capabilities of the Orbitz team of the product folks, the engineers, the marketing teams, and the data teams there have been really, really impressive. So one of the adds that, frankly, we weren\u2019t counting on going into the deal was that we are getting some seriously smart people, who now are contributing to the overall ecosystem within the Brand Expedia Group. They are some of our top engineers, and especially as it relates to the air product, Orbitz, because of its historical focus on air, had been doing some things, technical things on the air-side that we are not picking up. And it will certainly help Orbitz air volumes, but it\u2019s going to help all of the air volumes across our various brands. Another area where the Orbitz teams were very, very advanced was on the private label side. The private label capabilities that they had built for some of the partners were substantial and included the capability for our partners to build that functionality that the Brand Expedia platform didn\u2019t have. We\u2019ve essentially taking - we are taking a significant portion of those capabilities, building them on top of the Brand Expedia platform. And these are feature sets and benefits that are going to rollout really later this year. It\u2019s going to take some time. But we\u2019re pretty optimistic about those private label capabilities and ability for us to then go and market a full service travel stack to players on a global basis, whether it\u2019s banks who want to burn points, or whether it\u2019s supply partners who want to sell package product. That is yet to be seen by the public. But when it comes out, it\u2019s going to be a pretty dynamic [ph]. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities. Brad Erickson : Thanks. So I guess with the ramp in sales and marketing spend we are seeing here with these big funnels like trivago, what\u2019s the reasonable timeframe by which those newly acquired customers can start to really affect the EBITDA line as repeat customers? And then given the step-up in the quarter in sales and marketing, what are you finding thus far in terms of repeat rates on that new traffic you\u2019ve acquired relative to your historical averages? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : The trivago and the OTA brands are different animals. trivago is a marketing company, and often you can exactly measure whether or not a customer is a repeat customer or not. You can put cookies on someone\u2019s computer, but sometimes cookies are erased. And consumers now are moving across devices much more significantly now than they ever have. So when we look at trivago business, we look at our business, our marketing efficiency in aggregate on a country-by-country basis. And this team has been doing what they\u2019re doing for 11 years. And on a consistent basis, we see the return on advertising spend on a country-by-country basis improve over a period of time. The team keeps pushing the marketing envelope to see whether or not incremental marketing comes back with incremental revenue to the extent that we observe that it does. They will keep pushing marketing and that results in the revenue growth that you have seen, which is market-leading and truly impressive at the scale that these folks are playing at, and as a formula that really no one else is playing. And you essentially have the global television audience to work with. And at this point at least the global television audience is pretty big and as the Trivago brand improves on a local basis consistently, we see the online marketing return on investment also improve as well. So it first starts with brand, but it certainly has kind of after-effects in the other channels as well. So this is a formula that\u2019s working very well. I wouldn\u2019t put in terms of return customers. But when you look at the return on advertising spend it\u2019s unmistakable that the brand is growing and it is clearly getting lots of loyal customers. We also see it on the other side as far as our being a customer of Trivago, Expedia for example bidding on Trivago. When we bid on a variable channel, we measure what percentage of customers of that variable channel we can turn into, let\u2019s say, Hotels.com repeat customer or an Expedia repeat customer. From that basis, Trivago is actually very difficult, a Trivago customer is very difficult to turn into a Hotels.com or Expedia customer, which is great for Trivago and is great for us as well. So anyway we look at it is this is a brand that\u2019s pretty sticky. And this is a brand that is clearly resonating on a global basis. Mark Okerstrom : And then, Brad, in terms of the spend that we spoke about in Q4 and you saw the acceleration in spend there, I\u2019d say, very consistent with what we\u2019ve seen historically. Again, as conversion rates improve and we\u2019re back to business as usual, we\u2019re seeing very similar dynamics to what we normally see. Brad Erickson : That\u2019s great. Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : All right, next question, please. Operator : Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one bigger picture question for you, Dara. We\u2019ve seen - we continue to see a lot of strategic moves in the sector, lot of people are shoring up the assets, continuing to think about their asset mix on a global basis. Maybe if we can get your updated thoughts on how you think about the asset mix at Expedia, how you see the strategic landscape? And then maybe dovetailing it into a question for Mark of how it fits into the broader capital return strategy for the company? Thanks guys. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. Listen, we\u2019re very happy about our asset mix at this point. We\u2019ve got a Core OTA business that has really first rate brands that are now able to grow on a global basis organically. We have some regional brands that are driving pretty strong profitability, combination of profitability and growth as well. We have Egencia, that\u2019s getting big scale in the corporate sector. And really we don\u2019t see anyone else who is really a scale technology player in the corporate sector. And I think the Egencia team is just that. And I think you\u2019re going to see improved organic growth with that business over the next three to four years. And then we have just two very big growth opportunities ahead of ourselves as it relates to HomeAway and the alternative lodging category in Trivago, which we just spoke about. So we like our portfolio a lot. It\u2019s a combination of kind of highly profitable consistent growth businesses and then very, very big growth businesses if we execute. We will be opportunistic. We\u2019re consistently looking for our opportunity. We will certainly have deals ahead of us. But at this point, the deals are going to be driven more by opportunity rather than necessity. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Eric, as a result of that approach, I would say that on a go-forward basis, our capital allocation strategy is broadly very consistent with what you\u2019ve seen from us over the course of the last five years, which is we will opportunistically do M&A when we see attractive opportunities. But we remain over the long-term net absolute believers in this company. And we have a willingness and a desire to shrink our share count over a long period of time. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi : Welcome. Next question. Operator : Next we have Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Okay. I was going to limit myself to one question. Dara, the\u2026 Dara Khosrowshahi : Mark, [we\u2019ll take] [ph] only one. Mark Mahaney : The publicity over the, whatever, the immigration ban, whatever you want to call it, have you seen that have any impact on travel demand, inbound outbound, into the U.S.? And then Mark, in terms of cash overseas and the ability for like some sort of loosening or repatriation regulations - I\u2019m sorry, taxes related to that cash, could that be material to Expedia in terms of how you think about dividend policy and share repurchases in the future? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Mark, as far as the kind of current events and the volatility there, we have seen an effect on trading on a short-term basis. The weekend of the executive order, certainly we saw a negative effect on trading, election, big events usually have a negative effect on trading. We haven\u2019t observed anything meaningful on a trend basis so far. Fortunately, we were frankly worried about kind of the chaos and all the volatility and uncertainty and effect that it would have on general business trends and especially travel. We haven\u2019t seen any meaningful effect at this point, which is good news. We\u2019ll be watching it closely. Mark Okerstrom : And then, Mark, on cash, so we ended the year with about $1.9 billion of cash. But $1.2 of that was offshore and about just over $800 million of that we would think of it as being, call it, trapped cash. In terms of the impact of a repatriation holiday for us, I think generally we\u2019d look at that as a net positive. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a game-changer for us. However, we\u2019ve been pretty effective at putting that cash to work in the form of acquisitions internationally. And when we look at the opportunities we have ahead of us and sort of the opportunistic M&A that Dara mentioned, it\u2019s more likely that that\u2019s going to be outside of the U.S. than inside of the U.S. So, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be particularly material. But it could be an opportunity. Mark Mahaney : Thank you very much. Mark Okerstrom : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Next we have Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Security. Robert James Coolbrith : Good afternoon. This is Rob on calling for Peter. Two questions. Now as you are couple quarters in, with best match at HomeAway, I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe talk about runway in terms of maybe what inning you\u2019re in, in terms of improving conversion on that basis, what the response has been from consumers as well as the homeowners and managers. And then with respect to your comments, just few questions on Orbitz and the Matrix, just wondering, what kind of headwind was using Matrix to their business. And if you would add that into PFS and bring across the business more generally, what kind of a tailwind or benefit could that be to Expedia\u2019s broader air business going forward? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, Robert. As far as HomeAway goes, we think that there is a significant amount of opportunity ahead of us, both in terms of best match sort, but also in terms of the site design and introducing the same pace of experimentation that we - that you see on Hotels.com or in Expedia. As you know, John Kim who ran product at Brand Expedia is now CEO of HomeAway. So we have a lot of experience there. We have ramped up very significantly our investment in products and technical capabilities there. And so, we think that we\u2019re going to have much, much more experimentation both around sort, but in terms of the design of the site and the many feature sets that we are going to try on a go-forward basis both on desktop and on mobile as well. So I would say that we are in the early innings. We need to drive conversion in order to hit our targets in 2018. And at this point, we believe that we are capable of driving significant conversion increases both in 2017 and in 2018. As it relates to our homeowners, I do think that one of the clear areas of opportunity for us are to communicate more clearly with our homeowners as to why the sort is what it is. And I think that as we have moved from a subscription based sort to a conversion base sort, I think that we can more clearly communicate to our homeowners what that means to them. We are working on radically improving our homeowner tools in general, their dashboards, so that our homeowners can understand what it is that they have to do in order to improve their store position, certainly getting their inventory, instant bookable is going to help, increasing their acceptance rates is going to help, improving their pictures, descriptions et cetera is going to help as well. But we are going to lay it out for them, so that a homeowner who is making $20,000 a year knows exactly what they got to do in order to make $70,000 or $80,000 a year. Those are tools that we\u2019re investing in pretty aggressively as well, and we think there is a significant amount of opportunity there. So we\u2019re certainly going to drive I think a lot more homeowner satisfaction in 2017 than what they saw in 2016. Mark Okerstrom : And then, Peter, on Orbitz, we haven\u2019t broken out the specific impact of the air business. I will tell you though, on a standalone basis looking at Orbitz in 2015 versus 2016, gross bookings in total was down, call it, mid-teens on a year-on-year basis. And I would think about the air impact is being broadly consistent. But within that air impact, it\u2019s not only actually just losing that functionality. It\u2019s losing the clients and customers, and shutting down the points of sale as well. So I do think it is an opportunity for us in terms of when we build that functionality in both at Orbitz and Expedia potentially seeing an uplift. But it\u2019s tough to quantify at this point. Robert James Coolbrith : Great. Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our last and final question comes from Dan Wasiolek with Morningstar. Dan Wasiolek : Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just looking at the Core OTA segment, it looks like the take-rate there, last couple of years it had been kind of in somewhat of a gradual decline. And in the last two quarters, appears to be some stabilization, even some nice tick-up this last quarter. Just wondering how I should think about that take-rate metric going forward, whether or not maybe it\u2019s bottomed or if there\u2019s something to call out there, some type of positive mix-shift, either toward international boutique hotels or hotel mix? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. Well, there is a few things going on there. One is there is some mix shift. And it\u2019s really mix shift from air to hotel. Generally speaking, our hotel business has been and we expect likely to continue to grow a little bit faster than our air business, so that\u2019s a net positive. I would also call out that over the course of the last good three years we\u2019ve been in a process of resetting our hotel commission rates from a sort of higher premium price to a low base rate with then up sell opportunities and good replacement type opportunities. We are in a spot now at the end of 2016 and going into 2017, where that work is largely complete. And you started to see that the impact of that actually show up in our margins in Q3 and Q4. And the other metric where it shows up obviously is revenue per room night, and the gap between that and average daily rate. So in terms of what to expect for 2017, I think we are in a spot where we are in a much more stable environment. And I think there is opportunity absolutely for stability and revenue margins. And when you look at revenue per room night, again this quarter - past quarter it was 110 basis points of gap between revenue per room night in ADR. We, as we look out into 2017, expect it could be a little bit higher than that, as we annualized the margin reductions also from the impact of our rewards, loyalty programs, et cetera, but certainly much, much better than we\u2019ve seen over the course of the last couple of years. Dan Wasiolek : Okay. Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing remarks. Alan Pickerill : Thanks everybody for joining the call today. As usual, there will be a replay available shortly. Dara, any closing thoughts? Dara Khosrowshahi : Just a big thank you to our global employee base for an improved 2016 and certainly an improve end to the year. And hopefully, we will all be alive to see the end of next year. Thank you. Operator : Once again, that does conclude today\u2019s call. We appreciate your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Expedia, Inc.'s financial results conference call for first quarter ended March 31, 2017. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations. The following discussion including responses to your questions reflects management's views as of today, April 27, 2017 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise the information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release. I would like to note that beginning here in Q1 2017, we are including HomeAway on-platform gross bookings and property nights in our operational metrics. We've disclosed the quarterly balances for 2016 via an 8-K filing for comparative purposes. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. With that, let me turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Alan. Expedia is off to a good start this year with first quarter gross bookings up 14%, revenue up 15% and adjusted EBITDA up 18% year-over-year. Stayed room nights grew 12%, negatively impacted by the Easter shift, while booked room nights grew 18% year-over-year. The Core OTA segment continue to gain momentum with the global brands delivering healthy room night growth through solid execution and product, technology, marketing and operations. We continue tuning our regional brand operating formula with an eye towards optimizing profitability and with some trade-offs against top-line growth. Note that the travel markets are quite dynamic, and it's been less than a year since we fully optimized Orbitz, integrated Orbitz into the fold. We're early here in our learnings. Our OTA lodging supply portfolio now stands at about 385,000 properties, up 36% year-over-year. The HomeAway transition continues to go well. We're investing in growing our team of top-tier product and technology talent, and we shifted to a true test and learn culture to drive significant improvements in the overall user, homeowner and property manager experience. We're still relatively early in developing our muscles in the variable marketing channels, but we're beginning to ramp them up in addition to making aggressive investments in offline and online brand marketing to bring more demand to our growing supply base. We now have nearly 1.4 million online bookable listings, representing over 2 million bookable units and an increasing percentage of instantly bookable properties. Egencia delivered impressive adjusted EBITDA of $27 million in Q1, up 76% year-over-year, helped in part by lapping over the Orbitz for Business integration last year. We believe the business has reached an operational and technological inflection point and can now begin to scale at a more aggressive pace around the world. We're ramping up Egencia's sales organization to accelerate organic bookings and revenue growth. While this will be a headwind to near-term margins, as we bring in salespeople and train them up to Egencia standards, we believe we can balance this investment through the natural P&L leverage in the business at its current and go-forward scale. Lastly, trivago continued its very strong pace of growth with standalone revenue growth of 62% and $21 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Growth was strong across all regions with the highest rate of growth in APAC along with solid growth in Europe and North America. The trivago team plans to continue to invest into growth, and we'll share more details on their earnings call in mid-May. We're happy to have begun the year from a position of strength. Our Core OTA and Egencia businesses are posting attractive top line growth rates, investing aggressively in selling and marketing while leveraging their fixed cost base. After that, the impressive growth of HomeAway and trivago and smart capital allocation, and you get an effective formula for long-term value creation. It's early in the year with plenty of competition in the field, but we like where we stand now. Mark? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Dara. With both feet firmly back into business as usual mode, we're happy to have kicked off 2017 with a strong set of results. Total lodging revenue, including both hotel revenue and all of the HomeAway revenue, grew 12% for the first quarter, driven by stayed room night growth at the same rate. Normalized for Easter and last year's leap day, we estimate room night growth would have been approximately 300 basis points higher. Our global brands, Hotels.com, Brand Expedia, EAN and Egencia collectively delivered room night growth of 17%, a growth rate that would have been nicely higher if normalized for Easter. HomeAway revenue grew 30% to $185 million, driven by property night growth and increased revenue per property night. HomeAway property nights grew 39% year-over-year on a booked basis, while HomeAway stayed property night growth of 12% was particularly impacted by seasonality and the Easter shift. Property night revenue has improved as a result of our service fees, partially offset by decreased subscription revenue as we continue to lap over the elimination of tiered subscription sales in July of 2016 and as we transition more of our listings to the paper booking model and to our lower online bookable subscription rates. As expected, HomeAway's EBITDA was down year-over-year as a result of seasonal impacts to revenue coupled with aggressive investments in selling and marketing and technology and content. We currently expect HomeAway's 2017 revenue growth to peak in Q3, a quarter in which HomeAway will deliver the significant majority of its adjusted EBITDA dollar growth. Lastly, as a reminder, we will also start to see somewhat easier expense comps for HomeAway in the back half of the year as we begin to lap the ramp-up of certain selling and marketing and technology and content spend late last year. Advertising and media revenue of $257 million is up 47% year-over-year, a nice acceleration from the 36% growth we saw in Q4. On a standalone basis, trivago revenue grew 62% year-over-year and delivered $21 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, a bit ahead of our expectations. The trivago formula is working, and the team plans to reinvest some of the upside to-date in selling and marketing to drive continued impressive qualified referral growth around the world. trivago continues to nicely outpace other scale customer acquisition channels in travel. Our adjusted expenses trended in the right direction, and we're in line with our target P&L, something we also expect to see for the full year. We're driving leverage on our fixed costs, which allows us to make aggressive investments in selling and marketing. Cost of revenue grew just 3% year-over-year in Q1, leveraging nicely on efficiency in our credit card and fraud costs and our global customer operations platform, partially offset by growth in our cloud spending. While we continue to expect to see leverage in cost of revenue, we are forecasting somewhat higher growth rates for the rest of the year. Direct selling and marketing expenses grew 25% as we continued to push for global growth, primarily led by aggressive spending at trivago and HomeAway, along with continued growth for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com. Indirect selling and marketing, which represents people costs, grew 7% year-over-year. We currently expect total selling and marketing cost to grow faster than revenue for the balance of the year. G&A expenses grew 6% in Q1, leveraging nicely, which we expect to see for the full year as well. Technology and content were just 2% year-over-year as we are lapping over the accelerated pace of hiring and the Orbitz integration-related head count we carried in the first half of 2016. As expected, continued growth of the HomeAway team led to faster technology content expense growth for that business. In total, though we expect technology and content expenses to grow faster next quarter and accelerate further in the back half, on a full year basis, we currently expect to be able to deliver slight leverage on this line item, fully inclusive of the planned cloud spend. On that note, I'm pleased to say that our cloud migration efforts are going well. Total cloud spending for the quarter was $16 million, up from $6 million last year with nearly 60% of that spend in cost of revenue and about 40% of it in technology and content. We remain comfortable with our estimate of total cloud costs of $110 million in 2017 and though difficult to predict with certainty, we expect the full year mix to be roughly even between cost of revenue and technology and content. From a capital deployment standpoint, we have repurchased nearly 450,000 shares so far in 2017 for a total of $54 million. Our longstanding approach to capital deployment has not changed, and we continue to balance share repurchases, our quarterly dividend and opportunistic M&A. Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2017, on a consolidated basis, including the ramp-up in cloud spending, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 15%. Excluding cloud expenses, growth would be 14% to 19%. Separately, we have trimmed our CapEx forecast a bit and now expect CapEx excluding cost related to our headquarters project to be down year-over-year. For the full year, we are expecting depreciation expense to grow in the mid-20% range with the pace of growth decelerating from Q1 through the end of the year. With that, let's turn to questions. Operator : We'll go first to Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Yes. Hi. Thank you very much. Just on \u2013 two quick questions. So first, on HomeAway, Dara, can you talk about the conversion rates on the instantly bookable properties, what kind of trend you have seen to date and what should we expect going forward, given that you are willing to spend so much on the variable channels? And then I have a follow-up. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. In general, we are seeing overall conversion rates at HomeAway continue to increase on a year-on-year basis and continuing to increase at healthy rates. So when you look at the booking trends, which are strong and positive, it's a combination of traffic to HomeAway increasing on a year-on-year basis. It's double digits. We're being hurt by SEO but certainly being helped by other traffic sources, including the investment that we're making in the variable channels. And then the team is optimizing around booking conversion, and booking conversion is up at healthy rates on a year-on-year basis, although we feel that we have a long way to go. In general, the move towards what we're trying to make are two moves. One is from offline to online bookable, and we have over 85% of our properties now online bookable. And then we're also making the transition over from online bookable to instant bookable. That's still earlier and we think that the move to instant booking will continue to be a tailwind as it relates to overall conversion rates. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. And then just sort of drilling a little bit into the \u2013 into your response, so what should we expect about your ability to tweak the best sort for the remain- as we look into the remainder of the year? So I guess, with the ungrandfathering of the subscriptions, you would probably have more flexibility to do that. What would be the cadence of your tweak to the thing? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say the cadence is unpredictable. These are \u2013 we're putting in sort changes on a daily, weekly basis. You are right to conclude that as the paid tier subscription or the higher tier subscriptions roll off, we have greater room for optimization. And we think we're very, very early in the overall optimization. So the sort teams continue to roll out new algorithms and, in general, the algorithms are getting better and better. And this is really before we put machine learning into play as well. These are, call it, more static algorithms that are being optimized, and I think machine learning can take this to a different level. And we're really one year in here. So we got a long, long way to go. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: And Naved, as a reminder, that tiered subscriptions will completely become a non-issue starting in July of this year. So at that point, we've got complete freedom, but as Dara said, there's lots of tests already going on. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much for the question. A couple, if I could. Last quarter, you talked about improving the homeowner dashboard control to help property owners better understand the algorithms. Wondering if any of those improvements have rolled out yet and if so, what the feedback has been. And then secondly, wondering if you could give us any color on Orbitz? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as the owner dashboard, we have \u2013 there's been a significant amount of development going into the owner dashboard. In general, we want to arm up the owners with significantly more data, both in terms of their earning power, in terms of the kinds of folks looking at their properties and really how they can capture more share within our marketplace. I would expect some pretty significant releases over the year. I think we're pretty early. We've introduced some better calendar management, for example. We've optimized the traveler app for the checkout experiences. We've launched House Rules that inform travelers of what's expected of them before they book, but I think these are really the basics, and we're just getting started here. I do think we can do a better job, in general, in explaining to owners what they can and should be doing to improve their sorts. One of the significant factors is content, the quality of content as far as pictures goes, the quality of content as far as what to expect when you get into the home and, obviously, reviews. And I do think that this is an area that when we talk to our owners, we get some feedback that we can be doing better, and the HomeAway team is certainly focused on making sure owners understand exactly why they are getting the demand that they're getting and how they can optimize and improve their demand inside the marketplace. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: And then, Peter, in terms of Orbitz, I'd say generally, we're pretty pleased with the way that the \u2013 what was the old Orbitz and is now part of Expedia, Inc. is performing. In terms of just some specifics on that, from a top-line perspective, the business is still declining and, call it, the mid-teens range. As a reminder, the reason for this is there's a number of formerly Orbitz Partner Network customers that we didn't migrate over, a number of points of sale for e-workers that we didn't migrate over, some Orbitz for Business customers that we didn't migrate over. But if you back out the impact of that, the core of the business looks good. The conversion rates we're seeing on hotel looks solid and of course, the cost synergies that we really brought in to fruition through 2016 are there in full force. So we're happy with what we see. We are still optimizing the Orbitz businesses and getting that right marketing formula in place to optimize for profit margin and of course, profit margin in these businesses looks absolutely excellent. Next question, please? Operator : We'll go next to Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Should we expect HomeAway online gross bookings to follow similar seasonal trends as last year or as you are able to pivot the business to a more transactional model, should we expect a more smooth seasonal pattern? And then additionally for HomeAway, can you provide a breakdown between traveler fee or transactional revenue versus subscription and other? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. I'll answer the first, Jed. We are getting used to HomeAway booking patterns and stay patterns at this point. So we can't answer your question with absolute certainty. It actually looks to us like the seasonal stay patterns are going to become more pronounced. What we're seeing is that the early entrants into the HomeAway marketplace or property managers who might have had more apartments kind of the professionally managed concept apartments. We're seeing the average dollar value per property booking with HomeAway move up, which means that the bigger homes are coming online, and the demand is moving over to the bigger homes. Those larger homes tend to be more seasonal in nature, so we would actually expect to see a higher percentage of dollar stays if for HomeAway concentrated in Q3 than what you saw last year. Mark, you want to answer the HomeAway traveler fee versus transactional revenue? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, sure. Yeah. So we're not going to give the quarterly number but just as a reminder, what we said was that by the end of 2017 here, we'd be at about 25% subscription and no change. We're really on track to turn that way. Operator : We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Deepak on for Ross. Can you talk about the levels of marketing spend that are going into different components between the OTA brands and HomeAway this year? I think HomeAway was expected to ramp. And then given the several quarters we are into the integration, are the practices that are employed typically in Expedia to optimize for conversions currently put into place in HomeAway at this stage? How do you view their efficiency of marketing programs? I have one more follow-up after that. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. I think on the second question, most definitely, the CEO of HomeAway is John Kim, and John was the Head of Product at Expedia. So you can imagine that we have taken a number of Expedia practices and we have combined them with HomeAway practices that come up with, call it, the best-of-breed both in terms of design and in product and in technology as well. So, the HomeAway team is driving a lot more experimentation, significantly more A/B testing and the pace of change and testing on that site now is \u2013 while it's not up to, call it, Expedia or Hotels.com standards, it has significantly accelerated versus where they were a year ago, and I anticipate it's going to significantly accelerate going into next year, which is going to help conversion rates and is also going to help our ability to market into variable channels. We have moved over talent from online marketing from Hotels.com to HomeAway as well. So there's a bunch of talent moving over. The trends in terms of conversion are good. It's translating into higher online marketing numbers, and it's safe to assume that the HomeAway marketing spend on a year-on-year basis, the increase is higher than the year-on-year increases that you see in our Core OTA. Anything to add there, Mark? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I'd say, I'd put some numbers on it. I think our direct sales and marketing for HomeAway up north of 50% in the first quarter. We will start to see those decelerate, though, as we move through the year, because we're going to lap particularly in the back half of the year the aggressive ramp-up in sales and marketing. That's not in a spot where it's totally moving the needle on our overall sales and marketing numbers yet, although it is a factor. And to your other point around where we're putting dollars across the Core OTA brands, we're really putting money in behind Brand Expedia. We're putting it in behind Hotels.com. Egencia is a driver as well, other segment for us. And when you look at the bulk of our direct sales and marketing spend, which is growing 25% in the quarter, I think about the growth rate in sales and marketing in the Core OTA segment as being pretty close to that, because that's really where it's going. It's going to the big global brands. Operator : We'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: There Doug? Operator : Douglas, your line is open. Please check your mute function. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Let's try someone else and maybe Doug will come back. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks guys. As you look at the inventory additions this quarter, can you give us any color of the mix overall, hotels versus non-traditional? I guess what I'm getting at is, are you happy with your overall inventory mix, maybe across geographies? Are you happy with the way you're adding non-traditional and hotels? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say we're happy, but we think we have a long way to go. The inventory now is at about 385,000 hotels. We are early in the integration of the HomeAway inventory into the mainline OTA inventory. So we're just getting started there, and we have a long way to go. And we think that the pace of inventory addition, I think, we've added, it's up about 36% on a year-on-year basis as far as inventory goes. That kind of a pace is going to continue. It's not going to be consistent every single quarter, but that kind of a base is certainly going to continue. The new hotels continue to perform well within our marketplace. They represent an opportunity for us to spend more marketing dollars as well as to increase conversion on a destination basis as well, and it's just part of the formula right now. It's higher conversion, the higher conversion driving more marketing both online and offline. The more marketing allowing us the ability to add more supply into the marketplace and all of that increasing customer loyalty, which is really the formula that we've had for a long time, and you've got to optimize each portion of that formula a little bit in order to improve. And of course, you have to improve more than the overall market because the market is certainly improving as well. So I think we are in the early middle portion of the game, and we're quite optimistic about the opportunities here over the next 3 to 5 years. Operator : We'll go next to Akshay Bhatia with Bank of America. Akshay Bhatia - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for the question. When we look at the Core OTA take rate, looks pretty stable year-over-year. Could you talk about some of the puts and takes, specifically touching on maybe the mix of agency, hotel accelerator, and then maybe some of the negotiations you guys are having with hotel brands? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. So I think the story is similar to what we've seen for a while. I think on the hotel side, there still is a little bit of a headwind on margin, although that's significantly less than what it's been in the past. That's essentially offset by a couple of factors. One is, we do continue to see a mix shift of the business towards hotel, which is generally going faster than our air business. Secondly, we've seen nice results from ancillary revenues and media revenues that are also buttressing those take rates, and all of those sort of net out to something that's relatively stable. And I think we're happy with generally where we are, and we're particularly happy with some of these ancillary revenue streams in the Core OTA business, like insurance, like our activities business that are performing nicely. Akshay Bhatia - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. First off, how should we think about the room night growth trajectory during the summer booking season for both domestic and international, given the deceleration and especially domestic in the reported numbers? And then just generally, how would you characterize the macro backdrop for travel in the U.S., Europe, and APAC? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. So in terms of room night growth, I'd just remind you that the Easter impact was significant here in the first quarter. We were actually quite happy with what we saw in terms of room night growth and generally pointed to stable to faster in the first quarter on the normalized numbers that we look at. A few things to keep in mind, though, as we move into Q2 and Q3, one is, Easter will be a helper for us in Q2 from a reported basis, and then our comps do start to get easier as we move into Q2, and again, the easiest comp is probably into Q3, so a few things to keep in mind on that front. In terms of the macro landscape in Europe and otherwise, I think largely similar. I think the London attack for us, we could certainly see impact to London but it's hard to tease that out completely from Easter. And our expectation, thing would be to get back to business as usual is that's what we've seen generally with other regions. The elections in France didn't cause too much of a stir for us. The macro backdrop in Europe seems to be reasonably healthy. When we look at the U.S., again, similar stories. Things seem to be reasonably healthy. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in travel from the Middle East into the U.S. and a few cross-regional patterns like that, but, net-net, from where we see, looks like a healthy market to us. Operator : We'll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense of strategically how you're thinking about the trade-off between sales and marketing leverage and revenue growth. Obviously, you've got the targets out there for EBITDA, but to the extent that we saw the roughly 344 basis points of deleverage in sales and marketing this year or this quarter, can you give us a sense of what you're trying to get or what you think you'll get out of that kind of spend from a revenue growth perspective and where as a company you're happy with that revenue growth being? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Heath. I guess, just one note for you in terms of sales and marketing leverage this quarter. This is always a tough quarter for us from a sales and marketing deleverage standpoint, and primary reason is that we're spending sales and marketing essentially against bookings, not against stayed revenues so there's a little bit of a mismatch. That's accentuated this quarter by the fact that we had Easter also shift which, of course, is an impact revenue and nothing to sales and marketing. I'd say, generally, our strategy, though, as it relates to sales and marketing, has not changed. I mean, we are really looking to drive bottom-line adjusted EBITDA dollar growth and, to that end, really, we're looking to spend to drive more volume, get new customers into the platform, have them get a great experience and have them come back to us through the direct channels like apps, like e-mail, et cetera, and the formula is working. And so, most of what you see when you see sales and marketing de-levered with us is largely as a result of mix drivers. It's the fact that we're spending more aggressively and the region is getting bigger, Asia Pacific, for example, than we are in the U.S. and, though even Asia \u2013 even though Asia is less efficient from a sales and marketing perspective than the U.S., that's what's driving the mix, and Asia itself is getting more efficient over time. We also see channel shifts in our sales and marketing expense as we drive conversion. It allows us to spend more into variable marketing channels. Again, the direct channels, the chief channels still look very healthy, and they're growing nicely, but essentially we're able to buy more in these variable channels, and that's a factor for us as well. So I think you'll see the same strategy for us. We like to invest aggressively in sales and marketing. We like to fund that with leverage and fixed cost. That's the formula. And I think you'll expect see that for a long time to come. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: And just to push that home, Heath, we are not at all sensitive to overall sales and marketing leverage or deleverage as a percentage of revenue. We're very much sensitive to channel ROI. But really, the two factors that we look at when we're trying to gauge the health of the business is, how fast is our direct channel growing and that growth really is the biggest driver of our profit growth, and that has been healthy and we're happy about the signs there. And then how much money can we put to work in some of these indirect channels, especially outside of the U.S. because that's a key factor as the new customer acquisition and then moving those new customers into loyalty customers, for example, with Hotels.com or getting those new customers to try out packages on Expedia that really is an opportunity to save that you can't find really any place else. And the more new customers we bring in, to some extent, the worse our sales and marketing leverage is going to look just because of the margins in that part of the business, but that usually is not connected to ROI. We're pretty disciplined about our ROI in these channels and, as a result, we're just driving ROI, and the amount we spend in each channel is, to some extent, unbalanced. We'll spend as much as we can at a certain ROI. The more you spend in the channel, the more difficult it is to drive ROIs that are attractive, and those are the two factors that essentially are going after each other. Operator : And we'll go next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one or two. First and foremost, you talked about hotel room nights booked. Great to see that metric grew 18% year-over-year. Is this something we can expect going forward or more like a onetime disclosure, just talking about the booking trends in the quarter? And then, Dara, following up on that last comment, actually around new packages and may be, Mark, to your ancillary revenue comments, there has been talk about the newer format package as more flexible. Can you just help us understand where that is and how sort of meaningful that is in the rollout? And then, lastly, any insight on HomeAway properties on Expedia would be helpful? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Ron, so just on the hotel room nights booked, it's something that we will periodically disclose when we find it to be helpful to understand what's happening in the business. In this case because Easter was just such a big factor, both for the Core OTA business and particularly for HomeAway, we thought it was relevant to point it out. In normal operating circumstances, those numbers actually look relatively close together. But when they're not, we will call it out when it's helpful. On the packages side, I'll start and then Dara definitely jump in. I think we are at a, I'd say, relatively early stage here. The Brand Expedia team particularly is working on some really interesting ways to dramatically improve the shopping experience when you're shopping for travel, we can \u2013 call it, packages but the experience starts to look a lot more just like a multi-item purchase where either during the time of your purchase, you can bundle things together in whatever order you want into almost like a shopping cart experience or increasing what we're seeing as products that we've launched where if you booked a flight, you don't necessarily have to book it at the same time, but you can get a big discount on a hotel or maybe a car rental or an activity. So I think we're relatively early here. The exciting thing is when we look at it, there's really only one player on a global basis that can do these types of things. There are things that, at least our early tests suggest that, consumers really want, and we think that Brand Expedia and the whole Brand Expedia multi-product group including Orbitz and Travelocity and Wotif and CheapTickets and ebookers in that great staple of brands are going to benefit from this for many, many, many years to come. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: The only thing I would add just the key to what Mark said is, with our package path in the past, we would force our users to declare that they're looking for a package upfront, and the fact is that most travelers don't look \u2013 a vast majority of our travelers aren't looking for packages upfront. So the key here in our development is allowing users to attach more and more products to the single product that they came into the shop for, so to speak. We are consistently driving up our attach rates. We think there's a lot of upside there. And as we are able to attach more, that allows us to actually pay more for new customers that we find, especially in variable channels and international points-of-sale as well. So it has a double effect, and that obviously it allows us to monetize users more effectively. It allows us to deliver discounts to those users that they can't find pretty much anywhere else on the web and also the more contact that we have with our users, the better. The more relevant that we are, the better, and it allows us to be more aggressive about marketing in the various channels. So we think it's \u2013 we're in the middle of the game, and we think there's lots of potential left for us in that area. As far as the HomeAway properties on Expedia, we're up to almost 30,000 properties on the platform, still relatively small compared to the overall HomeAway supply base. And one of the factors there is that the Expedia model is based on commission, and the HomeAway model is based on a combination of commission and traveler service fee, and we are going to be looking to build that flexibility into the Expedia platform, which we think is really going to open up the Expedia, Hotels.com channel into the HomeAway supply as well. So that is going to happen throughout the year. I would say that when you look at this year and the development of HomeAway this year, by far, the number one priority for us is pushing HomeAway and developing that trend \u2013 that transition from an advertising platform to a global transactional platform. We think the upside there is absolutely enormous. And, by far, the number one priority is HomeAway on a standalone basis. The HomeAway supply on Expedia, Hotels.com is considerable long-term upside, but it's priority number two at this point. Operator : We'll go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks a lot. I just had a follow-up on HomeAway. When you look at night stayed there at plus 12% in Q1 versus nights booked at plus 39%, it was a pretty dramatic recovery. Could you just go over the top key factors again that you saw over Q4 and Q1 in that business that drove the acceleration? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. Well, Easter was a factor, but by far, the biggest factor is a lengthening in the booking window that we're seeing with HomeAway, and it really goes to, we believe anyways, one of the factors that Dara called out. The early adopters on online bookability were predominantly some of the larger property managers. And as we have rolled out online bookability throughout a broader selection of properties, what we've actually seen is an increase in the value per booking, which suggests to us that there's a mix shift into some of these larger bigger tickets, whole-home unique properties and those types of properties generally need to be booked much further in advance. So we're definitely seeing a lengthening of the booking window. We think that could be a driver. We haven't nailed down all of the specifics of what could be causing it, but that's by far the most obvious one that we can see at this point. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just to follow-up on that, how far along do you think you are in the process of kind of making sure all of the business that you're originating is [] transacted online to the platform? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Well, I'd say we've got a ways to go on that. It's a big opportunity still. We know that there are transactions that are happening off-platform, and the team is really focused on really developing reasons why both on the traveler side and on the property owner side or property manager side, reasons for people to stick with the platform. You've seen it on the consumer side where they've introduced the Book with Confidence Guarantee increasingly. You'll see HomeAway willing to step in front of a traveler, and if they've got a bad experience, help them move to a new property or help solve their problem. They are working on various series of, what I'd call, carrots and sticks on the owner and the supplier side to incent the right behavior and put more bookings on the platform. They're early on that side. They've got a number of supplier-facing data and tools that they're building out dashboarding, et cetera. As Dara mentioned, they're experimenting with sort, and these are the types of factors around on-platform versus off-platform that can start to influence sort order. And there's a number of other, call it, goodies that HomeAway is looking at rolling out across the platform to incent the right behavior. So it's relatively early. It's a really high priority for that team, and we're very optimistic that they're going to be able to increasingly just drive much more on-platform adoption because it's going to be something that both travelers and suppliers want to do. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, I think we're going to make it considerably more attractive, especially for our homeowners and property managers to stay on platform, so there are some pretty exciting products coming out there, so stay tuned. Operator : And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks, guys. This is Jim Shaughnessy stepping in for Mark. Just a quick question on international booking trends. I think on the last call, you mentioned that you expect trends to improve throughout 2017, and it looks like they have. So maybe building off a prior question, why don't you drill down a little bit on which markets you think are performing particularly well and continue in 2017? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, I mean, I think we're seeing a broad pick-up across the region. Brand Expedia, particularly, has seen some nice growth in Europe. They rolled out some new features in the air side of the business that's been driving some really solid results. We've seen strong results in various parts of Asia. Hotels.com is having a blockbuster year so far in South Korea, posting pretty impressive results, and Latin America generally is good. Mexico has been pretty strongly really for across our brands. I'd also say that one of the things to keep in mind when you're looking at international booking trends is that we will start to see some improvement further in the back half of the year as we lap over the ebookers transition, and that's actually a headwind on bookings. And because it was a business that had a fair bit of air in it, it has a disproportionate impact on gross bookings. But I'd say, generally Asia, Latin America and Europe are strengths with the countries I mentioned. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: And Paris is coming back now, is recovering from obviously the negative numbers that we saw last year. So Paris is growing for us, which is great to see. That city certainly needs a business. And London as a destination for us is very, very strong, which we think has to do with the British pound. Once the British pound went down, London as a destination became \u2013 the numbers there were pretty darn attractive, and they continue as we speak. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. I guess you may have answered some portion of the question, but tell us what percent of HomeAway properties or transactions are now capturing the traveler bookings, or do you expect to keep that at 100% of properties or will there always be some subset that don't capture the booking fees? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Well, the general way to think about it is when properties are online bookable, so the 1.4 million properties we have that are online bookable, they are all fee-able and are generally all being applied a traveler fee to it on the HomeAway platform. There will be some that are on the Brand Expedia platform, for example, which currently don't have a fee attached to them. But generally, on HomeAway, everything that's online, think about that as traveler fee-able. There are still some transactions though that are happening offline, which we don't have great visibility into, and that's where you'd call there be leakage, if you will, but that's really isolated to the offline business. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then you talked about buying back 450,000 shares so far this year. Is it your goal to somewhat offset stock comp dilution or is the goal longer-term to actually shrink the share count over time through your buyback activity or do you kind of want to focus on keeping dry powder for acquisitions? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Well, I'd say it's the same strategy as we've always had. If you look back over history, we have shrunk our share count over time, and we're big believers in this business, and I would look at our past behavior as an indication of what we will likely do in the future. But that's not the case always from quarter-to-quarter, and it's not always the case from year-to-year. And we certainly take into account the M&A pipeline and what we're thinking about doing on that side. We look at our dividend, and then share repurchase is something that we do look at. We always have an eye to dilution, but it's not formulaic. It's not the driver and we do think that part of our capital allocation strategy will include share repurchases over the next number of years. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Mark May with Citi. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Hopefully, these weren't taken already. But in terms of Core OTA margins, could you provide any color in terms of how much of the modest decline year-on-year was attributable to investments in, say, new markets, new growth initiatives versus kind of investing and doubling down, if you will, in some of your core markets? And if you could provide, if you haven't already, a progress update in terms of where you are in terms of leveraging the HomeAway inventory across the Expedia brands. And what, if any, impact that that is having either in Q1 or you expect to have this year in terms of room night growth. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Mark, the real driver on margins for the quarter was the shift of Easter to the second quarter. That, I'd call that number one, and no real other significant drivers I'd call out. It's really sort of business as usual for us, and we're happy with the margin profile that we see. And I think in Q2, you'll probably see the offset there of what happened in the first quarter. Dara, you want to talk about HomeAway? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Mark, on the HomeAway inventory, we talked about it some earlier. It's very early. Right now the production of HomeAway inventory on Expedia brands is pretty small. And we would expect to see that increase significantly as the year goes on and especially into next year. The priority for the HomeAway teams at this point is to make sure that the transition to online transactions go smoothly, make sure that the experience, the traveler experience and the homeowner experience is as good as it can be, and that's really what we're focused on at this point. Operator : We'll go next to Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. First on Egencia, Dara, you alluded to the business hitting an inflection point. Could you discuss what changed and just remind us whether the sales force investment was in the initial plan for the year or if it does something you've decided that lean into and invest a bit more in? And then, secondly, on HomeAway, could you walk through just what differences you see between conversion on instantly bookable and online bookable today, and then what levers you have to move back more toward instant bookable over time? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as Egencia hitting an inflection point, Egencia has been \u2013 the team has been hard at work in a number of integrations over the past three years via integration, Orbitz for business integrations, the Orbitz business integration really, really going well. And those integrations always take time, and they take focus, and they cost money. And at the same time, the team has been investing in the core systems of the business to globalize them or to modernize the technology stack, really in the same way that we've been consistently doing with Expedia, Hotels.com, et cetera. Egencia has been a little later in coming just because of all the integrations that the team has been driving, but we feel like we're in a really good spot where the team is starting to deliver just excellent innovation on the product side. The sale, the response to our sales pictures, et cetera, has been very attractive, and we just continue to gain share in the core travel marketplace. We think that we are competing against a set of competitors who has fundamentally not made the shift online, has fundamentally not made the shift to agile technology, and we think this is the time for it to double down. So seeing the very strong results in the first quarter, we were already planning to invest in the Egencia sales team, but the pattern for our company overall Expedia, Inc. is, when we see some strength, we like to lean into that strength. And with Egencia, we're seeing strength, we're leaning into that strength, and it will be safe to assume that the sales plan and the sales hiring plan for Egencia is higher today than where we started a year from and that's a great thing. As far as HomeAway, the differences in conversion, we're not going to disclose specific differences, but it's safe to assume that online bookable properties convert and produce at better rates \u2013 sorry, instant bookable properties produce at stronger rates than simply online bookable properties. Right now, the focus is moving the folks to online bookable, and we will quickly shift to getting as much of them instant bookable as possible. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. Kind of following up on some of the things you suggested. Interested in your thoughts on if you see some major disruptive technology on the horizon and if so, where so and when so? And does it involve AI or what it may involve? And sort of unrelated to that, can you talk about what you're seeing in timeshare business as competitive for HomeAway and for maybe some of the related type of companies? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: I think AI is a good deal down the road. I think, right now, we are more dependent on OI, organic intelligence, here of folks here at the company. I think as far as disruptive technology, I do like to talk about the 3Ms, and it's not disruptive. It's just happening. One is mobile for us. And right now with most brands, over a-third of our transactions are mobile. Over half of our traffic is mobile. And the cool thing about mobile is it's always on, and it gives you location context. The second M for us that's emerging, especially in the APAC markets are messaging. And what messaging does for us is, it allows two-way communication at any time, but it also combines identity with our communication. And once you have identity, you can start communicating with someone on a one-to-one basis. Most of our systems right now are built to serve the average. Basically as a consumer when you come to Expedia, most of our systems are built to serve the average consumer. Now more and more we can optimize to the specific customer. And you combine that with a third M, which is machine learning, it is only possible to optimize to the individual based on very significant amounts of data, very significant amounts of interaction, so that you can start treating every single customer in a different way. You can go back to the olden days, when you're travel agent knew exactly what you wanted. This is going to be disruptive, but it's going to be a slow disruption as we learn more and more about you, as you tell us more and more about you through your behavior and otherwise give us more data, but we think that, that personal one-to-one connection is something that's coming over a period of time. And we think that because we have so many opportunities to interact with a customer we are \u2013 and also because we are investing significantly in technology, in product, in user interaction, I think, that we are one of the best positioned companies in travel to take advantage of it. So call it a slow disruption, but it is absolutely coming. As far as the timeshare business as it relates to HomeAway, I think the timeshare companies and timeshare owners probably are participants in the HomeAway marketplace, but I can't say that it's something that we talk about on a significant basis in the HomeAway haul. So I'm sure they're part of the marketplace, but at this point, it's not a significant portion of our strategy. Operator : We'll go next to Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two please, if I may. Is there any other color you can provide on the overall performance at your OTA brand other than Orbitz? And then also the step-up at inter-company eliminations, does that just have to do with Expedia's brand taking more share on trivago or driving more traffic through trivago relative to other channels? Thanks so much. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. I'll take those, Perry. But just take the second one first. The answer is yes. That is largely due to our brands, so it could be Brand Expedia, Hotels.com taking share in the trivago channel and doing very well there. Super attractive channel right now in the market, generally just because it's growing so quickly and our brands are performing well, and we're very happy with the performance there, so it shows up in that number. In terms of overall performance at the core OTA brands, I think Brand Expedia is doing very well right now. It's great to have that team refocused on the core business and not so focused on integrations. They did a phenomenal job of those integrations. But as we all know, they did take a toll on the results, but that team is right back to business as usual. They're thrilled to be back to business as usual, and they're thrilled with the opportunity ahead of them, and they're going after it, and the results are starting to show up. We're pleased with what we're seeing at Hotels.com as well. That team has been executing very well for a long period of time. They've got a great rewards program, and they continue to press on that. Their international growth, I mentioned South Korea is impressive, and they just continue to execute on their formula around the world. And then I'd also call out our private label business, the Expedia Affiliate Network business, who had a really good year last year and is just on a really solid footing this year, just exceptional results really powering the whole industry, offline travel agencies, corporate travel players, other online travel agencies, airlines, all with our world-class agency and merchant hotel inventory. And I'd just say the team is executing very well there, and we're very excited about what that team can do. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I think in a number of industry forums it's come up recently that paid marketing channels might actually be increasing their importance in terms of the way consumers are finding travel brands, planning their travel, you obviously have a play on that with trivago, but I don't know, if either Dara or Mark, if you would like to talk about the importance of the paid marketing channels, how relative ROIs might be evolving at some of those channels versus what you can do brand building and trying to drive more direct traffic over time and maybe lowering your overall ROI over time. Thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Eric. In general, listen, I think it's accurate to say that the paid channels are growing their audience share in terms of travel spend, and the fastest share growth is coming from the meta channels, and the fastest share grower in the meta channels is trivago. That team is really executing on a world-class basis, and trivago I think as far as audience share as far as the channel goes, probably the fastest-growing scaled channel there is in terms of audience. And that's a great thing. And as it relates to our relationship with these paid channels, I think, in general, the OTAs are consistently investing in conversion, in user experience and in data science that allows us to get call it a higher share of those paid channels than the other players out there. So while from a profitability margin basis, the increase in growth of those paid channels hurts our margin, we talked a little bit about our sales and marketing margin as a percentage of revenue. From a share standpoint, it is unquestionably a positive for us, and it's a bigger positive because trivago is a part of the family. We're very strict on ROIs and in general, ROIs for us look stable, and they look good, and we view the paid channels as very significant means for us to gain share and a significant means for us to go acquire new customers, especially in international markets. And then, if we provide them for \u2013 if we provide those customers a great experience, again and again, we see that a certain percentage of those customers move over to repeat customers and stay with us and come direct. And when you look at the profit dollars that are coming into, call it, the big two OTAs, you can certainly see that the profit dollars and the profit dollar growth there is quite healthy on a global basis. And at this point, I don't see anything that would change that. Operator : And we'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Seth Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for the question. This is Seth on for Lloyd. I was wondering if you could provide any additional color as to how HomeAway contributed to room night growth in the quarter and what the core room night year-over-year was, as it seems to slowed even given the ex-Easter and leap year impact? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. So HomeAway's standalone stayed room night growth was right in line with the rest of the business. So it didn't have an impact. It did help the books room night metric that we gave you. But I think also just keep in mind that the other number we gave is just around the global brands, which grew about 17% year-over-year on a stayed basis. So HomeAway was a factor, but it didn't change the story at all for us. Next question please? Operator : That is all the time we have questions for today. So I'll hand the call back over for Alan Pickerill for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Great job. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We appreciate it. Dara, any closing remarks? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Just thank you to our team on a global basis. We're off to a good start, and let's keep it that way. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to Expedia's Q2 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Expedia, Inc.'s financial results conference call for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. Pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 27, 2017 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release. I'd like to remind you that beginning in Q1 2017, we include HomeAway on-platform gross bookings and property nights in our operational metrics. And such balances have been added to prior year's gross bookings and room nights for clean comparison. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense, and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. With that, let me turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Alan. We're pleased with our second quarter results, which when combined with Q1, stack up to the healthy first half of the year. For Q2, gross bookings grew 12%, revenue grew 18% and adjusted EBITDA grew 19% year-on-year. In total, stayed room nights were up 21% in the second quarter, evidence of a healthy macro environment and solid execution as we work to grow our business around the world. In our Core OTA segment, we continue to see good momentum, evidenced by faster room night growth in every major region. Our global brands continued to grow room nights at a very healthy pace as they made aggressive marketing investments across channels. Execution in variable marketing channels continue to improve, a trend which we also see early in Q3 and which we expect will continue in the back half of the year. Success here will improve new customer acquisition trends, but hurt profit margins as we lean into these channels. On the regional brands side, we're happy to continue to balance healthy adjusted EBITDA margins with a more modest topline growth. The HomeAway transition continues according to plan, with gross bookings up 45% and revenue up 31% year-on-year. We're systematically improving the online booking experience as well as supply-side tools and taking deliberate steps to move more of our bookings on platform. For example, we recently introduced the new closed system for owner and traveler communications and also require that all new and renewing subscription properties be online bookable. These changes represent industry best practices and serve to improve the overall experience and protection of our travelers, homeowners and property managers. We continue to put the vast majority of HomeAway's revenue growth right back into the business with significant investments in product and technology and marketing. In particular, we're making good progress implementing world-class performance marketing capabilities with the right people, process, and technology. Lastly, we're pleased to end the quarter with nearly 1.5 million online bookable listings and over 60,000 HomeAway properties available for booking on 11 Brand Expedia points of sale. Expect the number of integrated properties to continue to grow as we move through the year. We remain confident in a stellar HomeAway team and happy with the business transition as we pursue this enormous long-term opportunity. We're also happy to say that Egencia is now the fourth largest travel management company in the world based on revenue. Gross bookings grew 5%. Revenue grew 8% with the topline negatively impacted by Easter timing as well as the churn of certain Orbitz for Business customers during last year's migration, an impact that should continue to ease as we move through the back half of the year. New customer signings in Q2 were on track and the global sales pipeline looks good. As we mentioned last quarter, Egencia started to ramp up hiring of additional salespeople as we step on the gas to take advantage of a large global opportunity ahead. trivago continued its blistering pace of revenue growth with stand-alone revenue up 64% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was nominal in Q2 as the team continued to invest in selling and marketing around the world to continue to grow their audience and brand. As announced separately by trivago today, we continue to expect revenue growth of around 50% for the full year with slightly improving adjusted EBITDA margins. I'd like to officially welcome the SilverRail team to the Expedia family and spend a minute talking about rail and how it fits into our portfolio. Rail tickets are a high frequency product with growing importance in Europe and Asia and represent another key component of our multiproduct and corporate travel strategy. The Brand Expedia team continues to build out the world's most complete selection of online travel products, giving consumers unparalleled convenience and savings opportunities to the shopping and booking of multiple components of a trip. SilverRail has a great opportunity ahead as a standalone enterprise and has done a terrific job building rail technology and beginning to assemble ticket content. The combination of the SilverRail offering with the rail product rolling out on Brand Expedia as well as Egencia will be quite powerful. This will be a multiyear project, but we're happy to have jumped into great position that we can build on in the coming years. Finally, you'll notice that we announced the $350 million minority investment in Traveloka and deepened our global hotel supply relationship with them. Traveloka is the clear online leader in Indonesia and is expanding aggressively throughout Southeast Asia. We're incredibly excited to continue to expand our presence in Asia and to learn from Ferry and the talented Traveloka team and to unlock a more diverse offering of travel choices for Traveloka and Expedia travelers around the globe. In closing, we're pleased with our results for the first half of the year, and I'd like to thank our employees around the world for all of their contributions to get us here. It's gratifying to be back into our operational rhythm of continuous improvement and execution across the company. The good news is that we believe we can get better, faster, more efficient and more effective in many, many areas. We've got plenty of work ahead of us, but we're up for the challenge. Mark? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Dara. Q2 was a solid quarter and demonstrated continued strength in the business. Total lodging revenue, including both hotel revenue and all of the HomeAway revenue, grew 16% for the second quarter, driven by stayed room night growth of 21%. Room night growth was 19% for the hotel business and 42% for HomeAway. In the hotel business, we saw a 4% reduction in revenue per room night versus flat ADRs for a gap of about 400 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. We are pleased with execution across our lodging business, which translated into strong results, but of course, we did also benefit from the shift of Easter into Q2 this year and easing unit growth comps. HomeAway gross bookings grew 45% while revenue grew 31% to $224 million. Stayed property night growth was a robust 42%. Transactional revenue grew approximately 130% year-over-year, decelerating somewhat from Q1 as we began lapping over last year's launch of the traveler service piece. As expected, subscription revenue was down around 35% year-over-year, as we continue to see the impact of having eliminated the tiered subscription model in July of last year. We also saw an increasing number of subscription listings moving to lower online bookable pricing and also, the transition of properties from subscription to the paper booking model. We expect these general trends to continue in the back half of the year, with HomeAway's revenue growth peaking in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA for HomeAway in Q2 grew slightly and was largely in line with our expectations. Advertising and media revenue of $302 million was up 49% year-over-year. On a standalone basis, trivago revenue grew 64% year-over-year on strong volumes and solid monetization as consumers continue to flock to the platform and as advertisers continue to find trivago a compelling place to acquire highly qualified traffic. For another quarter, the shape of our P&L was in line with our target as we continued to contain our fixed cost while investing aggressively in global selling and marketing. Cost of revenue grew just 6% year-over-year in Q2, leveraging nicely. Note that we are forecasting somewhat higher growth in overall cost of revenue in the back half of the year, due in part to increased cloud spend, but also the lapping of certain efficiencies we gained through the transition of Orbitz to Expedia platforms in the first half of last year. Total selling and marketing expenses grew 27% year-over-year driven by direct expenses, up 30%. We continue to push for global growth, led by aggressive marketing investments in trivago, Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, and HomeAway. As we look forward, we plan to push further on the performance-based channels and to amplify our hotel acquisition efforts by further ramping up our hotel market management sales force, both of which represent a headwind to near-term profitability. We continue to expect total selling and marketing cost to grow faster than revenue for the rest of the year. Technology and content grew 9% year-over-year in Q2. Inclusive of cloud costs, we expect to see slight leverage in this line item for the full year. The growth in the back half of the year, however, is expected to be ahead of revenue growth due in part to cleaner comps on the Orbitz integration, heavier cloud spend and the hiring of additional technology talent. Our cloud migration project continues to go quite well and in line with our expectations. Total cloud spending for the quarter was $21 million, up from $9 million, same period last year, with a roughly 60%-40% split between cost of revenue and technology and content. Cloud spending is expected to ramp significantly in the back half of the year. G&A expenses grew 3% in Q2, leveraging nicely with increased professional fees and other costs largely offset by lapping over the Orbitz and HomeAway integration cost last year. We expect to see good leverage in G&A for the full year. From a capital deployment standpoint, in addition to the SilverRail and Traveloka investments, we've repurchased nearly 1 million shares so far in 2017 for a total of $134 million. Our long-standing approach to capital deployment has not changed, and we continue to balance share repurchases, our quarterly dividend and opportunistic M&A. We are pleased to have again increased our dividend to $0.30 per share to be paid in the third quarter. Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2017, on a consolidated basis, including the ramp-up in cloud spending, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 10% to 15%. Excluding cloud expenses, growth would be 14% to 19%. With that, let's turn to questions. Operator : Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Operator, we are ready for questions. Operator : Okay. I'm sorry, you can't hear me? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Hello, Operator? Operator : I'm sorry. I don't know why you can't hear me. This is the operator. Can you hear me? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Standby, everybody. Operator : Kevin, they can't hear me. This is the operator. This is the operator. Are you able to hear me? I am sorry. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Operator, we cannot hear you. Operator : Okay, I am sorry. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You are on the speaker line. Operator : I have never had this happen, I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? What was going on? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Hello, we can hear you now. Operator : Oh, okay. You can hear me now? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, we can. Operator : Okay, sorry about that. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Okay, great, let's get back to regularly scheduled program. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: We're ready for questions. Operator : I guess everyone can hear me with the speakers. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Operator : Okay. And let's go ahead with our first question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. A couple of questions. First on the business, how is HomeAway conversion performing as you've added more properties and made more properties online bookable? What are you seeing with conversion rates and are you still expecting some pretty good leverage next year? And then on the second question, on the EBITDA guidance, looks like you're keeping a 10% to 15%, but obviously, EBITDA is growing much faster in the first half, which is somewhat unusual. As you accelerate marketing spend, would you expect to see that in any operational metrics, like room nights or bookings or how would we see that flow into the model? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. As far as conversion for HomeAway goes, the conversion rates are very healthy and increasing on a year-on-year basis. There are a number of factors that are benefiting conversion, clearly adding to the breadth and depth of supply and getting more of that supply to the instant bookable is a positive factor on conversion. So that's affecting conversion. Second positive factor for us is sort. And we have some terrific data scientists down at HomeAway who now have more freedom as far as their sort experimentation goes and are now sorting properties who have a higher online booking success rate, for example, whose response to consumers as far as the request-response model, is higher, whose experience reviews are higher, etcetera. So the sort team has many more degrees of freedom to sort the stuff that is able to convert online as well. Third factor is just testing and learning on the site. We are very, very early on the development of the site of the optimization of the consumer experience. We have some terrific UI and product folks. And I think the ideas, while flowing, are just starting to show up on the site. We've consolidated the back end of many of the sites out there of the various brands so that when we drive improvements and experience, they can be propagated through all of our sites on a global basis very, very quickly. And then I think the recent moves to move communications to our internal secure channels, for example, is also going to be a conversion tailwind. So, we see conversion going up and we see that continuing and frankly, we need it to continue. We expect it to continue in order for us to hit our plans, but so far so good. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: And then Justin on guidance, yeah, in fact, we're keeping our guidance where it is and just a couple of things to remind you of. If you look at last year, about two-thirds of our dollar adjusted EBITDA was produced in Q3 and Q4, so there is a lot of the year left to come. And this year particularly, we just have tougher comps as we move through the back half of the year on expenses and that's because right now we are benefiting from lapping over kind of the first half of last year where we were heavied up in association with the integration and as you recall we started to realize the expense synergies through the back part of the year. Quite frankly, we also want to keep the flexibility to make investments. We don't lock and load on our plans at the beginning of the year and stop there. We're making decisions every quarter and when we see the types of returns and progress that we have been seeing with investments and market managers, salesforce, for example, to add hotel properties, that's the type of thing that we want to have the flexibility to do more of in the back part of the year. That's the plan. And we may have it up from there. Selling and marketing is another place where we like to invest in. We have been pretty aggressive in variable marketing channels through the first part of this year. We expect that to continue. Whether we do something incremental in approach to what we've been doing, I wouldn't necessarily say that we haven't made those decisions. So, I would actually expect that in terms of where this shows up in the P&L, although there could be some opportunity in performance marketing for room night growth, really the bulk of the investments are things that are more kind of longer term in nature and things that are unlikely to produce real results within a quarter. It's more likely to be sort of more long-term in nature. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for taking my question. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Welcome. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping you can elaborate on your comments on improved variable marketing execution in the second quarter. And I think you said that you expect that to continue in the back half. And then just following up on Justin's question, how are the conversion rates of HomeAway properties on other Expedia properties trending? I think last quarter, there were 20,000 rooms on Expedia and Hotels.com and now there is 60,000 rooms. What should we read into about the conversion rates given that trend? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as the variable marketing channels, the business itself is pretty basic in that we are getting back into the testing and learning. And I'd say conversion rates are healthy on our various sites. Obviously, they're hurt as more traffic goes mobile. But in general, we're happy with the testing and learning on the sites. Higher conversion means the ability to extend your marketing, especially on the marketing channels. And I would say that we're improving our capability in terms of data science and in terms of just integrating our marketing technologies into our mainline data and site technologies, which is allowing us to reach a greater breadth of variable channels than we have heretofore. The trivago channel, the meta channels in general, are very healthy for us. And search continues to be healthy. So as long as they're healthy, we plan to lean into them because these are spend that certainly come through on a lifetime basis and it's a set of new customers who's going to repeat with us and it's something that makes sense. As far as conversion of HomeAway properties on mainline Expedia, it's very early, right? So, I think you will see the number of HomeAway properties ramp up on the Expedia sites. We've seen some promising early signs, especially as we've gone from kind of the 20,000 to the 60,000. There's still a bunch of testing that we have to do around sort order, around trying to detect signal from the customer as to when is that a particular customer will be more likely to be searching for vacation rentals, et cetera. So lots of testing and learning to do. Good early signs, but off of a very small base and we hope to build that base as the year moves on. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. I kind of want to ask the exact same question that Paul just asked, but maybe slightly differently. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You know what, Mark, I'm going to let Mark answer the question. Since you're going to ask the same question, I'll let Mark answer it. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: I might do that, but just slightly differently. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, there you go. Go ahead, Mark. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great. Okay, then, I'm very intrigued by the bringing over of the HomeAway inventory on to the Expedia site. And so instead of asking what the impact is on HomeAway conversion, I want to ask is what the impact could be on Expedia and Hotels.com core conversion. I would think that this is a big win for you, but I don't know where along the way you have to make the tweaks, the testing and the learning. Is it trying to figure out how the traffic is coming in off of search or other pay channels, or is it that when you're on the site, how you match them up like you could just go through a little bit of a sausage on that like I think it's a great opportunity. But if you could go through it and then just a quick one, any comments on social media particularly Facebook as a marketing channel, all the other channel sound healthy, but you didn't mention that. I think it's always been small for you, is there any reason why it wouldn't be anything more than small for you in the future? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. So on conversion on Brand Expedia, first of all, the HomeAway inventory is only right now on Brand Expedia, and very recently on 11 points of sale. We recently expanded it. We generally agree with you that this is a big opportunity for us. As a general rule, what we find is that when you expand assortment and inventory for specific destination, you just have more likelihood of having something that a customer wants. And that's generally evidenced in conversion. The trick with this type of inventory, though, is that it's different. So when you have travelers that are shopping on a site, you don't know right out of the gate whether they're looking for a four-bedroom home our whether they're looking for a single bed. So now you just have to start to understand the traffic you're bringing in, whether it comes with some sort of purchase intent, how do you match them up with a landing page that may be tailored to that intent to be vacation rentals, you have to start thinking about your sort filters. You have to start thinking about sort order, and there's a lot of different testing you have to do to try to again match the purchase intent with what you show them. It's a science, but there's also some art to it. The great news is, is that we've got a team at Brand Expedia and across our leisure brands. So, this is what they do for a living and this is the machinery. So, we're confident that we're going to get there, but it will take some time. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: And the great news there is also, you've got the HomeAway team, which is continually optimizing their sites and what works, what kind of content users are looking for. So the HomeAway team are kind of our leading commandos and our Expedia team can learn from the commandos and build a very effective product. So, we're pretty optimistic here. Right now, HomeAway on Expedia is in the very, very early innings and we expect more. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Take the Facebook one? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yes. As far as Facebook, spending is continuing to grow off of what is compared to a whole spend, a relatively small base. But the Facebook spending growth is quite healthy. We are testing and learning and working kind of on a engineer-to-engineer basis with the Facebook team, and they continue to improve their product. I think we are looking at the incrementality of a bunch of the retargeting product that they've got. And also looking really aggressively to find intent signal, travel intent and destination intent signal in their huge, huge audience. So we are optimistic the channel keeps growing, and we just want to keep it going. Every day, every week, the focus here isn't on how big the price is, it's just getting on better. It's just our teams are getting better and better and better on the execution front. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thanks Dara. Thanks, Mark. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two. Good result on the room night growth. Obviously, big improvement from what we saw in Q1. Any sense you can give us on the conversion between booked versus stayed room night and how that might arc through the year so investors can sort of better understand what the pace of room night growth might be as we move through the year? And then second question, going back to the loyalty and reward layer inside some of your key properties, anything you could share there about how increased loyalty rewards or duration of being in those programs might change customer lifetime value and how that might be changing over time? Thanks so much, guys. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Eric. So the best way to look at the booked versus stayed gap is if you take a look at the year-to-date stayed room night growth number, it's around 17% for essentially the hotel business, excluding HomeAway. And that compares with last quarter, we disclosed the booked room night growth of 18%. And I'll tell you this quarter was broadly similar. In terms of looking out through the rest of the year, I would just remind you that we pulled back pretty sharply in variable marketing channels in Q2 and in Q3 of last year and then went back in pretty significantly starting in the fourth quarter. So you will start to see some harder comps for us moving into the fourth quarter that will shape up the overall full year number. In terms of loyalty and rewards, first of all, we are a big believer in the loyalty program, particularly the Hotels.com rewards program at \u2013 where you see 10 nights and you get 1 free. We find that on a pre and post basis, when you look at cohorts, customers that sign up for the loyalty program are just more likely to give a bigger share of your wallet, more likely to come back to you via your app or direct channels. And all in, it ends up being a good thing. And then generally the longer people are with the program, the more used they get to it and the more active they become as well. So, generally, it's a net positive. Of course, you've got to be very careful and make sure that you manage the program closely and make sure that you're awarding points appropriately and not essentially rewarding members who aren't loyal to you, for example. But that's something that the Hotels.com team is very good at and continues to get better at over the many years they've been at it. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Next question please. Yeah, you are welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. Question on another follow-up in the room night. I think you said last quarter that the global brands room night was 17%. I don't recall \u2013 I can't remember if that was booked or stayed. What was that this quarter? And, I guess, normalizing that for booked versus stay, what does that trend looks like? And then, I guess, just looking forward, what's the overall strategy in terms of managing some of the non-global brands, the legacy brands, and are those businesses continuing to kind of grow? Are they flattening out? Like any color there will be helpful. Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Ross. I think Dara and I'll tag team on this one, but let me run through some of the numbers first. So, I would say generally the global brands numbers is not something that we're going to disclose always on an ongoing basis. We'll do it when it's helpful to tell the story and otherwise, we'll kind of just do it periodically. I will just give you a little bit more color, though, on just the composition of our room nights because it is a question we get very frequently. Somewhere between 85% and 90%, depending on the quarter, of our room nights are delivered by our global brands, which are Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, EAN, which is our private label business, and Egencia. This quarter, I would think about growth on a stayed basis of kind of in the 20s. And Easter was about a 200 basis points helper for us this quarter across the whole portfolio and I would think the impact on the global brands will be broadly the same. We then go to what we call our regional brands and this is the consumer-facing piece of our recent acquisitions being Wotif, Travelocity, Orbitz, CheapTickets, ebookers, for example, excluding the Orbitz Partner Network business. Think about that is in the kind of high-single digit range of our overall room nights. That business has been flat to slightly up. And then the remainder is largely made up of Hotwire and the legacy Orbitz Partner Network business that we've now integrated with the Brand Expedia business. And as you recall, when we migrated that business over, there was a large number of partners that we just didn't keep with us and these were partners who want a particular customizations, we weren't ready to do, or partners who were empty calories, essentially profitless or loss making room nights. And so that part of the business has been down pretty significantly. Dara, do you want to cover kind of how we're managing this? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, just as far as of the strategy for the non-global brands, in general, these brands are on the Brand Expedia platform and to the extent that our platform improves, especially on the conversion side more than the competitive set, the aggregate competitive set, you're going to have conversion as a tailwind and these brands will get to kind of ride on the conversion tailwind. So our expectation is that over a long period of time, these brands are going to grow. How fast will they grow? As fast as the online travel markets or with the travel market is to be proven. The teams are really starting to get an operational rhythm. There's a group of folks who are coming together kind of under one roof that are working on these brands. And while we won't be as aggressive, especially in the variable channels as we are with some of the global brands, we will look for a higher ROI on the next dollar of marketing spend. These brands do spend significant marketing dollars. We are looking to kind of get there, establish their own personality as far as what the brand means and what it communicates and how they serve their core customer and each of them have their own core customer. And I think that playbook is really just starting to come together. So we're optimistic about the global brands, and we expect high profit margins. We're not going to see the kind of growth that we see in the global brands, but we do expect growth going forward. But, we have to prove that out to you and it's certainly our intention to. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, the only slight thing I'd add there is just to remember the regional focus of these brands, too. That even with excellent execution, they are in regions which are generally much more mature than the overall market and don't have exposure to some of the faster growing markets that the global brands do, and this is namely the U.S. and Australia and New Zealand in the case of Wotif. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. I just have one question. So Traveloka sounds like it provides you with newer opportunities to expand itself in Asia. Are there other markets where you could bolster your existing offering through acquisitions or potentially through organic effort? I think in other words, where else do you think you're maybe under-indexed, you could invest more, if any? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, great question. I think, first of all, we are incredibly excited to have Traveloka as an even closer partner. They've really performed exceptionally well and in a relatively short period of time have established themselves as a real leader in Indonesia, expanding throughout Southeast Asia. So very impressed with them and very impressed with the management team. We're hopeful that we can use some of our global expertise to help them, and we expect to learn a lot from them as well. In terms of opportunities in other markets, I would say that we are under-indexed in almost every single market in the world aside from the United States and Canada. So, we see this as being a huge amount of opportunity. And I think, again, on a business that is, call it, $80 billion of bookings and a market of $1.3 trillion, we've got a ton of runway ahead of us. And I think the opportunities ahead of us are, I'd say largely organic in nature. We've got some pretty amazing global growth brands. We've got the capability to add new hotels at an increasingly fast clip. We've got the technological capability to add new airlines. We've got the marketing capabilities that Dara spoke about how we're getting better and better there. So I think we've got incredible organic runway ahead of us. But as is the case with Traveloka, as is the case with our investment in Despegar, part of this is not only an operational story, but also a capital deployment story and we're going to continue to look for ways to deploy capital in smart ways, either through full acquisitions, as we have certainly done in the past, but also through smart investment in leading players where we think we can potentially help them and where they can potentially help us. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Just the other factor to add here is that we believe that our Expedia Affiliate Network business, this is our private label business that wires up our global inventory to really a global base of affiliate partners out there. This is a team that because of our inventory is able to detect a lot of little local players who are growing up because as these local players grow up, often they start booking big amounts of travel into the US and into Europe. So having the affiliate team out there allows us to detect kind of who the early local players are. The EAN business team gets to work with these local folks, and they're like, wow, these Traveloka folks are really smart and they're growing really, really fast, which then, of course, alerts kind of our strategy, themes, et cetera. So we have a bit of an early warning system, not only in terms of our supply folks who are on the ground, but also in terms of our private label folks who are growing very, very fast and continue to expand the relationship with many, many brands out there around the globe. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You are welcome. Next question. Operator : Our Next question is from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. HomeAway's international booking still appear to be less than 30% of the overall site bookings. Can you discuss some of the different competitive dynamics with HomeAway internationally versus domestically and what procedures can be implemented to accelerate HomeAway's online bookings internationally? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question. In general, what I'd tell you is that, obviously, with BRBO and the HomeAway brand, those two brands are very, very strong domestically and are not as strong internationally. And one of our very significant growth opportunities over the next five years with HomeAway is to extend internationally. As it relates to the order of operations, our focus has been mostly domestic this year. And you can expect our focus to turn from domestic to growing the international markets. We think there's a lot of potential, but there's also a lot of work ahead of us. So this year is about domestic and next year is about global for the HomeAway team. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You are welcome. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies . Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. Maybe on your cloud spend. Mark, you talked about it ramping in the back half of the year. If you had to say what inning you are in terms of the cloud spend and the immigration process, could you give us that? And then are you finding the processes accelerating as you progress? Last question around kind of the cloud stuff is, you mentioned that's 60/40 split, the spend. Does that mix stay consistent as you go through the back half of the year? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, so it is ramping up in the second half. If I was going to give it a baseball analogy, I don't know, second or third inning, I'd say. It's going to be a relatively modern game, though. So we might go the extra innings, we'll see. I'd say that it's not necessarily accelerating. I would say that team is getting better and better and better at not only migrating code into the cloud, but once they get there, optimizing it. And so it's sort of a immigration and optimization progress. We want to get there quickly, but we want to get there smartly. And so the teams going as fast as they can within reason, making sure that again they do it in the most intelligent way. In terms of the mix, I'd say on a full year basis, the mix is more like 50/50. So you'll see probably a shift of more of it into R&D through the back part of the year. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You are welcome. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you guys about the strategy and building out supply. Dara, I think you talked about or maybe it was Mark, about just pushing harder with hotel salespeople in the back part of the year. If you could talk more about that? And how do you try to balance supply growth with your ability to drive consumer demand? And then also, how are you kind of thinking about weighting hotel property growth and then HomeAway on Brand Expedia? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. Sure, absolutely. As far as the \u2013 I'll answer the last question first, weighting HomeAway and Expedia growth. Both of those teams are moving hard on supply, hotel supply and alternative lodging supply, as quickly as they can. So it's not 'or' it's an 'and.' And the teams are moving fast and running. And we absolutely intend to add significant supply, both in alternative lodging and in hotels on a global basis really for the foreseeable future. As far as our supply strategy and build-out, we have consistently seen that as we sign up hotels and we bring them onto the system, we are able to deliver demand to those hotels. And we're very carefully watching the balance of new hotel signings, how quickly we bring them onboard, how quickly we get the first booking, and our kind of penetration or demand into each individual hotel in a particular market, so that if you have a market where you are theoretically acquiring too many hotels, you would slow down because your demand is thinning out. Now in reality, we're not seeing that very often. Most of the time, if not the vast majority of the time, as we add hotels, the system is able to create demand. Every hotel is another auction that we can enter in some of the variable channels. As we add more hotels on a destination basis, usually destination conversion increases. So this machine is working. And as we see it work, we get more confident in our ability to execute against it. And as we get more confident in our ability to execute against it, usually we put more capital behind it. So that is certainly going to be a part of our strategy. How fast we go, depends on how fast we can great demand, and how much throughput the teams have. But so far, they've given us reason to be confident in their ability to execute. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You bet. Next question. Operator : From Peter Stabler and Wells Fargo Securities. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much. One or two on HomeAway. Dara, going back to the international expansion comment, I mean, HomeAway today has a dozen brands. We know that some of them are really small, but it seems to be regionalized. So when you think about expanding HomeAway internationally, what is it, a build or a buy strategy? Did the HomeAway brand become more front and center, or do you look for a continuation of the strategy that it is today where you have an opportunity to pick up stronger, localized brands? And then second quick question, wondering if you can comment on just kind of overall trends in terms of direct traffic. I know you're not going to give absolute numbers, but trends on direct traffic. And is the shift to mobile a drag on direct traffic visits? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as HomeAway international expansion, HomeAway historically have grown significantly through acquisition. And while we do have regional brands, the vast majority of those regional brands are now on the mainline HomeAway platform, and as a result, getting the benefit of all the technology investments that we're making to improve the consumer experience and the supplier experience on the platform itself. While Mark and I are ones never to say no to acquisition, we do believe that the majority of our growth on a go-forward basis, as it relates to HomeAway, is going to be on an organic basis. We just think the service can get so much better. We are already investing in non-U.S. growth in Asia, et cetera, but we just think we can step on the gas over the next couple of years. When going back to Mark's comment about our under-indexing outside the U.S., that is even more true of HomeAway. And we just think that the opportunity in Europe, in Asia, and Latin America is enormous, and we certainly plan to get to it. But we do believe it will be more organic than through acquisition. As far as mobile goes, listen, the trends in direct traffic, I would say, are similar to the trends that you see on desktop, in that mobile web is a very, very fast-growing channel for us as far as new customers go, especially internationally. A lot of those new customers come through paid channels. And then our teams are continually optimizing, moving those customers from mobile web into our various apps. And that's just a continuous optimization and process that goes on. Frankly, I think we can do better there and I think the teams are certainly planning to do better there. Our app direct channel is very healthy. It's one of our fastest-growing channels. So I think that mobile web, it's kind of the same game plan that you see on desktop, which is capturing new customers through variable channels, give them a great experience, and then get them to come direct the second, third, fourth, fifth time. No difference so far. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question. First one, as room night trajectory seems really solid and it seems like you've got plenty of runway in terms of adding new supply across hotel, across vacation rental, wondering how we should be thinking really about the medium-term room night growth profile. Do you think it can kind of sustainably get back to 20% plus type of growth rates over the next couple years? And then second one, if I can, looking at margins, Core OTA margins did expand nicely in the quarter. So as we kind of look to '18, you're expecting to scale revenue and profitability at HomeAway. We kind of have the target P&L from last year's Analyst Day, but what types of things, like cloud investment or other investments or abnormality should we keep in mind as we start to think about the business beyond the next few quarters looking out to 2018, anything you'd call out? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, as far as the room night trajectory, we're not going to characterize a room night trajectory going forward. We'll do our best. We're happy with how the year has progressed, and we hope it gets better. But that's about all we'll say about room night trajectory at this point on a go-forward basis. Mark, do you want to talk about margins? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. So on margins, I think just as a reminder, in the first half of this year, again, we benefit from comps on the margin front. Last year in the first half we were carrying some extra cost essentially. So on a year-on-year basis, they look particularly good. I would just say also that as we've said before, we are absolutely not managing this business to adjusted EBITDA margin. We're managing for adjusted EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow growth. And in many cases, because of the formula we operate on, when we do good things and drive better conversion, it drives higher performance in performance marketing channels, which can drive higher bottom line growth that might actually hurt margins. And we think that's a fine thing to do. I would also just keep in mind, if you're looking at the numbers, including the cloud spend, that's a headwind on margins for us this year. It'll likely be a headwind for us next year as well. And I would encourage you to look at things both ways. On a free cash flow basis, we think cloud is a great thing. And the longer we look at it, the more great it looks. CapEx actually was down year-over-year this quarter on infrastructure. And we're very pleased with what we see. And beyond that, I don't want to give too much guidance on 2018. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Shweta Khajuria - JMP Securities LLC : Hi. This is Shweta for Ron. Just a quick one on hotel negotiations. I believe there are a few upcoming or ongoing negotiations. Could you give us some update on that and how they're going, and how they've changed over the past few years? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not going to characterize specific negotiations one way or the other, other than saying we've \u2013 obviously having the best hotel supply and the greatest breadth and depth of hotel supply is of real interest to us. At the same time, as we add more and more hotels and properties into our marketplace, the import of any single hotel or single brand grows less. So we feel pretty good about our position. And frankly, we feel good about our production for our partners. It continues to grow. We feel good about our share. We're becoming a more important part of our hotel partner's kind of portfolio and business on a global basis. And we will look to balance both margins and growth and supply, and we'll do so on a go-forward basis. Shweta Khajuria - JMP Securities LLC : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You are welcome. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. First, it seems like alternative accommodations are gaining more momentum this year and we're starting to see Google and metasearch businesses approach that opportunity. How are you thinking about customer acquisition in this environment? Are there any differences versus the hotel business? And then, secondly, looking more longer-term, it seems like there's going to be a lot lower cross-listing by property managers across HomeAway and some of the other alternative accommodation services. How are you thinking about adding on other services like attractions or restaurants or activities to really differentiate for more than just supply? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. As far as the customer acquisition of alternative accommodations, listen, I think the formula is no different than the hotel formula or frankly any other travel product formula that we've established. And we've got some experience here. We've got some data here. So I think it's just applying the same formula. In general, searches for alternative accommodations, the number of searches are lower, let's say, for vacation rentals than for hotel terms. So the kind of availability for customers out there to acquire through variable channels is somewhat less. Sometimes consumers don't really know about the category. I think consumers are becoming more aware of the category. But we think that even a consumer who, for example, is looking for a hotel in Orlando and has a family with them will be delighted at the kind of inventory that HomeAway has available, certainly on a price per head basis, have a living room, et cetera. So I think for us, as far as customer acquisition goes, the formula will remain the same. I think what we bring to the pie, which is different, is that we are also able to take customers who are looking for lodging or are looking for hotels and then introduce them to the alternative accommodation segment. And when we look at our Net Promoter Score for HomeAway users and people who experience alternative accommodations is superb. It is over 70. So it's our highest NPS-scoring product. And we will continually kind of test and learn ways of introducing this product to our consumers on a global basis because they are certainly delighted with it and certainly love it. For background, on a direct basis, we are investing very aggressively in sales and marketing at HomeAway. It's up 45% on a year-on-year basis. So we'll continue to be aggressive both on a direct basis and on an indirect basis. As far as long-term goes, adding on other services, attractions, restaurants, et cetera, one of our core strengths is that we are a multi-product. And attractions is a large and growing part of our portfolio. We are building a database of everything travel everywhere. And we are building an engine to be able to combine all of these different products to delight travelers we think, in a way and with capability that others are not. So I can't tell you exactly what the business is going to look like three, four, five years from now, but I do think that the customer interaction points are going to increase, our relevance with our customers is going to increase, and I think we have a competitive advantage there versus the other players in the field. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Mark May from Citi. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. In terms of the comments around HomeAway international expansion, maybe you don't want to make too much of a deal out of this. But was this factored in when you last kind of spoke to and provided the $350 million EBITDA target for next year? Is this kind of a change or a new thinking here? And then in terms of the comments about ramping the hotel acquisition team, wondering if you could talk a little bit more specifically about where you see the opportunities there? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: So, as far as international expansion, listen, the life with the speed of change in this industry, the opportunities available to us have changed very significantly since we first put the $350 million target out there. International expansion was certainly a consideration. But as we look at the business on a holistic basis, a target is a target and the target remains on the table. Mark, do you want to talk about ramping hotel acquisition? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, I think I'll use a similar answer to what I did before in terms of where the opportunity is. I mean, we view the opportunity as really everywhere. We feel good about our supply coverage in the U.S. and Canada. We've got significant opportunity outside of that. You look at Europe specifically, we think we can add multiples of properties from what we've got there right now. As you move further away from Bellevue, Washington, the opportunities only get bigger; Asia, Latin America. So I think at the end of all of this, I think we want to ultimately wire up all of the hotels and alternative accommodations that exist in the world. And there's a long road ahead of us to get there. But really, virtually, every region has opportunity for us, and we'll get there in a metered way, in a way that delivers the best returns for our shareholders. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : From Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, you've been very good at ironing out inefficiencies in the system from cloud and other areas the last year or so. I was wondering, could you just talk to other areas you still see for a potential efficiency improvement in the way you operate just to give you further potential leverage or the ability to invest harder. And then the second one on HomeAway, can you just talk to kind of where you are in the evolution of pushing out HomeAway paid search or potentially more advertising investment further? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. So on efficiencies, we see them across the business. We're very focused on delivering on a financial profile that allows us to essentially contain fixed cost, get good leverage on cost, and basically flow the capital on the P&L to expansion-type investments, whether it's technology, headcounts, sales and marketing headcounts, or to sign up more hotels, or direct sales and marketing. So that's essentially the formula. We continue to see a huge amount of opportunity in our call centers and they have done just an exceptional job over the year of just getting more and more and more efficient, both in terms of handling calls but then also rooting out the ways that or the reasons why people call and trying to solve those problems online. We've become exceptionally good at squeezing out fraud of all types out of the system. And I think we've become best-in-class in that standpoint. We continue to work very hard in our back-office operations. And the way that we collect money and the way that we disburse money, we are collecting and disbursing through the merchant model over $50 billion on an annualized basis. And there's a lot of just automation that we're building into the system that we're going to continue to do, and we'll continue to allow that to scale. I think also just in terms of the other parts of our operation, I think we're getting better and better at automation in general, both in terms of online marketing, some of the decisioning we do around where sales forces spend their time is ultimately done by in many cases algorithms using the latest machine learning capabilities. And I think it's a long road ahead of us and we see lots of opportunities across the business. Do you want to talk about Away paid search? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah, definitely. I would say on Away, listen, we are building up our talent in paid search. Conversion for us is on HomeAway clearly a tailwind for acquisition marketing as it relates to HomeAway. That said, we're in the early innings. I would say that that team has really started to operate in a real way for a couple of quarters. And I think we see a very, very significant upside in paid search even though paid search volumes are increasing on a year-on-year basis. So it is early, and we expect much more potential from that team. I think just to add a little bit to what Mark said as far as efficiencies go. One of the interesting, I would say, new occurrences that we're seeing at the company is that the way that we structure the company as far as the technology platforms are essentially separate. Every brand has its own platform, every brand or backend group has its own CTO. But as we are building out our services based on newer architecture, some of these services become available to other brands to use. So we're actually seeing a lot more activity across brands. So, for example, some of the HomeAway team is using some search technology that's been developed on the Expedia side. And now we're seeing kind of tech teams sharing and consuming micro-services that have actually been built out across the company in other parts of the company, and rather than having to build out these services on kind of within each brand, the brands are sharing. And I think that will, long-term, add to even more, call it, efficiency or more throughput on the technology side, and we're starting to see it happen. We're not forcing it, but I think now the CTOs are kind of building closer relationships. They are happy to take advantage of the labor of the other tech teams. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Kevin Kopelman with Cowen. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks a lot. Could you give us an update on the air business? It's still a big bookings driver. Just what are the kind of the key drivers you're seeing there? The tickets growth was a little bit slower. And what's the outlook in air business? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yeah. So we continue to be happy with the progress on the air business. The air numbers this quarter were impacted by a number of factors that caused us a bit of a slowdown from prior period. Generally these are things that we're not concerned about at all. One of the big factors was Brand Expedia in Europe testing with pricing and various online marketing channels and looking for profit optimization opportunities, so kind of regular course things. But we continue to be big believers in the air business, particularly as it relates to Brand Expedia. It's a key differentiator for us. The teams are getting better and better and better at using the air business as a customer acquisition channel for hotel and for other products. We continue to expand the number of airlines, for example, that we're offering around the world. And we think it's a real key part of the formula. I think the other thing that's interesting that's happening in air is that as the airlines start to actually develop different fare types, as they start to develop different ancillaries, et cetera, it just gives more opportunity for leading tech players like ourselves to merchandise those and actually create win-win situations for both the airlines and ourselves. And we think that's just an absolutely great development. And I think back to the baseball analogy, I think we're in the early innings on that and we think it will be a long fruitful path for us to work really closely with our airline partners to innovate over a long period to come. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Any more questions, operator? Operator : Looks like we have no further questions at this time. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Okay. Operator : So I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for closing remarks. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks so much, Dara, any closing remarks? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Just thank you again to the ever-expanding employee base across the company and another welcome to the SilverRail team and also a welcome of sorts to the Traveloka team to the Expedia family. It's great to have you guys onboard. So thank you very much for joining the Q2 call. And Alan, anything to add? Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: The replay will be up shortly. Thanks, everybody, we'll talk to you next quarter. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Once again, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Expedia Inc. Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Kristy Nicholas (0:18), Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Unverified Participant : Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Inc.'s financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Mark Okerstrom, Expedia's CEO and President, and Alan Pickerill our CFO. The following discussion including responses to your questions reflects management's views as of today, October 26, 2017 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of these statements made on today's call are forward-looking. Typically proceeded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release which is posted on the company's investor relations website at ir.expediainc.com and I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content including today's earnings release. I would like to remind you that beginning in Q1 2017, we include HomeAway on platform gross bookings and property nights in our operation metrics. And such balances have been added to prior year's gross bookings and lodging room nights for clean comparison. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenues, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Kristy. Firstly, thanks to everyone for joining our call today. I'm thrilled to be at the helm of Expedia Inc. and I'm incredibly optimistic about the opportunity ahead. Before launching into a more detailed discussion of our Q3 results, I did want to take a few minutes to share some preliminary thoughts about where we are as a company today and how we plan to evolve to better position ourselves to seize the enormous potential ahead of us. As anyone following the industry knows, the size of our opportunity is huge, with the total travel market representing annual spend of around $1.3 trillion globally. We built this company into one of the largest players, yet we only have mid single digit percentage market share, making our potential runway for growth long and wide. Over the last six years we created exceptional returns for our shareholders while at the same time designing, investing in, and building truly global platforms with the potential to deliver growth and shareholder returns for a long time to come. We built, bought, invested in and integrated some of the best travel brands in the world. We modernized our technology stack giving us the capability to learn fast and improve customer and partner experiences across desktop and mobile at scale. While at the same time delivering significant operational efficiency gains in areas like payments and customer operations. We restructured our hotel margins globally and rolled out an agency hotel product to ensure that neither margin nor model were barriers to any lodging partner joining our platform and giving us great inventory. We retooled our hotel acquisition machine and developed solid scaling ability. And though we still have much to do, we dramatically improved our global performance marketing capabilities. It's been an incredible journey, but we believe the next phase can be equally if not more exciting. We now find ourselves in the enviable position of having all of the essential assets needed to realize our full potential as a company. Looking forward, we are more optimistic than ever that we can gain share and create significant value over the long-term. And while M&A is and will always be in our DNA, when we compare the returns of tomorrow with the returns of yesterday, we expect to disproportionately generate value from solid organic execution. With that backdrop, looking forward from an operational perspective, we will focus on three primary themes, each of which are natural evolutions from where we are today. Firstly, we will refine our ambition of going global to an ambition of becoming locally relevant on a global basis. Going forward, we will not be satisfied with simply expanding our international point of sale presence. Instead, our ambition will to be build market competitive and ideally market-leading offerings in every single market in which we choose. To deliver on this ambition, in our priority markets, we'll make more aggressive supply, content, and translation investments, focus technology and infrastructure initiatives to benefit these markets, and ramp up our marketing spend as we improve the quality of our offering. Though the results of this shift in focus will not accrue over night, our experience tells us that execution on this path is the winning formula. Secondly, we will become much more customer centric. Putting the A back into OTA. Over the last 20 years we've put the power of research and booking into the hands of customers around the world. With the digital age, we made researching and booking travel exponentially better, but we still have a long way to go in truly alleviating customer pain points. The passion of our employees, combined with the power of machine learning and our incredibly rich data sets, make us confident we can do much better on delivering on the agent promise on a go-forward basis. Finally, we will accelerate the pace of execution within our organization, working towards total organizational alignment around focused priorities, clear decision-making, and deliberate execution, rigorously measured, we hold the power to take Expedia from the great company it is today to a different level. In short, we need to focus on what is important, then do it better and faster. With the above operational focus areas, we will be in a better position than ever to drive growth across our business on a go-forward basis. As a leadership team, we are all energized about this next chapter. During my 11 years at Expedia, our employees around the world have proven repeatedly that they are capable of nearly anything. I'm extraordinarily excited to lead them and empower them as we all evolve Expedia towards its full potential. Now let's turn to our Q3 results. Though underlying execution was solid on a number of fronts, our overall results were weaker than expected. Q3 gross bookings grew 11%, revenue grew a healthy 15%, and adjusted EBITDA grew 6% year-over-year. Stayed room night growth was 16% year-over-year, a bit slower than our first half 2017 growth rate of 17%. Our results this quarter were negatively impacted by the record storms that hit the Americas beginning in late August and continued through mid September. Excluding estimated impacts from these natural disasters, adjusted EBITDA would have improved by approximately $15 million to $20 million and our total stayed room nights would have grown largely in line with the first half of 2017. In our core OTA segment, we saw continued good momentum. Our global core OTA brands continued to grow room nights at a healthy pace and collectively delivered room night growth of 18%. For certain of our regional brands being U.S. centric made them particularly susceptible to recent storm impacts. Separately, we're pleased to bring our total available core OTA property counts to more than 500,000, including over 95,000 HomeAway listings available on 28 brand Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity, CheapTickets and ebookers points of sale representing lodging portfolio growth of 57% year-over-year. Despite storm impacts, Egencia grew gross bookings 9% and revenue grew 13%. We're pleased to see real progress on ramping of Egencia's sales force in the quarter and we're even more pleased in Q3 to see them sign a quarterly record of approximately $385 million in new client business. We have high ambitions for Egencia to double last year's gross bookings by 2020, and it's great to see them getting some solid traction towards that goal. Moving on to HomeAway, Q3 marked another solid quarter of execution by the team as they continued to drive their transformation from a subscription business to a true online eCommerce business. For Q3, transactional revenue exceeded 75% of HomeAway's total revenue for the first time ever. Conversion rates at HomeAway continue to steadily climb as they ramp up test and learn velocity on traveler-facing experiences and introduce new features making it easier and more attractive for travelers, property owners, and managers to transact on the HomeAway platform. Given solid progress at HomeAway, we plan to lean even more heavily than anticipated earlier this year into paid marketing channels, a trend we expect to continue through 2018. trivago's revenue growth on a standalone basis decelerated to 22% year-over-year driven by trivago's traffic and marketplace optimization efforts, along with advertisers' ever-changing responses to those efforts leading to less monetization of the marketplace. We do expect marketplace monetization and advertiser behavior to normalize over time. Regardless, trivago will continue to face very difficult revenue comps for the first half of 2018. Despite these current challenges, we know trivago is one of the best-known and best-loved consumer brands in travel, and that trivago remains a very attractive travel advertising platform for OTAs and hotel companies across the globe. As such, we remain convinced that trivago will execute through its current challenges and remain a large and important player in the travel ecosystem for a very long time to come. In closing, though we are not at all satisfied with our Q3 performance, our sights are clearly aimed at the longer-term opportunity ahead. I am extremely optimistic about what we can achieve with our greater focus on becoming locally relevant globally, becoming much more customer centric, and moving much faster as an organization. To that end, going forward, you should expect to see us lean more aggressively than previously contemplated into marketing, technology, and supply investments through the remainder of the year and throughout 2018. In doing so, we expect to create yet another phase of delivering tremendous shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Briefly I'd like to say how honored I am to be in this seat today to have the chance to partner with you, the rest of the leadership team, and Expedia employees globally to continue to build and grow the best and largest travel company in the world. In spite of the headwinds created by the recent natural disasters, lodging revenue including both hotel and total HomeAway revenue increased 15% for the third quarter, driven by stayed room night growth of 16%. In the hotel business, revenue per room night declined 3% while average daily rates grew approximately 2% leading to a gap between these two metrics of approximately 450 basis points. Essentially consistent with last quarter and right in the range of our expectations. HomeAway gross bookings grew 44% while revenue grew 45% to $305 million. Stayed property night growth came in at 36% and would have been higher absent the hurricanes. Third quarter transactional revenue grew by 116% and peaked for the year at $236 million. Subscription revenue declined, decreasing by 37% year-over-year, as HomeAway continued to gain momentum in their eCommerce transition. HomeAway reported the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA in the company's history of $126 million representing 63% growth year-over-year. Advertising and media revenue of $299 million was up 24% year-over-year due to continued growth at trivago and Media Solutions. Performance for trivago came in substantially below our expectations as compared to the second quarter call with adjusted EBITDA for trivago falling to an $8 million loss on 22% revenue growth. As discussed, on trivago's earnings call yesterday, they continue to see negative trends as advertisers adjust to the new normal and test new bidding strategies. In terms of expenses, cost of revenue grew 8% year-over-year, 4% ex-cloud, leveraging quite nicely. Cloud expense in cost of revenue totaled $17 million during the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of revenue to grow slower than revenue including cloud costs. Total selling and marketing expenses grew 21% year-over-year driven by a 22% increase in direct expenses. Despite the headwinds created by the natural disasters, we continued to make aggressive marketing investments across our global brands. Additionally, performance at trivago impacted direct marketing expense growth rates. We continue to optimize our regional brands with a bias toward profit versus top line growth. Technology and content grew 13% year-over-year primarily driven by higher head count along with the addition of SilverRail and included $11 million in cloud expenses. Including cloud expenses, we expect technology and content to grow slightly slower than revenue for the full year. General and Administrative expenses grew by 17%, a bit faster than normal on significantly more difficult comps and higher head count, along with the addition of SilverRail. We continue to expect good leverage on general and administrative expenses for the full year. Our cloud migration project remains on track. We spent a total of $29 million on cloud during the third quarter, compared to $11 million in the prior year period. Year to date, we have spent $66 million across both cost of revenue and technology and content. We now expect to spend around $100 million on cloud this year. Turning to the balance sheet, we opportunistically placed approximately $1 billion in senior notes with a 2028 maturity and a coupon of 3.8% during the quarter. This represents Expedia's largest-ever bond deal and an excellent source of long-term capital at very attractive interest rates. And to confirm, our long-standing leverage targets and approach to capital deployment have not changed. We will continue to balance share repurchases, our quarterly dividend and opportunistic M&A. Additionally, this quarter we were pleased to declare a dividend of $0.30 per share to be paid in the fourth quarter. Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2017. On a consolidated basis, including cloud spending, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range. Our expectations reflect a meaningfully lower EBITDA contribution from trivago in the fourth quarter and include a hangover effect of the natural disasters we discussed today of nearly $10 million. In addition, as Mark noted in his opening comments and as we spoke about in our Q2 call, we continue to lean into performance-based marketing channels and are ramping up investments in our hotel market management sales force, both of which put pressure on our bottom line performance near term, but both of which we believe are the right investments for the long-term. Although we've not yet completed our 2018 planning exercise, we did want to give you some initial thoughts and key factors to consider when looking out into 2018. Firstly, as it relates to our core OTA business, as Mark mentioned, we have gained increased confidence that an accelerated pace of property addition along with related marketing and infrastructure investments in priority markets will produce out-sized returns over the medium term. As a result, we are currently in the process of ramping up the required resources. Additionally, we also expect our cloud expenses to ramp significantly in 2018, all of which we expect to put pressure on 2018 profitability. Secondly, we see great potential at HomeAway, given solid progress we have seen in the transition so far. As such, with our eye to the long-term opportunity, we are inclined to continue to invest in that business. Additionally, HomeAway is undertaking its own cloud migration, which we estimate will result in nearly $30 million of direct cloud expense next year. Given these factors, we now expect HomeAway's 2018 EBITDA to be below the previous target of $350 million. Third, trivago performance is currently challenged. And as a result, our expectations for trivago for 2018 are significantly lower than they otherwise would have been. Finally, as a further framework for understanding how we are approaching 2018, from a financial planning perspective, we have an established track record of appropriately balancing long-term investments while delivering near-term results. Against that backdrop, with very few exceptions, we historically delivered adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 10% to 20%. In years where we believe it appropriate to be more aggressive in our investment efforts, we have generally delivered full-year growth closer to the low end of that range. We look forward to giving you more precise 2018 guidance on our Q4 call. With that, let's turn to questions. Operator : . We will take our first question from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question. A couple if I can. I guess just first on HomeAway, can you kind of give us a sense for whether the fees that we've been seeing on the customer side of late are going to continue at these elevated levels into 2018, or if these are perhaps just tests? And how should we think about, I guess, the mix of subscription, bookings on subscription listings versus paper booking listings that carry a host fee? Is that something you can give us a little bit of color on in terms of the mix and the trends? And then shifting to the core, can you just talk a little bit more about the investment that you're going to make next year aside from obviously the cloud expense and perhaps a little bit slower growth that's leading to that EBITDA in the towards the low end of that 10 to 20% range? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure, Lloyd. Happy to do it. So firstly, on HomeAway, you know, it's hard to say with any precision whether looking forward fees are going to be at the level that they're at right now. The team is really doing a ton of testing. So, you know, you may see something that other consumers don't see. I mean, we will do things where we test things sequentially. So it's hard to get a gauge or give you more guidance than sort of keep your eye on things. In terms of mix between subscription and PPB on the host side of things, you know, I'd say generally the trend has been to shift to more PPB. It's hard to say exactly where it will go. I mean, I think that all of the hosts are trying to figure out what's the optimal break-even point for them. But I think increasingly as HomeAway transitions to, you know, a real marketplace model and starts introducing things like the Accelerator program which like we've got on the hotel side, I think it may be the case that PPB hosts just have a better ability to compete in that marketplace. But time will tell. But the trend is definitely towards more PPB. In terms of the investments in the core besides cloud, you know, really this is all about us be in a position now where we basically stamped out a point of sale presence around the world. Hotels.com I think is now in 75 different countries around the world. You know, brand Expedia has a few to add certainly. But they've got a decent presence. So we sort of planted our flags, if you will, for the most part. And now it's about looking at all of those markets which are large attractive opportunities where we're not number one and figuring out exactly how do we get to number one. And it's not a secret. We know exactly what we need to do. We've got to have great hotel inventory, we've got to have great content, it's got to be translated well. We've got to have landing pages, we've got to have variable marketing campaigns going, we've got to have where we've got a very competitive product, compelling television advertising, for example, to tell the world how great it is. So we know what to do, and we're now in a position where we've got these global platforms in place, and it's about more so going deep as opposed to going wide. It's hard to say right now or give you more color in terms of exactly what the level of investment is, how much we'll return in year. But what I'll tell you is that the investments that we're going to put in through Q4 and into 2008 (sic) [2018] (22:03) will represent a step-up. But the returns from those investments accrue over multiple years, and whether we'll have to do step change after step change, I doubt it. I think it's going to be a step-up in investment that we'll grow from. And the goal here ultimately is to build just much more compelling consumer experiences around the world and more compelling experiences bring better top-line growth, bring better market efficiencies, and ultimately better EBITDA margins over the long-term. And that's the goal here. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : We will go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much for the question. Mark, could you give us a little bit more color around the decision to lean more aggressively into the marketing for both HomeAway and the core OTA products? Is this reacting to the competitive landscape in the performance marketing channels across different regions, or is this more kind of a philosophical shift now that you're in the seat on seizing this opportunity? Thanks. Any color would be appreciated. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. It's not really or in actuality a result of me changing focus or changing the focus of our various businesses. It's a by-product of a lot of the thinking and execution that the teams have been working on. So for HomeAway, for example, they by the end of this year, we'll be in a position where they have a true technology-driven performance, marketing platform in place. And with the increase in online bookable properties, they've got now up to 1.5 million, with 1/3 of those now being instantly bookable with the platform in place. They're just going to be in a better position to actually execute on performance marketing, make sure they've got coverage and actually track the results than they've ever been, and so that will enable them to step it up. I think as it relates to the core OTA business, again, as we ramp up hotel properties, this creates essentially new opportunities for marketing for us. So we'll see associated marketing spend that go along with our ramp-up in property acquisition. And then, I would just say that the team is just continuing to get better and better and better in terms of just approaching performance marketing, really across all of the capabilities, and that gives us confidence to spend more, and hopefully will allow us to spend more ultimately and deliver better returns over the long-term. So it's really execution. It's not a strategic shift, and I'm not changing the way that we'll be doing things on performance marketing. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : We will go next too Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two of them. What was the bookings impact of the natural disasters? I think I saw an EBITDA impact. I wasn't sure if you had highlighted a bookings impact. And then, also, on the increased cloud spend, what does ramping significantly mean? Can you just provide some context around that? Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Paul. This is Alan. Listen, on the bookings side, we didn't quantify it in the prepared remarks. We obviously have looked at it across the entire P&L. I would say the primary factor there on bookings has been a slowdown in domestic room nights booked in the period from about mid-August into a good part of September, and you can see that in our domestic bookings growth in Q3 compared to Q2. So that's the primary impact on gross bookings. On revenue, it's a combination of canceled room nights and then also refunds, where we're refunding more than we normally would in order to accommodate customers, but we haven't quantified the specific amounts. As far as the cloud spend is concerned, I'm not prepared to give you a number today. We are certainly in the process, but I guess what I'd like to do is just kind of be sure that everybody understands how this works. The spend that we're talking about is basically the spend that we pay to a cloud provider for compute power. And so as we move more and more of the products, the technology, the functionality into the cloud computing environment, then the spend ramps up. As we move through 2017, we are putting a fair bit of the compute into the cloud. The biggest component of which happens to be our components of our lodging stack, but by the end of this year, we will still have significant compute to move into the cloud. And so that will happen into 2018, and all of that results in an increase. So we'll have more details on that when we give the guidance, but it is a meaningful increase. I mean, I would say it's \u2013 think of it as being more than 50% increase year-over-year. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yes. And I would just remind you too in addition to moving more compute into the cloud, there is the annualization of the exit rate of compute that's in the cloud as at December. So you're already on a growing base, and then our ambition is to move as much as we can essentially into the cloud. But as a reminder, the real benefit here comes in, yes, there will be some operating savings in terms of decreased power costs that show up in our cost of sale, largely from running our own data centers, but also a significant reduction in CapEx, and you've already seen that. You saw it last quarter. You're seeing it again this quarter. That will be a trend going forward. And, importantly, it's not only just a year-on-year decrease in capital expenditures from what we have had in the past, but remember just given the amount of growth that we've been driving, this is also about, you know, avoiding the future CapEx to just fund that growth that we'd have to spend and then throwing maintenance CapEx on top of that. So we're more convinced than ever that this is an excellent decision from a free cash flow perspective. We're more convinced than ever that this is an excellent decision from a performance standpoint, and we are more convinced than ever that from a velocity of innovation standpoint that this is the right move. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Two questions for me. So first, direct marketing spend de-levered by about 200 basis points, but growth rates also decelerated to 21% this quarter. I know trivago is going through pricing changes, but could you discuss whether you saw changes in efficiencies across any of the marketing channels that might have kind of caused a deceleration in room-nights stayed? And do you think trivago is now at a point where it kind of makes sense from an ROI standpoint to grow spend again? Or do you think there is still adjustments needed? Thanks. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: So, yes. So let me start on that, and then Mark can jump in. I think as far as the overall deleverage on selling and marketing, I think more than anything else, the two primary impacts are the impact of the storms. You have a situation where your revenue is hit both, as I said earlier, from cancellations as well as from refunds, but the marketing spend carries on pretty much. So the marketing spend for the stays during the quarter has been spent prior to and into the quarter, and then there's marketing spend that carries on to try to drive gross bookings going forward. So I think that's an element. I think the second element we talked about is just the fact that we're seeing a disproportionate mix of our volume coming from the higher-cost channels. And so just mathematically in a given quarter, that's going to result in lower net efficiencies. And then the trivago component, I think you're right to point out, and I guess the main factor there is that, as trivago saw changes in their marketplace and a slowdown in their revenue growth, they didn't necessarily pull back their marketing immediately. And so they are also going through the process of determining what their appropriate marketing spend ought to be given kind of, you know, what will become a new normal for them on their growth rates. Mark, do you want to add to that one? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yes. Just a few things on trivago because I know that is a story. So I'll just sort of broaden the conversation a little bit. I think first of all, just from the impact on our results from trivago, in addition to the bottom line result, obviously as that channel has slowed down a little bit, it can have a negative impact on the room-night growth of our business. But elevating back up to trivago just generally, I would just say that we continue to believe that this is just an excellent business. trivago has an incredible consumer following, because it's an incredible consumer product. The management team is excellent. They are terrific operators. They're getting used to being a public company, obviously. But they are just excellent, excellent operators. And the third thing I'd say is that it is a very attractive marketing channel for OTAs and hoteliers, and that has not changed. What has changed is that trivago has made a number of modifications to their marketplace, and including the introduction of the landing-page score and then the normalization of that landing-page score. And advertisers are basically testing into that channel to figure out what the best way to get the best volume at the right efficiencies are from that channel. And I think that's going to take a little bit of time, but as that volatility settles out, and we do believe it's going to settle out, we're not at all questioning whether it's going to be an important channel for our OTA brands. We know it is and will always be, and we're not questioning the importance of trivago in this ecosystem at all. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Mark, just quick follow-up on that. Was there any other channel during the quarter that might have been disproportionately inefficient with respect to marketing efficiencies? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: No, nothing I'd call out. Again, the big movers here are, and there's probably three of them. There is trivago itself not being able to pull back fast enough and deleveraging more than they would like; there is essentially the impact of the storms taking revenue away without taking sales and marketing away; and then there is our core OTA business and HomeAway starting to ramp up in performance marketing channels with some associated revenue hitting in the quarter and some coming in future quarters Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. Thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : We will go next to Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. As you talk about more aggressive advertising for HomeAway in 2018, should we expect next year's online bookings to actually accelerate past this year's seasonal trends than we've seen in bookings over the past two years? And then can you speak to some of the qualitative drivers around HomeAway's room nights growth lagging online bookings? I guess some has to do with the hurricane. And should we expect this gap to close or even reverse as you start to drive more shoulder season and overnight travel? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: I'll take the first one and then I'll turn it over to Alan for the second one. Listen, I think certainly HomeAway's aspiration would be to accelerate online bookings. But remember that the historic portion of HomeAway's bookings that came from performance marketing channels was pretty darn small and actually a lot of it comes direct. You know, a lot of it comes through other branded sources, you know, SEO is a source, and that's been challenged, you know, across the whole industry. So the question is does the performance marketing, does that become big enough to move the overall number up or not. And we don't really know the answer to that. I mean, what we do believe obviously is that the performance marketing based bookings are going to grow very quickly and will probably accelerate. But whether or not that can move the whole number, it's hard to say at this point. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: And, Jed, I would say on your second question, just looking at the room night growth relative to the gross bookings growth, you know, obviously over a period of time, they're going to be the same. And the primary factor in the quarter actually probably has less to do than a significant difference in the rate of room nights booked versus room nights stayed and a bit more to do with their ADRs. Their ADRs are up kind of mid- to high single digits year-over-year as they have been for a while. And that's a combination of mix, it's also impacted by the mix of larger, bigger homes being booked. So I don't think there's a huge story this quarter in terms of their booked volumes versus their stayed volumes. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon. Couple questions. Other than the hurricanes and the increased investment in various areas that you've outlined, would you say there is any weakness in just fundamentals of the travel environment or any market share issues that you're bumping up against? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Well, I'll take that one. You know, I think that certainly the overall macro climate, it's hard to ignore some of this terrorist activity that we've seen in Barcelona, obviously the horrible events we saw in Las Vegas. I mean, there are things going on that are starting to be sort of the new normal. Aside from that, when we look at the macro environment, it still looks reasonably solid, and a lot of the trends that we have seen for some time now look to be continuing. You know, air ticket pricing is down, which is generally good for us. The lodging industry continues to be relatively strong. Haven't seen a big change there. Car rental companies kind of up and down. But, you know, no significant change their aside from the overall macro shift that seems to be hurting their on-airport locations towards, you know, things like Uber, which is obviously a great company. But, you know, aside from that, no major change. I think in terms of share and us specifically, we don't see a big change in what's happening with our overall our global growth brands. They continue to do very well. The things that end up hitting us from quarter to quarter are some of the smaller brands. I think the regional brands we mentioned got disproportionately hit by the hurricanes and other storms. Hotwire has not yet completely found its new footing, so that can be a drag on results. We still have not completely lapped over the shedding of some of the Orbitz Partner Network business that continues to be a drag on the business. So there's little kind of nicks and cuts that hit our results, but no change for the global growth brands. They are collectively doing well and on solid footing. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. And there's lot of interest in the alternative accommodation space from a lot of people. HomeAway appears to be continuing to do pretty well. Do you think that's a function of HomeAway winning the market? Or is it rising-tide-lifts-multiple-ship scenario, or is it some combination of the two? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Well, I think it's a combination of the two. I would disproportionately put attribute winning market to them. If they were sitting still and doing nothing, I could say that they're just getting lifted by the rising tide, but they are just pushing a ton of change. It's remarkable how much change that that team has accomplished in such a short period of time, and they're not even nearly done. So I think that they're winning in the market. Now, whether or not they're winning from a like-for-like competitor, whether they are encouraging more people to travel than would otherwise travel, whether or not they're taking from the traditional lodging market. It's hard to say, but we do believe that they are growing significantly faster than the overall alternative accommodations market. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : And we will go next to Akshay Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thank you. Could you characterize the CapEx savings you expect from cloud migration over time? And can you remind us what sort of the status is of your new headquarters in Seattle and some of the expenses around that? Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Yes. So on the CapEx savings, there's a couple ways to think about that. I mean, we're already seeing it. You can kind of see it \u2013 you can start to see it in our CapEx numbers. If you take a look at what we've spent so far this year that this year includes our spending on new headquarters. So we are in the data center down already, and the year-over-year comparison isn't even entirely fair to us, because the savings is actually kind of what you would have spent relative to what you are spending. So we are already seeing some benefit there. The real benefit, though, is going to come when we get far enough along in the process that we can actually start to shut down parts of our data centers. We're a little ways away from that. We've not made any final decisions there. We need to learn more in terms of how everything is going and how things are working. But at some point, we will be able to reduce the actual data center size, and that will be more meaningful. It will cut CapEx. And also, by the way, eventually we'll cut some OpEx in cost of sales, too. On the new headquarters, things are progressing just from a timing perspective, the vast majority of the work is going to be done in 2018 and 2019. There has been a fair amount of prep work done so far, but there's a lot of additional fitting out of existing buildings and some new structures going up in the next couple of years. We think the whole project, excluding purchase of the land, will be between (42:02) million. By the end of this year we will probably have spent around, call it, $130 million, $140 million. And so the rest of it will be split, call it, roughly evenly between 2018 and 2019. And we expect to be able to move into the building at the end of 2019. Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about hotel acquisitions. I think that's a key strategy for you all. And specifically, Mark, is the team in place and are the processes in place to call it double your hotel count if that's the goal of what the 500,000 as of this quarter? I think earlier you said hotels create more marketing opportunities and therefore growth, and we've talked a lot about the cost side. I want to understand the benefit side and where we are in that process. And then when you think about the step-up in investments going forward between locally relevant, customer care, et cetera, how would you characterize this step-up in investment relative to those in the past? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. Well, the team that is required to deliver on the ultimate acceleration in hotel acquisition in 2018 is not yet completely in place. We are in the process of starting to ramp that up. We have not given a number in terms of where we want to get to. I would just say that if you look at our overall property count now at 500,000 available on the OTA side, we've said 95,000 of those are HomeAway. So call it 400,000 less are actually hotel properties and compare that to the overall number of hotel properties that exists in the world. I mean, our ambitions are ultimately to connect everyone in the world to every place in the world and give them the full selection of places to stay. So over the course of the next five years, that's the direction that we're going to go. We do have, obviously, the processes in place now that we can scale things up. If you look at how many properties we added three years ago, it would have been 25,000 to 30,000. This year we'll add 80,000 or so, or a little bit north. So we just about tripled our capacity over the course of the last three years, and we're expecting to do a step change going forward as well. Yes, there's a cost side of this, but we do this to ultimately to generate revenue, and that comes from two sources. One is we have demand on our websites right now looking for properties that we don't currently have signed up. And so signing up those properties allows us to satisfy that demand. But two, if you take the simplest example of trivago that runs hotel-specific meta-search auctions, we are simply not in the auction for any hotel that we don't have. So it also creates the opportunity to drive new demand. So that's the goal here is ultimately better satisfy existing demand, create the opportunity to drive new demand, and in the process, build ultimately a better product for customers around the world and particularly customers in countries in which we prioritize. In terms of investment level, it's hard to characterize at this point. We don't want to get into providing detailed guidance for 2018, although we did provide actually guidance for 2018 a little bit early. But what I can say is that these are investments that, unlike the technology investments we made in the past that you should start to see some impact at least in terms of room-night growth versus what we would have otherwise delivered in 2018, particularly around the back part. It's going to take us a while to ramp things up, but you should start to see results, and I think you'll be able to see what we're doing based upon our property count, based upon our indirect sales and marketing expense ramp-up, and ultimately, we were successful in the short-term in room-night growth and, in the long-term in better margins. And I think you'll find the investment that we're making is appropriate and will be well returned. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please? Operator : We'll go next to Mark May with Citi. Please go ahead. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I think given that you're deciding to lean in on investing in HomeAway, you've been getting this question a lot, but maybe I'll ask it again. Can you try to give us a sense of what the organic online-plus-offline bookings growth looks like at HomeAway now that you're getting close to over half or the majority of it happening online? I think people are obviously wanting to get a better sense of what the organic bookings growth looks like there. So anything you can add to that would be helpful. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. Well, I think, again, we stopped estimating what the total platform bookings were the day that we closed the deal. So we're not \u2013 it's very difficult for us to get a sense of the booking volume that's happening offline. What we can tell you is that traffic on the platform is growing, that the total listing count is growing. So we believe that the overall booking volume, including online and offline, is growing as well. At what rate, it's hard for us to tell. But we're very focused on, obviously, the online piece. So I think it's that the total bookings growth rate that we've seen online for HomeAway has been pretty consistently in sort of the 35%, 45% year-on-year range. I suspect obviously that that is penetrating into the larger opportunity and the offline piece is growing slower. But I think the whole 14 billion to 16 billion in total platform bookings, which is the number we gave at the time of the deal, is significantly larger now. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Mark, I want to unpack your first priority around local relevance on a global basis, primarily in the context of Asia and China. You made the investment in Traveloka last quarter. Your competitor just made one (49:06). How should we think about your approach in that region? And then secondly with HomeAway, it looks like you're taking a gradual approach to integrating inventory on Expedia sites. Could you talk about the time line to just integrate all of the inventory and how we should think about factors like non-instant booking inventory listing optimization? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. So in Asia Pacific, we've got a multi-pronged strategy there. I think when you think about Expedia, Inc., we are really part portfolio company, part operating company. And the first part of the multi-pronged strategy is about making sure that ultimately if there are attractive assets out there like Traveloka, which has really latched onto something special with what they're building there, that ultimately we can be a part of that. Not only in terms of investing capital, but also partnering with them to provide their non-direct hotel inventory. So that's a piece of it. I think, secondly, is we have a great business with our Expedia affiliate network which is not only powering the likes of Traveloka where we make minority investments but is also out there powering every other online travel agency that exists in China to the extent possible. Corporate travel players, offline travel agencies, all of which are pretty significant in Asia; airlines, for example. So even where we don't have necessarily a consumer-facing presence, making sure that we tap into demand from all of those regions, including China, which you mentioned, and driving that demand into our inventory base both in Asia Pacific but then also outside of Asia Pacific. And then separately, brand Expedia and Hotels.com are building real meaningful presences in Asia. Brand Expedia, for example, very strong in places like Hong Kong, building strong presence in Taiwan, starting to grow significantly in South Korea. Hotels.com very strong in South Korea. Brand Expedia very strong in Japan. So we should have got this combination of investing combined with our affiliate business combined with our global brands, and that's not even to talk about Egencia which is building up a big presence there to serve their corporate clients. So it is really multifaceted. Asia Pacific is quickly growing to be the largest travel market. Obviously with emerging markets there starting to actually become meaningful for pushing more people into the middle class, the fact that mobile is allowing people to leapfrog the desktop and bringing people more online, we're very excited about Asia and we are in Asia in many different ways, and we're in it very seriously. And I think if you look over a five-year basis, there will be many countries in Asia where at the end of five years, we are truly locally relevant in terms of having number one positions in those markets. In terms of integrating the inventory from HomeAway onto the Expedia, Inc. sites, I think the first pot of inventory to go after there is the 500,000 some-odd instantly bookable listings. We've got 95,000 of them now integrated into our core lodging stack. And really the goal right now is to get ourselves in a position where we have real property density across a number of popular destinations and we've got enough demand, which we now are up to 28 different points of sale, that we can really start to get the statistical significance on tests that we're running around how do you best present this inventory to ultimately deliver the most bookings by essentially matching that inventory with the demand or the customers who are actually looking for it. So that's what it's about. I think we will ramp it up even further here in the fourth quarter and into 2018. And our hope is that we do get better and better at matching the right customer to the right property. Our expectation is that we will. We do not have yet firm plans on integrating all of the other inventory yet, although it is, which is not instantly bookable, but is absolutely on our radar, and that is something that could come later on in 2018, but we have no definitive plans at this point. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : We'll go next to Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Firstly, Mark and Alan, congratulations on the new roles. Apologies if this question was... Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Thank you, Perry. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. Apologies if this question was asked already. Mark, at the Skift Forum in September, you said that HomeAway's next priority will be to push into international markets and major metros. Can you comment on the timing and likely level of investment required to go after these markets? And is there a chance this keeps HomeAway's marketing at elevated levels and possibly restricts margin expansion for several years? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. Well, I think the broader point there is that it is really something that we highlighted at the time of the acquisition, which is Phase 1 of this is just taking the volume of activity that they've got right now and they had at the end of 2015 when we closed the deal that was predominantly U.S. and Western European and predominantly in secondary and tertiary resort and ski destinations and moving that stuff online, and they are still in the process of doing exactly that. Phase 2/2a is then expanding their international presence, and Europe is an area where they are setting themselves up for success. It's part organizational, getting themselves into a real pan-European global organization, part of it is platform consolidation and getting everything on the same global platform, and they're making good progress there. It's hard for me to give you a timing on whether or not that is going to be a meaningful \u2013 when that will be a meaningful push for them. I think it'll be a little bit more gradual here through 2018, at least from what we see now. And then, the urban opportunity is something that is \u2013 which we called out as kind of the Phase 2, and maybe now I'll call it the Phase 2b. One of the big catalysts there is getting the HomeAway instantly-bookable inventory onto our core OTA sites. Those core OTA sites, brand Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity, ebookers, Hotels.com, just to name a few, have real meaningful volume into major metropolitan centers, where there is a significant amount of urban inventory. So step one is to get what they've got in the resort and ski destinations, predominantly onto those sites, start actually getting things optimized and working, and then of course once we get those muscles working, moving that more into some urban accommodations. But it's not priority number one right now. It is something that maybe we'll get to towards the end of 2018, but it's not priority number one. Priority number one is get what you got online and monetize it better, and we think they're making great traction on that front. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. So I wanted to ask a follow-up on core OTA marketing. Can you talk about how you're approaching return on ad spend, including what you see as acceptable returns? And also how do you attribute revenue to your ad channels given the complexity of multi-session and multi-device shopping and repeat customer behavior? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. So return on ad spend, I'd say no major change to how we've been looking at it. Factor number one is how much money am I going to make on this first transaction from this traffic that I'm buying. And consideration number two is how likely is it that this customer that I am introducing to my product is going to repeat with me. And as a general rule, the traffic that you would get in traditional paid search, think about it as the New York hotels' Blue Link that generally has a higher repeat propensity for our brand than something like a TripAdvisor meta search link, for example. So because of that, the return factor for meta search would be a little bit smaller than it would be for the traditional SEM. So that's essentially how we approach it. Again, I'd say no major change to our overall approach. In terms of how we attribute revenue to the ad channels and how do we attribute to the specific keywords, how do we attribute to all of the keywords they touch, I mean, this is a data science gold mine which we have a ton of people constantly working on answering this exact question. And I'm just not going to get into the details of that right now. It's something that's, I'd say, proprietary, but it is something we spend a lot of time on, and of course the most important thing is trying to get as close as you can to spending as much as you can or allocating as much as you can to the channel and to the keyword or whatever it is that actually drove the booking. And that's the goal of those teams. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : We'll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing on the hotel direct side of things. Obviously, Hilton on their earnings call earlier today had very positive things to say about their efforts in these areas. And to the extent that you are seeing a higher cost of customer acquisition or higher marketing costs or, put another way, sort of conversion headwinds on the marketing dollars that are being spent, is there any sense that the success that some of these hotels seem to be having with these direct programs is contributing to that? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Well, I think the short answer is no. We don't think it's impacting our business at all. We have seen no direct impact on our marketing efficiencies from anything they've been doing. We've seen no real impact on our conversion rates, our marketplace from the discounting they've been doing. So we're just not seeing it. I think as it relates to their overall push direct, listen, it makes a ton of sense to me. We do the exact same thing, which is bring customers onto our platforms, try to give them amazing experiences, and try to have them come back to us directly. So we think it makes strategic sense. Now what I would say is that the real way that, at least we think from our humble perspective, that hotels should be thinking about this is that the best way to get customers that are on our channel that are, by the way, brand agnostic. Less than half a percent of Hotels.com shoppers are looking for the largest hotel chain out there. They really are brand agnostic. And in the last 18 months with the all of the discounting activity that's been going on and seeing what that's done to the search results of these hotels, that's only been proven out even more that this is a competitive marketplace amongst hotels on our channel and that ultimately this is the basis of competition. So the question is well, how do they compete in that world. Well, the best way to compete in that world is the way that we compete, again, for our repeat customers is give them an amazing experience. And it's not through a television advertisement. It's not through rewards points. It's not through a discount. It's actually through giving them an amazing experience on property. And if they do that, they're going to build great loyal customers, customers that hopefully will come back to them again and again. But even if they don't come back to them again and again, customers that ultimately choose that hotel the next time they're shopping on Expedia or Hotels.com, and that's where I hope we can shift the dialogue. But I think they're booked direct. Overall, that intent, I think it makes a lot of sense. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Just a clarification on the shift to cloud away from your own proprietary infrastructure. What's the duration that you're putting behind this? I know there's associated costs that are ramping, but when you look at the completion, is this two to three years out? How do you think about the end goal of when you'll be pure cloud? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Yes. Well, so it remains to be seen if we'll be pure cloud. I think there's a chance that we may require some of our own data center capacity indefinitely. But in the spirit of your question, at the point at which we think we'll be vast majority cloud, I would say it's a two to three-year effort. Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Wasiolek with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi, guys. As you look to expand and accelerate your international offering, just wondering if maybe you can give any commentary on how that would potentially impact the international take rate if at all? Just any kind of view on that as we look out into 2018? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Sure. I mean, it obviously depends on how you're looking at take rate. We don't anticipate a significant change to our overall hotel margin mix as a result of this. There could be slight as we go into some markets with that lower structural margins, but there's nothing right now that says that's going to be a dramatic impact on our business. I think that if you look at take rate from the purely financial standpoint and look at international gross bookings versus international revenue, I think as we go more international, I think the first step is to actually ramp up our hotel acquisition efforts and get more hotel inventory. And that could drive more mix into hotel, which could be a positive for overall take rate defined by that sense. Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Please go ahead. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. Could you talk about Egencia? Particularly I'm interested in how much of the growth is market share and how much, if any, of the growth is improved corporate travel and maybe could also break that out geographically, U.S. and international? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Glad you asked about Egencia because we're pretty excited about it. I'd say that it is all growth in market share. Egencia has been consistently growing at two to three times faster than the overall market. The overall corporate travel spend environment has been actually pretty consistent over time. You're talking about flat to up slightly, low single digits (01:05:48). Not a significant change in the overall dynamic by region obviously in the emerging markets where overall business activity is growing quicker. You see quicker growth in corporate travel spend. But not a significant driver. So it is really all about growth in market share, and of course Egencia is taking essentially consumer experiences built by the best in class in consumer-facing online travel agencies and putting them in the hands of corporate travelers. And that just resonates with people. So their offering is resonating really well with the corporate travel market, and we are investing aggressively behind that. We mentioned we ramped up their sales force. That continues to go well. They had a record new client signing in Q3, which we're really excited about. And I think that we are I think very early in the stages of what Egencia can become. I think it's going to be a big part of this business, and I think five years from now, that will be all too clear. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : So is it picking up share from OTA or creating OTA customers? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Well, I think it's more likely taking it from traditional travel management companies or taking companies that used to work with traditional offline travel agents, some of the smaller ones, and moving them online. I don't think there's a lot of share coming from OTAs at all. In fact, I think there are some OTAs including Hotels.com and some of their other competitors that have a pretty significant part of their business that actually comes from business travelers. They're just not in a managed sense. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question. Operator : We'll go next to Naved Khan with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Thank you. I just had a question on the international room night growth, 22% this quarter versus 26% in the prior quarter. Was most of the slowdown because of the change at trivago, or was there anything else driving it? Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.: Yes, I think the majority of it is Easter. I do think there's a possible element that's associated with trivago's changes. But those would be the two primary factors. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then just quickly, following up on this trivago change, are you able to redeploy those dollars into the channels or how does it work when you look at the spending? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Well, essentially we're always optimizing our marketing spend within channels and across channels. I'd say that within each channel, we've essentially got efficiency and growth targets, and so whether or not actually a change in trivago results in a change in another channel, I couldn't be too specific with you on that. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.: Great. Well, I'd just like to reiterate I'm thrilled to be at the helm of this great company. I want to thank all of our amazing Expedians for yet another quarter of great work. And boy, we're really excited about the next chapter and we look forward to delivering it with all of you. Thanks to all of our investors, and we look forward to talking to you at conferences across the quarter and of course on our next Q4 call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect at this time.",

Morgan Securities Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Expedia, Inc. Q4 2017 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Kristy Nicholas, Acting Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kristy Nicholas : Thanks, Greg. Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia, Inc.'s financial results conference call for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Mark Okerstrom, Expedia's CEO and President; and Alan Pickerill, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, February 8, 2018, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements we made on today's call are forward looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediainc.com, and I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content, including today's earnings release and our latest investor deck. I would like to remind you that beginning in Q1 '17, we include HomeAway on-platform gross bookings and property nights in our operational metrics, and such balances have been added to prior year's gross bookings and lodging room nights for clean comparison. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Finally, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable efforts. These items include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange, returns on investment spending, acquisition-related or restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, dependent on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Kristy. 2017 was a year of change for Expedia across many dimensions. And though the year did not end up as we planned from our financial perspective, we hit some impressive milestones and made huge progress in a number of areas. Importantly, we spent the last quarter aligning the organization strategically and operationally to execute on our ambitious plans. And we are now firmly in execution mode. We know the work we are doing as a group will set us up on a path to deliver to our full potential in this massive industry of ours. Before providing more details about our strategic themes for 2018, I wanted to cover some of the highlights from Q4. Our global growth brands : Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, Egencia and Expedia Affiliate Network continue to grow stayed room nights at a healthy pace, turning in 70% growth this quarter on a combined basis. HomeAway grew room nights 30%. Strong growth at these brands was offset slightly by our regional brands optimized for profitability, leading to overall lodging room night growth of solid 15%. Our booked room night growth in Q4 was a bit faster than stayed and accelerated from Q3 rates. Though it's early, I would add that we are encouraged by the top-line trends that we are seeing so far this quarter. Egencia grew gross bookings 15% and revenue 18% for the quarter. After signing a quarterly record in new client business during Q3, Egencia immediately broke that record by signing approximately $405 million of new business during the fourth quarter bringing its total signings to approximately $1.4 billion for 2017. Clearly, our investments to ramp up the Egencia sales machine are starting to bear fruit. In 2017, HomeAway advanced on its transition to an e-commerce business, with on-platform gross bookings hitting $8.7 billion for the year, up 46%. Adjusted EBITDA of $202 million compares quite favorably to the $125 million of adjusted EBITDA back in 2015, the year of our acquisition. HomeAway continues to deliver solid financial performance, while investing heavily back into building the business for the long-term. trivago grew revenue on a standalone basis 18% for the quarter, although foreign exchange drove roughly half of that growth. We continue to believe that trivago offers a strong value proposition to both customers and advertisers, and that the business will continue to grow over the long term. Note however, trivago does face extremely tough revenue and profitability comps through the first half of 2018. Before I turn it over to Alan, I want to spend a bit of time discussing a few of our key strategic themes for 2018, each of which I highlighted last quarter. We're going to accelerate growth by being locally relevant on a global basis. We'll be more customer-centric putting the A back into OTA. And we will speed up the pace of execution and innovation across our group. On becoming locally relevant on a global basis, we identified a number of high priority markets for our initial efforts. In these markets, we're already hard at work, dramatically increasing our hotel supply to ensure that no matter where a customer wants to go, we have the perfect place for them to stay. In our high priority markets, we're also making more aggressive content and localization investments, focusing product technology and infrastructure initiatives to benefit these markets and bolstering our marketing efforts, as we improve the breadth and quality of our offering. I'm happy to report that we have hired about 95% of the sales-force required for our aggressive property acquisition push in these markets. And we expect to complete the onboarding of these team members in short order. All told, in 2018 we plan to directly add nearly 2 times the number of properties to our core OTA platform this year versus what we achieved in 2017. Home Away additions to the platform will be on top of that number. Over the years, we have observed strong network effects develop, where we can intelligently match deep supply coverage, broad marketing and brand awareness with great localized user experiences. We aim to replicate those powerful effects around the world, and in doing so, drive greater growth and share gains for many years to come. Second, on becoming more customer-centric or putting the A back into OTA, one of our key goals in 2018 is to put ourselves in our customer shoes. We want to go beyond, just making it easier for customers to shop and book on our sites. Our objective is to provide customers with increased confidence that if things go wrong on the trip, which does happen in this messy travel industry of ours, or plans change, we will do what we can to help. We'll also look to wow our customers with exciting new products and features such as our new shopping cart experience on Brand Expedia, which is live and being tested against a portion of U.S. traffic right now. We'll also push for greater customer personalization and increased innovation in voice and chat. Finally, we will continue to accelerate the pace of execution and innovation across our organization. We have revamped our goal setting and prioritization processes for strong cross-organizational alignment and simplification. We're already seeing this translate into faster more effective and more efficient execution throughout the organization. On the pace of innovation front, our cloud migration is unlocking a new level of velocity. For example, on our new cloud-based applications, we are deploying new code more than 2,000 times per day, a stark contrast to the daily or weekly release cycles of yesteryear. As we've migrated greater portion of our mission-critical compute into the cloud environment through 2018, we expect to continue unlocking opportunities to move faster. To be clear, our strategies themes are squarely aimed at the massive global opportunity ahead of us. Travel is a $1.6 trillion industry. And we operate the largest multiproduct two-sided platform in the world. Our role is clear, and our potential is enormous. We are the only truly globally travel platform that can orchestrate the movement of any person from any place, to any place by almost any means and offer them access to their ideal experiences throughout the journey. That's an awesome responsibility, and an incredible opportunity, and we are only at the early stages of what we can become. With that, I'll turn it over Alan. Alan Pickerill : Thanks, Mark. For the fourth quarter gross bookings growth accelerated to 14% driven by booked lodging room night growth, while revenue growth decelerated to a 11%, partially due to HomeAway's further transition from a subscription to a transaction-based model. Adjusted EBITDA declined 9%, as we began ramping up key investments, while putting a drag on fourth quarter profitability. It helped us gain a head-start on 2018. These investments included hiring for our lodging supply and content teams and migrating more of our compute to the cloud. Lodging revenue including both hotel and HomeAway grew 11% for the fourth quarter, driven by stayed room night growth of 15%. In the hotel business, revenue per room night declined 3%, while average daily rates grew 2%, a gap which was slightly larger than last quarter given a harder comparison versus Q4 of last year. We do expect this gap to narrow throughout 2018, driven by increasingly stable margins. HomeAway gross bookings grew 47%, while revenue grew 16%. The sequential deceleration in revenue growth primarily reflects HomeAway's hyper seasonal trends, difficult comps and ongoing impacts of their transition to a transaction based business. Fourth quarter transactional revenue grew 71% to $130 million, while subscription revenue declined 33% and ended the year at 27% of revenue in line with our expectations. HomeAway adjusted EBITDA decreased 28% to $31 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the confluence of revenue deceleration and increased investments in the business. Advertising and media revenue of $214 million increased 13% for the quarter due to continued growth at Expedia Media Solutions and trivago. Note that in 2017, we eclipsed $1 billion in total advertising and media revenue. Air revenue was essentially flat in the fourth quarter on a 3% increase in air tickets sold offset by a 3% decrease in revenue per ticket. All other revenue increased 14% in the fourth quarter reflecting growth in travel insurance and car rental products. For the full year our expense growth was largely in line with our target P&L with cost of revenue leveraging nicely at 8%, and each of our technology and content, and general and administrative expenses growing 10% for the full year compared to revenue growth of 15%. Selling and marketing grew faster than revenue at 22% as we mixed into some higher cost channels and sought to drive global growth. For the quarter, however, each of our expense categories grew faster than revenue. On cost of revenue, we spent $18 million for the quarter on cloud, representing year-over-year growth of $16 million. We also built out operations to support our partner solutions business with a combination of these items leading to deleveraging this expense line. In line with our expectation, selling and marketing grew faster than revenue for the quarter, driven by growth at trivago, Brand Expedia, Expedia Affiliate Network and HomeAway. We continue to believe in employing a strategic mix of both performance-based and brand marketing activities across our brands and around the world. Our investments in headcount in our lodging supply and Egencia teams also contributed to higher growth. Technology and content grew slightly faster than revenue during the quarter, primarily due to headcount added at HomeAway to drive innovation on supplier and traveler facing products and technology. General and administrate expenses also grew faster than revenue on headcount growth, as we scale up some staffing at HomeAway and trivago, and also reflects the inorganic impact of SilverRail. In terms of capital deployment, we were pleased to have repurchased 1.3 million shares in the fourth quarter bringing our 2017 repurchases to 2.3 million shares for a total of $294 million. In addition, we paid $176 million in dividends for the year. We expect to remain net buyers of our stock over the long-term, and we'll have a balanced approach between opportunistic M&A, share repurchases and dividends. Our financial statements include estimates of the effect of the recent U.S. tax reform, including the transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability to the newly enacted 21% U.S. corporate tax rate. Overall, we recorded a small net benefit on the U.S. GAAP basis for the impact of the Tax Act, and we do not expect the transition tax to result in any meaningful impact to our cash taxes. There are a number of other provisions that do not impact 2017, but will impact 2018 and beyond. We continue to analyze those provisions expect further guidance from the Treasury Department, and we'll be able to share more information on the impact of these factors as we move through 2018. Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2018, on a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% to 11%. Our guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates, which have been pretty volatile of late. In terms of the shape of the year for 2018, with the seasonality of our consolidated business in mind, including the seasonality of HomeAway and the back-end weighting of trivago's plan this year, we are forecasting all of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the second half of the year. As a reminder in our core OTA business and at HomeAway, we invest in selling and marketing to generate bookings ahead of the busy travel season with the revenue recognition occurring at the time of the stay. This impact will be amplified by our planned investments for 2018, including accelerated supply acquisition and cloud migration among others. Please note that on a consolidated basis, all of these impacts will be particularly acute in Q1, where we expect adjusted EBITDA to be down significantly year-over-year, including the adjusted EBITDA losses for both HomeAway and trivago. We remain intent on driving leverage and fixed cost over the long-term. Given our ambitious investment plans, we expect the following for full-year 2018. We expect cost of revenue to grow slightly faster than revenue due to expanding owner and property manager support and new payment options at HomeAway, customer operations for our partner solutions business, and the increase in the investment in cloud. We expect technology and content expense to grow significantly faster than revenue, primarily due to an increase in cloud and the impact of key investments. More specifically in total, we expect cloud spend of $170 million for 2018, roughly split 50-50 between cost of revenue, and technology and content. As we invest aggressively in supply, we also expect to utilize higher cost performance-based channels to drive demand across our global growth brands causing sales and marketing expense to grow faster than revenue. Additionally for HomeAway, we continue to ramp investment in performance-based on brand marketing on the back of better overall capabilities and improved transaction-based monetization. We expect general and administrative expenses to grow solidly slower than revenue. With that, operator, we're ready to take our first question. Operator : All right. Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And first from Piper Jaffray we have Mike Olson. Alan Pickerill : You there, Mike? Operator : Apologies. [Operator Instructions] And I apologize. We missed the beginning of your question. Mr. Olson, your line is now open Michael Olson : All right, thank you. Just one question for me, guys. So one of the things that we heard from investors during the quarter was a concern that there would need to be, I guess, further downward EBITDA revisions, and I guess that proved to be the case. And as you look forward, do you feel like you've now set a good level for 2018 or is there a real potential that as we go through the year you may identify further investment areas that could drive EBITDA growth lower still as we kind of migrate through 2018? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Yeah. Hey, Mike, it's Mark. We feel good about our guidance. As a reminder, in Q3, what we wanted to do was give people a framework for understanding how we were thinking about planning for 2018. We have not finished planning the time. As you know, Q3 is not a time where we usually give the next year guidance. It was really just a framework. And what we were doing was steering people towards this sort of lower end of our historic performance of 10% to 20%. You'll note from our guidance, which is 6% to 11%, the 10% is squarely within that range. And, of course, we do detailed planning exercise. We've got everything planned out. And our expectations will be able to hit the number within that range. Michael Olson : All right. Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Right. [Operator Instructions] Next from Oppenheimer, we do have Jed Kelly. Jed Kelly : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Looks like HomeAway bookings accelerated versus the prior couple quarters. Was there anything you can call out that's either working from a site conversion or higher performance marketing? And then following up, I guess, there's been a couple recent vacation rental property-manager conferences that sort of spoke to some of the displeasure around some of the recent HomeAway changes, especially around the attribution. How would you assess your relationship with some of the large property managers right now? Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Jed. Well, the gross bookings acceleration is really a combination of a lot of great stuff that HomeAway is doing. As you recall, there are a bunch of pieces to the transition. One of them was around monetization and we introduced the traveler fee. Now, we've lapped over that. We introduced that in 2016. It was really creating that conversion engine, improving travel experiences, and owner and property manager experiences. And they've been executing really well against that, and then, of course, solving this problem of people taking bookings off platform. And so, what you're seeing is a combination of all of these things working. And when they work, it allows HomeAway to start stepping on the gas in sales and marketing. And that's what they've been doing. They're now in a position where having worked with lot of our core OTA businesses and actually have a leader in their online marketing function who used to be the leader for hotels.com. They really got the technology stack in place and they're executing on the online marketing playbook. And that is driving some very nice growth. The flipside of that, of course, is that it can put pressure on near-term profitability. And Alan spoke about that in terms of Q1. And what we're finding interestingly is that unlike our core OTA business, a lot of times for these big whole homes, we're seeing bookings not only booked into the busy summer months like Q3, which is a high, high peak quarter for them, we're actually seeing things start to slip into future years as well. So we're starting to get a better handle on how to forecast these things. But it is really a combination of a lot of great work. With respect to the property managers' displeasure and how those are going, listen, I would say that broadly speaking, the property manager and owner community is adjusting to the changes. They're finding ways to use the platform to benefit them. And generally, things are moving in a very, very constructive direction. But, of course, because HomeAway is making so much change and implementing change to this platform, they're always trying to find ways to incent the right behaviors or correct problems that are resulting in leakage or poor behaviors. And you can see some of the things they've done in terms of charging fees for off-platform bookings, some of the movements they made in terms of taking subscription, pricing up just a little bit, all really intended to create the right marketplace activity, so that HomeAway can continue on the path it's on, which is thriving and growing, and ultimately, continue to drive great bookings and great revenue for all of their property managers and owners. So we think the relationship continues to be good and constructive. And we're very happy with the progress there. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Next question, from Morgan Stanley we have Brian Nowak. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. Just understanding that the comments on the previous call were kind of a soft guidance, you talked about out of few exceptions you delivered EBITDA growth between 10 and 20. I guess, as you think about this year and kind of the investments, has anything changed in the way you think about the pace of the investments over the next couple years now versus then? Are you spending more on cloud this year than you thought you would? Are you spending more on hotel supply than you thought you would? Has anything changed? Then, how do you think about the potential benefits of the increased supply coming through the platform? How long does that take? Mark Okerstrom : Yeah, sure. So, I'd say that everything was just an inch, probably an inch more in cloud than Alan had had guided to. I think our supply investments an inch more, but not anything dramatically different. So broadly in line with what we were expecting there. The difference is now that we've actually got things planned out. And I think that the timing is more clear to us at this point. In terms of the benefit of supply and timing, again, we're going to hire folks up here. We've got just about all of them hired. They'll be onboarded, the bulk of them by the end of the first quarter, They'll get to work and some of them are ready to work, signing up new properties, hopefully for the high season. And our expectation is that, we should start to see some impact in terms of room night growth towards the back part of the year. But the real benefit for adding more supply really comes in the second year and its subsequent years, when you can really, one, see the full year impact of the properties you've added. And secondly, create the real network effects of essentially having everything that a customer could possibly want, who lives in a given region, and having them come back to you directly again and again and again, through direct channels and generally cheaper channels. And that's a longer impact. We hope to see that in 2019, from our priority markets this year. But at this point, there are no guarantees. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Next, we have Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Great. Given that you guided HomeAway to $300 million in the past, I wondering if you could help us understand what kind of the outlook is for that now, and if you had any write-down related to that? I wouldn't think so, but just wondering on that. And then secondly, I think you said in your prepared remarks that booked nights growth was better than stayed in the quarter. I wonder if you could help us with the differential there. Thank you. Alan Pickerill : Yeah, Justin, this is Alan. So on HomeAway, the things that have changed for us in terms of our original guide on - or target I would say for 2018 adjusted EBITDA are principally around the migration of the business to the cloud. And we had said last quarter, we thought that would be about $30 million of spend in 2018. And we continue to think that's the right range. And then, the other side of it really are just kind of the level of investments that you might see in brand marketing and performance marketing. That business has finally become one that has true unit economics, true travel transaction e-commerce business and has stood up a proper search engine marketing efforts. And so our inclination is for them to push on that, and to push on growth. And keep in mind they have a very long booking window. So sometimes, we're seeing - we sometimes see bookings on HomeAway that are more than a year out for example. And that's a little bit different than what you typically see in the hotel business. So that's - those are the primary differences from our prior guide on HomeAway. As far as the booked room nights are concerned, we saw - sorry, Justin, was this specific to HomeAway or in general? Justin Post : For the total company. Alan Pickerill : In general, yeah. So we did see a little bit of acceleration on the booked room nights in Q4, it's - it was faster than Q1, I wouldn't look at it as being, a very steep curve, but it was trending in the right direction, we just want to call out that we were seeing good healthy trends there. Mark Okerstrom : Next question, please. Operator : Next from Goldman Sachs, we have Heath Terry. Heath Terry : Great, thanks. Curious, Mark, can you give us a sense on the higher cost that we're seeing in sales and marketing. How much of that or how do you guys think about how to separate what is investment versus what is simply higher operating costs? We've been seeing this trend for a while, not just with your business, but everyone in the travel space, the cost of traffic or the cost of customer acquisition going up. How do you sort of distinguish between investment verses just a lower ROI, because of a more competitive environment that we're in for traffic? And then to the extent that we're hearing hotels, talk about the success of their direct booking programs, and we talked about this before. But kind of curious what you're seeing now in terms of whether or not that's having any impact? Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So with respect to sales and marketing, particularly direct sales and marketing, and advertising a lot of the trends that you're seeing with us, particularly the trends in Q4 were driven by spend at HomeAway, which is ramping up their spend as well as trivago. And I think trivago spoke about the declines that they'd seen in ROAS. In Brand Expedia, for example, Hotels.com, we actually saw very nice trends with sales and marketing efficiencies. And sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was broadly consistent, they were growing at similar rates, which was a nice trend. The way that we think about it going forward is similar to the way that we think thought about it in the past, which is generally what we have observed is that the declines in sales and marketing efficiency from an optical perspective. Have generally been driven by mix shift for us, which is spending more in international markets, which are generally less efficient and then building up more efficiency over time, and even though those trends are generally good and going in the right direction. International markets growing faster than the U.S., just leaves a mix shift that puts pressure on the line item. What we're doing in terms of investing more aggressively in our supply, in our localized consumer experience is an international market, is squarely aimed at trying to get a better sales and marketing efficiency faster in those markets. And that's the level we're looking at it at. We're looking at it at the individual market level. We're looking at it at the individual channel level. And so far, I mean based on our experience in this business. We've been in the situation, where it has not been a case, where we've had to pay more for the same. We've been generally able to offset CPC increases and rising costs with better conversion rates through just our test and learn velocity and adding better supply. In terms of the hotels direct booking campaigns, again we still do not see an impact on our business, and we look at this in a million different ways, generally what's happened in the marketplace is that we have seen a trend towards - mixing towards more independent hotels, as our sort order does take into account the competitiveness of pricing. And as a reminder, generally our customers are pretty darn brand agnostics. So less than 0.5% of shoppers on Hotels.com are looking for the largest brand by name, and as a result they're picking the hotels that they see, and I think it's picking the hotels that are drifting down the sort order a little bit less. So perhaps it's working up for the hotel chains. It seems to working up fine for us, and maybe we hit a new equilibrium. Heath Terry : Okay. Great. Thanks, Mark. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Next from RBC Capital Markets, is Mark Mahaney. Mark Mahaney : Great. Thanks. I could throw out a couple. When you talk about building out the OTA lodging supply, the particular geographies that you - that are targeted by you particularly in 2018 places that you want to more than others build out that supply? And then secondly, as you brought more and more HomeAway inventory real-time booking onto - into the Expedia platform, have you noticed an overall impact on conversion? Is it too early to tell, but are you - is that allowing you to increase match rates? And I assume that's what you'd like to see happen in the future. Is there already evident that that's going to happen? Thanks a lot. Mark Okerstrom : Yeah, you're welcome. So in terms of geographic focus, I don't want to get into specifics, I would say that, obviously, Europe is an interesting place for us, Asia is interesting. But of course, we're going to replicate this around the world. So to some extent what we do in 2018, it's just a precursor to what we're going to continue to do on a go forward basis. But those are a couple of regions that are interesting to us for 2018. In terms of HomeAway inventory on the Expedia platform, yeah, we generally, what we see is, when we are able to expand inventory, the overall conversion rates for the destinations generally go up. And that's what we see with alternative accommodations generally. It can have a higher impact in some markets that have a higher mix of that type of inventory. But we have not yet cracked the code on getting to the degree of proficiency that we want to get to in terms of just matching the perfect property with the perfect shopper yet, but that's exactly the work that we're doing. So it is conversion accretive, we think it can be a lot more and we are actively working on product features and sort algorithms to actually optimize the opportunity ahead of us. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Mark. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Next we have from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Guys, in prior quarters you would call that some differences you seen in sort of core global Expedia growth brands versus things that might have weighed down the growth rate in prior periods, specific brands that you've acquired or was that underperformed. Any differences you're calling out for people this quarter in terms of brands that either outperformed or underperformed expectations? And maybe a second question with respect to geography same thing, anything we call out in terms of things you saw on the plus or minus side on the geography basis in the quarter that will inform your view for early 2018? Thanks. Alan Pickerill : Eric, thanks. This is Alan. In terms of the kind of the split by brands, the global - what we kind of refer to as the global growth brands, which is a reminder of our Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, Expedia Affiliate Network and Egencia grew at 17% year-over-year in the quarter. That has been pretty consistent all year long, they grew 19% for the full year. So we've seen good growth there in the high teens. They make up, call it, 85% to 90% of the mix. So we've got a good, good vast majority of our businesses and our hotel business growing in the high-teens. The regional brands, which are Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif, Hotwire those types of brands think of them as being kind of flattish, sometimes better, sometimes worse. And they're making up, call it, mid-single-digit percentage of the mix. And then all of the other room nights have been a headwind for us. That has essentially eased as we've kind of cleaned the comps on Orbitz for business, and Orbitz partner network where we had churned off components of the business. Mark Okerstrom : And then in terms of geographic, generally a continuation of the usual broader trends which is international growth is faster than domestic growth. Europe has generally started to be a bright spot for us, particular strength in Greece and Turkey, which had gone through some tough times and they are back to full strength. Brazil was strong for us; Japan continues to be strong for us; Vietnam, where we're starting to build a presence. So you know a lot of positive stories. On the down side Caribbean was continued to be a tough spot for us, obviously, because of the storms. But encouraging actually with some of the harder hit areas, we're actually seeing them bounce back and we did see them bounce back towards into December period. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for the color. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from SunTrust, we'll hear from Naved Khan. Naved Khan : Yeah. Thank you very much, guys. Just a couple of question. So a little more clarification on your guidance, If I look at the range, are there any big variables to call out that might cause you to coming towards the low-end versus the high-end? And then, I had a follow-up. Alan Pickerill : Well, I think, look, we - the guidance that we put together in the range that we put together is obviously an amalgamation of all of the potential outcomes of the various businesses. I think for the most part setting aside exogenous factors that we would be unaware of at this point, I think, we think of it largely is execution. And the teams are out, pushing hard to grow the business as well as they can. I will remind you that the investments that we're making, the cloud investment for example is, call it, $75 million more in 2018 and 2017. The investment, we're making in the supply acquisition is substantial. If you take those two together that's a mid to high single-digit percentage impact on our guidance. And so if you wanted to quote unquote normalize for that it would put the guidance well into the mid-teens. Naved Khan : Okay. And just sort of get a little more color on this. So trivago which reported yesterday, I mean, obviously, that you consolidated the results. And I guess the guide was probably a little bit worse versus the expectations back in the third quarter, so how much of that kind of being reflected in your guidance today versus it was at the end of the third quarter? Alan Pickerill : Yeah, I mean, I don't want to get into specifics brand by brand, but we are expecting a negative contribution from trivago in 2018 on the profit line. Mark Okerstrom : So obviously that could be an upside that could be a little bit of downside there, perhaps, but it's not where we've got them for our full year 2018, I don't expect it to be a material mover. Other things, I probably call out is foreign exchange, which has pretty volatile of late. I don't know if, Alan, you call that out. And then, I would just remind to you that, we are still finding our way in terms of the booked to stay lag. I mentioned that - Alan mentioned that at HomeAway. And so there is a risk there for HomeAway that as we continue to ramp up spend in performance marketing channels that we continue to slip revenue out into 2019. But all of those things are forecasted to the best of our ability right now. There are just things that could move things around, ultimately the result within the range. Naved Khan : Okay. That's perfect. And then, on HomeAway, actually I had a two-part question. So I think, Mark, you talked about focusing more on brand and performance advertising for HomeAway this year. If you have to think of the split between the two, would you be more focused on brand versus performance? And then, how would you sort of go about addressing the bookings that are happening off-platform? How would you get attribution for that? Mark Okerstrom : Yeah. So in terms of branded performance, I don't want to get into specific mix, I would say that HomeAway has been brand advertising for a while, performance marketing though is one of those things that's relatively new. So in terms of growth rates, I would expect performance marketing to be a bigger part of the story. In terms of off-platform bookings how to get attribution. I mean, the biggest thing with the HomeAway team is focused on, right now. Is this creating reasons for people to book on platform, they've developed some incredible technology around their marketplace feeds, the revenue management platform, that they've rolled out lots of great reasons for property owners and managers to actually use the platform, engage with the platform when they do get bookings on the platform, they get credit in short order. And then, on the traveler side again just the book with confidence guarantee the insurance, be making sure that ultimately you're protected from fraud. I mean, they're all great reasons to be on the platform and that's the primary focus for them, right now. And in addition, they're looking for areas, where there is abuse going on and trying to close those loopholes, where they can. Naved Khan : Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next we have Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Stabler : Thanks. A couple if I could. Alan, could you give us a bit more color on the revenue per room night trends you're seeing and maybe how we should think about that going forward? And then, secondly domestic revenue 4% in the quarter, up 10% for the full year, how should we think about that deceleration a bit more pronounced than expected? Thank you. Alan Pickerill : Yeah. So on the revenue per room night, I mean, it's the usual culprits in there. We've got an impact from just our contracted margins; we've got an impact from the loyalty programs. I would say the last couple of quarters; we've had a little bit more of a negative impact from refunds that we use typically to accommodate customers in times of tough weather. And so that has been a little bit more than we would normally see. I think that, the other factor for Q4, is that we had a particularly tough comp, if you look back at what we said in Q4 and actually in Q1 as well this year. The revenue per room night trend was better than we had anticipated in those quarters and that was on some package pricing trends and related. And so that's a particularly tough comp. We do expect to see the overall trend be favorable in terms of the gap between revenue per room night and ADRs, as we continue to move through 2018. And then as far as the revenue trends, I would say, just if you're kind of thinking about the growth we saw in Q3, which was around 15% and the growth we saw in Q4 was about 11% total revenue growth. The difference is there were the HomeAway - deceleration in HomeAway revenue, which I talked about the variation you saw in the hotel business, both in terms of slightly slower stayed room night growth and a slightly larger impact from revenue per room night. And lastly just the trivago top line trends also contributed. Those are really the key factors that change the revenue growth from last quarter. Mark Okerstrom : Yeah, Peter on the domestic side specifically, the HomeAway subscription revenue peeling off was one of the largest factors for domestic. So hit that disproportionately hard, if you remember last Q4, we were in the spot, I think, we called it out that we were essentially double earning. We are in the spot. We're still recognizing the revenue from the subscription business, including tiers. And we have added the traveler fee and we're copying over that for HomeAway so that was a bit of a drag. Peter Stabler : Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Next Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Paul Bieber : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. First, Google announced a few big changes to its flight and hotel search experience. I'm just wondering, how would you characterize those changes and are they more the same from Google? Will these changes have a more significant impact on the industry? And then just, secondly, just following-up on the room night growth de-sell sequentially, what are the factors that drove the deceleration given that 3Q had the negative hurricane impact? Is that all being driven by the recent brands? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Paul. I'd say for the Google changes largely it's more of the same, they continued to try to create a better and better search experience. They continue to try to monetize more of the page, these continue to be along that same vein. It continues to be a great channel for us, particularly on the hotel side, we get great traffic from them and we turn those users into repeat loyal customers. But I think, listen, over the long term, we have got to be mindful and we always are mindful of the incredible market power that Google has, and it just underscores the importance of to make sure importance for us. To make sure that we build out the credible products, products where we've got the breadth of hotel inventory that spans the whole market that's exactly what we're doing, making sure that we've got user experiences that are localized, and can get people through the booking path as quick as possible. And then importantly if things go wrong or plans change, it's us they can help them and that's where we're uniquely positioned to really add value and to differentiate ourselves from search partners and actually create real customer loyalty. Room night growth, you want to take that? Alan Pickerill : Yeah, listen on the hotel side of the business, no major story, I kind of walked through the general trends there, we're still seeing very good growth for the global growth brands. We are seeing you know flattish trends on the regional brands and we've cleaned the comp on some of the other orbits businesses, that we had acquired that shed a fair amount of business. There's puts and takes in there each quarter as you would imagine, but no big change quarter-to-quarter. On HomeAway, we did see slower room night growth in Q4 on a stayed basis than Q3. I think that's largely driven, frankly, by just the seasonality of that business. It's hyper-seasonal. So much of what's happening there is coming in the third quarter with that being the busiest stayed season for them. And so, that really was the contributor. In terms of the hurricane impact, I mean, we were not sizing it for room nights. We do think it was net-net about a - call it in the range of the $10 million headwind on EBITDA in Q4 on top of what we saw in Q3. So it was a headwind for us in Q4. But we knew about that coming into the quarter. Paul Bieber : Okay. Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Next question, please. Operator : Next question will come from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks for taking the question. Two if I can. First, just on MatchBack, the recent interview, Jeff Hurst from HomeAway, I quoted him as saying, HomeAway had originally expected some of the offline leakage would close on its own, but it hasn't. So, I guess, just wondering if you can give us your latest thinking on whether you can migrate that $15 billion of total bookings at HomeAway online and is that - why do you use something like MatchBack that's so upsetting the suppliers, given the market still seems fairly nascent? And then, second one, on the shopping cart, I think this first came up, at focus right in November of 2016. So seems like something you guys have been working on, testing for a while. Anything you can share with us around how this is impacting your conversion rates, transaction values and how you might be able to leverage this as a competitive advantage going forward? Alan Pickerill : Thanks, Lloyd. Listen, on MatchBack, I think as it is often the case when you make some of these platform changes, people find ways around them. And we had a situation with a very small group, who was able to essentially get credit for bookings as if they were on platform, but actually go around the platform. And so, what this program is meant to do is actually through the honor system, self-report and actually get credit. There will be a vocal minority of people, who are against it. But unfortunately, we got to do these things to drive the health of the overall marketplace. And this particular program doesn't at all change our view on migrating the bookings online. They're making exceptional progress there. It's not just one thing. It's one thing after another thing. And then of course, you find situations like this where people try to find a loophole and exploit it. You close them down. But we're making great progress there. In terms of shopping cart, it hasn't really been live with live traffic for all that long. This is a relatively new. Right now, we're live in flight and car. It is - looks particularly good in mobile. And the implementation is essentially a slide open tray if you will, that as you're shopping you can press the plus sign and drop things into this tray. And then, when you pull the tray over it is automatically calculating the savings. So we're finding some very encouraging results in terms of what it's doing in terms of attach rates and bundling. But it's still early yet, and of course, still just flight and car. We think the big upside comes in hotel. And that will come here, probably later this quarter we'll start testing that, if not, the second quarter. But it really is a very encouraging product. And it's something we've been talking about doing for many years. And it's great to see it finally in reality and out in the wild. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we have Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Perry Gold : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. With the recent shakeup of Airbnb and the delay of its IPO until at least 2019, do you see opportunity to leave it - lean in even more aggressively to the alternative accommodation sphere, to drive faster supply and demand growth? Alan Pickerill : Well, Perry, it doesn't really change our overall philosophy. I think as we've said a number of times, it is just a massive market. And we think ourselves and other competitors in the marketplace can grow very well for a long period of time. I think these management changes may happen. You never know exactly why they happen. We got a ton of respect for the Airbnb team. I think I've met Laurence a number of times. I think he is a very sharp guy. I think people went their own ways. And who knows the reasons, but I'm not reading a lot into it. Operator : Right. And next from Jefferies, we have Brent Hill - Brent Thill, excuse me. Brent Thill : Thanks. Just back to the expenses, sales and marketing outpacing revenue. I know you're not giving detailed guidance. But in terms of the duration, how long you expect that to continue and I just wanted to be clear on the cloud migration. I think that you expect it through 2018. You would be through kind of the bulk of that, and the benefit would be more felt in 2019. I just was hopeful if you could clarify a little more around both topics. Mark Okerstrom : Yeah, Brent, sorry, can you just elaborate on your question on selling and marketing? What are you asking, duration of what exactly? Brent Thill : Just, Alan, to your comment about sales and marking outpacing revenue, how long you anticipate that down investment in sales to continue to outpace at that clip? Alan Pickerill : Yeah, well, so we don't have a target for kind of trying to get leverage on selling and marketing. I think it's well known the opportunity in front of us. It's well known that it's a global opportunity. When we launch in new markets, for example, we're starting from scratch in a way in the sense that we don't have repeat customers. We don't have brand recognition in those countries. And so, we have to make investments to get traffic in the store to please those customers to getting - get them coming back to us. And over time, the goal obviously is to build a repeat customer base, so that that particular point of sale can start to see at least better overall efficiencies, if not, leverage. From a directional perspective, a lot - just directionally, we get more deleveraged today from brands like HomeAway and trivago than we do from some of the core OTA brand. So just, I don't want to get into the details of that. But more of it is coming from those brands than the other way around. So for now, we're fine with revenue - sorry, with selling and marketing growing faster than revenue. And we'll see how the business plays out over the next several years. On cloud migration, one of the biggest keys for us in 2018 is getting our lodging stack onto the cloud. We're planning to do that in the not too distant future. And it's a key milestone for us in terms of how we're doing on that migration, how the performance goes and what kind of momentum we think that would mean for the rest of the year. There will still be work to be done in 2019. I'm not ready to size it today, mostly because we have to see how we do in 2018. But we will start to - we will have additional migration to do in 2019. From a benefit perspective, we've already seen some. The first thing that we saw early was that we avoided the need to build out another data center. We were getting pretty close to the point where that was going to be a requirement to deal with the size of our business and that has been completely avoided and completely off the table. We also are seeing a significant drop in CapEx related to data center. Two years ago, our CapEx on data center assets was in the neighborhood of, call it, $180 million. And that's down to, call it, $50 million now on an annual basis. So we already are seeing a big benefit in the CapEx side. And that's just on the pure kind of cloud versus data center equation. There's a whole bunch of other benefits that will come from being in the cloud that we think will accrue to us after we're migrated. Mark Okerstrom : Next question, please. Operator : And moving on, our next question - next question will come from Mark May with Citi. Mark May : Thanks. First on the guidance, the 6% to 11%, if I look at some of the estimates out there on trivago and I back those out, it would actually be like a 2 percentage point headwind on your guidance. I'm just trying to square that with your comment earlier that it's not really a material driver. Would you say it's at least over a percentage point impact? It just seems like it could be more material. And does your guidance include FX? And if so, what would the 6% to 11% be if it didn't. And then, in terms of HomeAway revenue in Q4, with the subscription rolling off and some other noise in that number, is that a closer look at what organic growth looks like? Can you help us kind of think about, when we clean that up, is that a clean look at kind of what organic now looks like. Mark Okerstrom : So, Mark, just on trivago, my comment was related to the year-on-year growth of Expedia, Inc. So on the context, it's still over $1.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA. trivago was irrelevant in 2017. And based upon where they are guiding 2018, we think it will be similarly relevant. So that's a headwind. Alan Pickerill : It is a headwind. But it is a headwind. Mark Okerstrom : Yeah. Alan Pickerill : And then, in terms of FX. Yes, I mean what we do with our guidance and our forecast is we include current foreign exchange rates. And so, to the extent that the dollar weakens after we've done our forecast, that's a tailwind. If the dollar strengthens, that's a headwind. And so, that's in there. I mean, we don't size it as precisely as you're asking for. The one thing I will remind you though is we are a global company. We have people all over the world. We have a reasonably sized natural hedge of folks sitting in the UK, folks sitting in Europe, folks sitting in Asia. So there is some offset from what you would think would be the - just the pure impact on revenue translation. On away - on HomeAway revenue growth, and whether this is kind of what organic growth looks like, no, I don't think the 16% growth that the company posted in Q4 is a typical what we would expect from organic. And the reason for that is that, A, there is a seasonal component as I mentioned before, so they get a lot more of their revenue in Q3. And they're investing marketing to get that and so they see outsized growth then. But the other bit is we will eventually reach subscription equilibrium. We're not there yet. It continues to decline. And so, once that gets completely normalized then we would be into a more kind of, as you called it, organic growth rate. The last thing I'll mention is that, in Q4, they had a particularly tough comp on their service fees. So if you remember back to 2016, when they first started implementing consumer service fees, they did the U.S. in the spring, they did Europe in late spring early summer. And there's a lag between when they implemented those and the book to stay. And so you can think of Q4 2016 as being the first quarter where pretty much all of the bookings had a consumer service fee against it, and so, they comped over that in Q4 this year. Those are all the factors to consider. Mark Okerstrom : Next question, please. Operator : Next question from J.P. Morgan we have Douglas Anmuth. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to the supply acquisition efforts and the step function change that you mentioned. Just trying to understand, I guess, the shift in strategy. I think, historically, you kind of had a more measured approach on adding supply, particularly as you sought to balance traveler demand with existing properties, kind of with the new ones coming onboard. So if you could talk about that. And then, secondly, I think it was 2016, the last time you kind of gave a view on margins two years out. I'm just curious if you have anything to update there or thoughts as you're looking over the next two years. Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Doug. It is certainly a shift in strategy from what we've been doing for the last five years. But it's a shift in strategy that has been enabled by the hard work we've done in the last five years. Really to get into this position, we had to build global online marketing capabilities. We had to build global multi-language multi-currency websites, Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, which we've now done. We had to roll out an agency hotel product. We did that with our Expedia Traveler Preference program. We had to get our base level margins to the right spot. And then, we had to get into a situation where we could actually wire everything up together, so that when we signed up a new property we could actually start marketing that property in variable marketing channels. You saw us ramp up our supply capabilities over the course, the last five years, from 15,000 to 20,000 a year to this year, call it, 90,000. And next year, we'll do 2x or more that number. And it's really on the back of us having the capability to do it. We have demonstrated over the years to ourselves and I think to investors just how powerful it is when you can add supply. You can create better conversion. You can tap into new sources of demand. And so, we're absolutely convinced this is the right strategy. Is it a shift? It is a shift, but it's really based on the hard work that we've done over the course of the last five years. And then, I will give Alan the margin question. Alan, you want to take that one? Alan Pickerill : Hey, Doug. Yeah, so - yeah, we did give some view on the target P&L at our Analyst Day a couple of years ago. We have not updated those since then. I don't think it would be appropriate to kind of give guidance on that or even directional indicators. We're focused on executing in 2018. We have these key investments that we've talked about that that we're focused on. And seeing how this year plays out, just how successful we can be with these initiatives will play into how we think about 2019 performance and beyond. Operator : All right. And ladies and gentlemen, we are out of time for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mark Okerstrom for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Okerstrom : Great. Well, I'd just like to thank everyone for joining the call. And your continued interest in Expedia, especially I just love to thank our employees for their incredibly hard work in 2017. And thank you all, every one of you globally, for in advance for the hard work in 2018. We've got ambitious goals. And we are incredibly excited to get going with them. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

Josey - JMP Securities LLC Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Mark A. May - Citi Investment Research Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Expedia Group Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Michael Senno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Unverified Participant : Good afternoon and welcome to Expedia Group's Financial Results Conference Call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Mark Okerstrom, Expedia's CEO and President; and Alan Pickerill, our CFO. The following discussion including responses to your questions reflects management's views as of today, April 26, 2018, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com and I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content, including today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. One additional item to note, in this quarter's earnings release we presented financial results both for Expedia Group in total and excluding trivago in order to provide increased transparency on the underlying performance of our transactional businesses. You will find reconciliations for non-GAAP measures excluding trivago in our earnings release. Finally, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable efforts. These items include but are not limited to foreign exchange, returns on investment spending, and acquisition-related restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Michael, and welcome aboard. We're off to a good start in 2018 with gross bookings and revenue, each increasing a healthy 15% in the first quarter and adjusted EBITDA coming in a bit ahead of our expectations. We're also continuing to make excellent progress on our key strategic initiatives aimed at positioning us even better to delivered sustained healthy top and bottom-line growth for many years to come. Helped in part by Easter timing, total lodging stayed room nights grew 15% in the quarter, led by 16% growth at our global growth brands, Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, Expedia Partner Solutions and Egencia. HomeAway was also a factor posting strong room night growth at 36% year-over-year. We accelerated the pace of new property additions for our global lodging portfolio, directly adding 50,000 properties in addition to making another 25,000 HomeAway properties available to our core OTA brands. All told, we now count over 665,000 properties in our core lodging portfolio. While we're still ramping up our supply initiatives in the first quarter, the pace of property acquisitions in our priority markets has begun to accelerate and we expect property growth in these markets to pick up further in the second quarter and continue as we move through the year. Overall, we remain on track to add more than 180,000 new properties directly to our global lodging portfolio for the full year, while continuing to integrate additional HomeAway properties. HomeAway delivered another strong quarter with 46% growth in gross bookings, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to ramp and optimize performance marketing, as well as an increase in conversion from continued improvements in customer and partner-facing experiences. That also pushed HomeAway's online and reported gross bookings to $10 billion on a trailing-12-month basis, a nice milestone as the team continues to make great strides in transitioning to a true e-commerce business. It's still early days and we have lots of work to do, but we continue to see a tremendous opportunity ahead in the $120 billion alternative-accommodation space. Egencia grew gross bookings 15%, exceeding $2 billion in quarterly bookings for the first time, while first quarter revenue was up a solid 23%. We posted another quarter of over 20% year-over-year growth in new-client signings as the investments we've made in Egencia sales team over the past year continue to pay dividends. So we have good momentum in this business, a healthy sales pipeline, and we're progressing well towards hitting our ambitious goals for Egencia. As expected, challenges at trivago continued in the first quarter with revenue down modestly on a stand-alone currency-neutral basis. trivago is expecting top and bottom-line pressure to continue into the second quarter with trends improving in the back half of the year. Last month we launched a new corporate identity reflecting our increasingly global focus and the powerful global travel platform we've become. Our new identity is symbolic of the next chapter in the Expedia Group journey, which we began late last year. On a go-forward basis and more than ever, our efforts are squarely aimed at leveraging the full scale of our global platform and improving operations across the portfolio of assets we've built and bought over the years. While there is still lot to do, the steps we've already taken give us increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong growth and share gains in this huge $1.6 trillion market for many years to come With that, I'll turn it over to Alan. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We were pleased to deliver healthy top-line growth in the first, helped in part by Easter timing and foreign currency. Lodging revenue, including both Hotel and HomeAway, grew 15%, in line with the stayed room night growth. The shift in Easter timing added an estimated 150 basis points to total lodging room-night growth. Excluding HomeAway, revenue per room night was flat, while average daily rates grew approximately 5% year-over-year, a slightly smaller gap than last quarter. We continue to expect the gap between revenue per room-night and average daily rates to narrow as we move through the year. HomeAway revenue increased 26% on strong stayed-property-night growth of 36%. HomeAway's transactional revenue grew 70% in the quarter, while subscription revenue declined 29%, in line with our expectations. While the seasonality of the business can obscure it, we're pleased with our continued progress in monetization. As we continue to progress our transition to a transactional business, we do anticipate further declines in our subscription base and currently expect subscription revenue to decrease in the mid-20% range for the full year. HomeAway's negative $21 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was in line with our expectations, due in part to the planned investments in performance-based marketing. That contributed to HomeAway's very strong growth in gross bookings and will drive revenue growth in future quarters. We also continued to invest in both consumer and supplier-facing products and HomeAway's migration to the cloud. Total advertising and media revenue was up 10% for the quarter, as a benefit from foreign exchange more than offset local currency revenue declines at trivago. Our Media Solutions business delivered solid 14% growth. Air revenue grew 11% with a 1% increase in air tickets sold and 10% growth in revenue per ticket. Two changes that took effect this quarter drove the majority of air revenue growth. One relates to distribution fees previously classified as contra revenue now classified in cost of revenue. The other is a reclassification of certain customer refunds from air revenue to insurance. Neither of these changes has an impact on overall profitability. All Other revenue increased 18% in the first quarter, reflecting healthy growth in car rental and travel insurance. Turning to adjusted expenses, in line with our expectations for the quarter, each category grew faster than revenue due to a combination of our key strategic initiatives and ongoing investments along with elevated spending at trivago and a foreign currency impact. Cost of revenue grew slightly faster than revenue in the quarter, similar to what we expect for the full year. Cloud costs contributed about 350 basis points to that growth and the accounting change related to air revenue added a 200 basis point headwind. Total selling and marketing increased 19%, growing a bit faster than revenue. The primary drivers of de-leverage in direct selling and marketing were trivago, the acceleration in marketing spend at HomeAway, and continued growth at Expedia Partner Solutions. Indirect selling and marketing growth was elevated, given the increased head count associated with our supply initiative and the sales team at Egencia. We continue to expect selling and marketing to grow faster than revenue for the full year. Technology and content expenses grew 27% during the quarter, as we've increased head count over the last year to invest in platform and product across the organization; most notably at HomeAway. Our cloud migration and the inorganic impact from acquisitions each contributed around 300 basis points of growth. Given these investments, we continue to expect technology and content to de-leverage for the rest of the year. General and administrative expenses also grew faster than revenue on increased staffing that mainly took place in the second half of last year, notably at trivago and HomeAway. The inorganic impact from acquisitions also added about 250 basis points of growth. Looking ahead, we expect growth in general and administrative expenses to slow slightly in the second quarter and moderate further in the second half of 2018 as comps become easier. We remain on track to see solid leverage on general and administrative expenses for the full year. In terms of capital allocation, our historic balanced approach remains the same. Year-to-date, we made $268 million in share repurchases, taking in 2.5 million shares at an average price of $107. We also paid $46 million in dividends. We are returning capital to shareholders, while also investing responsibly in organic initiatives across the business, given the significant opportunities we have in front of us. As always, we will continue to look at M&A opportunistically. Turning to our financial expectations for the year, we are reiterating our guidance for consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% to 11%, or 10% to 15% excluding cloud. Our outlook incorporates the updated adjusted EBITDA guidance trivago provided yesterday, and we now expect trivago to be an approximate 200 to 400 basis point headwind on our consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth. Before closing, I want to highlight a few items to keep in mind for the balance of the year. First, we are expecting slightly slower room night growth in the second quarter due to a few factors. As I mentioned earlier, Easter stays shifted largely into the first quarter this year. We are also facing more difficult room night comps due to the acceleration we saw from the first to the second quarter last year. In addition, we are increasingly looking for ways to better optimize direct marketing spend, which could have a marginally negative impact on unit growth. Second, turning to the shape of the year, we continue to expect more than 100% of our adjusted EBITDA growth to come in the second half of the year. I also want to note a few below-the-line items. We plan to redeem our 7.5% coupon bonds that mature in August and, as a result, expect net interest expense to be approximately flat for the full year. And lastly moving to taxes, based on our current analysis of the impact of U.S. tax reform, we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be a bit below the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. This could change as we continue to receive additional guidance and interpretation of the tax law. In closing, though it's still early in the year, we are pleased with how we're executing and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial expectations for the year. With that, operator, we're ready to take our first question. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Mark, you there? Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sorry, I was on mute. I apologize. As you build up this inventory both for traditional accommodation \u2013 especially for traditional accommodations, can you talk about what you're already seeing in terms of conversion rates revenue? I don't know if there's any impact on ADRs. I think there's a very well-known reason why you're trying to build up that \u2013 a very thoughtful reason for why you're trying to build up that inventory. But have you already started to see the flywheels off of that increase in inventory? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. Well, with relation to the stuff we've already started this year, it's still pretty early. We did acquire 50,000 properties in the first quarter, but that built as we moved through the quarter. So it is a bit early. I mean, historically, what we have seen is that conversion does improve as you add more property density into a destination. So we do expect to see that. We have seen some pockets of nice acceleration in some of our wave one countries. We do believe that this is in part driven by the property acquisition push, but again, it's too early for us to call victory on this by any means. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. A couple questions. Could you just help us understand how HomeAway dynamics are going to work in the second half with the 46% bookings growth? Any thoughts on what the organic rate is? I know there's a transition online that's helping you. Is the whole platform growing? Do you think it is? Maybe some thoughts on that? And then finally with trivago, it's clearly one of the big advertisers, we think Booking.com is pulling out are you getting the benefit to your room nights as they spend less on that platform? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: So, Justin. On HomeAway, I would just say both is occurring. I mean, there was a book of business that existed when we acquired the company two years ago. That was estimated at that time at around $15 billion. You know, our belief is that that has grown in the two years that we acquired the company, so there is a tailwind associated with the existing customers and existing supply partners transacting more and more online. But the company is growing organically as well and one of the best examples of that I think is that they've been able to stand up a proper performance-based marketing team really for the first time in the history of that company and invest in ad words on Google and bring in traffic that way, and that is part of what's driving the 46% gross bookings growth. So what the kind of pure, pure organic growth rate would be if the all of the book of business that was already involved in the platform was online it's difficult to say, other than we think the industry is growing and there should be plenty of room for very healthy growth for that business for a long time. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: And certainly we see traffic growing nicely. We've certainly seen a pretty significant increase in the number of properties on the platform over the period as well, so we do believe the overall volume is growing. With respect to trivago, it's an interesting dynamic I think, what we see is that Booking.com does appear to be pulling back. I think that's pretty clear and it's an auction and so the auction essentially adjusts. That said, trivago is adjusting their marketing spend as well, and so overall volume isn't growing as quickly as it has in the past. So it's not really us versus them situation. We continue to react to the auction or at least our big brands do, and the overall channel is a little bit slower than it has been in the past just, given the pull-back on marketing. Operator : Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclay's. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions for me. So first, the de-leverage in direct marketing was better compared to last quarter. You discussed the trends in trivago in a way that was pretty helpful, but can you comment on the trends in the core OTA business? And as we think about 2Q and beyond, can we expect similar trends in there? And then second question, as you continue to add more properties in these markets have you ramped marketing spend on these regions already? So do you feel like you are gaining market share at this point or is it too early to say? Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah, so Deepak, on your first question, I would say as you alluded to and as we said, the de-leverage in the quarter principally came from trivago and HomeAway. What's happening on the other side of the business is a combination of factors. One is that we do continue to grow those businesses globally. We do push on some marketing in the international markets and, as we said before, when we do that, those new markets or newer markets are going to be at lower market efficiencies than established businesses. Having said that, we are also looking for opportunities to optimize in the marketing channel. We're looking for inefficient spend that has low probability of repeat and are willing to make trade-offs where we may get better profit \u2013 eliminate some of that spending, get better profitability and the result may be slightly slower room-night growth in those circumstances, but we think those are good trade-offs for us to be making. So we saw good traction on that in the quarter across a couple of the big brands. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: And Deepak, with respect to the priority markets where we're adding properties more significantly, generally, yes, we are ramping marketing spend. First of all, we are being a little bit more focused in terms of our global offline or brand spend and focusing it, not dramatically, but certainly incrementally, on the target markets where we're building stronger positions. And then secondly, as we add new properties, we are entering new auctions that exist in performance marketing channels where we simply couldn't spend historically. So almost definitionally, we are gaining market share. We do monitor the impact on our existing properties very closely and make sure that growth into new properties isn't coming at the expense of our existing partners. Operator : Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on HomeAway, is there anything that you've seen that indicates it's going to be sort of harder to replicate the success you've had with HomeAway in the United States is going to be harder to replicate in international markets? And then sort of, I guess, Airbnb's been testing a \u2013 removing the traveler fee to reduce some friction. Do you ever foresee where potentially you shift more of the fees to the host versus the traveler? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Jed. I would say that generally everything outside of the U.S. is harder than the U.S., and I think we learned this very early in our core OTA business that being multi-language, being multi-currency, it is a little bit more challenging, and in a lot of these markets there are other players there that we have to compete with versus the U.S. where the HomeAway and particularly the VR brand was really one of the first and is so exceptionally strong. That said, we do think there is a big opportunity there, and we are starting to see some nice growth in a number of markets because the product is great, and customers want it, and customers want to have choice when they're shopping around for alternative accommodations and, as HomeAway or VRBO steps up their efforts in international markets, there's certainly a willing and receptive market for them both on the host or supplier side and on the consumer side, but it is a little bit more challenging. With respect to Airbnb testing the removal of the traveler fee, listen, HomeAway has been in the great position of having a combination of all monetization models for a while. We think it's important to have that flexibility. I think that all of the alternative accommodations players out there are likely to have some combination in the near term. I think that as the overlap between properties amongst the players gets larger and I think that will happen over time, I expect that the monetization will shift a little bit more to supplier pays and away from traveler pays based on what we've seen in other industries, but right now that's just an expectation. We don't really know at this point. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon. Regarding the expectation for slowing room-night growth in Q2, could you just elaborate on what you said related to optimizing marketing spend? What kinds of changes are you making there? And maybe just so models don't end up all over the place, maybe you could say approximately how much you expect room nights could decelerate by? Thanks. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Well, on the second part, I'm not going to go there. I mean we don't guide on room nights, and we don't guide by quarters. So I'm happy to give the directional indicator, but not going to try to put a pin in it. Yeah. I mean on the other bid, again, I mean for competitive reasons we'd probably rather not be super specific here, but the fact is that we spend billions of dollars on selling and marketing every year, and a lot of that is geared towards trying to drive traffic related to hotel shoppers and bookers. And that we've always had efforts in place to try and optimize channels, make sure we're getting the most bang for our buck in given channels, but we also increasingly are interested in finding pockets of spend that we think is not efficient enough or doesn't drive the opportunity for repeat traffic. So, I don't want to be specific about channels or specific geos, but we'll look for that. Now \u2013 and I don't want to overstate it either. I mean, the issue is that there's a huge growth opportunity in front of us and we're definitely biased towards global growth, so think of this I think as a little bit more around the edges and trying to optimize the channels. I don't know if... Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: I think you said it very well, Alan. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : We'll take the next question from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe following up on that, just trying to tease out a little bit of within global brands versus some of the acquired and regional properties. Is there anything you can give us the way you're attributing marketing? Is it a function of your aiming for growth in the global brands that we're seeing numbers like up 16% and we should be thinking about the percentage of bookings that aren't tied to that as sort of being run-off or just run for profit? How should we be thinking about that narrative as we move through the year? And then second question, is there any way to call out headwinds and tailwinds from Easter of what it contributed to Q1 or what it might create in terms of Q2? I didn't hear that during the prepared remarks. Didn't know if you wanted to frame that for folks. Thanks, guys. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: So I'll take the first one, Eric, and then I'll turn the Easter question over to Alan. You know, generally the strategy on the global brands versus the regional brands remains the same. The global brands are increasing their footprint around the world are pushing growth and building strong brand positions around the world and as a result, we are allocating a significantly larger portion of our marketing spend both online and offline towards those brands. That said, the regional brands still have a loyal following and continue to be great profit generators and our goal with those brands is to have them growth broadly in line with market in which they operate and most of them are in the more mature U.S. markets. So growth rates are a little bit more modest or a lot more modest than we see in the global growth brands. So that's basically the strategy. It hasn't changed much and I think as we move through the year, our goal is to try to grow those regional brands as well as we can with an eye to profitability. And our expectation is that we will continue to do that, but we do expect it's always going to be a large bit slower growth than we see in the global growth brands. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. And then, Eric, on the Easter impact, what I said in the prepared remarks was that it was about a \u2013 we estimate it to be about a 150 basis point benefit to Q1 room night growth. The impact on, call it, the traditional core OTA side of that is a bit lower. The impact on HomeAway was quite a bit higher than that, and that makes sense given the mix of those two businesses. It's tricky this year because Easter fell on April 1st as you know. And so, some of the stays happened before and some of the stays happened after Easter, so a little trickier to estimate. But those are the numbers that we provided. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll next go to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Alan, I was hoping maybe you could disaggregate a little bit the 240 basis points of incremental marketing cost that we saw on a year-over-year basis this quarter. How much of that should we think of as sales in the form of people out getting new hotels signed up for the platform versus the cost of driving bookings in the quarter? And then, Mark, you made the point that you guys don't give quarterly guidance, but you actually did give pretty specific quarterly guidance back at the beginning of March for EBITDA in Q1 and then came in significantly above the EBITDA guidance that that you gave. Wondering how much of that was the quarter was significantly better than \u2013 or the last a few weeks of the quarter were significantly better than you expected they were going to be at that point? And if that's the case, how much of that momentum has carried forward into Q2? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. So I'll take the second question and then turn it to Alan for the marketing question. That was Alan that said that. It wasn't me, so just to clarify. The fact we did. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: We usually say the same thing. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: We did break our practice because we felt it was appropriate. We saw a combination of things. We did, in the core OTA business, see real legitimate stronger performance \u2013 better revenue performance and more efficient marketing spend and we found that encouraging. We did also, as Alan mentioned, benefit from Easter shifts in \u2013 you pick up a couple of days more than you think you will in stays and it can help as well. So it wasn't all just pure organic goodness, but there was a healthy dose of organic goodness in the results as well. I think, so far, Q2 looks broadly, as Alan said, we are expecting some deceleration on tougher comps and the beginning part of April was a little bit choppy just due to the Easter comps. But we continue to feel good about the overall strength of the business and confident about our full-year guidance. Alan will take on marketing. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yes. And then, Heath, on the marketing bid, if I understood the question correctly, I think the way I would do it is take a look at the numbers ex-trivago, so you can isolate trivago's impact on selling and marketing de-leverage. And then specifically, once you do that if you take a look at the relative growth rates of direct selling and marketing, that's really the category that has all of the real selling and marketing \u2013 performance-based marketing, television advertising, et cetera, that I think you would categorize as what's intended to drive gross bookings. And then, the indirect \u2013 and that was up \u2013 on an ex-trivago basis, was up 15%. The indirect selling and marketing is the people costs and it's not all our lodging partner services team. There's head count for Egencia and for our partner solutions business in there, which I'm not going to get into that level of detail. But that line was up 29% year-over-year and, again, you can kind of get down to the dollar impacts as well. That's probably the way I would tear it apart to kind of answer the question that I think you're after. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I have a couple, if I can. First, just on the supply acquisition effort. Can you give us a sense for how much visibility you have across that process from adding each employee how many hotels they can add, how they perform in meta search when you plug it in, and then conversion rate lifts, repeat rates. Is that a well-worn path where you can project all of this with a good deal of certainty? And how, I guess, are the early innings progressing versus planned? And then, second one, can you give us an update for the HomeAway gross bookings? What percent of those carry traveler fees and what percent also carry host fees? And how is that changing? Are you continuing to book more and more on \u2013 or more away from subscription? And just when do you think your total revenue, as a percent of gross bookings, will start to rise? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Lloyd, I'll take the first one and then turn the second one over to Alan. On the supply efforts, we have good and trying to get to great visibility into the end-to-end process of adding properties, having content build, having marketing campaigns propagated and, ultimately, delivering first booking to properties. So I'd say, good on that upfront. We do have teams working very diligently on giving us better visibility into that and really tracking that like a true manufacturing process. Where we don't yet have great visibility for the properties that we're adding is impact yet on conversion rates and repeat rates. We certainly have the capability to do that, and we have done that historically. And really that's what gave us \u2013 one of the pieces that gave us such great confidence that this was the right strategic direction to go. But we're not yet seeing significant impact on that because it's simply too early, given the rate at which we're adding these properties, but also too early in terms of the traveler frequency cycle or purchase frequency cycle that exists in the travel market. So I'd say we are in early innings here, but, again, the teams are working on getting to a point where we can really demonstrate true operational excellence, and we do have good confidence that we'll see the results in conversion rates and repeat rates that you're referencing. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: And, Lloyd, on the HomeAway question, there's a couple of things. I mean, I probably won't get to the level of detail that you're looking for on this. I think the \u2013 but just directionally, the fact is that a big percentage of the listings, the online bookable listings, are on pay-per-booking on HomeAway, but there's still a big, I call it disproportionate or out-sized percentage of the bookings happening on subscription properties. So for all bookings on the platform there is a traveler service fee, but for a good number of the bookings there still is not a host fee. Those are still coming through subscription and so that will continue to evolve as the business goes forward and as more and more of the business moves over to pay-per-booking. I would say we're kind of in mid innings on that. As regards the blended take rate, I think that we will see some \u2013 the biggest impact there in my mind is just the fact that subscription continues to be a headwind for us. Now it shifted from being both a volume and rate headwind to being essentially just a volume headwind and I think once we kind of fully normalize the subscription side of that business then the take rate can start to normalize. One of the ways that we try to get a little kind of better visibility on the trend there is to look at it on a trailing 12-month basis and/or full-year basis, and so you can see like I think in 2017 the revenue margin for HomeAway was 10.3% or 10.4%, and that's going to come down in 2018, but not substantially. I think it'll be in and around that area. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll go to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Another one on VacationRentals. Given the pressure in performance marketing channels and given the brand strength of your key rival in the space, wondering if you think the multi-brand strategy is in any way a disadvantage. I understand in international regions you have dominant country brands, but let's say in the U.S. when you're looking at VRBO and HomeAway, to what extent is there consumer confusion? To what extent is there property-host confusion? And is this a disadvantage for you when you're up against a single brand with so much power? Thanks so much. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah, listen, I think it's certainly an added degree of complexity operationally. I do think that we are ultimately dividing our marketing spend in terms of brand building across a couple of different brands, if you take the U.S. for example, and that issue does exist around the world. We do, however, have a good loyal customer following for each of these brands, so we do have to be careful in terms of how we treat them. We do have to be careful not to just disregard any of them. But I do think it is a disadvantage in terms of complexity. But so far it has \u2013 it's not been a material deterrent for us growing this business exceptionally well, and we don't expect it'll hold us back, but certainly if we were able to concentrate all of our marketing dollars and all of the customer and supplier-side loyalty in one brand, it would be a simplifier in our life, and I think could be a benefit. Next question, please. Operator : We'll next go to Tom White with D. A. Davidson. Tom White - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just quickly on the EBITDA growth guidance. So, it's affirmed versus what you guys had before despite obviously weaker outlook for trivago. Can you just remind us what you guys had anticipated for trivago? I feel like maybe it was supposed to be breakeven EBITDA, but if you could just clarify that. And then the property supply initiative and the impact on revenue margins, it looked like revenue margins in the core OTA business were up a bit. As you guys look to contract with more hotels, some of which might be kind of big Booking.com customers, do you expect any pressure on revenue margins in order to kind of get in there? Or are those properties kind of eager to have another kind of distribution channel to sort of play against your competitor? Thanks. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Hey, Tom. It's Alan. Yeah, on your first question, I don't want to give the specifics, I mean, we \u2013 they didn't guide that specifically in Q1, nor did we, but we did have a full year loss baked into our guidance for trivago for 2018 on our prior call. The guidance that they gave yesterday is updated and is worse than that what we had assumed. But I don't want to get into the specifics of what we assumed in the Q1 call \u2013 or Q4 call. Sorry. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: And, Tom, just in terms of our supply initiative and our impact on revenue margins, we do not use our revenue margins or discounting them as any sort of competitive weapon generally when we show up to properties. They are eager to have new distribution channels. Our demand footprint, the ability for us to target demand by country, the ability for us to include properties in package paths, which are generally places where our suppliers or new suppliers want to play give us at least a differentiated offering to properties than what our competitor has. So generally they are happy to see us and generally they are happy to pay the market-based prices that we offer for distribution. Next question, please. Operator : We'll next go to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask two. First, there's been a lot of movement in the activity space recently. I was just hoping you could give us a better understanding of how you're positioned there and how it's \u2013 how you're thinking about it in terms of packaging and the shopping cart. And then, secondly, we heard obviously trivago's view of the performance marketing space. I was curious just to get a little better understanding from you in terms of your brands and how you're thinking about profitability targets. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Doug. We feel good about our current position in activities. It is a place where we've highlighted over the course of the last six months or so where we're interested in stepping up our efforts. We do have a things-to-do or activities business that in total is north of $0.5 billion in bookings in Q1. It grew north of 20% year-over-year in terms of transactions. So we've got a big business. It's growing nicely, but we do think there's a lot more we can do. I think inclusion in shopping cart or a shopping cart-type product is certainly something we're looking at as we continue to roll out the functionality of that product. I think there's a big standalone opportunity. I think the fact that our brands have, I think, now over 250 some odd million app downloads, gives us the opportunity to make offers in destination. We've already got the connection with the customer. So we do think there's a world of opportunity here. We feel good about our organic positioning, but there are always M&A opportunities out there and we will be very disciplined in looking at those and we'll be opportunistic. In terms of trivago's view of the performance marketing space and how we're thinking about the profitability targets for our brands, as Alan mentioned, we are on the margin working to be a little bit more disciplined and perhaps an inch more analytically driven in looking at our performance marketing spend and making sure that we, to the best of our ability, are able to concentrate spend in places that we feel are incremental, places where we feel like we can drive good, strong, loyal customer repeat rates and where efficiencies are acceptable. Again it's not a huge C-change for us; it is really on the margin. But we are looking for places to be more efficient, to be sure. Next question, please. Operator : We'll next go to Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on the transition date of the U.S. with Amazon and maybe just give us a sense of your expectation of when the lodging stack gets fully ported over. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. So the transition continues to go well. First of all, the teams are very happy with the transition and are very happy with what it's like to operate in the cloud environment. That said, we are being very deliberate about it. We are not sort of running wild into the cloud. We're making sure we do it in the right way and we continue to make great progress in moving the lodging stack over. We do expect to have the vast majority of it over towards the end of this year, but we are being careful, making sure that we do it in the right way and that we're mindful of costs as we do it. Next question, please. Operator : We'll next go to Naved Khan with SunTrust. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, thank you very much. I had a couple of questions. So, can you just comment on the performance of the inventory you brought over from HomeAway on the Core OTA? And then can you also comment on expectations from maybe potential impact on GDPR rollout in Europe and how we should think about it? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. So the inventory on HomeAway, again, I think we've got over 150,000, 175,000 properties on right now. Predominantly, the experimentation is happening on Brand Expedia points of sale, as well as the other multi-products points of sale : Orbitz, Travelocity, et cetera. It's good. It's not in the grand scheme of things of our business. It's not yet at a point where it's a big driver for us. The teams are continuing to look at ways to optimize and search and optimize for sort order, find those situations, for example, large groups where it's quite obvious that a whole home will be better. So it's still in the early stages, I would say. But we are optimistic that it's going to be a nice driver for us. In terms of GDPR in Europe, from a financial perspective, no meaningful impact operationally. We are working hard to make sure that we are in compliance, and we're certainly well aware of what we need to do. And the teams are diligently going against putting the appropriate infrastructure and safeguards in place. Next question, please. Operator : We'll next go to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a quick follow-up to the one you just answered around HomeAway integration on Expedia. So I think you said you're optimizing for sort order and trying to figure everything out. Would it be helpful if you put more \u2013 why not put more properties on faster? I think you're at 175,000 now and that's relative to the 665,000 in total globally. So that's question one as a follow-up. And just bigger picture, Mark, past three quarters international bookings have been 39-plus-percent of total bookings versus, call it, mid-30s prior. I know you can't put like one thing on it, but can you just talk about the international business? Might just be all hotels here, but how you're investing here and then how you see this play out longer term? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. The gate on putting more properties on faster, honestly, it's largely an operational gate. Yes, Brand Expedia continues to lead the charge in testing user interfaces, but there's also a significant piece of work that needs to be done on the part of the hosts and property manager partners to make sure that we can serve up availability quickly and make sure that the prices that a Brand Expedia customer sees is the prices that they get when they roll through. And some of the complications here include things like a lot of alternative accommodations are used to charging by the week, and we've got to translate that into a daily rate. And there's just a lot of operational stuff that has to happen not only in our Core OTA brands, not only at HomeAway, but also from our partners. So we'll get there. It's just a matter of a lot of sausage-making, as we like to say. In terms of international bookings, one thing to note, particularly, this quarter is foreign exchange is a big tailwind for us. So I think if you look at the FX-neutral numbers, you won't see as much of a significant acceleration. That said, we are pressing internationally. And we do expect that, over time, as we concentrate in our priority markets now here in 2018 and subsequently roll out more groups of priority markets where we go in and work to essentially build a hugely competitive product both for suppliers and customers, that we should be able to deliver better growth rates, international bookings, also international room nights. And we would hope that we're able to do it in a way that delivers better marketing efficiencies for us over time, because we're just able to garner more overall brand loyalty. Next question, please. Operator : We'll next go to Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on the supply efforts and building the Lodging Partner Services team. I guess the question is, Mark, as you look kind of the plan for the year, where are you now in your plan of your overall hiring for the year? Should we still expect a significant step-up in that in the back half of the year to hit your hiring goals? And then as we go into next year, by the time you get through 2018, will you have scaled that team enough or should we think of this as \u2013 sort of this as an ongoing process as we see the opportunity to continue to add more bodies and more properties in 2019 and 2020 and beyond? And the second one on free cash flow conversion. Understanding free cash flow temporarily compressed by headquarters and cloud integration, duplicative costs, how do you think about free cash flow conversion potential as you get into 2019 and 2020 and start to realize the benefits of the cloud and you get rid of some of these one-time and duplicative costs? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: So, Brian, on the supply efforts, there are two, call it, bodies of work here. One is a significant ramp-up in our priority markets where we're hiring up hundreds of new folks, both salespeople, but operational people. In that regard, we're largely done hiring those folks, if not nearly completely done. And I think we've said that this overall supply investment is in the ballpark of $50 million or so, and that'll be the impact this year. And this is a big push for us. In the grand scheme of our expense base, it's not a massive investment, but it is a significant investment. So that's bucket number one. Bucket number two is we are still acquiring properties at a much more, call it, measured pace in other parts of the market and there is some, I would just say, ordinary course head count growth in those markets. Nothing as dramatic or significant as we see in the priority markets. In terms of 2019, again, we are watching very closely the results of this effort, and we'll make a call towards the end of 2018 in terms of what we do in terms of incremental head count growth. But I would reiterate that, again in the grand scheme of our overall expense base and the grand scheme of our overall, I think pretty consistent approach to how we balance long-term growth and short-term growth and the way that we're generally gearing this business to be able to deliver nice solid earnings growth in the near-term and also invest in the long-term. I wouldn't necessarily take comments that we might make around further investments and supply head count is necessarily indicating that we're going to depress our overall earnings growth because of it. So, again, we do believe in this. We are likely to continue on this path, but I wouldn't take it as a sign that we're going to accept lower earnings growth than we have historically. Alan, do you want to take the... Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah, so on the free cash flow conversion relative to EBITDA, I mean, I'm not going to get specific here in terms of numbers. I think that we have the opportunity to have a very healthy conversion rate here in this business, and there's a few factors to consider. I mean I guess to the \u2013 we've got the headquarters, which we've talked at length about. For 2019 and 2020, those are going to be significant expenditures, so they will have an impact all-in on free cash flow. But we've got some other things happening. One is that HomeAway will increasingly be a generator of free cash flow as their gross bookings grow. Our merchant hotel business continues to grow pretty much ratably with the agency hotel business, and so that generates significant free cash flow. And so all of those factors lead to healthy trends. There are some other things on the other side of that ledger. I mean, one is that we've got businesses that we're growing that don't have those same working-capital tailwinds like trivago, like our private-label business, like Egencia, where they're a little bit more traditional businesses that generate receivables and consume working capital as opposed to having the negative working capital cycle in our merchant hotel business. The last couple of things would be we've got our \u2013 we do have a tax-rate benefit which I talked about on the call which should help us over the long term and, as we mentioned on the call last quarter, our data center CapEx in terms of what we would have needed to spend on data centers relative to what we will need spend in the cloud, or after we're in the cloud, has come down substantially. So that's a tailwind as well. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll go to Mark May with Citi. Mark A. May - Citi Investment Research : Thank you. First, in terms of optimizing direct marketing spend, I assume there that you're referring mostly to Meta. I guess one of the questions would be your plans to possibly reallocate that to other channels, including maybe more brand marketing. And then I know that HomeAway seems like a lot of focus. Certainly, the commentary is around pushing the pedal on marketing side. When it comes to supply growth, a lot of their commentary has been, I think, more on the traditional lodging and outside the U.S. I guess my question is, HomeAway listing growth, is that a priority for you? Some of the data would suggest that it's been relatively slow recently. Is that for your own doing? Or are there other factors driving that? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. I'd say the direct marketing spend, again, this is not a big thing. We are, on the margin, trying to optimize a little bit more intelligently. It's not just on Meta. It's across the board, whether it's display or retargeting or traditional search. It really is sort of a broader, just \u2013 again, just focus on really digging in analytically and figuring out are we happy or not with efficiencies and is there opportunity to do, again, an inch better. I think that there is always an opportunity for us to reallocate into brand marketing but, again, we've been doing brand marketing across the portfolio for a very long time, and the teams that are the big brand marketing teams are really quite sophisticated at it, and we look at brand marketing spend as a largely a discrete decision, and so I wouldn't assume that we take out from one and directly put into another. We're always looking at the best places to put our capital across the P&L. In terms of HomeAway's focused on the marketing side, they've been focused, I really think on actually two things. One is building performance and also their brand marketing capabilities, but also just improving the product overall, both on the customer side and the host side. Listing growth has not been the big priority for them. It's really been about taking the existing base of business that they have and doing a better job for partners and for customers and, as a result, being able to monetize the platform better. That said, despite the fact that they're not actively looking to do it, hosts and properties and listings just keep flowing in. I mean if you look at the listing count from Q4 and you compare it to the end of Q1, I think there's about 100,000 more listings that are available all online bookable. So the platform has gravitational force. They're not actively trying to do it. There will be a phase at some point here over the next couple of years where listing acquisition does become a priority both in the U.S., but I think increasingly in international markets. And all signs say that that could be a nice catalyst for HomeAway. But, again, it's not been a focus for them at this point. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to Mark Okerstrom for any additional or closing remarks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Great. Well, obviously, thanks so much to all of you for your interest in Expedia Group. And a big thanks to our awesome employees around the world, a solid start, but there's lots of hard work and execution ahead of us and certainly we're looking forward to going after it. So thank you. Operator : That concludes today's conference, and thank you for your participation.",

(EXPE) Q2 2018 Earnings Call July 26, 2018 Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Expedia Group Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Senno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Michael Senno - Expedia Group, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to Expedia Group's financial results conference call for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Mark Okerstrom, Expedia Group's CEO and President; and Alan Pickerill, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 26, 2018 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking. Typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release which is posted on the company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com and I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content including today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. One additional item to note, starting last quarter, we are presenting financial results both for Expedia Group in total and excluding trivago in order to provide increased transparency on the underlying performance of our transactional businesses. You'll find reconciliations for non-GAAP measures excluding trivago in our earnings release. Finally, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable efforts. These items include, but are not limited to, foreign-exchange, returns on investment, spending and acquisition-related or restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on the GAAP results for the guidance period. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. As we sit here halfway through the year, I am pleased with our progress thus far. We've delivered solid financial results while continuing to push forward on several critical initiatives aligned with the three strategic themes I outlined late last year, becoming more locally relevant on a global basis, becoming more customer-centric, and speeding up the pace of execution and innovation. And although it's still early days in our transformation, I am pleased to say that we are making great strides along our new path. Looking forward, though our industry remains highly dynamic, we are increasingly confident in our execution capabilities and are optimistic about the opportunities they can unlock for us in this $1.6 trillion market. Turning to the second quarter, gross bookings increased 13%, revenue grew 11% and adjusted EBITDA was up a very healthy 18%. Overall room nights grew 12% year-over-year and smoothing of the impact from the shift in Easter timing, first half total lodging stayed room nights grew 14%. HomeAway continued to deliver strong results, increasing stayed room nights 35% in the first half of 2018. All told, we have great momentum heading into the back half of the year. Our brand teams are making good progress in better optimizing direct marketing spend and that was evident in the balance between healthy room night growth and profitability in the second quarter. We plan to keep leveraging our data-driven approach to marketing optimization, while at the same time continue to aggressively drive our global expansion agenda. As we strive to become more locally relevant on a global basis, we continue to build momentum on the property acquisition front, adding over 60,000 new properties to our global lodging portfolio in the quarter, excluding HomeAway listings. That number includes a further acceleration in the pace of property acquisition in our priority markets, where we are firmly in execution mode, and we are seeing encouraging early signs in our performance. Collectively, in these markets, on a booked basis, both total and domestic room night growth accelerated in the second quarter. We're optimistic that the momentum we are seeing in these markets will continue to build as we move through the year and into 2019. In addition to the 60,000 newly-acquired properties in the quarter, we also integrated an additional 20,000 HomeAway listings into our core lodging platform, bringing our total property count available to all Expedia Group brands to more than 750,000 as at the end of the quarter. Overall, we remain on track to directly add at least 180,000 new properties to the core platform in 2018 in addition to integrating more HomeAway properties throughout the year. HomeAway ended the quarter with over 1.7 million online bookable listings, an increase of about 20% from last year. Over 800,000 of them are now instantly bookable. We do expect the continued shift to instant bookability to be a nice tailwind to conversion over time, further enhancing the HomeAway marketplace. The HomeAway team has been ramping up the velocity of innovation on both sides of the platform. Over the past few quarters, they've rolled out an impressive lineup of industry-leading supplier-facing tools and it's helping our partners optimize the productivity of their listings. We continue to be very happy with the progress at HomeAway. They're making incredible strides in their transformation and, in doing so, are positioning HomeAway and Expedia Group very well to capitalize on the significant global opportunity in alternative accommodations. Gross bookings growth at Egencia accelerated to 18% in the quarter and stayed room nights grew 21%, their highest growth in nearly two years. The sales team at Egencia continues to produce strong results, signing over $460 million of new business for another quarterly record. So we're seeing good returns from the investments we've made in the team. With nice momentum in sales and a differentiated product offering, we believe Egencia has a significant opportunity to continue to gain share in the managed corporate travel market for a long time to come. trivago continued to face difficult comps and challenges in the second quarter as it navigates changes to the dynamics in its marketplace. As the trivago team highlighted yesterday, they are now taking a more-balanced approach to trade-offs between top-line growth and profitability with more of a bent towards profitability than in the past. Combined with easing comps, trivago expects adjusted EBITDA results to improve in the second half of the year. Overall, the lots of hard work remains, we have made good progress in the first half of the year. We are executing at a much-improved level and are gaining traction with our key initiatives all aimed at positioning Expedia Group for healthy growth well into the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We, again, posted healthy top-line trends in the second quarter with lodging revenue, including both hotel and HomeAway up 14% on stayed room night growth of 12%. As we expected, total lodging room night growth decelerated from the first quarter, primarily due to a headwind from the shift in Easter timing and difficult year-over-year comparisons, which were, in part, driven by more aggressive marketing spend in last year's quarter. Excluding HomeAway, revenue per room night increased 1%, compared to average daily rate growth of approximately 5%. That gap was over 100-basis-points smaller than last quarter and we expect that to continue to narrow slightly in the second half of the year. HomeAway grew both gross bookings and stayed room nights 33% in the quarter, with revenue increasing 32%. Transaction revenue growth remained robust at over 60% and accounted for over 80% of HomeAway's revenue for the first time in the second quarter. Subscription revenue declined 25%, roughly in line with our expectations for the year. HomeAway showed nice leverage on overall costs and posted very strong adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, almost doubling year-over-year to $78 million. In addition to lapping some of last year's hiring increases, the cost leverage was primarily related to slower growth and marketing expenses than recent quarters. After building out our performance marketing function last year, we continue to refine and improve our capabilities and gain more data-driven insights. With a fully-functioning marketing platform and team now in place, we are also better able to optimize our spend to appropriately balance top-line growth and profitability, which we did nicely in Q2. I would note that as we continue to refine our performance marketing capabilities at HomeAway and comp against the ramp-up in marketing investments over the last year, we do anticipate some continued deceleration in gross bookings growth as we move through the year. Overall, HomeAway remains on track for very healthy top and bottom line growth in 2018. Total advertising and media revenue decreased 9% for the quarter due to significant declines at trivago. Our Media Solutions business delivered another quarter of solid double-digit growth. Air revenue was up 10% on a 6% increase in air tickets sold, 4% growth in revenue per ticket. Similar to last quarter, air revenue growth benefited from the reclassification of distribution fees from contra revenue to cost of revenue and the reclassification of certain customer refunds from air revenue to insurance. These changes took effect in the first quarter and we'll have an impact for the rest of 2018 although they are neutral to our overall profitability. Other revenue increased 16% in the second quarter, largely reflecting continued growth in travel insurance. Adjusted expense growth decelerated across each category and drove consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points. In line with our expectation for the full year, cost of revenue grew faster than revenue in the quarter. The accounting change I mentioned earlier related to air distribution fees contributed around 150 basis points to the growth while cloud expenses added about 250 basis points. We continue to make good progress migrating our lodging stack to the cloud, balancing speed with prudent cost management and a seamless customer experience. As we've moved through the year, we've developed greater capabilities to more dynamically optimize costs. As a result of these efforts, our 2018 cloud expenses are tracking a bit below the $170 million we previously discussed. Looking ahead to 2019, our early estimates, which are subject to change, call for total cloud spend to be over $250 million balanced by a nice offset in free cash flow in the form of avoided data center CapEx. In addition, we expect cloud expenses to continue to be split roughly 60/40 between cost of revenue and technology and content, similar to the past several quarters. Total selling and marketing expenses increased 7% with direct expenses up just 5% for the second quarter. We have an easy comparison to the 30% increase in direct expenses in the second quarter of 2017 as we made aggressive marketing investment decisions across several brands last year. In addition, we continue to make progress on optimizing direct marketing spend as we strive to deliver incremental quality top-line growth, although we do begin to lap some of those benefits here in the third quarter. Indirect selling and marketing growth also moderated as we lapped the initial investments in the sales team at Egencia. Growth does remain elevated given the increased head count associated with our supply initiative and we expect that to remain the case for the rest of the year. In total, we now expect total adjusted selling and marketing expenses to grow in line with or slightly slower than revenue for the full year. Technology and content expenses were up 19% in the second quarter. Inorganic impact from acquisitions and our cloud migration contributed a total of over 450 basis points to that growth. We expect technology and content expense growth to reaccelerate slightly in the second half of the year as we continue to invest in our e-commerce platform and product innovation across the organization. As expected, growth in general and administrative expenses slowed significantly compared to last quarter as we started to lap last year's staffing increases, notably at trivago and HomeAway. The second quarter marks the last of any meaningful inorganic impact from recent acquisitions, which added over 200 basis points to G&A growth in the quarter. We continue to anticipate growth in general and administrative expenses to moderate further in the second half of 2018, though we now expect that growth to be roughly in line with revenue growth for the full year. This slightly higher than planned G&A expense growth largely stems from operating in an increasingly dynamic global tax and regulatory environment. Moving down the income statement, depreciation expense growth continued to slow, increasing 12% in the quarter in part due to benefit from lower data center related CapEx. We also saw leverage on net interest expense and our adjusted tax rate came in at 16% for the quarter as we benefited from the lower U.S. corporate tax rate. All of that added up to very robust adjusted earnings per share growth of 55%. We expect adjusted EPS to grow faster than adjusted EBITDA for the rest of the year. On the capital allocation front, year-to-date, we've returned a total of over $540 million to shareholders, including over $450 million in share repurchases at an average price of just under $112. Our year-to-date repurchase total is already higher than any full year amount since 2014. We also recently raised our dividend for the seventh consecutive year. Going forward, we intend to maintain the same balanced approach to capital deployment, opportunistic M&A and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and our dividend. Turning to our financial expectations for the year. We are increasing our full year guidance range and now expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of 7% to 12%. That growth would be 300 to 400 basis points higher, excluding cloud. Note that while we are pleased with our results to this point, we still have a lot of work to do with more than 100% of our dollar growth in adjusted EBITDA ahead of us in the second half of the year. We have strong operational momentum and believe we are well positioned to continue delivering healthy top-line and profit growth in the near-term, while investing in key initiatives to drive sustained growth over the long-term. With that, operator, we're ready to take our first question. Operator : Certainly. And we'll take our first question from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. First, on marketing spend, is the industry getting more efficient? And is that helping your overall returns on marketing? How are the ROIs going? And how do you feel about that right now? And then, second, HomeAway, it looks like bookings did decelerate. You called that out. How are you choosing between spending on marketing to try to drive that bookings growth versus driving profitability? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Justin. In terms of marketing efficiency, listen, there has been no secret that some of the large players in the industry, ourselves included, have been pulling back, and I think cooling off some of the auction heat that may have been taking place previously. I would also say that just from an Expedia Group perspective, the level of sophistication that we've got now in terms of really applying to modern data science techniques, leveraging a lot of the capabilities that we've got by moving a lot of our data infrastructure up into the cloud, has just allowed us to be a lot smarter in the way that not only that we're bidding for traffic, but also in the way that we're able to really understand what traffic is incremental. So I think it's a combination of a couple of things. I think also that we're in an industry where the real big brands, the brands that consumers care about and have got experience with, are starting to mean something. And I think that, as a result, can lead to more traffic shifting over to direct-branded channels, whether they're through apps or whether as a result of branded marketing. In terms of HomeAway, listen, I wouldn't read too much in the slowdown in gross bookings or Alan's guidance that we would expect some deceleration. I think, largely, it's a comps issue and we're trying to maintain a balanced approach. And I would just put your attention to the long-term opportunity. As a reminder, the phase one of HomeAway that we're in right now is really about transitioning the business from an offline listings business to an eCommerce business. We have not been focused on international expansion. We have not been focused on acquiring new listings, although we have acquired hundreds of thousands since the acquisition. And since last quarter, we had 100,000 new listings sign up with us, that's really going after that. And phase two is really about that. It's about international expansion. It's about property acquisition. It's about moving into the urban opportunity. And that's all ahead of us. So we feel very comfortable with trajectory of HomeAway and really what you see here is just the team tuning its muscles around making the right trade-offs here in phase one. Justin Post - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. Alan, for you, calling out there on the cloud. I want to understand, investors ask us all the time sort of how we should think about cloud spending versus benefits from cloud migration playing out as we move through this year and into next year. Is there any framing you can give around the way investors should think about that? And, Mark, a good solid commentary on the pace of investing in inventory. How should investors be thinking about the investments in inventory leading to either higher marketing efficiency, better conversion, faster growth in terms of room nights? What should we be watching for, for how that plays out over the next sort of 12 months to 18 months? Thanks, guys. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Eric, thanks. I would say on the cloud side, I mean, we've talked a little bit about some of these data points already. If you look at our data center CapEx spend in 2016, it was about $180 million. It went down to about $50 million in 2017, and that's the actual decline. We are, obviously, avoiding additional CapEx as well. I've talked to you in the past about the fact that before we had made the decision to migrate to the cloud, we were on the cusp of having to make decisions around building out additional data centers. That's all been taken off the table and avoided as is. And so, we are already seeing, I think, pretty good trade-offs in avoided CapEx relative to what we're spending for compute in the cloud. On top of that, there's just a ton of operational benefits associated with it. The speed is much better, latency reduced, the ability to deploy code very quickly, the ability to test algorithms and roll out algorithms is much better in the cloud. The disaster recovery is much, much better with cloud, where if you have a \u2013 we already had a situation where we had a brownout on Brand Expedia, we were able to roll it out into the cloud, seamlessly roll it back once the issue had been resolved. So there's a ton of operational benefits as well, but we like it both from a total cash flow over time perspective. And then, from a product perspective, we think it's a no-brainer. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Great. And then, I'll take the one on inventory. There's basically a two-leg benefit here that you see. Step one is as you acquire the new properties, you're entering new auctions and performance marketing channels. Generally, what you see in that phase is you see an acceleration in room night growth for the markets that you're going after. The second phase in it, however, is once you start to get better density of properties, you do see higher repeat rates. You do see more customer loyalty. And with that, comes, generally, higher conversion rates and better marketing efficiency. We're not expecting to see that second phase in a particularly noticeable manner here in year one. It is something that in years two and three we would expect to see particularly in, of course, our priority markets that we're focused on this year. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks so much. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I have two. Just going back to the supply initiative, I wanted to talk a little about sort of the incremental investment from here. You talked about sort of pushing into your target market and seeing good early results. Can you just talk us through a little bit sort of the \u2013 what you think about incremental investment in the supply initiative as you go into 2019? And then sort of the similar question around Away, and Away profitability is very strong in the quarter. Mark, you talked a little bit about kind of phase two. How should we think about the timing of when you decide to push into phase two and start investing more in HomeAway? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Brian. In terms of incremental investment in the supply initiative, I would just say that the way that we're operating based upon the results we've seen so far is really the new normal. As opposed to taking a more distributed approach to our supply acquisition and a more metered approach, I would just say the expectation from here on in is we will take a more concentrated approach, not only to just supply acquisition but this whole thing is under the umbrella of this concept of locally relevant on a global basis. So on our wave-one markets, the big push here is around acquiring supply, because we do believe that we had a reasonably large gap versus the next competitor in these markets. But as we look out into future waves, in some cases, it's not going to be a supply centric. In some cases, it's going to be a more concerted effort and maybe not incremental resources, but a concentration of resources into things like translation, payment types, content, et cetera. So, as we look out into 2019, we're going to be looking through the back part of this year around what are going to be our priority markets, where are we going to invest, and based upon those decisions, it'll dictate where in terms of focus areas \u2013 in terms of functional focus areas the investments will go, whether it's again property acquisition or one of these other levers. The good news, though, is that of course we've already got a pretty significant investment sitting here in our 2018 base, and so this one-time big step-up, even if we do another significant investment next year is going against what will be at that point easier comps. And secondly, with the step-up, again, the big benefit, as I responded to Eric, is really in the second year. And so the expectation is that we'll start to see some of the benefits of our big push this year flow through in the second year, and that will, in effect, start to fund some of the investments that we'll be making in future waves. In terms of HomeAway and timing, listen, I think we're going to do what I think we've done historically, which is try to strike the right balance. That's what we are doing here in 2018 and I think we'll see as things go through we haven't done our 2019 planning yet, and again the HomeAway team is very focused on getting phase one here nailed and they're doing a great job, by the way, and then as we move through the back part of this year, we'll start to think about what comes next and what parts of phase two do we really start getting serious about in 2019. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome, next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thanks. I think, Mark, you mentioned that room night growth accelerated in some of the priority markets. Can you tell us what learnings you're getting from those markets that you could apply to the non-priority markets to get room night growth to accelerate there, or why is room night growth \u2013 what did you do to get room night growth accelerated in those markets? Was that just the lodging procurement? And then that HomeAway EBITDA margin you had in the quarter, that looked pretty positive, is there something that tells you that you want to sustain it at that level? I know you're bouncing as you just talked about growth and profitability there, but do you feel like you've reached, after a lot of investment, a new level there that you could work up from there? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mark. I'll take number one and turn number two over to our trustee, CFO. In terms of room night growth acceleration, listen, we talk a lot about the supply acquisition side of this, but of course in these markets, we're also making sure that we've got content right, payment types right, et cetera., it is really the whole package. The investment, though, is in these markets pretty concentrated into supply. But, of course, we're also just trying to build just much more significant cross-platform operational rigor so that we can shrink the time from a time when a property gets added to the time that it's live on the site and the time that it's actually marketed in metasearch and search engine marketing channels. So it's really a whole host of things that we're doing. This is built, by the way, on the back of years of hard work in terms of getting our supply acquisition machine into shape, getting our customer experience into shape, being multi-currency, multi-language, building great landing page development capabilities, and of course developing much better online marketing capabilities. And really what we're doing now is just executing across the board on an end-to-end basis, all of those discrete basis, functions in a much more coordinated and, I'd say, operationally rigorous way. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. And then, Mark, on HomeAway, I think, first of all, I would just remind you it's a hyper seasonal business, so I wouldn't necessarily look at the margin in one quarter and kind of use that as a proxy for ongoing margins. The vast, the big chunk of adjusted EBITDA that they will earn will come in Q3, which results in some fluctuation, seasonal fluctuations in margins throughout the year. I don't think we're set yet on exactly what the normalized margin ought to be for HomeAway. I think we're happy with the margin they delivered in 2017, we're happy with what we expect that to look like in 2018. We think that the opportunity is such that we can grow the top line at healthy rates. Use some of that to invest in the business, deliver healthy profits and profit growth, but some of that's going to depend on specific decisions that we make as we move forward. As Mark mentioned, as we get through the 2019 planning, we'll look at some of these initiatives and make some decisions about what the right investment levels are. We have talked historically about how we think there is probably no reason that a business like HomeAway couldn't deliver EBITDA margins that look something like the EBITDA margins that you see at a hotel-only OTA, but I wouldn't put a pin in that. That's a directional aspiration and we'll see how things pan out over time. But we \u2013 to be honest, we don't spend a ton of time tearing it apart because we're confident that we will deliver healthy margins for HomeAway. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. And I would just add, too, that, again, we're not focused particularly strongly on margins. We're really looking to drive adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and adjusted EPS growth for a long period of time and we're really trying to strike the best balance to get a sustained growth rate to be deliverable over the long-term. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Alan. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions. First, as you guys optimize the performance marketing channels over the last several quarters, have you noticed any meaningful changes in the booking window or whether it's expansion or contraction? And how does that play into the stayed room night growth during the last couple of quarters? And then the second question, Alan, were there any FX impact on the guidance? I know the U.S. dollar significantly reversed course. I was wondering if the guidance would've been better if not for the U.S. dollar appreciation. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: So, Deepak, just on the booking window piece, we do see some ebbs and flows, less so associated with our performance marketing movements and actually more so just in terms of the mix of our business. And there's a couple of mix factors that move it around. I think, first of all, HomeAway generally has a longer book to stay window. They're generally looking at larger homes, and even when they're not larger homes, they're taking bookings into places that don't have 20 rooms or don't have 100 rooms, they simply have one. So people are more likely to book that further in advance so that they make sure that they get the place that they want to stay. So as the mix of our lodging room nights between HomeAway and the core lodging business ebbs and flows, you could see a lengthening of the window, particularly at certain parts of the year. The second thing is that as we push more into the domestic markets in a number of these countries like the priority markets that we're in right now, it does open up the opportunity for local travel to happen on a much more significant basis of our overall mix. And in many cases, local travel is more last minute booking. It's weekend trips, for example, where you're driving somewhere or you're taking a short flight as opposed to the overall mix of our business that has traditionally skewed a little bit more to the international side. So just a couple of things to keep in mind. Again, we're not seeing anything super significant right now, but, over time, we can imagine these types of things take hold. Alan, do you want to take the FX one? Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure, yeah. Deepak, so on FX, yeah, I mean, I think you're right to point it out. The fact is that FX has been a helper in the first part of the year here, although the dollar has strengthened more recently. And so the amount that we estimate it to help us for full year 2018 has come down relative to when we guided earlier this year. It's one of many factors considered as we put the full forecast together, but you're right to point out directionally, that it has become less of a tailwind than we thought. And at current rates, it looks like it kind of crosses over here kind of July-August timeframe, and becomes kind of neutral to a slight headwind in the back half of the year. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen & Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. So you had a pretty substantial 400 basis points headwind to the core hotel revenue from lower revenue take rates. Can you call out the key factors driving that headwind? And it looks like it's going to improve a little bit in the back half, but how do you see it over the longer-term? Thanks. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah, so as I said my prepared remarks, the gap between \u2013 in the hotel business itself, or the business \u2013 I should say the business excluding HomeAway, the gap between ADRs and revenue per room night was still there. It was a narrower gap than we had last quarter, although the comp got a little bit easier. I mean, we've said essentially we are seeing that gap in the 200 to 400-basis-point range. As a reminder, the factors that contribute there are when we have taken \u2013 historically, when we have taken changes to our margins and annualizing those changes as we add new properties in new markets and we add them at the revised lower rates, that can blend the mix down as well, although that we look at as being new business. So still all gravy. The loyalty programs are an impact, a weight on revenue per room night. We think of it largely as a marketing channel, but the accounting rules require us to show it as contra revenue, so that has been there as the loyalty programs have grown. A few other factors play in there. FX can play in. Expedia-funded discounts and coupons, refunds and cancellations, those things all play into it as well. Ultimately, for this year, we're comfortable in the 200 basis point to 400 basis point range. And then, as we move forward into 2019 and beyond, we'll kind of reassess the factors that are contributing there. The one thing I should say is that we do get questions from time to time about whether just an ongoing push by hotel chains to try to get lower commission rates or economics will play into this. We're not looking at it like that. We reset our commission rates purposely over the course of the last number of years. We think we're currently at very fair rates and giving good value for the economics that we get. And so, we don't see that as something that will pressure those rates going forward. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's great. Thanks so much, Alan. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : Next, we'll hear from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I have two on the add-on program. It looks really interesting and very differentiated. So just starting with the first one, it's probably early, but what are you seeing in terms of just early uptake there? Are you seeing a lift in attach rate on hotel? And do you have a sense for how much of that is incremental versus just a shift in how people are booking? And then, I guess, the second one on the same topic would be as you run these programs, we understand they're mostly net rate programs, but wondering if that's a drag on take rates at all or unit economics, and maybe give us a sense of what percentage of hotel partners are participating in that program. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Lloyd. Listen, it's early, but early indications are very solid. We're seeing higher customer attach rates and essentially higher room night growth than otherwise we would have seen. So we think that it is at least in part incremental, but it's really hard for us to get conclusive on that. What we do know, which is what you called out, it's a highly-differentiated product. It blends two wonderful things about brand Expedia, which is the convenience of having everything all in one place, so if you change plans where things move around, you've got one, quote, travel agent to deal with and they can solve all your problems. And, secondly, it does result in overall lower cost of travel, which, of course, travelers absolutely, absolutely love. In terms of take rates, we don't see this as a significant driver of deteriorating unit economics. We're not going to get into the specifics of how all of this works. I would just say that we've had a very successful package product for a very long period of time, and this is an alteration on the traditional package. In terms of hotel participation, listen, one of the things that hotels, lodging partners generally love about the Expedia Group platform is that it is incredibly targetable. And this gives our hotels the ability, to in a very specifically-fenced way, to target customers not out in the open but to target customers that we know are going to a certain place with a special deal. And so, the hotels that participate, which is the vast majority of them, I think are finding it to be a great program, just like they have our traditional package program. Generally, when hotels get booked with a flight or something else, you get lower cancelation rates, you get longer lengths of stay, and that's generally a great thing for our hotel partners. So, again, it's very early. We like it because it's differentiated both on the customer side of the platform and on the partner side of the platform and it delivers great value to both of them. So we're optimistic about what it can do for us. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks for taking my questions. The HomeAway transaction commissions that continue to improve, are you starting to see a higher mix of paid-per listings and, if so, is that being driven more by individual owners or professional property managers? And then I guess on the comment in the release that travelers on HomeAway grew over 40% year-to-year, is there any way to unpack that on how many of that growth was driven by members with new profiles? Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yes, we'll try to be helpful, Jed, I don't think we're going to get to the level of detail that you're looking for. I think, on the listings, it's fair to say that we are seeing \u2013 in terms of actual listings, we're seeing an ongoing shift from subscription to pay-per booking that's been going on for a while. I think I mentioned last quarter, it remains true now that in spite of that we still do have a disproportionate SKU of bookings to the subscription products, and that is to be expected as we \u2013 or listings as we move through this transition. And so that's kind of ongoing. I don't have the data on \u2013 and I'm not sure we would share it, either, on how many of the members were members with new profiles. I don't know, Mark, if you would... Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Well, I would just say that we continue to believe that on both sides of the platform we're getting, obviously you can see it, we're getting many more hosts sign up to the platform based upon our traffic growth and our transaction growth. We think we're getting significantly stronger traveler growth as well. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And then I guess just to follow-up on the property manager comment on the outside growth or the SKU, I mean, how much of that is being driven by property managers, say, with over thousands of bookings on HomeAway \u2013 thousands of listings on HomeAway? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah, I don't think we want to get into that level of detail. Yeah, I mean, I would just say that, generally, the large property managers are the ones that are generally more likely and were some of the earlier adopters to online bookability and to essentially commission-based pay-per booking listings with the individual owners, particularly have large homes, generally preferring or sticking around for the longest time on the subscription model. But it really is a pretty dynamic environment right now with the changes that HomeAway is making to their marketplace, the incentives are constantly shifting, and the performance that property owners and property managers can get from being in the pay-per performance model are increasing over time, and so we expect to continue to see a continued shift across essentially all host categories. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Naved Khan from SunTrust. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, thanks a lot. Just a couple. So was there any impact from the World Cup or GDPR on the room nights? And as we think about the back half, what's the right way to think about room night growth given that the first half was maybe a bit noisy? And then I had a follow-up. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah, so we've talked about this in the past. I mean, when you have big events like this, it could be the Olympics, it could be the World Cup, sometimes it's natural disasters, there are changes in travel patterns. We do think when you have an event as large as the World Cup, you do see a situation where a decent percentage of the population is preoccupied with that event and so you may see overall booking slow a bit during a certain period of time, but usually we would expect that to come back in the form of pent-up demand, and ultimately, we don't think it has anything to do with kind of the longer-term trajectory of the business or anything we're doing strategically. And I should say, too, when you have the event in a particular region or country, in this case, Russia, you do see a pickup in travel into that location as well. As far as thinking about room night growth in the back half of the year, we're not going to get into the specifics. I would say there are a couple of things to consider. One of them is that we will continue with this effort to optimize marketing spend. Now I want to be clear that the effort there, first and foremost, is to root out marketing spend that we can test for and decide is not incremental. And if we're right, then when we don't make that spend, a decent portion of that volume still comes to us. Because by definition what we're trying to do is take out spend for room nights we would've gotten anyway. We probably do lose a little bit around the edges though, around the margins. So we think that could have an impact on room night growth. In terms of the contribution from priority markets, I think Mark mentioned earlier, first and foremost, we're going to look for the result of room night growth in total and for domestic travel in our priority markets and just monitor how that's impacting those markets. At what point it gets big enough to move the needle on the whole business, we're not entirely sure, but we're not counting on a big impact in the back half of the year. And then the last factor I would probably throw out there is just, as a reminder, we had some tough storms in the back half of 2017. That negative impact was more skewed towards EBITDA than it was room night growth because what happens in those storms is you end up with a lot of cancellations and refunds you're giving customers for room nights that you booked and you actually had in the system. So bigger impact on profits than it had on the room night growth, but could provide a minor tailwind in the back half of the year. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. So, I guess, can you give us some additional color on the move to Progressive Web App for Brand Expedia just on the hotel side? How much of the traffic was on this PWA previously and what are the benefits that you may have seen? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. So we've now essentially got the whole hotel piece or at least hotel shopping for Brand Expedia on the Progressive Web App in terms of mobile. And we are really ramping it up through the first \u2013 actually really throughout the quarter. And really the benefits, the biggest benefits we see are largely in respect to just the speed. So particularly, in places outside of the U.S. where we had latency issues, speed is significantly faster. And then it really is just, it's a coding framework which allows us to really start to get closer to giving app-like experiences in mobile web experiences. And so that's harder for us to measure now, but it is something we expect will give us benefits over a long time to come. And we are now building more functionality and will be building more of the other lines of business and more of our applications onto the PWA app as well. So we can expect that to give more benefits for us as we move through this year and into 2019. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great, thanks a lot. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo securities. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. A couple on brand, if I could. Mark, in the past you've talked about the power of the Expedia brands and the percent of traffic and bookings that come to you directly. Just wondering if you're able to offer a little color on how that might vary across the family on the core brands versus the regional brands versus HomeAway and VRBO and whether you're seeing any impact in the market from the increased brand marketing efforts of some your close competitors. And then just a quick follow-up on the cloud. You spoke earlier about the operational benefits. Is there any way to offer us any sort of quantification on improvement you might expect in terms of conversion, whether it's five bps here, 10 bps there, or any sort of quantification that could help us understand these operational benefits? Thank you very much. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah, you're welcome. So in terms of the power of the Expedia brands, again, the brands in our portfolio, we think, are really amongst, if not, the world-leading brands in travel, many of them, such as Expedia, Hotels.com, have literally had billions of dollars of brand spend, spent to build up customer loyalty in addition to just giving customers great experiences over the long history of those brands. There is variations across the family and a lot of the variation really comes down to how aggressively we're pushing international expansion, because in the more mature markets, where you've got a fully locally-relevant product, you really generally have a significantly larger portion of your business that comes to you directly. So think about Brand Expedia U.S., Hotels.com U.S., Orbitz U.S., Travelocity U.S., are really getting the lion's share of their business through direct and branded channels, such as direct type-in or the mobile applications, or e-mail, et cetera. But as you move further away from your more mature markets and you get into markets, which you are sort of in a growth phase for or new markets, the percentage of direct branded traffic goes down and really the game is to build locally-relevant products in each of these markets. And when you do that, really start to push more of that traffic to come to you via branded channels and more direct. I'd say in terms of competitor activity, it is not a major change. I mean, we have seen, over the course of the last particularly five or six years, various players come in and out of television advertising. If you take the U.S., for example, you saw over the course of the last five years trivago come in very significantly, essentially backed by us. You saw Orbitz and Travelocity pulled back. You saw Booking.com come in in, I think, first 2013. And then, you saw TripAdvisor come in and pulled back, so it's always been a very dynamic environment. But for us, I think television advertising, brand spend, it's always been a key part of our formula, and we're just going to keep doing our things. And we think our capabilities, there are \u2013 really have the potential for us to really differentiate ourselves. Not only in the U.S., where it has been, but as we increasingly become locally-relevant in a lot of these other markets, also bringing our expertise globally. In terms of the cloud operational benefits, it's hard for us to completely quantify this for you largely because we're doing a ton of things to drive conversion rates up. What I will do, though, is just underscore for you the operational importance of this. We are essentially rewriting our code base so that it can operate in the cloud and so that it can move seamlessly between AWS and our own data centers and potentially from one cloud environment to another cloud environment over time. We have the brightest engineers, we think, in the industry. No one is doing what we're doing at scale. We are not taking this lightly. But the reason we're doing it is not only because of the financial benefits that Alan is talking about, but it is the operational benefits. And if you want to look at some quantification of this, I would just point you to the marketing optimization efforts that we're doing right now. We've got some of, we think, the leading data scientists now working on data sets up in the cloud environment, who are getting to essentially real-time re-computation of our algorithms. We're building self-learning algorithms and we're able to spool up massive amount of processing capacity, essentially on-demand and then bring it back down, and that is actually helping us deliver some of these marketing optimization benefits that you're seeing. So, it goes beyond just conversion; it goes right to the core of almost everything we do. Our PWA application, for example, I mean that is a cloud native app. A lot of the speed benefits that we talked about, which do deliver conversion benefits outside of \u2013 particularly outside of the U.S., this is all enabled by the cloud. So, again, we are at the cutting edge of this. It's a big thing that we're doing. We do already see the operational benefits, but I think we're really just scratching the surface in terms of what we can do. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for the color, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Certainly. And, again, to remind everyone that we ask you to please limit yourself to one question. Moving on, we'll go with Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I know you talked how the marketing landscape has cooled just the auction market kind of coming down on performance. Do you think this is the new normal, going forward? And recognizing that you're focused on optimizing efficiency, has this also created some opportunities, though, for you as well? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Well, it's hard to say in the travel industry whether anything is the new normal. It's always dynamic. It's always been dynamic. I think the one thing, of course, that has created opportunities for us is just our increased capabilities that we have in terms of just bidding more effectively, measuring incrementality with more precision, again, largely driven by the data-driven approach and really massive data sets that we're being able to manipulate and compute up into the cloud environment. And I think that's something that is the new normal. I think the question is, of course, with all of this is you can build competitive advantage, but to sustain it you've got to keep moving. So we're not standing still, we're going to continue to evolve our capabilities in this area. And assuming we do that, I think we can hold this as the new normal. But again, what happens in the overall competitive environment and what happens in these auctions, it's really hard for us to tell at this point. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please? Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you very much. This is maybe a little bit along the same lines as Doug's question, but to the extent that we've seen your competitors pulling back on their marketing spend, there's generally been a more negative impact to bookings growth for them here this quarter, bookings growth were essentially flat and you guys still saw a pretty significant improvement in sales and marketing efficiencies. So is there something different about the strategy that you're using or the way that you're thinking about this in terms of how you're benefiting from this sort of system-wide reset in ROI targets? And then just if you could maybe update us on any progress that you're making in terms of your work with hotels on leveraging their direct booking pricing models as potentially something that's either having an impact on the business one way or the other or something that you guys could potentially incorporate into some of your channels over time? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Heath. It's hard for us to compare what we're doing to what are competitor's doing because, unfortunately, for us, we don't know what they're doing. But I can tell you a little bit about what we're doing and why we may be in a different spot. I think, first of all, when you think about hot advertising auctions, it's generally in auctions where you've got a couple of players who have comparable products, if you will, and they start to bid against each other and that can create situations where you sort of destroy industry economics. I think there could have been some of that happening in markets where both us and our larger competitor and maybe some other players, we're both relatively strong. We're trying to find, of course, these auctions and situations where that type of activity isn't incremental to us and where, hey, the customer were to come back to us together. But the good news, bad news story for us is that there are very few markets where that's the case. I mean, we have not built locally-relevant product offerings in that many markets yet around the world. If you look at the total number of hotel and alternative accommodations properties out there, there's millions of them. We talked about us having, this quarter, 750,000. So we've got a whole bunch of, what I would call, just global expansion to do outside of our core mature markets so that as we pull back or find marketing spend, which is not incremental because we've already got such powerful brands in a lot of these markets and customers are going to come to us anyways, we are able to pull that back, not have a significant impact to bookings. But at the same time be able to actually drive growth in a really healthy way, which is just get more customers, new customers to the platform, more properties to the platform and other products because simply we're just adding more selection and more availability, and that creates great network effect. So that's what we're doing. Listen, in terms of the hotel direct pricing model and any impact to our business, again, we've been saying this for a long time, we have not seen an impact to our business, our customers, our brand agnostic. That's why they come to us. We don't like the practice, we think that it's not a great thing for the industry, it's not a great thing for our value proposition if there's a big message out there that you get lower prices elsewhere. But, so far, our customers haven't really cared, because they don't really look for a specific branded hotel. We think that's a great opportunity for a lot of our partners and a lot of our more forward-thinking partners have taken advantage of that and have used our channel as a way to sign up new customers and new loyalty members. And the partners that we have had signed up to that program have generally, and I think without exception, cited great results. We are always having conversations with additional partners. We love to test this stuff. So I would invite all of our partners, large and small, to come forward and we'll do a test with you and see if it works. Again, for the most part, I think without exception, it's been a good thing for us. So, again, I think this is an evolving area for us and we're hopeful as with the large chains and the small chains that we can collectively find win-win situations where we can drive incremental value for everyone across the platform. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please? Operator : And we'll take our final question from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon. You talked about the priority markets for new inventory. What are those markets where you're adding and saw acceleration? I guess, I could take a guess, but if you could say more specifically. And then, looking beyond alternative accommodations, what's your appetite for other booking products, like tourist attractions, et cetera, that maybe just there's too much fish to fry in hotel and alternative accommodations to bother with that at this point? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Well, Mike, I can't tell you my secrets, so I won't tell you. But I bet you, you've got a pretty good guess. In any event, we're happy with the progress there. I would just tell you that there are important markets out there. It's the beginning. It's the wave one. We'll be doing other markets around the world in future years. So for competitive reasons, I'm not going to call out exactly what they are. In terms of appetite for other products beyond hotel alternative accommodations, listen, it's a voracious appetite. I mean, we have been the ones that have been building and investing this multi-product platform for years. This year, we'll spend approaching $1 billion just on the P&L and our tech platform investments. It's what we do. And in doing that, we built the world's travel platform, and yet we're still early days in terms of building real liquid marketplaces across all the lines of business. Yes, we are investing right now and making sure that we've got a locally relevant product in the hotel and alternative accommodations marketplace in priority countries, and we're going to move that around the world. But sure to follow, we're making sure that we do that as well in those priority markets across air, car, activities, cruise and we love the cruise business. I think we're just at the very early, early stages. So we've gone through a multi-year investment cycle. I think we're uniquely positioned to build incredible marketplaces not only in standalone basis, but also increase the sophistication within which we can cross-sell and create network effects across all of these different product categories. And I think if you look out over the course of the next two to five years, that's going to be an increased focus for us. It's something that our customers love and you can see a piece of it already with add-on advantage. It's also something that our partners love as well. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mark Okerstrom for any additional or closing remarks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Well, firstly, I just want to thank everyone for listening in today. Secondly, I just really want to thank the entire Expedia Group team. In a very short time, we have made some very significant changes in the way that we operate at Expedia Group, and I am more impressed than ever with our incredible employees around the world. I know I speak for all of them when I say that we are so excited about the enormous opportunities in front of us. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator. Operator : And at this time, that will conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Senno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Senno - Expedia Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by Mark Okerstrom, Expedia Group's CEO and President, and Alan Pickerill, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, October 25, 2018 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic that, or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's investor relations website at ir.expediagroup.com, and I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content including today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Finally, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable efforts. These items include but are not limited to foreign exchange, returns on investment spending and acquisition-related or restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. We continued to build on our operational and financial momentum in the third quarter, posting strong top and bottom line results. At the same time, our organization is focused on executing several key initiatives that underpin the three strategic themes I shared this time a year ago : being locally relevant on a global basis; being more customer-centered; and speeding up the pace of execution and innovation. While we are still in the early days of this journey, I'm pleased with our progress to date. We're collaborating across the company more than ever, and the organization is aligned around clear objectives, squarely aimed at unlocking the full potential of our global travel platform. As we continue to push forward on these strategic priorities, we're optimistic that they will result in sustained growth and share gains in this massive travel market for a long time to come. In the third quarter, we grew gross bookings 11% and revenue 10% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased a very strong 29%. Our brands are making nice strides, optimizing direct marketing spend, balancing quality topline growth with profitability. That approach was evident in both our strong adjusted EBITDA growth and solid 13% increase in total lodging stayed room nights. We continued to see very good execution on our supply acquisition efforts. We added 40,000 properties to our core global lodging platform in the third quarter, bringing our total property count to approximately 595,000, excluding HomeAway, a 46% increase compared to Q3 last year. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we have now acquired over 150,000 properties and remain on pace to directly acquire at least 180,000 new properties for the full year. We also integrated 100,000 additional HomeAway listings onto our global lodging platform for the quarter and now count over 895,000 total properties in our core lodging portfolio. Our concerted efforts to push into our priority markets continued to show promise. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress. We continue to add properties and work through everything it takes to be locally relevant in these markets. In addition to adding properties, our teams are laser focused on refining our product by enhancing areas like language translation and localized content, all aimed at making sure we provide a great experience for customers in each and every market. As a reminder, this year's just the beginning of our new operating model calling for a much more focused approach to global expansion. We expect this new approach to drive better performance in the coming years as we improve our supply position and product in these initial markets and extend this strategy to other key geographies in 2019 and beyond. HomeAway delivered strong results, posting more adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter than it did in all of last year. That's a tribute to the tremendous progress the HomeAway team has made in transforming the business in the few years since our acquisition. As we prepare for the next phase of growth at HomeAway, we want to welcome the teams at Pillow and ApartmentJet to the Expedia Group family. We see the addition of these unique software platforms as a key step in establishing the foundation that will help embolden HomeAway and Expedia Group's urban expansion efforts in the coming years. Overall, the HomeAway team is executing very well and is on track for a great 2018, and we see a long runway ahead in the growing alternative accommodation space. Egencia continued its strong top-line trajectory with gross bookings increasing 14% and revenue up 10% in the quarter. With a strong sales pipeline and leading product offering, we believe Egencia can continue to take share in the managed corporate travel market for many years to come. trivago delivered significant improvements in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter as it executed on its operational shift to focus more on profitability and began to see slightly easier comps. The team is making good progress in adjusting its business model to reflect the new industry dynamics, and we're optimistic trivago can continue to deliver performance improvements going forward. In closing, we are pleased with our execution and the results to date, and I'm extremely impressed with how much our team has accomplished so far in 2018. While we still have a lot of work ahead, we are confident that our new strategy combined with rigorous execution will translate into attractive growth for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We delivered another strong quarter, balancing solid top line trends with healthy growth in adjusted EBITDA. Total lodging revenue increased 12% on stayed room night growth of 13%. Excluding HomeAway, the gap in revenue per room night and average daily rate growth was on the higher end of the 200-basis-point to 400-basis-point range that we have discussed, in part due to foreign currency headwinds. HomeAway posted solid 24% growth in gross bookings, a deceleration from last quarter as we expected. Total HomeAway revenue increased 35% driven by over 50% growth in transaction revenue while subscription revenue declined 18%. Combined with leverage and operating expenses, HomeAway posted a quarterly record $209 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 66% year-over-year. With HomeAway's transition to an ecommerce business nearly complete, the combination of longer booking windows and a high concentration of stayed room nights during the summer months will drive increased seasonality in the P&L. Given that, as a general rule of thumb, we expect HomeAway to see pressure on adjusted EBITDA in Q1 and Q4 of each year with solid profit generation in the second and third quarters. Overall, HomeAway is headed for strong revenue and profit growth in 2018, and we are focused on driving very healthy top and bottom line growth for a long time to come. Total advertising and media revenue increased 1% for the quarter. Our Media Solutions business was up over 20%, mostly offset by the year-over-year decline at trivago. Air revenue grew 11% on 6% growth in revenue per ticket and a 4% increase in air tickets sold. Air revenue growth continues to benefit from the reclassification of distribution fees from contra-revenue to cost of revenue. As a reminder, this change is neutral to profitability, and Q4 will be the last quarter it impacts our results. We again saw leverage on overall costs with adjusted expense growth decelerating across each category, resulting in nearly 400 basis points of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. In line with our expectations, cost of revenue grew slightly faster than revenue. Similar to the last few quarters, the deleverage is due to the aforementioned accounting change related to air distribution fees and higher cloud expenses, each of which added over 100 basis points to growth. Our cloud migration is moving along nicely and we continue to see some of the early operational benefits. As we discussed last quarter, we have improved our cost optimization capabilities and are judiciously scaling traffic on our cloud-based lodging stack to ensure a seamless customer experience. Based on our current trajectory, we now expect total cloud costs to be around $150 million in 2018. We continue to expect cloud expense to exceed $250 million in 2019 as we complete the lodging stack migration and shift focus to our air stack. Total selling and marketing expenses increased 3%. Direct expenses were roughly flat in Q3, largely driven by the marketing rationalization efforts at trivago. Excluding trivago, direct selling and marketing expenses grew 6% as we continue to benefit from improved marketing efficiency. Looking forward, we expect less direct selling and marketing leverage in the fourth quarter as we further lap the initial benefits from our optimization efforts and due to the seasonal timing of HomeAway marketing expenses. Indirect selling and marketing growth remains elevated due to increased head count associated with our supply initiative. For the full year, we now expect total adjusted selling and marketing expenses to grow slower than revenue. Technology and content expense grew 17% in the third quarter primarily driven by investments in our ecommerce platform and continued product innovation. General and administrative expenses increased 10% year-over-year, further deceleration from the second quarter. We expect G&A cost growth to continue to slow in the fourth quarter, but given the year-to-date increase, we now expect general and administrative expenses to grow slightly faster than revenue for the full year. While specific initiatives can occasionally drive it higher, we continue to expect to deliver nice leverage in G&A over the long-term. Depreciation expense was up 10% as growth continued to slow in part from the benefit of lower data center related CapEx. Net interest expense decreased year-over-year due in part to the redemption of our 7.5% coupon bonds that matured in August while our adjusted tax rate declined to 17% in Q3 due to continued benefits from U.S. tax reform. All told, our solid operational performance and leverage down the income statement combined with a lower share count led to a very robust adjusted earnings per share growth of 46%. Turning to capital allocation, year-to-date, we've returned a total of over $770 million to shareholders. That includes over $630 million in share repurchases, already our highest amount for any full year in over a decade. In addition, as Mark mentioned, we continue to opportunistically invest in strategic M&A with the acquisitions of Pillow and ApartmentJet. This is consistent with our approach to capital deployment, balancing attractive capital returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends with opportunistic M&A that complements our organic growth strategy. Turning to our financial expectations for the year, we are increasing the low-end of our guidance range and now expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 12% in 2018. As a reminder, that growth would be 200 basis points to 300 basis points higher excluding cloud. Overall, we had a strong third quarter and are pleased with our performance to this point in the year. We believe the operational momentum we're building balanced by continued investments in key strategic initiatives will drive sustained healthy growth over the long term. With that, operator, we're ready to take our first question. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we will open the floor for questions. And our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. I just want to drill down, please, just on the HomeAway business. Could you talk about the sustainability of the profit levels that you've achieved there and the sustainability of the revenue growth, the bookings growth there? Thanks a lot. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. Mark, thanks. This is Alan. Yeah. On the margins, I think, first of all, it's important to point out that the EBITDA margin for HomeAway should be viewed not really on a quarterly basis, but much more on a full year or trailing 12-month basis. For instance, if you look at the full year 2017, it was about 22% margin. There's just been \u2013 through the transition, through the seasonality, there's been a bit of variability quarter to quarter, so I would really encourage you to look over a 12-month period. We are not optimizing for the margin for HomeAway, as we're not for the margin percentages, we're not for the rest of the business. We prefer to take a balanced approach. We see a big global opportunity. HomeAway in particular has opportunities both here in the U.S. as well as in international markets. We want to make sure that we're making the right investments there to gain share and grow the business globally. At the same time, it's our philosophy that we should be able to do that while delivering healthy profits and profit growth. So, we really are taking a balanced approach. I wouldn't put a pin in a particular margin number at the moment, but that's our philosophy looking forward. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks, Alan. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much. Could you give us any first thoughts about how you're thinking about 29 (sic) [2019] EBITDA ahead of the planning process and any key things you want to call out there? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Kevin, you said 29. I think you meant 19, maybe? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: 2019. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: 2019. Yeah, thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: We've not finished our long, long-range planning yet. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: No. Yeah, this is Alan again. We are in the middle of the planning process. We don't have a lot of color to provide today as regards 2019. I would just re-emphasize what I said in the prepared remarks, which is we are looking to build a business where we can have sustained healthy top and bottom-line growth. We are looking at a global opportunity, and we're building a business in a way to build it out globally. And we think we need to make appropriate investments in order to do that. But we think we can, as I mentioned on the HomeAway answer, I would say the same here. We think we can have a balanced approach, where we are making those appropriate investments and setting this business up for success over a very long period of time, while at the same time, delivering healthy profits and profit growth. And I think you can kind of see that so far in what we've delivered in 2018, and we would seek to continue to do that as we move forward. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's great. Thanks, Alan. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thanks. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to get some clarity around full year 2018 guidance. Even if you assume the high end of the guidance, it implies EBITDA growth rates for 4Q are sort of moderate. Other than seasonality and some of like the performance efficiency gains that's being moderating and also the piece associated with the HomeAway, anything else that's going on that we should think about? And what would be some of those factors? Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah, Deepak. I think you got a few of them there. I think that you're right to point out, even though we don't guide quarterly, there is implied guidance for the Q4. We are expecting a more subdued performance in terms of adjusted EBITDA growth in Q4 relative to year-to-date and Q3. A couple of things I would point out. I think you did mention them, but just to emphasize, the HomeAway seasonality is an important factor. The fact is that they are more seasonal than the rest of our business. They drive tremendous room nights and revenue and profitability in Q3 and less so in the other quarters, in Q4 and Q1 as I mentioned in my script. The other bit is that we do have the full impact in Q4 of the lodging supply investment, tech investments, other things that we've kind of been scaling up as we move through 2018. That has an impact on Q4, and in a way, you could think of it as being an outsized impact, just given the fact that it's fully scaled up, and Q4 is a seasonably lower adjusted EBITDA quarter. So, I think those are the things to point out. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Related to that, you have announced some new marketing programs like partnership with the UEFA Champions League. Is that something that we should expect in 4Q? Or is that going to be largely in 2019? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Deepak, it's Mark. I'll answer my first question of the call. So, thank you for giving me the opportunity. I think you'd see a little bit of that in Q4. It will be spread really throughout 2019, and it's a three-year deal. So, it will continue on beyond. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Thank you for the question. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks a lot. Just maybe a clarification on the international room night growth, I guess sequentially it grew a little bit slower in the third quarter versus second quarter. Can you sort of parse out the growth in the focus markets in terms of room nights and did you continue to see good growth there and maybe a throw down in other geos. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure, Naved. So, I think that the variation from Q2 to Q3 in room night growth would be non-meaningful. I wouldn't draw anything from it. I would say that on balance the metasearch channels which are running slower and in some places, you saw with trivago yesterday actually declining year-on-year, can have a disproportionate impact on our international room night growth certainly compared to our domestic. So, I would call that out as a headwind even though it's pretty consistent from quarter to quarter. In terms of our focus markets, we continue to be very happy with the progress there. Overall in those markets, room nights are growing nicely ahead of the overall average. We do have a number of those markets where we were starting from a decent position in terms of brand recognition where the numbers are looking very nice, particularly domestic room night growth showing very strong growth rates. And other markets where we are really starting from a lower base, things are little bit slower to get going. But all told, we are happy with what we're seeing. And I would just remind you, it's a multi-year journey. I mean the first thing you see in these markets is picked up room night growth largely because you're entering new auctions for traffic that having more properties allows you to do, but really the benefit here is producing a better customer product and a better customer product produces better marketing efficiencies over time. So, that's really the goal of this, and I think with respect to our wave one markets, we would expect to see more of that type of benefit in the second and third years. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. That's very helpful. And then maybe a quick follow-up. I think on the last call, you guys talked about how you're able to use analytics to figure out where you don't need to necessarily bid for that traffic if it can come to you organically. How far along are you now in sort of honing that ability and does it continue to sort of hurt on the margin just because you're still sort of going through the process? Or how should we be thinking about that? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Well, I'd say that it's a journey. We continue to make solid progress. I think we originally started this work in the early days in Q3, Q4 of last year and really started to see some of the benefit show up in Q1, but I think it's an ongoing level of sophistication. There are really two things that we're doing here. One is trying to identify marketing spend that is truly non-incremental meaning that if we didn't spend it, we would see those bookings show up in cheaper channels such as direct type in or mobile applications. So that's goal number one. In that respect, you really don't see if you do it well, an impact to the top line. It's really just more efficiency in your sales between (21:52) line item. The second piece of this, though, is really getting much more granular in looking at what efficiencies are certain ad buys actually delivering or what returns on ad spend? And in those cases if you find an efficient spend, it can be incremental, but it's just an efficient, and when you pull the efficiencies out and actually pull your bids down, there can be an impact on your room night growth. And you can see some of that in our numbers and I think you could expect to see some of that going forward. But I think again, we've developed a new capability here. I think it's going to be something that we'll continue to build on and refine over time. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just with a HomeAway, the deceleration in bookings, is that more self-inflicted on the marketing or competition from other players in the space? Then on this morning's acquisition, do you expect to get more of that longer extended stay such as over 30 days and you intend to make that inventory exclusive to Expedia? And how should we factor into HomeAway's growth for next year? Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the deceleration as I said in my remarks was largely in line with what we expected for their gross bookings growth. I think there are a few factors at play, one being that they are lapping over some of the ramping up of their performance marketing that they did late last year and just as they get further along that curve, the low hanging fruit is more difficult to come by. I think the other bit is they do continue to optimize just generally in the marketing area and trying to make sure that they've got the right balance between returns on marketing spend and unit growth. So, those are a couple of key factors. In international, there are couple of kind of nuanced factors. One was that they had implemented some product enhancements in international markets last year that drove a bunch of gross bookings online, and they're comping over that. They also have, in the not too distant past, migrated some of the international business onto the common platform, and typically what happens when you see that is a bit of a disruption in current trends until the team can kind of optimize on the new platform and get things back to status quo. So those are some of the factors. But the opportunity for HomeAway is quite big, and it's a long runway. So, we continue to expect them to grow at healthy rates for quite a while. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: And, Jed, just on the new acquisitions, so just to give a little more color, we are super excited about these two acquisitions that we've made, just great teams and really solid new platform capabilities that we built. And essentially what these technologies do is allow apartment type or multifamily owners and managers or communities essentially have a central way to manage all the alternative accommodations, rental activity that's happening in the building, and also allow them to rent out some of the hospitality suites that sometimes exist in these buildings, all in a way that can be tracked and in a way that makes it quite easy for owners and managers to be compliant with whatever regulation is put in place over the years. And certainly that's a fast-moving area. I wouldn't expect it to have any significant impact on length of stay or booking windows or really be a significant driver in the near term 2019 of HomeAway booking volume. I think these are foundational investments that are going to build a platform on which that we can really start to build an urban business over time, but it is going to take some time. And then in terms of exclusive or not, we haven't commented yet. I think it's something that we'll look at over time. Generally, what we have seen, though, is that exclusivity in these markets has not been often a good thing. So, I think we'll look at that very carefully. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. I have two, if I can. First, just on the direct marketing line, you saw another quarter of even better leverage. Obviously, a lot of that is coming from HomeAway, or at least you're seeing a lot of EBITDA upside at HomeAway, a lot of leverage at trivago. So, can you kind of give us a sense for how marketing efficiency trends are moving in the Core OTA business? And then secondly, I guess going back to the focus markets for supply acquisition and localization, I think last quarter you said you saw acceleration in terms of bookings and room nights stayed there. Are you still seeing that in those markets? And then is there anything else you can share around repeat behavior in those markets that can give us comfort the strategy is on track? Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Hey, Lloyd. It's Alan. Yeah. On your selling and marketing question, I think the color I would provide there is obviously, there was a lot of leverage on the selling and marketing line in Q3. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the majority of that was driven by what you saw at trivago. So, that's the largest single impact if you're thinking about direct selling and marketing relative to revenue growth. The other two healthy contributors there were HomeAway and then the Core OTA business. And I'm not going to size them up specifically, but the contributions were in that order, with the second biggest help coming from the HomeAway business and then Core OTA in third. So, those were the three components. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: And then, Lloyd, on the focus markets, what we saw was essentially after the step up in growth rates from Q1 to Q2, we saw the markets sustain essentially the healthy growth rate that we saw, and there was a mix between the markets. Some of the markets did accelerate nicely, and I mentioned, particularly in the domestic market, some of them were a little bit more challenged than others, in many cases because of things that were happening in the metasearch channel or other market specific items. But we certainly have no question that this is the right direction. And just as a reminder, we're doing this because we have seen very compelling evidence of a very high correlation between property coverage and repeat rate. It's too early for us to give you any numbers in these particular markets. It's always dependent on the actual travel cycle and repeat cycle of the customers that we're actually serving. But certainly, we have a long history of understanding this relationship and we have no question that we will see stronger repeats rates as a result of this. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. All right. Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Lloyd. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. This is Akshay Bhatia on for Justin. When we talk about the hotel supply investments, what is the timeline to get these focus countries up to scale that you'd be happy with? And then when should we expect you to move on to the next set of focus countries and will there be additional expense around that? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. So, we are going to launch another effort next year, 2019. We did have a pretty big step up this year, and so we're lapping over that and I wouldn't expect as big of an investment required in the next wave of markets. In a number of these markets, supply is not the biggest next thing to do. It may be some sort of product enhancement or translation or some sort of marketing effort and it really depends from market-to-market. So, we are going to continue to do this, but again, I wouldn't expect as large of investment as we saw in 2018. In terms of timeline, it depends. I mean, generally, it depends upon how much inventory there is to acquire. So, in very large markets, it could take two to three years. In smaller markets where supply is less of a focus, we could get it done in one. So, it is really dependent as is all of this stuff on the specific market that we're focused on becoming locally relevant in. Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. You have a lot of fish to fry with international inventory growth and now you're just talking about. And then alternative accommodation growth, but how are you thinking about experiences and the potential there and could that be an area of increased investment in 2019? And then second, Alan, I may have missed it but you talked about trends for sales and marketing and G&A leverage or deleverage in Q4, but what about tech and content? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: So, activities is absolutely in the frying pan with all of the other fish. We are pretty excited about the opportunity in activities. We're not new to it. I gave you some numbers last quarter. It's a big business. I think obviously mobile opens up a big opportunity. It has been one of those spaces as happens in this industry where suddenly it has acquired or attracted a lot more attention and a lot more capital. So, there's certainly much more competition in this space than there has been historically. And there's a lot of pretty exciting players out there that are doing interesting things. But for us, our focus is really about harnessing one of the big advantages that we have, which is we have an incredible installed base of mobile applications, nearly 300 million across the portfolio. We have a multiproduct offering, so we know where customers are going and can generally tell where they are and we will be working on building out our set of activities inventory so that we can deliver the perfect activity to the perfect customer at the right time. And that's the goal, and we'll be working on putting \u2013 essentially having execution follow that strategy over the course of the next several years, and we're pretty excited about the possibilities there. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: And then, Mike, on your question on tech and content, I would just say a couple of things. One is that we are forecasting a bit of an increase in the pace of growth in tech and content in Q4 and just given the year-to-date impact plus that fact, you obviously would end up with meaningful deleverage in tech and content this year relative to revenue growth. Some of that is due to some of the investments that we've talked about over the course of the year, which is from a pure forecasting perspective. That's what we're expecting. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : And our next question comes from Tom White with D.A. Davidson. Thomas White - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. High-level one. You guys had another, kind of, nice quarter of year-over-year expansion of EBITDA margin in the Core OTA segment. How should we think about direction of those margins for Core OTA, kind of, over the long term? I realize there's a ton of puts and takes in there. But can margins expand further from here over time? Or in five years or so? Are we, kind of, in the ballpark we're at now? Or lower? Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry. Excuse me, Tom. I'm just getting over a cold. As far as \u2013 I would repeat some of the stuff I said earlier, which is we are not optimizing for margin. We've been pretty clear about that over time. And nothing has changed there. I think what's unique to 2018 and just the period that we are in is that we're finding this opportunity to eliminate marketing spend that's not incremental and/or that is highly inefficient. And that's having a meaningful impact on the EBITDA margins for Core OTA. I think our general model still exists, which is, we want to get leverage on our fixed cost. We think the business that we're in should allow for that, and if we're effective at running the business, we should be able to see that leverage in fixed overhead cost. Selling and marketing, looking forward, we will eventually, kind of, get through the goodness of this period, and at that point, I would expect the relationship of selling and marketing to normalize to something closer to historical averages and/or revenue growth. But it's a little hard to be specific on that particular line, just because it's just going to depend on the opportunities that are in front of us. We just need to make sure we're \u2013 as long as there's returns on the selling and marketing in period or in the near-term, then we're happy to continue spending there. And we're kind of optimizing there for global share gains at good returns. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Are you there, Ron? Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Can you hear me okay? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Oh, perfect. Great. Thanks. So I just wanted to ask two questions. I think, Mark, you talked a little bit about this with repeat rates on the new hotels out there, but I wanted to ask about just the language translation, and how you see that sort of impacting results as you head into year two and maybe where you are in that. And then, also as it relates to just lodging in HomeAway, pretty big step up on HomeAway properties on Expedia getting to around 300,000, is this like the right number of properties, where maybe you can start highlighting these more and more in the core Expedia product? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. Well, some language translation is just of so many things that you've got to get right. And in many cases, it's not just about translating perfectly into the language, but really starting to use local, more colloquial tone of voice. And that's, in many cases is where the nuance. But again, it's just one piece of it. You've got to have great marketing. You've got to have great landing pages and homepage content, and you've got to have your geography systems right and payment types right. And of course, you've got to have translation in a format or localized format, so it really feels like it's a local experience. And we're going through each of these wave markets and just making sure that that is the case. In terms of HomeAway properties, yeah, I think we are up to 300,000 HomeAway properties on, really, the Core OTA brands right now. I think they are being highlighted in many cases. It's really getting a lot smarter, although it's a muscle we're building around identifying those use cases where this type of inventory is highly valuable. Some obvious ones are large groups. We can present them with a large house, any sort of alternative accommodation in a period where there's high compression in terms of low availability for traditional lodging categories, for example. But again, it's still relatively early, and if you think about just the overall opportunity, it's significant. But 300,000 properties, if you compare it to the 1.8 million that HomeAway has or some of the larger numbers that we've heard our competitors talk about, and you compare that number of units to the competitor or HomeAway's units, compared to the gross booking opportunity, we're very much in the early stages here. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : That makes a lot of sense. And, Mark, just as a quick follow-up on the language translation you talked about, all those things that you needed to get right for it to work. Is this more of a wave two, phase two event? Or I'm just curious where you are. Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: No. I mean, yeah. We are doing it in the waves as we go. So, it's just completely \u2013 it's part of a formula. And we're doing it in the wave one countries right now, and we'll move on and do it in the wave two countries. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks, guys. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to step back and have a bigger picture question. I think the number one issue we get from investors is sort of the way the travel funnel, the travel industry is sort of evolving. When you think out, Mark, over the next couple of years and the product innovation you're seeing from Google, the intent from some of your hotel partners to get more direct traffic, your desire to get more direct traffic, shared accommodation, what are some of the investments you're making? And how should investors think about the output of growth and share as you're looking out multiple years? Because I think that's the big investor debate right now on the group. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think, first of all, we think that the overall opportunity we were moving into remains very significant. You continue to have a massive industry. You've got offline to online trends. And yes, we hear, oh, is this industry fully penetrated? The answer to that is not even close. I mean if you look at where we are in the U.S., it's, call it, high 40s, 50% online penetration. It steps down from there the further you move away from, call it, Manhattan. And if you compare that with our corporate travel business Egencia where you're in environments where everyone has a device, everyone has broadband access, online penetration there is in, anywhere depending on the client, high 80s or 90s. Because the reality is, as long as the experience is good, people don't really want to talk to a human. So, we think that the offline to online opportunity is significant, and where we are investing to make sure that we continue to be the place where people go to for travel is in all of the places that you've heard us talk about. We continue to have a huge opportunity from new geographic expansion standpoint. And just, again, to give you a sense of that, if you look at the number of alternative accommodations we've got and compare that to any of the huge numbers that the alternative accommodations competitors have mentioned, we just got a ton of room to go to put those properties on our platform. And by the way, they are already getting bookings. It's already online. We just have to add them. And that's just alternative accommodations. In the hotel space we've also got significant opportunities. So geographic expansion is certainly one. We sit on an incredible amount of data, and we've been working very hard on making sure that we are using that data to our full advantage, getting much more able to actually provide much more personalized results, real-time, on-the-fly, through a lot of the work we've been doing in the machine learning and AI space. We've been investing in voice, and we just launched a new application with Google, essentially, to allow us to answer questions and make bookings on Google Assistant, making sure that wherever customers are or however they want to interact, we're a part of that. We've been investing in all of the chatbot technology and are currently \u2013 particularly in some countries in Asia doing significant volume through our chatbots online and other applications. So we are staying at the forefront of this industry. We think the opportunity is very significant. We watch very closely what others are doing in the industry, and we make sure that we're trying to ensure that we are one step ahead. And we think that's going to be a growth formula for us that can sustain us for a very, very long time to come. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Apologize if this has been asked already, but in terms of marketing and how you're thinking about the intensity of marketing going forward, it seems there's the potential for the market dynamics, competitive dynamics to potentially get a little bit more competitive out there plus, on top of that, you guys are strategically focusing on some international markets, and now beginning to lean in there. Just looking at it as a whole, should we be expecting maybe a bit more intensity on the marketing front going forward? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. It's hard to say at this point. I think certainly we have gotten much more sophisticated in understanding specifically what we're getting for our marketing dollars, and it feels like our other major competitor has done the same. So there has been I think a shift in context here that I think could continue for a long time to come. I think Alan made some comments around international markets that I think are important to keep in mind, but this is not expansion of international into international markets with irrational or exuberant or poorly returning marketing spend. This is us applying the same disciplined approach into essentially new auctions that exist in meta-search channels or other performance marketing channels. That in the first early days of the market can produce marketing deleverage because those markets are less efficient overall than our core markets. But over time, they get more efficient over time as well. So I think, for us, as we push internationally, you may see optically some pressure on that line item, but it's really just a mix shift issue and the cohorts underneath continue to perform very well. So listen, I'm hopeful that we're in a world where the level of sophistication that we have just allows for there to be a new normal, and we're just focused on international expansion in a very responsible way that produces solid returns on our advertising spend. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. In terms of the head count that you've added to address the hotel supply effort, can you give us some color on the dynamics you're seeing there in terms of productivity as you onboard new hires? Is there any limitation on the gains that you're yielding out of that productivity effort and will that change as you have to add new heads into further supply expansion next year in new geographies? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Sure. So we did hire up a significant amounts of new heads. I think we talked about investment levels in the range of $50 million or so. We're pleased with the productivity so far. It does take individuals a while to ramp up, but once they ramp up, we've got a pretty good formula of getting them up and productive. Importantly, though, something that Alan mentioned is we've been also investing in our technical systems to actually help with the automation of a lot of the activity and really trying to drive much more productivity amongst this team and also looking at ways where we can significantly reduce the amount of human intervention that has to happen to either on board a property or to actually manage a property going forward. So it's something that we're very focused on. Those investments that we made in automation along with the head count, as Alan said, they are pressure on Q4 profitability simply because we didn't have those investments in Q4. And as it relates to the technology investments, Q4 can be a seasonally low capitalization rate so can have artificial pressure as well. So I just wanted to highlight that for you as well. But really is we are very much focused on productivity and a lot of the things that we've learned as we've added new heads and we've invested more in automation are things going to help propel us to better and better efficiency as we roll this out around the world in wave two and beyond. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, Mark. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Coolbrith with Wells Fargo Securities. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking our questions. On the revised cloud guidance for 2018, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's helped you come in under the initial guide on the hotel stack migration. And then on air, probably more computationally intensive, a bit less seasonal than hotel, is that migration more about performance than cost savings relative to the hotel migration? Is there anything about that migration that makes you a little more conservative as you approach the cost guide for 2019? I also just wanted to check in on Egencia. It looked like a little bit of a slowdown in revenue there. Just wondering if you can give us an update, anything to call out there. Thank you. Alan Pickerill - Expedia Group, Inc.: Yeah. Great, Rob. This is Alan. So on the cloud spend, there's two main factors there at the moment. One is just the amount of compute that we move into the cloud. And that is largely in our control. So we obviously are trying to do this in a measured way. We're trying to make sure that we test and learn, that we offer our customers a seamless experience and that's been part of that process all along, and that can lead to situations where you have either more than or less than the amount of compute moved over than you initially expected in a given period. The second component which we have undertaken in 2018 has been key efforts just to make sure that we're being as efficient as we can be. And I won't go into the nitty-gritty details here, but you can imagine that as you're moving compute into the cloud, there are things you can do to make sure that you're not leaving compute or code in the cloud that's not necessary, that if you're spinning up the instances that you need in the cloud that you're taking them back down again when they're no longer needed, and trying to make sure that you just have good processes in place. And that has been a component this year as well. But as long as you're doing that well, then really the question is just about how much compute do you have in the cloud? And the numbers I gave you for this year and for next year are based on our current estimates of how much of the compute will move into the cloud. I don't have a lot of information for you to think about it in terms of, like, the air stack versus the hotel stack. I mean, ultimately we plan to move the vast majority of the compute into the cloud, and there will be both operational and customer benefits across all of the products. But the cost savings that we'll compute and, kind of, to the extent, share externally, I wouldn't expect them to be product-by-product. We'll look at that on an all-in basis. As far as Egencia is concerned, no, there's nothing I would point out there that's a big story. There's likely some FX impact this quarter that wasn't there last quarter. It can be a little bit choppy in terms of the growth because it depends \u2013 their top-line growth depends on a combination of the business that they're selling, the business that they're implementing and then the share of wallet that they're getting from their customers. And all of those play into the growth rate quarter-to-quarter. I would just remind you that, even with the topline growth rates that we posted for Q3, it's well in excess of what you would expect to see the travel industry growing at. So, no big story there. I think you'll just see that ebb and flow from time-to-time. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. Touching on the tenor in this discussion, I guess, on disruptive technology, is it possible to break out the impact on the volume of sales and marketing and the cost of sales and marketing? And secondly, are the obvious names in the industry all at the same place? Or are there some leaders and \u2013 well, of course some leaders? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: And, Mike, sorry. On the volume and cost of marketing, are you thinking about it in terms of the various marketing channels out there? Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : No. I was thinking in terms of your total sales and marketing, and... Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Right. And breaking it out by marketing channel or...? Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : No. Well, if you could do that, the more detail the better. But I wasn't. I was more looking at it from 30,000 feet of, in terms of what your total sales and marketing might become over time as this disruptive technology becomes better and more in place. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Right. Got it, got it. Well, I think, first of all, I think sales and marketing is always going to be a big part of our business. The industry remains massive, $1.6 trillion and we're single-digits of it. So we really do have a significant opportunity to expand. And part of having an amazing service like we do is being able to tell customers all about it. Now, I do think that our increased sophistication in sales and marketing will allow us to do that more efficiently over time. I think that our focus on customer centricity and really building products that customers love to come back to and love to tell their friends about will help our marketing productivity and efficiency improve over time. I think mobile app and the investments we're making in mobile app will help as well. So I think there is a lot of opportunity for us to spend sales and marketing long into the future, but I do think on the margin we should be able to get more efficient as we grow. And certainly that's a big focus for us. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Next question, please? Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. And we have no further questioners in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Okerstrom, President and CEO, for closing remarks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.: Great. Well, I want to thank everyone again for listening today, and obviously a big thank you to the entire Expedia Group team for another solid quarter of progress. Let's end the year strong. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Senno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Senno : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's financial results conference call for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2018. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by Mark Okerstrom, Expedia Group's CEO and President, and Alan Pickerill, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, February 7, 2018 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic that, or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the Company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com, I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content including today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Finally, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable efforts. These items include but are not limited to foreign exchange, returns on investment spending and acquisition-related or restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Michael. We were pleased with our overall financial performance for 2018. Not only did we deliver excellent financial results that exceeded our expectations, but we also moved into execution mode on the transformational strategy that we laid out at the beginning of the year. As part of that strategy, we articulated three key themes : Being locally relevant on a global basis; being customer centric; and speeding up the pace of execution and innovation across our platform. We enter 2019 with solid operational and financial momentum and an organization more focused and aligned than ever before. I'm truly excited about the opportunities ahead as we have only just begun, harnessing the true power and potential of our platform. For 2018, full-year gross bookings grew 13%, reaching nearly $100 billion. We increased stayed room nights 13% and revenue was up 12%. Our solid execution on marketing optimization led to even faster profit growth with adjusted EBITDA increasing 15% and adjusted earnings per share up 35%. We delivered these results while at the same time making strategic investments in several key initiatives including our cloud migration and accelerated pace of supply acquisition. On that note, our team added approximately 200,000 new properties to our core lodging platform in 2018, roughly double the amount added in 2017. We ended the year with over 1 million total properties including over 370,000 HomeAway listings now integrated into our core platform. We continue to make solid progress in our priority markets. While we still have more work to do both on the supply and product side to be truly locally relevant for customers in these markets, we saw positive signs as we moved through the year. We expect to build on that momentum as we head into 2019. And we remain confident that as we drive deeper supply coverage, deliver a more locally relevant product and layer in brand and other marketing efforts to increase awareness, we can accelerate both the top and bottom line growth in these markets over a multiyear period. This focused market approach is now our standard international expansion strategy, and we plan to continue investing in the normal course of business. HomeAway posted healthy financial results for the full year with revenue increasing 29% and adjusted EBITDA up a robust 43%. Total online bookable listings increased 24% in 2018 to over 1.8 million, including over 1 million in instantly bookable listings, which we think will provide a nice boost to conversion over time. Given the attractive growth prospects, we plan to keep investing significantly in this business in 2019. That includes additional performance in brand marketing for HomeAway and VRBO as well as laying the ground work to pursue the significant urban and international opportunities that we believe can unlock the next leg of growth for the business. We remain focused on positioning HomeAway and Expedia Group to capitalize on the significant long-term opportunity in the alternative combination space. And we believe we have a long runway of healthy top and bottom line growth ahead. Egencia delivered solid results in 2018, growing gross bookings 14%, revenues 16% and adjusted EBITDA 13%. The sales team continues to sign new business at a healthy pace, and we're investing in customer service and product to further differentiate Egencia\u2019s offering. We're optimistic we can continue to take share in the managed corporate travel space while delivering attractive profit growth over the long term. trivago is making nice progress on adjusting its strategic focus, posting strong profits for the second consecutive quarter. The team is executing well on the shift to better balance revenue and profit growth. And as outlined on the call yesterday, we expect trivago to carry its operating momentum into 2019. Overall, our team achieved a lot in 2018, making solid progress on our transformation while delivering excellent results. I'm impressed with the high level of execution we exhibited across the Company, and I'm optimistic we can carry that in to 2019 and beyond. The travel market is as competitive and as dynamic as ever, but the opportunity is large. And we're confident that by continuing to execute our strategy, we can deliver exceptional products and services to our customers and create value for our partners, resulting in share gains, healthy growth and attractive returns for our shareholders for a long time to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan. Alan Pickerill : Thanks, Mark. We finished the year with another strong quarter, growing gross bookings 11%, revenue 10% and adjusted EBITDA 17%. Total lodging revenue grew 10% on stayed room night growth of 11%. Across our Core OTA segment, growth in both lodging revenue and stayed room nights were essentially in line with Q3 as we continued to execute on appropriately balancing healthy, quality, top-line growth with profitability. When analyzing room night growth, keep in mind that our focused international strategy involves building supply depth in key markets by pushing into secondary and tertiary destinations. As a result, we're adding smaller properties than we historically have and alternative accommodations are growing portion of our overall property mix. We expect that pattern to continue going forward and therefore expect room right growth to be less correlated with property growth than in the past. Based on what we've seen, we believe the increasing depth and breadth of our supply will drive better conversion and higher customer repeat rates, leading to improved marketing efficiency over time. At HomeAway, gross bookings growth moderated to 15%. The deceleration was primarily due to slower international trends, headwinds in SEO and ADR growth continuing to normalize. HomeAway's revenue and stayed room nights each increased 20%. Total advertising and media revenue increased 9% for the quarter. Our Media Solutions business continued to perform well, growing 28% in Q4, partially offset by declines at trivago. Air revenue grew 18% with tickets sold increasing 10% and revenue per ticket up 7%. We saw solid contributions from Brand Expedia and Egencia, as well as some benefit from Expedia Partner Solutions\u2019 new partnership with Chase Ultimate Rewards. Similar to the prior few quarters, air revenue also included a modest benefit from the reclassification of distribution fees from contra-revenue to cost of revenue. As a reminder, this change is neutral to profitability, and Q4 is the last quarter it impacts our results. We continued to drive leverage in the overall P&L, delivering over 100 basis points of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in Q4. In the quarter, cost of revenue grew slightly slower than revenue. That includes continued impact from our cloud migration and the accounting change related to the reclassification of air distribution fees, which combined, contributed over 300 basis points to cost of revenue growth. Total selling and marketing and direct selling and marketing expenses each increased 7%. Leverage on direct expenses was largely driven by the ongoing marketing rationalization efforts at trivago. Excluding trivago, direct selling and marketing expenses grew 14%. That was faster than the past few quarters due to increased spending at HomeAway and higher brand marketing investments across some of our Core OTA brands. Indirect selling and marketing growth decelerated in Q4 as we started to comp against the hiring ramp to support our supply initiative. Technology and content costs continued to deleverage. Although growth came in a bit lower than expected at 16%. General and administrative expense growth further decelerated from the past few quarters, increasing 8%. We also continued to leverage below the line in Q4 with depreciation expense up only 2% and net interest expense down year-over-year, while our adjusted tax rate came in at 24%. Those factors along with a lower share count, led to strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 49%. We expect adjusted EPS to grow faster than adjusted EBITDA again in 2019, as we continue to see leverage on our below the line item. Excluding CapEx investments for our new headquarters, free cash flow grew 7% in 2018 to $1.3 billion. That came on top of 46% growth in free cash flow, excluding headquarters in 2017. The shift in timing of a couple of significant payments benefitted 2017 and negatively impacted 2018. Normalized for that timing shift, growth would have been more balanced across the two years and faster than adjusted EBITDA growth each year. Our business continues to generate attractive free cash flow, and we see an opportunity to improve our free cash flow conversion in the coming years. In terms of capital deployment, we returned nearly $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2018, primarily through share repurchases, along with our quarterly dividend. In total, we bought back 7.7 million shares for $903 million, our highest amount in any year since 2007. In addition, we deployed $186 million on acquisitions and strategic investments. Going forward, we intend to continue prudently balancing opportunistic M&A with returning capital to shareholders. Turning to our financial expectations for 2019. We expect total adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 15%. We expect the seasonality of our adjusted EBITDA growth to follow a similar pattern to 2018 with pressure on adjusted EBITDA in Q1 and the large majority of growth coming in the balance of the year. One factor to keep in mind is that Easter fully shifts into Q2 this year, creating a drag on consolidated first quarter stayed room nights\u2019 revenue and profit. In addition, as a reminder, we invest in selling and marketing to drive bookings ahead of the busy travel season with lodging revenue recognized at the time of the stay, which peaks in summer months. This trend will continue to be even more pronounced at HomeAway due to its longer booking windows, and we expect that to result in an increase in losses in Q1 for HomeAway this year, compared to last. For the full-year at HomeAway,. as Mark mentioned, we intend to continue investing back into the business, including brand and performance marketing to position HomeAway to capitalize on the significant long-term opportunity we see in alternative accommodations. We expect the increased investment levels to result in slower adjusted EBITDA growth for HomeAway in 2019 with the returns coming over time. Turning to our expense expectations for 2019. We expect more significant deleverage in cost of sales compared to 2018. The key drivers are the increased investment in cloud, customer operations costs related to new details at Expedia Partner Solutions and HomeAway shift to become merchant of record on more of its transactions. We also forecast tech and content expenses to deleverage due to higher cloud cost as well as continued investments in product enhancements and platform initiatives across the Company. In total, we currently expect cloud expenses to increase from $141 million in 2018 to around $250 million in 2019. Excluding cloud expenses, adjusted EBITDA growth would be approximately 400 basis points higher. We project total selling and marketing expense to leverage again in 2019, mainly reflecting the cost rationalization efforts at trivago, which will have a bigger impact on the first half of the year. Excluding trivago, we will lap the marketing optimization benefits we recognized in 2018 as we move through the year. Overall, we intend to maintain a balanced approach, strategically investing in both performance and brand marketing where we see opportunities to drive good returns over time while continuing to look for areas to optimize spend. Meanwhile, we expect solid leverage on the general and administrative costs line. Looking below the line, while we continue to receive additional guidance related to the U.S. tax reform, we currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20% range. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in 2018 and believe we're entering 2019 with good momentum, leaving us well-positioned to deliver solid growth this year and for years to come. With that, operator, we're ready to take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Mahaney. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Hey, Mark, you talked about these three factors that were driving -- or maybe Alan, the three factors that are driving the gross bookings deceleration. Could you just go through those again in a little bit more detail? One of those was lower international trends. And then, one other big picture question. I always like the slides that you put out. And the one that shows this huge opportunity in the market, and one of the things that's glaring about that is how small your share is in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America versus what you've been able to do in North America. Could you talk a little bit about how you can increase shares? Is there a different strategy that you can use to increase share in those three, in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America? I know it\u2019s a broad question, but it's one of that interesting takeaways from those slides. Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Mark. I\u2019ll have Alan answer the first one; I'll take the second part. Alan Pickerill : Yes. So, as far as HomeAway's gross booking trends are concerned, I think the first thing I would just talk about is just level setting on kind of what's happened with that business over the last three years. And when we bought the business, just remember that 100% of their business was essentially offline gross bookings. And so, we've gone through this transformation at HomeAway, turning it into a true travel e-commerce player and pulling gross bookings online. And so, obviously, when you do that, you're going to have a tailwind associated with a book of business that previously had been booked offline that's now being booked online. And that transformation has been quite successful, gotten us up to about $11.5 billion of online gross bookings for HomeAway in 2018 and shown pretty strong and healthy growth over that period. We did see some deceleration in 2018 as we went through the quarters, and I mentioned that as far as Q4's results are concerned. I would just point out a few factors there. One is that the international business, we did some things last year that did pull gross bookings online. And we're comping over those things that we did, while at the same time, having international not be extreme focus for the team. International will be more of a next leg of growth for us along with urban. And so, that's gone from something that did create a bit of a tailwind to something that's now not contributing that much growth to HomeAway's overall gross bookings. The second factor is we do have SEO headwinds. And what I would say there is we stood up a proper search engine marketing team in the past years. They have done quite well and are driving significant growth and healthy growth in gross bookings. But, at the same time, HomeAway is going through a period where they've got pressure on their SEO trends. And that's creating a headwind for them. This is something that all travel businesses have had to endure. I would say HomeAway is coming through that at a later date than some of the other ones because of the transition of their business, but it is creating a headwind. The last thing I would just say is that the ADR contribution, historically we had some periods where ADRs were a bigger contributor to gross bookings growth. That's because we had some larger properties coming online first and those were coming on at high ADRs and so it was driving a nice tailwind there. We still are seeing growth in ADRs but it's moderated and not quite as big of a contributor. But overall, I would just say that we're looking for HomeAway to be a good healthy grower over a long period of time. We're very happy with the transition that we've been through in the last three years. We think the market that the business is in is large and growing. And we've not even done anything really significant in the urban, we've not done anything very big in international. And we think those things will provide kind of the next phase of growth for HomeAway. Mark Okerstrom : And then, Mark, in terms of our approach to international, it's really encapsulated in this first pillar of the three-part transformational strategy we laid out at the beginning of the year, which is the concept of being locally relevant on a global basis. We've been able to build up an incredibly strong position in the U.S. and in Canada and few other markets around the world, largely because we've delivered an incredible service, a service where everyone knows Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Travelocity are places where they can come, where they have all of the inventory in terms of lodging choices, increasingly alternative accommodations in the case of Expedia, crews, car, activities, flights. You can find them all at one place. There is great content. It's in your local language. You can use your payment types. You pay us now or you can pay us later. And then, if something goes wrong, we'll help you sort it out. And that's just an incredible customer experience. So, for the U.S. customer, for the Canadian customer, we're truly locally relevant. Outside of those countries and again a few others, we haven't concentrated on building incredible products. We\u2019ve been, up until 15 months ago, going with really much more of a land-grab strategy where we were expanding simultaneously in 30 to 60 countries around the world, depending on what brand you're looking at. And even though we would have got there over a long period of time, it would have taken us a long period of time. So, the approach now is really this focused strategy. We\u2019ve talked about the Wave One markets. And it's a focused strategy, making sure that we have incredibly easy-to-use websites that have great descriptions and photos, all translated into local tone and voice, promotional offers that talk about things that are locally relevant in a similar way that we do in the U.S. We've got all of the lodging and other inventory available on our sites. We've got local payment types. And then, we layer on good marketing with locally relevant messages, both in performance marketing and brand channels. And that's the recipe for success. And we have seen, again, very encouraging results in our Wave One push. It's a multiyear journey when we prioritize these markets. But, now, based on the historic data that led us to pursue this strategy, based upon the results that we've seen so far with the progress in 2018, this is now business as usual. And we're just incredibly optimistic that that $1.7 trillion travel opportunity, based upon where we can go geographically, where we can go by segment across leisure, corporate, offline travel agencies, powering airlines, et cetera, we're very comfortable that all of that to us, it looks very addressable. Operator : We'll take our next question from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two, if I can. Following up on there. As you continue to sort of ramp marketing investments behind the opportunity you see, can you talk about maybe some of the experiences you've had about shifting in and out of different channels on the marketing side, definitely leaning in more on branded and direct, what that does for ROI for the platform of the medium to long-term? That's number one. And then, number two, wanted to understand maybe some of the background or rationale behind the proposed or negotiation that's going on between yourselves and Liberty Media, just so we can put that in the context of broader capital allocation? Thanks, guys. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So, in terms of marketing investment, I think we've spoken a fair bit about our marketing rationalization approach and what we were upto in 2018. And what we've done is essentially been able to get much more sophisticated in our ability to understand what type of marketing is truly incremental versus just shifting bookings from one channel to another, and also trying to get much more granular in the way that we -- essentially by marketing, not only in performance marketing channels, but also in other channels, like television and digital video. That has enabled us, I'd say just to get smarter in terms of understanding where we want to put our marketing dollars. I would just say that as we have done that, we have observed that in markets like the U.S. where we have an incredibly strong products, where our mobile applications are excellent, our customers find us than in many cases where we are less aggressive in certain performance marketing channels. Our customers find us by either downloading our app through some of those placements, or if they've already got the app, just booking on there. And you'll see, we put a disclosure in our investor deck, which talks about our app transaction growth on Hotels.com and Brand Expedia, which was up 50% year-over-year in 2018. So, we've found that -- again, in places where our product is excellent and where we are truly locally relevant that our customers find us. And it's allowing us to be much more efficient with our marketing spend. So, the strategy going forward again is to build a great product in all of these focus markets, and then follow-up that with exactly the same strategy. Performance marketing, I guess in prudent levels to support the strategy, to support the growth. And then, when we've got a truly best-in-class product, layering on more brand spend. With respect to Liberty, we did file an 8-K, I would just refer you to that. There's not a lot more that we can say at this time. All right. Next question, please? Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Can you give us an update on the ad ROI environment? And also on room nights trends, as you comp against the ad spend rationalization last year, are you expecting to see nights accelerate? And then, lastly, how will Easter impact the room nights in the first and second quarter? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So, I'll take the first couple and then I\u2019ll have Alan talk to you about Easter. So, in terms of ROI, I'd say nothing remarkable for us. I mean, we have been again quite focused on optimization. And what that does is allows you to drive essentially better ROIs. As you mentioned, there are some situations where we were driving room nights that we're in some cases unprofitable, because we were dealing with averages. And in those cases some of those room nights go away, and they get dispersed to the broader market. That has been a headwind on our room night growth in 2018. Trivago itself has been a headwind on our room night growth, certainly third quarter and fourth quarter as well it was a headwind. In terms of whether that's going to result in acceleration, it's really hard for us to guide you on room nights, because obviously we have dynamic market. We just know that we've got to a very clear strategy and focus, and we hope to deliver very-healthy room night growth and top-line and bottom line over the long time to come. Alan, do you want to talk about Easter? Alan Pickerill : Yes, just briefly, Kevin, last year, we had talked about the impact we saw of Easter moving partially into Q1, and we said it was about 150 -- we estimated it to be about 150 basis-point benefit to Q1. That would be the range of what we would still expect to see this year. The only thing I'll say, it's a bit of a nuance. But, the impact is usually a larger impact to the first quarter, because it's a smaller quarter in terms of total room nights and a slightly smaller impact on Q2, because it's a larger quarter. But, that's the range to think about. Operator : We'll take our next question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Thank you. Going back to last year, it seemed like pretty conservative EBITDA guidance and you exceeded that. So, congrats on that. Just wondering about this year's guide. It seems more aggressive with marketing leverage. And just wondering if you've added any cushion in there for potential Google changes or potential actions by your competitors after a lot of people really did pull back last year? And then, secondly, on the international bookings, I think you exited the year 11%. Maybe just give us some progress update on some of the new international markets, and if you're seeing traction there, and if there is the change that could accelerate? Thank you. Alan Pickerill : Thanks. Justin. This is Alan. So, as far as guidance, I don't want to add too much color. I'd say just as regards how 2018 developed, some of the things that turned out in our favor relative to our expectations coming into the year were trivago, certainly their full year performance compared to where we thought they were at the beginning of the year is quite improved. Cloud\u2019s turned out to be a little bit lower than we have originally anticipated. We did have solid execution across the Core OTA business, so that helped. Mark spoke just a few minutes ago about the benefit that we saw from some of this marketing optimization provided some good tailwind. And we also just undertook to make sure that we had good fixed cost control and overhead control. So, all of those helped and kind of explain the difference between where we started the year and our expectations and how we delivered. In terms of the guidance going forward, I would say, we feel comfortable with the 10% to 15% range. Some of the main factors in there are of course trivago, trivago's performance. They guided on their own. So, you can take a look at the contribution they're expecting to provide. We do have a headwind associated with the increased investment in cloud spend. But, we're expecting good solid contribution across the core business. And I can't really get into like whether there were things in there factored in for specific marketing channels or anything like that. But, those are some of the main factors to think about. Mark Okerstrom : In terms of international growth. Listen, I think, one thing that we do expect to see in 2019 is we should see a larger contribution to our lodging revenue, essentially from the new properties that we added through 2018 because we were ramping them up through the year. Whether that's enough to actually drive acceleration in those markets, it\u2019s hard to tell. As a reminder, in a number of these international markets, we\u2019re much more reliance on performance marketing channels like trivago, like other metasearch players. And those players have -- I think as you\u2019ve seen with trivago, have been in a position where in some cases qualified referrals have been down year-over-year. So, that is a headwind that is disproportionately hitting those markets in terms of their growth. But, the underlying fundamentals look strong. And absent those impacts, again, we would expect those markets to deliver a better contribution and significantly so in 2019 than they did in 2018. Operator : We'll take our next question from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore. Anthony DiClemente : I had a question about in the slides, you talked about the headquarters and the CapEx spend 425 to $475 million in \u201819. Can you just talk about to what degree is that incremental versus \u201818 CapEx? And then, just had a question really about the macro outlook in Europe. I know others have asked about international, but some of the traditional tour operators, like Thomas Cook for example are calling for a tougher growth outlook. You haven\u2019t mentioned macro conditions in Europe and the expectations for \u201819. So, any more color on the environment would be helpful there. Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Great. I'll take the latter and Alan can talk about headquarters. Alan Pickerill : So, I\u2019ll just give you some additional data points on the headquarters. Cumulatively for the retrofit and the additional build through the end of 2018. We had said just under $300 million, about $190 million of that was in 2018. So that will go up to, as you mentioned, a range of 425 to $475 million in \u201819; and then a range of 135 to $185 million in 2020; total projects in the neighborhood of $900 million plus or minus. Mark Okerstrom : And then, in terms of the macro environment in Europe. I\u2019d say, there's a ton of uncertainty there. Certainly, we watched and heard Thomas Cook's results and some of their commentary, Bank of England has taken their growth outlook down; I think Germany has expressed similar concerns. We have seen a drop off in UK flight bookings, both outbound as well as inbound. We expected uncertainty around Brexit and just overall uncertainty in Europe. So. I think, we are cautious on Europe. The great thing with our business though is that first of all, we're very global business. And so, we're broadly diversified across all of these movements. Generally, people do continue to still travel in economic downturns. They often just take shorter trips, they stay closer to home, they do often trim their budgets. But,. if you look at how that has actually played out for us over history and particularly, if you look at 2008, 2009, one of the world's largest global financial crises ever. We actually had some of our strongest core profit growth in across those years. And ultimately, what we see is, essentially we\u2019ve got more unused capacity with our suppliers, based our discounting into our channels, consumers get great deals. And maybe they change their travel patterns but ultimately they still take their trips. So, we're somewhat countercyclical. But, I think, again, the travel market exited 2018 in a very stable and healthy state, near record highs, and occupancy, air tickets growing, ADRs still going up. I think as we sit here right now, particularly as we look at Europe, there is a little bit more uncertainty in the air. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two if I can. First, just can you guys perhaps give us an update on what percent of your business is direct versus acquired? I think, it was about two thirds direct at the Analyst Day you guys held in 2016. So, wondering if you can just give us an update there. And then, I guess, as you look to HomeAway and investment, how do you think about balancing marketing investment and the core business kind of ski and beach, whole home versus urban and international? It sounds like you're starting to think more about those markets, but it seems like there may be more competition there. So, how do you think about the Company's competitive advantage as you look to expand into those markets? Alan Pickerill : Yes. Lloyd, this is Alan. On your first question, you're right. We did in an investor deck, investor presentation, gave that roughly two-thirds presentation. And we were essentially, just for those that maybe haven't seen it, we were essentially indicating that roughly two-thirds of the business comes from direct/proprietary channels, including things like email, loyalty programs, branded SEM, direct type-in as examples. We don't have an update for you on that today. We continue to look for good balance in growing new customer acquisition through some of the paid search channels, such as Google and other metasearch players, while at the same time providing great products and services, so that those customers will repeat. And then, as we\u2019ve spoken about earlier, having a good mix of brand marketing, so that we can drive direct traffic. So, no update on the specific numbers for today, but we look for growth in both. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. And I would just add to that too is that as you might expect, we essentially have two offsetting factors going on here, as we optimize our marketing spend. We are shifting in many cases more of our traffic over to our proprietary channels. You can certainly see that with the apps that we disclosed. But at the same time, as we get more aggressive in going into some of these international markets where we're less known, in those cases, we are really stepping on the gas in performance marketing channels, and that skews things the other way. So, I would think about it as an overall formula of the U.S. and our core markets where we're locally relevant, very, very strong direct proprietary channel bookings volume. In international markets, less so but always improving. And the playbook is essentially is to make them all look like the U.S. And we track those metrics very closely in terms of repeat customer usage, new customers versus existing, cost of customer acquisition, et cetera. And generally, we feel very good about the trends that we're seeing there. In terms of HomeAway, I think you use the word balance. We are absolutely going to balance. I think, the HomeAway team has shown the ability to be very-disciplined in their overall approach. Listen that the core resort and beach markets are highly important and HomeAway is very strong there. And those are markets that we just have to continue to support and invest in. But also, those are markets where -- that are performing quite well. And so, we have the capability to take profits from that part of the business and reinvest it in urban and reinvest it in international and essentially balanced both of things quite appropriately. I would also say that part of HomeAway\u2019s urban and international expansion strategy is getting new property, signed up on to the platform. And not only marketing them to VRBO and HomeAway customers, but also providing them to Expedia, Hotels.com, market or brands that have already strong urban demand and have strong international presence, and increasingly stronger international presence as we expand more around the world. So, that's part of it as well. They're not doing this alone. They've got the power of the Expedia Group behind them. Operator : We'll take our next question from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Naved Khan : A couple for me. How should we think about the growth in ADR versus revenue per night? I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about disparity of maybe 200 to 400 basis points. And then, if I just look at the international room night growth, there is a deceleration there. What drove that and how should we reconcile that with the focus market and the growth in those markets? Mark Okerstrom : Yes. So, on the first one. Naved, we have spoken, as you said of 200 to 400 basis-point difference kind of expected in the rate of growth in revenue per room night relative to the rate of growth in ADRs. That has been the case for a while. We did see that narrow this quarter, which we were quite happy with. There's no major story there as far as a particular component. As we've discussed before, some of the things that impact that obviously are just our overall margins and our geographic mix. FX impacts can be in there, the impact of our loyalty program, any couponing and refunds that we do, play into that as well. But, we were happy to see it kind of more of on the narrow end this quarter, but no major change to the story. As far as the international room night deceleration, I would just point out two factors. One is, as I mentioned HomeAway. And we did see decelerating bookings, international bookings growth for HomeAway as we move through the year. And you kind of start to see that impacting the room night growth. We had done some things last year to move a lot of the bookings online. And we did some platform migrations that had an impact as well that we're comping over. The other bit is that trivago is an important channel for us internationally as well. And with their reset and the fact that their volumes are essentially down, they're qualified referrals are down year-over-year, that has created a headwind for us in our room night growth. It became a headwind in Q3 and continued, and was a bit more of a headwind in Q4. We do expect that to continue in the first half of 2019 as well. The important thing is that we've been able to pick some of that up through other channels, but that is having -- that is a net negative for us. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. Understanding you've been investing in the sales force for Wave One sort of increasing the supply in the new markets, could you just sort of talk to us about sort of the incremental step up in the sales force investments as we go into 2019 to really capitalize on the next wave of markets? How we think about the dollar investment in headcount there? And the second one, just thoughts philosophically about ways to reaccelerate HomeAway overall growth. How do you think about essentially reducing consumer take rates or sort of making it more competitive and a more compelling offerings for consumers to drive faster growth at HomeAway? Alan Pickerill : Hey Brian, it's Alan. I'll take the first question and Mark can handle the HomeAway question. Yes. So, we did talk a lot last year in \u201818 about the investment that we needed for our Wave One and to add the supply. It was -- the supply gap in those markets was significant and required a meaningful investment. We had talked about it being in the $50 million range for that first push. And so, at that time, we felt like it was appropriate to show the details. I think, at this point, we've kind of fallen into as Mark said, earlier kind of into more of a business as usual mode. We do have some additional wave markets that we're going to focus on in 2019. We've been able to consider the investments required for that within kind of the envelop of the guidance that we gave. And so, we're not inclined to detail out what that specific investment is this year. Mark Okerstrom : And then, in terms of reaccelerating HomeAway growth, it's really the playbook that we've laid out. Urban is a big opportunity for them. International is largely an untapped opportunity. They\u2019ve just really got the bulk of the international product now on the new platform, which we talked about last quarter. And they're working on optimizing those and honing their performance marketing capabilities in international markets. But, importantly now that they've got the business replatform in addition to just entering into new, call it categories or new segments, urban and international. They are very focused on front-end customer innovation, developing much better user experiences and planning tools. I think, you'll see increased pace of that type of innovation roll out here as we move through 2019. And they're also working on making sure that they reach customers and that investments that they're making in marketing are investments that really build the strength of some of the incredible brands that they've got in the portfolio. So, I think you'll see a little bit of more that and more to come on that in 2019. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin Patterson : Great. Thanks so much. One on HomeAway. With the HomeAway business you've taken a very measured pace toward listing inventory on Expedia. With over 1 million instantly bookable properties on the site now, how are you thinking about stepping up that integration and optimizing conversion. And then, philosophically, is the consumer fee still the right approach for that business or are you open to considering other avenues? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. Thanks, Justin. So, with a 1 million instantly bookable properties, the opportunity is getting larger for us to do integration. I think, you'll see us pick up the pace here as we move through 2019. That's certainly the plan. And then, the goal is really to help customers pick between traditional accommodations and alternative accommodations, and really solve the kind of search and navigation process. The teams have been working on that a lot, 370,000 properties, it sounds like a lot. But in the grand scheme of the millions that are available and the millions that are on HomeAway, it\u2019s really a small number. So, we've got enough on there to do testing; we're learning lots, we're learning lots about the type of content you need to really merchandise whole homes well and how that's different from lodging. We are going to -- you're going to see that be an increased focus for us, both on the full line OTA businesses like Brand Expedia, but also on Hotels.com as we move through 2019. But, we're happy with what we see so far. When we have this inventory, it is absolutely a conversion grower, more selection is absolutely the right thing to do. You just got to find the right way to merchandise it. In terms of the monetization method. Again, we are in the position where we've got every monetization method in on the plan and essentially in our manual options. We have pure supplier pay commission. We've got consumer fee with very low credit card fee for the supplier side. We've got subscription plus consumer fee. And really, we're experimenting with all of those monetization methods to find out which works, which works for customers, which works for the different supply types, whether it's whole home, whether it's urban, whether it's property managed, or by owner. And I suspect that you're going to continue to see us evolve that over time. We don't have the answer to what the exact right approach is at this point. But we suspect that it is approach that is closer to what we have right now, which is really a menu of options that we can tailor to suit the needs of both customers that are shopping for given market and the suppliers that are providing accommodation for those customers. Operator : We'll take our next question from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : You guys achieved good leverage in performance marketing last year through your own optimization efforts. Obviously, some of that is going to moderate in 2019. But, at what point can we expect similar step-up benefit in the future, or looking ahead, is it going to be more of continuous iteration? And then, second question on the cloud spend. What should we expect the cadence to be this year? When do we have most of the assets fully migrated and the growth and expansion be in line with maybe revenue growth? Alan Pickerill : Yes, Deepak. So, this is Alan. I would say on the marketing leverage, we are expecting to see leverage from trivago in 2019. We -- as we lap the significant optimization that we did on the core business, those will be difficult comps. And so, we don't think we'll see that same level of leverage in \u201819. So, the core business is looking for opportunities to continue to optimize, looking for opportunities to continue to find non-incremental or highly inefficient spend. So, there are some opportunities, but we don't expect it to provide the same level of tailwind in  \u201819 that we saw in \u201818. As far as the cloud spend in \u201819, I don't want to give you kind of a quarterly cadence. I would say, we just continue on somewhat of a routine path. We're scaling up -- we have a fair bit of the shopping and booking traffic for the lodging stack in the cloud. We continue to scale that up. We've got additional components across air and the other lines of business to put into the cloud. It will just kind of continue to grow as we move through the year. If we go according to plan, then we'll have a good share of the compute in the cloud as of the end of 2019, but there will be more to move in 2020. And so, by 2020, we won't quite yet be to a just a normalized rates, but will be getting closer. And then, I would imagine without being too specific, when we get into 2021, we'll annualize the step-up in 2020 and be a lot closer to that just normalized rate and growing with the business. I should say too, though, that we are being -- we're trying to be very prudent and disciplined about the rollout to cloud. We test things very carefully, will roll things out and scale them back just to make sure that the customer experience is seamless and not disrupted. We also in 2018 undertook efforts to get a lot better and smarter about how to be efficient at deploying into the cloud. And that includes things like just making sure that you don't have duplicate instances spun off from the cloud that you're spinning up your compute only for the time that you need it and then pulling it back and other ways of making sure that we're being as efficient as we can. And I think we made some pretty good ground in that regard. I think, we've got a better overall process in place now that we did at the start of the year. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you. So, stepping back a little bit, Mark. You just announced that you have a 1 million properties on site with call it 630,000 hotels or so. So, from a selection perspective, you're probably where your competitor was about two years ago. And, I think at that point, they were through-putting what seems like two times the amount of room nights that you are now. So, it seems like your booking dollar should be much higher. So, can you talk about how cloud marketing and other products will all kind of tie together for you to raise the purchase velocity among the users that you have now? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. I agree with you. It should be much, much larger. And that is absolutely -- that is absolutely the goal. Listen, it is just the playbook. I mean, supply is just part of it. It's also about the overall product experience and the effectiveness of reaching customers. And that is the locally relevant, on a global basis, playbook. We're happy with the penetration that we have into our existing hotel base. We're watching very closely that penetration level as we add new properties. And we are happy with the increased level of penetration that we're seeing into the new properties as we ramp them up. But again, this is something that takes a little bit of time, particularly, if you take some of the European destinations, these are highly seasonal destinations. So, as you build up your loyal repeat customer base, you may not see them again until a year later. And so, it goes with the travel cycle. It's going to take a little bit of time. But again, we really like what we see. We think there's a ton of opportunity and that went to Mark's question at the very beginning of this call, and the playbook works. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll take our last question from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : How much more the macro indicators factor into your guide, or how much do you build a cushion into your EBITDA guide for natural factors? And then, just on scaling HomeAway in the urban and more international destinations. Do you ever think about signing up exclusive relationships with property managers to get their inventory? Alan Pickerill : Hey, Jed. It's Alan, I'll take the first one. Boy, it's tough to be super specific there. I would say that on balance, we're not -- we don't try to put ourselves in the position of being prognosticators of ultimate macro outcomes. We of course pay close attention to them as you all do as well. And I think as Mark spoke about earlier, on the one hand, we've come through a period where the macro looked pretty good. The hotel industry, the airline industry, they're all posting numbers through 2018 that look pretty good. But, listen, there's lots of discussion about Brexit and the impact on Brexit -- from Brexit. There's weather impacts, there's trade rhetoric and trade war potential. And those are really difficult things for us to handicap. We give a 10% to 15% range to give us some room. But certainly, if things really went off the rails, we wouldn't be able to predict that. Mark Okerstrom : I would just add though that we do have a highly variable cost structure. And so, if top-lines weaken, certainly we've got a lot of discretionary spend items that we\u2019re able to pull the lever. I would just go back to, again, the commentary around 2008-2009. This business is very resilient and able to adapt. In terms of exclusivity, great question. I think, we have never been big fans of exclusivity at the property level or at the building level or the property manager level. And the reason is, is when you've got hard assets that are -- have utilization factors, it seldom ends up being the right economic outcome and it can prevent a platform like ours from being essentially unbiased in a way that we treat essentially all of our partners and unbiased in terms of the way that we will always want to serve up the best product for our customers. So, absolute exclusivity has never been something we\u2019re a huge fan of. It can be useful in very specific situations and situations where we have platforms that can drive a huge amount of demand and it makes sense. So, we'll look at it selectively, but it's not -- it's never been really core to our strategy. And really what we try to do is, generally speaking, is try to get unique offers, things like upgrades or things -- in hotels or things like special amenities or things like special rates or certain packages that not at the property level, but actually at the offering level are a little bit more unique. And we feel like that generally is a good path to get a similar type benefits that you might get with exclusivity without really compromising some of the desire to be neutral. But again, we look at it, this is not really a core part of our strategy. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Mark Okerstrom for closing remarks. Mark Okerstrom : Great. Thank you. Well, I just want to thank everyone for listening today. And a big thanks to all of the Expedia Group employees around the world, tons of hard work and great progress in 2018. I know you are as well, but I'm super excited about what we can do together in 2019 and beyond. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Expedia Group Q1 2019 earnings conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Senno, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Senno : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Mark Okerstrom, Expedia Group's CEO and president; and Alan Pickerill, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, May 2, 2019 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that, or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the Company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com, and I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content, including today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable efforts. These items include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange, returns on investment spending and acquisition-related and restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period. In addition, please note that starting this quarter, we have renamed the HomeAway reporting segment to Vrbo. Finally, on April 15, Expedia Group entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Liberty Expedia Holdings in an all-stock transaction, which remains subject to approval by Liberty Expedia stockholders. With regard to the deal, we refer you to the Form S-4 filing made with the SEC yesterday. Note, we do not plan to take any questions related to this topic on today's call. Please refer to the information in the S-4 and the 8-K filings. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Michael. We're pleased to come out of the gate strong in 2019 with robust profit growth and solid momentum. Now into the second year of our transformation, teams across Expedia Group are more aligned and collaborating more than ever as we execute against our key strategic themes, being customer-centric, being locally relevant on a global basis and speeding up the pace of innovation and execution. With these strategic themes serving as the foundation, Q1 saw a continuation of the operating momentum we built through 2018 in our core OTA segment. Q1 core OTA room night growth was healthy and, adjusted for the Easter impact, was a bit faster than we saw in Q4. We have a playbook in place and execution is continuously improving. Focused geographic expansion supported by rapid customer and partner-centric user innovation, locally relevant content, broad inventory assortment at excellent prices and disciplined data-driven marketing and investments add up to a formula that we believe can deliver sustained share gains and balanced growth for a long time to come. We remain pleased with our supply acquisition efforts, a key part of our playbook. Our elevated pace of new property acquisition continued in Q1 and we are on track to add a healthy number of new properties in 2019. We ended the first quarter with over 1.1 million properties on our core lodging platform, including approximately 460,000 integrated Vrbo listings as we continue to make progress unlocking the potential of our alternative accommodations inventory on our core OTA brands. As you have likely noticed, we refreshed the brand positioning of Vrbo. With high consumer awareness and brand loyalty, Vrbo is our strongest alternative accommodation brand and accounts for a majority of our U.S. business in the space. Vrbo will now be Expedia Group's primary global alternative accommodation brand and we intend to expand Vrbo to international markets in phases. We spent the last several quarters laying the groundwork for this shift. Although we are confident in our direction, our streamlining of brands and platforms has put increased near-term pressure on SEO trends, which has contributed to the deceleration we have seen in Vrbo's gross bookings growth. Despite this near-term slowdown, consolidating the bulk of our efforts behind the Vrbo brand globally and operating on a unified, world-class e-commerce platform will allow us to maximize our potential in alternative accommodations in the coming years. In addition to the refreshed brand, we launched several new product features, including Trip Boards, a customer-centric collaboration tool for family and friends traveling in groups. We also re-launched the mobile app to enhance the overall customer experience. We still have a lot of work to do, but these branding changes and new product features are all aimed at strengthening our competitive positioning over the long term. And we are optimistic that we can deliver healthy growth and remain a global leader in alternative accommodations for many years to come. Egencia posted solid double-digit room night growth in the first quarter, although FX had a pronounced negative impact on gross bookings and revenue given Egencia's significant international mix. This strong room night growth reflects benefits from our supply acquisition efforts and enhancements in Egencia's product experience that are driving an encouraging increase in our hotel attach rate. Continued innovation at Egencia, combined with a robust customer pipeline, give us confidence that we will continue to gain share in the corporate travel market. Trivago continues to execute well on their marketing optimization efforts, delivering strong profits for the third consecutive quarter. As Trivago discussed on its call yesterday, with its marketplace approaching stabilization and as they fully lap last year's changes and the team's plan to lean back into certain marketing channels, we expect them to return to revenue growth in the back half of the year and to deliver on their profit expectations in 2019. All in, we're pleased with our Q1 results and happy with the progress we're making against our key strategic themes. The opportunity ahead of us is large and our potential enormous. While we still have a lot of work ahead, we're carrying excellent operating momentum, which we intend to build on as we move through 2019 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan. Alan Pickerill : Thank you, Mark. Our 42% growth in adjusted EBITDA puts us on a good path early in the year. Excluding close to 300 basis points of negative FX to each, gross bookings grew 11% and revenue increased 7%. As expected, trends at trivago and the Easter shift negatively impacted revenue in the quarter. We expect revenue growth to accelerate in Q2 and remain healthy as we move through the year. Stayed room nights grew 9% in Q1 while FX drove ADR declines, resulting in total lodging revenue growth of 7%. In our core OTA segment, in addition to the healthy room night trends Mark noted, we also delivered solid adjusted EBITDA growth, especially notable given our usual first-quarter seasonality. Our balanced approach to marketing, along with benefit from strong performance in our direct proprietary channels, is contributing to the solid top and bottom-line trends over the past year, and our core OTA business is on track for another strong year in 2019. Vrbo bookings increased 5%. As Mark mentioned, the platform consolidation and brand streamlining related to making Vrbo our primary global alternative accommodation brand contributed to continued SEO headwinds. That, along with tough comps in performance marketing channels, were the primary drivers of the deceleration from Q4. We expect the slower gross bookings growth trends to persist in the near term as we work through these changes and lap the elevated performance marketing comps. We have good visibility on what we need to do to optimize our SEO profile on our new platform and expect Vrbo's gross bookings trends to improve later this year. Revenue at Vrbo grew 14% in the quarter with transaction revenue up approximately 25% and subscription revenue down 10%. As expected, adjusted EBITDA came in at negative $40 million given a seasonally light top-line and higher marketing investments in Q1. We plan to invest behind the Vrbo brand globally in 2019 as we position the business to drive strong growth over the long term. Total advertising and media revenue decreased 6% for the quarter, including approximately 500 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Strong 23% growth from our media solutions business was more than offset by the declines at trivago. Air revenue was up 3% in Q1 with tickets sold increasing 11%, partly offset by a 7% decline in revenue per ticket. New partnerships at Expedia Partner Solutions and solid performance of Brand Expedia drove the strong volume increases. The decline in revenue per ticket relates to the negative foreign currency impact, a shift in product mix and a reclassification of certain fees to other revenue. On the expense side, we executed well on managing overhead costs in Q1 and saw a modest benefit from FX. While we anticipate adjusted expense growth will be above these levels going forward, we do expect to execute on the same formula, driving solid leverage on our fixed costs and strategically investing in marketing in order to deliver attractive profit growth. Cost of revenue grew faster than revenue, as is our expectation for the full year. Increased customer service costs at Expedia Partner Solutions and higher cloud expenses accounted for the majority of the increase. We forecast cloud expense growth to accelerate as we move through the year given the comps to last year and continued progress on our migration. Our full-year estimate for around $250 million in total cloud spend is unchanged. Total selling and marketing expenses increased just 1% in the quarter. trivago drove the leverage in direct selling and marketing and also contributed to a decline in indirect costs. Excluding trivago, direct selling and marketing increased 11% due to higher spending at Vrbo and brand investments in our Core OTA brands. Indirect selling and marketing expenses, excluding trivago, were down 1%, reflecting a benefit from foreign currency and comping over last year's supply acquisition investments. Technology and content costs grew 6%. We expect technology and content expense growth to pick up over the next few quarters and we continue to anticipate deleverage for the full year as cloud cost growth accelerates and we invest in product and platform enhancements. General and administrative costs declined 4% overall and were down 2%, excluding trivago. We are tightly managing our general and administrative expenses and seeing nice operational efficiency. It's also worth noting that we benefited from a couple of nonrecurring items that impacted year-over-year comparisons. We expect modest general and administrative expense growth the next few quarters and remain on track to deliver solid leverage in 2019. In general, we are taking a more disciplined approach to overhead expenses, which is comprised of the indirect selling and marketing, tech and content and general and administrative expense lines. Collectively, overhead was essentially flat in Q1, reflecting our focus on closely managing these costs. I noted a few factors that will result in overhead growth in the next few quarters such as higher cloud spend and product and platform investments, but we do intend to remain disciplined on fixed costs to make sure we deliver leverage on overhead this year and going forward as we scale the business. Moving down the income statement. Depreciation expense increased 6% while interest expense was down year over year. Those factors, along with our strong adjusted EBITDA growth, led to a 41% improvement in Q1 adjusted EPS. Last month, we were pleased to announce the deal to acquire Liberty Expedia Holdings which, in addition to simplifying our corporate structure and governance, will enable us to reduce our share count by 3.1 million shares We see this as an efficient and attractive outcome that aligns with our goal of reducing our share count overtime. Overall, though it's still early in the year, we're off to a good start in 2019 and continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 15% for the full year. We expect a combination of improving revenue trends, efficient strategic marketing investments and a disciplined approach to fixed cost to drive that growth. And we are confident that executing that same formula while progressing on our key strategic initiatives will leave us well-positioned to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth into the future. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : I'll ask two. First, with Vrbo decelerating, how do you think you're doing in the category? Do you think the category has really decelerated and that's part of it? Or is it really company-specific issues? And then secondly, a lot of questions out there about your hotel take rates with some of the bigger hotel deals. It looks like they were stable at 9% room night growth and 9% revenue growth ex FX, but could you talk about that? And do you expect any impact on your take rates in the back half? Mark Okerstrom : Listen, with respect to Vrbo, not V-R-B-O, Vrbo's deceleration, yes, listen, I think it's largely company-specific factors. If you take a look at the place where we are actually focusing our effort, which is the Vrbo brand in the U.S., that business was up nicely double digits and growing healthily. And really, what's causing the deceleration is a combination of the brand streamlining we've been doing, the re-platforming we've been doing, as well as just more difficult comps. So the underlying fundamentals of the business we think remain strong. 2019 is going to be one of these years though until we get the SEO trends moving in the right direction from pulling some of these replatforming moves and we can really start investing much more aggressively on the urban opportunity, on the international opportunity, that we might just see some moderated growth rates here for a number of quarters and until we move to the back part of the year. With respect to hotel take rates, listen, we have been very clear that with respect to, particularly our large global chains, that we were done resetting our compensation rates. That is, in fact, the case. And I would just say that the overall dialogue with our global chain partners has just become significantly more constructive over the course of the last couple of years. I think that we have all recognized that we all play a unique role in this ecosystem. It turns out this Internet thing is here to stay and the big global marketplaces and platforms, of which Expedia Group and travel is kind of one of the biggest ones, we're here to stay. And we have a lot of value to create, but also our partners who deliver incredible customer services and unique products, they have a lot of value to bring, too. And so the dialogue has shifted away from us versus you and how do we redivide this pie toward how do we actually expand the pie? How do we actually create new sources of value and both participate in that in a way that is accretive to both of us? We're super pleased with the way that that has gone with virtually all of our global chains. We're very pleased with the Marriott arrangement that we made. I think they are, too. And I'm hopeful that this is a sign of things to come across all of our global partnerships across all of our product categories. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Mark Mahaney : OK. Two questions. One, just the usual one about geographic regions. I know last quarter you called out some -- a little bit of concern over Europe, especially in the U.K. Just give us an update there, please? And then you also talked about revenue improvements in the back half of the year. You know that stuff always gets me going. You talked about -- is that more than just the comp issue related to the timing of Easter in Q2? Are there other reasons why revenue growth should accelerate or improve as we go through the back half of the year? Just lay those out. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. I'll take first one and then Alan will take the second one. On Europe, we did call out on our Q4 call that we were seeing some weakness in outbound U.K. travel and inbound U.K. travel. That really was something that was a theme for the quarter. I think as April unfolded, it was really hard to tell with the Easter timing. Certainly, as the Brexit date has been extended out, there are, anecdotally, reports of better economic activity in the U.K. and we're hopeful that will translate into better trends, but it was a factor in the quarter. With respect to the rest of Europe, I would say, generally, it looks stable to us. There's always puts and takes from time to time, but it generally looks good. And I think we're going to get a good read here in May and June as we move into the high season, how things are generally looking out, but so far, so good. Alan Pickerill : Yes. And Mark, on the reasons to think about revenue trends in the back half of the year, there's a couple of things that are very applicable to Q1 and the first half, and those include the impact of foreign currency. That becomes less of a headwind as we move through the year. Obviously, Easter is only a first half phenomenon. trivago, as they said and as we believe to be the case, they'll be on more normalized footing in terms of their revenue in the back half of the year. And so we expect to see easing impact on our revenue and obviously even some growth. The other thing I'd say is just that the core OTA business is performing quite well. We're pleased with the trajectory there. We do continue to do a lot of work around adding inventory and making sure that we're locally relevant. And we think that's going to continue to have impact on the business and we're optimistic about that as well. So I mean, I think those are some of the factors. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Maybe a couple, just following up on Justin's with Vrbo. When we think about the marketing investments you made starting in '17 through '18 and now, are you starting to see a yield or return on those investments? Or is the rebranding of the platform now and unifying it under one brand going to sort of hide or mask those improvements? And how should we think about those getting pushed out? And then secondarily, it sounds like your expectation now is that business will stay relatively moderate through this year and recovering until the very end. When you strip out some of the headwinds you're seeing in the business, what do you think the underlying market and your business are growing ex the headwinds you're facing so investors have a better sense of what we're trying to track back to in terms of a comp against the headwinds we see now? Mark Okerstrom : Yes, sure. I think the marketing investments that we made in '17 and '18 were largely in two primary buckets. One was really ramping up our performance marketing efforts as we transition the business from being a listings business to being a real transactional business. That created a great opportunity for us to really build best-in-class capabilities there. We're very pleased with the results that we've seen, but as we went into the first quarter, we started to lap really the big push there. And so that was a moderating factor on growth, but it is still a source of growth. The other place was that we started to concentrate particularly our brand investments against the, at that time, the VRBO brand, now the Vrbo brand. And again, we saw really strong returns for those investments. And in fact, some of those investments were some of the rationale for us choosing Vrbo as the primary global brand. We were running one television campaign with essentially the same creative, one with Vrbo branding and one with HomeAway, and the Vrbo brand just performed multiples of the performance that we saw with the HomeAway version. And that, along with a bunch of consumer research globally, really drove us to pick that brand. And you can see the results that I mentioned earlier that we are seeing in the Vrbo brand, solid double-digit growth. And I think that's a testament to the marketing investments, but also just the whole consumer experience improvements that we've made in the Vrbo division generally. And really, the story here is that the things we've done to de-prioritize certain brands, to consolidate platforms both on the consumer side and also on the partner side, are masking some underlying strength and goodness in the core Vrbo brand. I think in terms of what is the steady state for this business, this is a highly popular category. It's definitely growing faster than the overall industry. I think that Vrbo, at real steady state and certainly if we look at the trends that we see, again, against the Vrbo brand here, should be able to grow gross bookings, I think, at multiples the Vrbo brand here, should be able to grow gross bookings, I think, at multiples of the rates that it is right now. It may take us a while a little bit -- it takes a little while to get clear of that as we move through the year, again, because of these other factors, but we think this is a growth category, not only on Vrbo, but also as we move more of the inventory on to our core OTA brands. We think this remains a very attractive category and a very attractive opportunity for us for a long time to come. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Naved Khan : Just a couple. I guess, on the Vrbo side, as you sort of consolidated the HomeAway and Vrbo just under Vrbo and lead with that, how do you address consumer retention and loyalty, those who might have been coming directly to HomeAway and now you're out, I guess, in a bigger fashion with Vrbo? And then secondarily, maybe on just the core OTA, how should we think about this gap between ADR versus revenue per night over the next one to two years? Mark Okerstrom : Naved, on the customer retention question, our intention right now is not to shut down HomeAway, but rather just to focus a lot of our marketing and other innovative efforts on Vrbo. So the expectation is that the loyal customers of the HomeAway brand, of which there are many, will continue to enjoy that brand, but on margin, we'll take the bulk of the new customers against the Vrbo brand here in the U.S. and globally. And then, of course, as we get into this, we will probably look at ways where potentially we can incent customers, whether or not it's from HomeAway to Vrbo but certainly with respect to some of the other regional brands in international markets, really start to introduce them to the Vrbo brand in a way that is nonthreatening and gradually move them over. Alan Pickerill : Yes. Naved, on the revenue per room night versus ADRs, I think the factors there are, as we've discussed before, loyalty is one. And loyalty costs are recorded as a contra revenue. And as long as our loyalty channel is growing faster than the rest of the business, that will be a net difference between revenue per room night and ADRs ongoing. FX is a component too, but we don't read too much about that because it would come out in, over time, in the wash. There are other factors in there that ebb and flow, things around customer refunds if there's particularly inclement weather. Again, those are things that tend to ebb and flow over time. In terms of the core margins, I think the only things I'd mention is just that in terms of our global chain, contracted margins, we feel like we are where we need to be and we're providing value for the rates that are being charged. We are constructive, as Mark mentioned earlier, with our partners and try to look for ways that we can add value there, but we don't expect big changes in our contracted rates with our global chain partners. In there too, there could be some mix factors over time. If we're growing in particular countries where the economics are different than they are for the rest of the business, that could have an impact as well, but that, again, should be generally around the edges. We've talked about a gap in the 200 to 400 basis point range. It's been a little bit narrower than that these last couple of quarters, but there's nothing really changed significantly in our thinking about that gap and how to think about it. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. The only other thing I would add to that is we do have a couple of programs that we're seeing great traction on that could aid in our overall monetization and also aid our partners. One is the Accelerator program where we're just getting significantly more sophisticated in providing our tools partners to essential -- our partners tools to essentially get higher placements in the sort order to drive more incremental volume where they want to get it, when they want to get it. And that is something that is getting increased traction. We're happy to see that. And of course, we do have our TravelAds product, which shows up in ad and media, which is also getting strong traction. And you can see that show up in our advertising and media revenue. But I think, as Alan said, I think we feel good about where we are in terms of our margin trajectory. There will be various puts and takes, but we think we're in a good spot. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Alan, you mentioned a more disciplined approach in expenses. I'm just curious if you could give us a sense of kind of where you're seeing the greatest efficiency this year maybe where you didn't have that last year. And for Mark, just a follow-up on Mahaney's question on Europe. In the quarter, was Europe worse than what you had expected? Or did it decelerate from what you saw in the fourth quarter? I'm just curious, the trajectory that Europe is on from your perspective. Alan Pickerill : Yes, Brent. So on the first question, I think there's a couple of things to call out. One is that we are -- one of the things we're trying to do, and a lot of our overhead costs are people as I'm sure you're well aware, is just to be very strategic and purposeful about where we're hiring, why we're hiring and make sure that's focused on the most strategic and value-add areas of the business. At the same time, we are looking across Expedia Group and the teams, in fact, are looking across the Company for opportunities where we can better leverage the technology and assets and get some efficiencies there as well. And I think we're starting to see some of that benefit as well. This was kind of a something that we started really focusing on late last year and I think we're starting to see some benefit now. I was careful on the prepared remarks to say we don't expect the same level of growth that we saw in Q1 for the full year. We have some investments that we are making. We are doing some hiring. And so don't expect to see those same levels in the rest of the year, but we do expect to get leverage on fixed costs and overhead as we move forward. Mark Okerstrom : And on Europe, I'd say Europe was broadly in line with our expectations, grew broadly in line with the overall rest of the business. We did see nice growth in the domestic markets of most of the major markets probably with the U.K. as an exemption. So that would be the one thing I would call out. But broadly, it was in line with our expectations and, like I said earlier, broadly stable from what we can tell. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : So I wanted to ask another question about your supplier relationships and take rates on the air side. So can you talk about how you're approaching your dispute with United Airlines and what's going on there, and more generally with your air partners? And how do you expect those negotiations to impact your metrics and financials? Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So I think, listen, on the air side of things, it's really a tale of two cities. On one side, we've got some very strategic partners that not unlike our global lodging partners, over the last couple of years have really started to work with us on a much more constructive basis, recognizing the value that we bring, the value that they bring and all of the different areas that we can work together to add more value. Honestly, that is probably where the majority of our U.S. carriers are, including the big ones, the competitors of United. And to give you a sense of the breadth of places where we are working together, if you look at the traditional distribution business, the ticketing business, that has evolved significantly over the course of the last five years. Not only are we significantly larger than we've ever been, we've got huge audiences in the hundreds of millions of visitors and customers that we can showcase brands to and showcase products to, but increasingly it's become a very cost-efficient channel as consumer credit card fraud has become an issue, as automation and customer service has become an issue. And if you look at our major carriers, in many cases, we are driving billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars of revenue for them at the same time as doing it with lower fraud cast -- in fact, on fraud protection, we're covering that for our partners. For customer service, we're covering that for our partners. And that can add up to tens, if not more than that, millions of dollars per carrier. We also have great partners like American Airlines where we're working on ways to actually help them reduce their customer service costs. And again, this is just kind of the beginning of things. We're also working with, again, American Airlines on thinking about ways where we can be creative around upselling from economy or basic economy up into higher fare classes. But if you look across Expedia Group, there is more. We've got -- our strategic partners are using our advertising platform to target specific customers, to showcase the unique differentiators that each of our carriers bring to bear. Air Canada has done some really incredible things on this front in conjunction with our MeSo or Media Solutions team. Our Expedia Partner Solutions business drives the hotel portion of many, if not most of the major carriers' dot com websites, including providing them with packaging technology. That's been a really area of value creation. And our Egencia business, fourth largest corporate travel business in the world, has got preferred relationships with the likes of Delta, who's doing some super creative things around status matching, targeting meetings, business and being part of a preferred program. The other new thing I would say is that over the last year or so as we transitioned really into more of a platform company, we found new ways to use our real time review data to help our airline partners understand how they compare with their peers on customer service items, things like check-in experience, in-flight experience, in-flight entertainment, all of these things and enable our partners to drill down literally to the root level and understand how they're performing versus their peers. We've also started working with partners to help provide them with some of our forward-looking demand data for revenue management. And I think, honestly, we're just getting started. So I think when you look at all of that and you think about what our more sophisticated players are doing in the airline space, I just think there's tons of opportunity for us to create value with United with all of our other carriers. I think we're about five months out from contract expiration. We've always been very excited about having this type of discussion with United. But listen, at the end of the day, this is a platform. It has market level economics. And to the extent that United, for whatever reason, decides to go a different direction, no one of our carriers represents more than 1% of our revenue. We've got very strong relationships with our real lead carriers in the U.S. Our customers shop at Expedia because they're largely carrier-agnostic and certainly we have a lot of experience with what happens when we have certain outages or not. But when I look at the value that can be created by expanding the pie as opposed to focusing on dividing it, I think for both strategic and economic reasons, I would find it completely bewildering if United decided to not engage in that discussion. But at the end of the day, they've got to make their choice and we will just move on. And I think United's competitors would be very happy with the outcome, but I think it would be value-disruptive to both of us, and that's not a place where we particularly want to end up. And I suspect that they really, in their heart of hearts, probably don't want to end up there either. Operator : Next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Mark, just kind of curious, I mean, we're obviously in a moment in time as it relates to the way that many of the companies in the OTA space are creating marketing efficiency goals and the ROIs that they're trying to target within their advertising. We talked about it before. You guys have clearly been a beneficiary of this. We saw this obviously in trivago's numbers yesterday and your results today. Curious if you have a view on how stable this environment that we're in is and to what extent having other competitors for keyword buys, retargeting buys, pulling back from the market has sort of benefited Expedia's profitability or growth and what your expectations for that are going forward. And just merchant side of things, well, I completely understand and have seen in your numbers that the take rate or commission piece of this has been relatively stable. We've seen in prior negotiations, structural changes, things around pricing parity and last room night availability. I'm just curious to the extent that you can share with us or give us some direction whether or not you're seeing the hotel partners or Expedia pushing for certain structural changes within the operating agreements that you have with your hotel partners. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. I think, Heath, on the marketing efficiency side, I wouldn't say that we are at steady state right now. I think we're currently benefiting from what has largely been a step change in our approach and some of our competitor's approach to marketing. And I think we will, as we move through the back part of this year, get to more normalized levels where we've got the non-incremental spend out. We understand with much more accuracy what our returns are and we can start to lean back in, in a more disciplined way. So again, I think we're not quite there, but I think it's been a good benefit, I think, for all of us. Obviously, it has been a headwind on revenue because even inefficient marketing spend does generate some revenue. And we're looking forward to the back half of this year, not only for our core OTA business, but also for trivago to essentially start from this new base and start really pushing into efficient, balanced growth on a much more regular basis, on a go-forward basis. I think as it relates to our relationships with our big chain partners, there's nothing specifically that I would call out. I think, again, the general theme for us has been let's find new ways where we can tailor our arrangements to better match the value that ultimately these partners get from our channels. Let's find ways through programs like Accelerator, programs like TravelAds to give you more control around getting the volume when you need it. And I think beyond that, we are looking at other unique ways where we can work together beyond just powering packages and doing other unique things that leverage our platform capabilities. But it's not really one thing. It's really -- we're really trying to be very flexible and tailor our approach on a strategic partner by strategic partner basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : So first for Alan. Alan, regarding your comment on revenue acceleration in the back half, can we read the commentary as applicable to the room nights as well? And then secondly, on Vrbo bookings growth, I realize the headwinds from comps and the SEO issues from brand consolidation, but is the benefit of online bookability penetration gains fully achieved at this time? And also, considering the scale of marketing investments, is it smaller compared to what you are doing at last year? Wondering about this kind of deceleration in the face of ongoing investments. Alan Pickerill : Yes, Deepak. On the room night, I mean, there are definitely some connections between my comments on revenue and room nights. There are things like Easter being a first half issue is comments to both. I think one thing we've talked about before is that from a room night growth perspective, trivago at meta generally and trivago specifically has been a reasonably meaningful headwind for us on room night growth as we've pulled back and as they've kind of reset the business. If that goes according to plan and they start to normalize in the back half of the year, get back to growth and just by virtue of the comps that we have there, that should start to ease and we should see some benefit from that in the back half of the year. We will have lapped the -- a lot of the marketing optimization that we did in 2018. And so I think that can have an impact as well. So definitely some connection between the revenue and the room night trends that we'll be seeing there. And as I said before, we're quite happy with the core business. It continues to just basically hum along. And so we think that will be as good or better as we move forward. Mark Okerstrom : I mean, Deepak, on Vrbo, listen, the team, over the course of the last three years, has done just an exceptional job of getting a big book of offline business online. I think what you're seeing right now is getting to some of those harder yards associated with getting that offline and online starting to actually reach a flatter part of that penetration curve. I think that's absolutely happening. But again, the real story on gross bookings and online gross bookings deceleration has really been around these platform changes that we've made that has taken some of that business because it was offline and maybe we've lost it to other parts of the industry and, of course, platform and brand streamlining as well. So that's really been the story. And then in terms of marketing investments, I think we're still pleased with the return that we're seeing at the marketing -- with the marketing investments. I think the story there is, again, we're just lapping over something that went from 0 to 60 pretty quickly and now we're at cruising altitude. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore. Anthony DiClemente : I had two. How much of the performance or the strength that you saw in the quarter outside the U.S. is being driven by improvements as a result of the property supply growth and acquisition that you've embarked upon in Europe and other areas and any corresponding marketing around? I'm just trying to get a sense for how much of the strength is sort of year two or that as opposed to better stability in the macro environment. And then my other question is just in terms of Vrbo and the investments there. I know that you're trying to compete in urban and international and growing supply in urban and international. And so -- but just wondering, is the goal to drive consumer engagement with those newer listings primarily on Vrbo? Or to what degree are you thinking about integration of those listings on Expedia.com as well? Mark Okerstrom : The new inventory that we've added is performing very nicely. I think though it's really just part of the overall formula, which is adding new inventory, making sure that inventory is actually selling through, through good, solid disciplined performance and marketing and then having much more locally relevant user experiences, getting content right, getting translation right, making sure we've got local payments. So I think it's a combination of all of those things really starting, again, starting, we're still early stages here, starting to show some real promise in terms of better customer engagement and repeat rates and more efficient growth. And we're hopeful that we can just keep this going. As we mentioned last quarter, we really have ruled this effort into business as usual. We are targeting a broader set of markets here in 2019 in addition to continuing to improve in our initial wave one markets. With respect to Vrbo in terms of where we're investing and the goals in terms of driving consumer engagement with alternative accommodations, I think it's really going to be a combo of driving Vrbo and expanding it globally as a really best-in-class single product type focused player and then also bringing that inventory on to our core OTA brands. Our core OTA brands have incredible urban demand already. In general, they've got very strong and actually strengthening international demand footprints. So I think in the initial stages when we add new properties -- alternative accommodations properties, having integration on to the Core OTA brands is going to be a big boost, but we have no question that Vrbo with their unique user experiences, their focus on family and friends, the collaboration tools that they're building that are truly unique and best-in-class, we have no question that Vrbo does have the potential to be a real strong growth driver and generate real strong customer loyalty in its own right both here and the U.S. and then importantly, in international markets and really extend it back into the urban markets on its own. Operator : Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Chris Kuntarich : Yes. This is Chris on for Lloyd. Maybe a few, if I can. We've seen some of your peers migrate away from the traveler fee model. Just curious how disruptive a change like that would be for Vrbo and if you think industry forces would really kind of move you in that direction. And then we've seen a little bit of news lately that some of the hotel brands are starting to compete in the vacation rental space. And was just curious if that inventory is something you guys would expect to get on the platform and how those take rates would look relative to a like your core lodging business. And then maybe one on your Add-On Advantage product. I think it's been about a year since you guys have rolled it out. And I was just curious if you could give us an update on what markets that product is currently in, some of your early learnings there and maybe how we should be thinking about the program rolling out to additional markets and the potential integration of other products like vacation rental into it. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. On the traveler fee, Vrbo is in a fortunate position in that they've got the complete menu of monetization options between traveler fee plus subscription and traveler fee plus pay-per-booking, pure pay-per-booking model. And they're really looking at trying to find ways where they can match the monetization model with the inventory type, what the supplier is interested in doing, what consumers are willing to do. So I think any sort of migration to or from the traveler fee is something that essentially Vrbo is very well equipped to handle and is, in fact, driving a lot of these changes and testing itself across its own supply base. In terms of the hotel brands competing in the VR space, certainly we have seen that. The recent announcement by Marriott is not particular -- it's new for them, but we have had other players, including the core, be active in this space. I think it's super interesting. I think that the alternative combination space is one that is right for some degree of professionalization. If you look at the big hotel operating companies and chains, boy, they are really good at this stuff and really providing a great guest experience. So I think, generally, it could be a really good thing for the industry to add this type of professionalization to the space. And I think we're very hopeful that we can help our partners as they develop these new inventory types just like we have with all of their other ones, help them to get them to market and get them in front of the right consumers and at the right time. With respect to Add-On Advantage, it's alive here in the U.S. It has been for a while. We have rolled it out to a number of international markets. It has been pretty darn successful here in the U.S. It's been moderately successful in other parts of the world. But getting this right is a combination of two important things. One is getting the product right. And the product is super compelling. Buy a product and then ultimately you can add other things to it over time. It incents people to essentially get these bundled deals. And then, of course, once they've got everything in one place, it's super easy to change and cancel. We can handle everything at once. We update itineraries. I mean, the value proposition is there and the product is really getting significantly better over time. But the second piece, of course, is merchandising and marketing. And that's where the team continues to experiment with Add-On Advantage and does that resonate with consumers in other parts of the world as much as it does in the U.S. But like everything, I mean, we are just continually testing. We're continually striving for better. We like what we see go far -- so far. We know the product is super compelling and we're just evolving the way that we market it over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. You guys are a very data-driven company, sort of very analytical. I guess, could you sort of talk us through some of the main KPIs that you're watching in the markets where you've rolled out the new inventory and the new supply you've added over the last couple of years just so that investors would kind of get an understanding for the merits of your investments sort of paying off. What are you watching and what are you seeing in these markets? And then, Mark, can you talk to us about the way you think about loyalty, the importance in sort of investing in loyalty program to potentially build a stickier customer base? Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So as you can imagine, being a data-driven company, we just look at a ton of KPIs in terms of success, but let me just give you some highlights. Really, at the core of what we're trying to do here is be locally relevant. And locally relevant is a piece of customer centricity. So how do you measure that? Well, we take a look at customer repeat rates and try to understand, are we creating more sticky products with what we're doing in terms of everything, from inventory acquisition to being more locally relevant? We're looking at does adding more inventory give us access to new customers as we add essentially new destinations with real competitiveness, new keywords, new metasearch placements. We're taking a look at room night growth. And importantly, we're taking a look at domestic room night growth and saying, hey, are we actually driving incremental room nights? Or are we just shifting share among our partners? We're taking a look at marketing efficiencies. And importantly, we're also taking a look at -- for the partners that we add, are we driving bookings to them? Are we becoming more relevant for them? So those are just some of the metrics that I would call out. I would say that, generally speaking, in all of these markets, the metrics are moving in the right direction. We're learning as we go. We don't get everything right, but it is a constant optimization effort. And as you can tell from us baking this into business as usual, this is absolutely the right way to go. In terms of loyalty and the importance of building that, building a stickier customer base, listen, I'll just say that we're strong believers in the fact that the best loyalty program is an incredible product and that we are dead focused on providing a customer-centric product, a locally relevant product. And that is the core focus. But we do believe that our loyalty programs, the Hotels.com program stay 10 nights, get one free is super additive to that story. In addition to having a great product that Hotels.com does have, it adds that extra thing that is a real value and a real differentiator for them. And I think for the Expedia, the Brand Expedia program, the Orbitz program, also similar stories. They're very focused on building a great product, but again, that caret of moving up the loyalty tiers and getting better status with maybe a bit better treatment, a bit better amenities when you show up at the properties are all just little things that make the product just a little bit different, a little bit more differentiated and ultimately we believe can turn into better customer share of wallet and better customer retention over time. Operator : Our final question will come from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : So I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the SEO headwinds you called out for HomeAway from the brand consolidation. Our recollection from back when HomeAway was an independent company was that this was an issue that they had to navigate slowly. So are the headwinds you're calling out, I guess, a more rapid pace of brand consolidation you have put in, so at some point you just have to comp these? Or are you consolidating the sites one at a time into mainly Vrbo? Alan Pickerill : Sure, Stephen. So I would say SEO headwinds for every player in the Internet have been a story for a long time. Google is absolutely taking free and moving it to paid and moving from paid to more qualified like they're during in hotel ads products. What we've done with Vrbo though, of course, has been on top of that. And Vrbo and essentially HomeAway and all of the brands that they've had internationally traditionally been actually quite dependent on SEO. And as we have consolidated platforms, it has changed essentially the linking structure of those brands and ultimately resulted in bigger headwinds for them. In some cases, there are places where we can recapture this. I think in Vrbo, for example, the teams have got great playbooks in place. And even as Vrbo has changed platform structures, we're marching up. We're seeing good metrics and there are signs that things are moving in the right direction. But with some of these brands, some of these regional brands, it will be something where, by and large, we're just going to have to comp it and lap it over time. And we'll move past this. Again, we're a long-term player. We're very much focused on building great brands and building great customer relationships and growing them internationally. We're backing Vrbo as the primary brand and we're optimistic that Vrbo has got a long runway ahead of us and it will move past some of these transitional issues like we're seeing with SEO. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Mark Okerstrom for closing remarks. Mark Okerstrom : Great. Well, a big thanks to all of you for listening today. I especially want to thank all of the Expedia Group employees around the work -- around the world for your hard work this past quarter. I'm just incredibly impressed with the collaboration that's happening and the progress I'm seeing across the Company. I'm just so excited about what we can achieve together. I look forward to speaking to all of you next quarter. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentleman this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Michael Senno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael Senno : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's Financial Results Conference Call for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2019. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Mark Okerstrom, Expedia Group's CEO and President; and Alan Pickerill, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 25, 2019, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content, including today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable efforts. These items include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange, returns on investment spending and acquisition-related or restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period. Finally, on April 15, Expedia Group entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Liberty Expedia Holdings in an all-stock transaction. For details on the proposed transaction, we will refer you to the information in our SEC filings. The deal is currently pending approval from Liberty Expedia stockholders with the shareholder vote scheduled for tomorrow Friday, July 26. We do not plan to take any questions related to this topic on today's call. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Michael. In Q2, we, once again, saw solid execution across the company and built on our operating momentum. Our strong results through the first half of the year are evidence of the continued progress we're making on our transformation underpinned by our key strategic themes. Being locally relevant on a global basis is guiding our focused market approach where we're seeing nice progress in international markets. We're focusing on being more customer-centric, adding features and functionality to better serve travelers. For example, we're rolling out a virtual agent platform, which is already driving improved customer satisfaction and increasing the efficiency of our customer service. This year, our efforts to increase the speed of execution and innovation have evolved into a new third strategic theme around fully leveraging the power of our global platform. We're collaborating across the company and operating more and more as one group than ever before. We're increasingly unlocking opportunities to cross-sell between brands. For example, Vrbo customers are now able to book rental cars and other products powered by Brand Expedia. Our teams are also leveraging best-in-class systems and technologies across divisions. For instance, Hotels.com recently migrated to Brand Expedia's system for collecting post-stay reviews, and is already benefiting from additional features and an improvement in content. And these are just the tip of the iceberg. We have many other opportunities to drive customer and partner-facing innovation and increase operating efficiency by better leveraging the scale of our platform across Expedia Group. To that end, we've recently begun a design process with the goal of realigning certain teams across the company to enable them to better execute on this platform approach. All of these efforts are squarely aimed at driving better customer and partner experiences as well as stronger long-term growth and value creation. Our continued progress on these key strategic themes contributed to healthy financial performance in Q2 with top line growth accelerating and adjusted EBITDA increasing 23% year-over-year. Our Core OTA segment continues to lead the way as we see positive results from the playbook, we're executing to drive our lodging business. Core OTA room night growth was a healthy 12% in the quarter. We're confident that continuing to push targeted supply acquisition along with focusing on locally relevant content, product innovation and strategic marketing investments will lead to healthy top and bottom line results across our Core OTA business going forward. A key tenet of our playbook is our supply acquisition effort where we continue to see nice results. Excluding Vrbo listings, we added over 40,000 properties to our core lodging platform for the sixth consecutive quarter and expect that elevated pace to continue as we move through the year. Including them now approximately 570,000 integrated Vrbo listings, we ended the quarter with nearly 1.3 million total properties on our core lodging platform. Vrbo eclipse 2 million online bookable listings in the second quarter, and over 1.3 million of those are now instantly bookable. The team continues to navigate the brand and platform transition we discussed last quarter. And although, gross bookings growth remained modest, we saw growth trends improve throughout the quarter. While we still have a lot of work to do, we continue to see an attractive long-term growth opportunity, both at Vrbo and across Expedia Group in the alternative accommodation space. Egencia delivered healthy profits in Q2 with adjusted EBITDA increasing 24%. The Egencia team continues to be disciplined in cost management while enhancing its product offering with new machine learning-driven features and increasingly leveraging the Expedia Group platform capabilities to provide a better customer experience. As we further differentiate our product, we're confident we can deliver strong growth and share gains over the long term in the managed corporate travel segment. Trivago posted another quarter of healthy profitability, while revenue decline slowed as its marketplace continue to stabilize and trivago started to lap last year's marketing optimization effort. With comps largely normalized heading into the second half of the year, the team is making targeted marketing investments to drive growth. In addition, as trivago highlighted yesterday, it continues to evolve its product and test new features aimed at enhancing its marketplace, which should provide a benefit over time. Overall, we expect trivago to return to revenue growth in the second half of the year, and they remain on track to deliver healthy profits for the full year. In closing, we're making nice strides in transforming the company as we push forward on our key strategic priorities. Our operating momentum and healthy financial results throughout 2018 and now into the first half of this year are evidence of our enormous potential. While we're still early in our journey as the world's travel platform, we are confident that continuing to rigorously execute on our plan will lead to sustained growth for many years to come. With that, I'll turn over to Alan. Alan Pickerill : Thank you, Mark. We are pleased with our performance in Q2 with both gross bookings and revenue increasing 9%. Excluding the negative foreign currency impact to each, gross bookings grew 11% and revenue was up 12%. Both total lodging revenue and stayed room nights also grew at solid 12% in the quarter. We continue to see nice momentum in our Core OTA segment. The healthy room night growth Mark mentioned contributed to an acceleration in revenue growth and an 11% increase in adjusted EBITDA despite tougher comps as we started to lap the marketing optimization benefits from last year. Our approach to marketing remains balanced and disciplined, strategically investing in key marketing channels to drive growth, particularly, as we expand our supply base and attract new customers. That balanced approach has our Core OTA segment well positioned to deliver solid growth for full year 2019. Vrbo gross bookings increased 2% in the quarter as we continued to work through the brand and platform changes that we have discussed previously. Stayed room nights grew 8% in Q2 and we expect continued modest room night growth in the back half of the year. Revenue at Vrbo was up 17% year-over-year due to approximately 25% growth in transaction revenue, while the decline in subscription revenue moderated to 7%. Transaction revenue benefited from continued optimization of our fees and further mix shift of transactions to pay per booking listings. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% in the quarter as we invested behind the Vrbo brand across marketing channels. We plan to continue investing in the business as we navigate this transition period to position Vrbo to capitalize on the significant opportunity in alternative accommodations longer term. Total advertising and media revenue was up 4% in Q2 and increased 8%, excluding a negative foreign currency impact. Media Solutions posted another quarter of over 20% growth, while the revenue decline at trivago moderated as the comps began to ease. In our Air business, ticket volume increased 10% benefiting from new enterprise partnerships at Expedia Partner Solutions that launched in late 2018 along with growth at Brand Expedia. Revenue per ticket declined 7% due to a reclassification of certain fees to other revenue, in addition to a negative FX impact and a shift in product mix. As a result, total air revenue was up 2% in the quarter. Turning to expenses. We saw a nice leverage on overall cost, resulting in almost 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. While total expense growth was above Q1 levels, it was in line with our expectations as we continue to execute on the same formula : combining strategic marketing investments with disciplined overhead cost management to deliver attractive profit growth. We saw nice leverage on cost of revenue, which grew 6% in Q2, primarily due to higher cloud expenses. We continue to expect cost of revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of the year, but we now expect cost of revenue to grow approximately in line with revenue for the full year. Total selling and marketing expense increased 7% in the second quarter. Similar to last quarter, trivago accounted for the leverage with declines in both direct and indirect selling and marketing. Excluding trivago, direct selling and marketing increased 15% due to higher brand investments and performance marketing costs in part to support our international expansion efforts along with partner commissions related to the growth at Expedia Partner Solutions. As I mentioned earlier, we started to lap the marketing optimization benefits we saw last year, which were most notable in the second and third quarters creating tougher comps and direct selling and marketing this year. Technology and content expenses were up 9% year-over-year driven primarily by increased headcount as we invest in product and platform enhancements across the business. General and administrative costs grew 7%. As expected, cost growth was above Q1 levels mainly due to more difficult comps and higher growth in professional fees in Q2. We remain on track to see nice leverage on general and administrative costs in 2019. In total, overhead expenses increased 4% as we continued to take a disciplined approach to managing these costs. As Mark highlighted earlier, we are increasingly operating as a platform company by leveraging technology to drive automation and collaborating to reduce duplicative activities. We're starting to see some early benefits and expect additional efficiency gains in 2020 and beyond. Importantly, we expect our platform approach to spur further innovation and contribute to healthy revenue trends over time. Moving down the P&L, we also saw a nice leverage below the line. Depreciation expenses increased just 4% as we continued to benefit from lower data center CapEx. Net interest expense declined year-over-year and our adjusted tax rate was 22% in Q2. These factors, taken together with our strong operational performance, led to very healthy adjusted EPS growth of 29%. In terms of capital allocation, our overall approach is the same as it's been for several years : balancing opportunistic M&A with share repurchases and our dividend. Looking ahead, the strong organic growth potential for our business and declining capital intensity leave us well positioned to deliver attractive free cash flow over the next few years. As demonstrated last year and based on the landscape we see today, we currently have an incremental bias toward deploying a greater portion of our excess capital to share repurchases in the coming years. Also note, we remain on track to close Liberty Expedia acquisition pending their shareholder vote tomorrow, which will reduce our share count by 3.1 million shares. Turning to our financial expectations for the full year. We are increasing the low end of our guidance range and now expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% to 15% in 2019. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect modest adjusted EBITDA growth in the third quarter due to the expected retroactive impact of the French digital services tax as well as tougher comps at trivago and from the ramp-up of our marketing optimization efforts last year. We then expect adjusted EBITDA growth to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter. One other item to note, we anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be a bit higher in the second half of the year than it was in Q2. Overall, the formula that led to our strong performance in the first half, healthy revenue growth combined with strategic marketing investments and disciplined overhead cost management, is the same formula we plan to execute going forward. And we believe continuing to progress on our key strategic initiatives, which are all aimed directly at driving that same growth algorithm, will position us to deliver healthy growth in 2019 and beyond. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question today from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : I had a question about the advertising ROI environment. Can you give us more color on ad ROI trends? As it looks like your room nights accelerated but your ad spend also accelerated above that. So how much was Expedia kind of getting more aggressive versus changes to the environment or just seeing more volume? Mark Okerstrom : Kevin, I think it's been largely consistent with the trends that we've seen over the course of the last number of quarters. The same really factors exist in our business as they have in the past, which is we continue to optimize our marketing spend, making sure that we're getting the incremental bookings and that we're being very disciplined around the rest of the whole marketing piece. But as we expand internationally, ultimately you end up with countries that you're expanding into that have a greater proportion of their mix being in more performance channels. And as those markets are growing faster than domestic, ultimately, they can result in the acceleration of sales and marketing growth. And certainly, that's something you could expect to see from us over time. But again, the formula here is that you build a position in a new market over time, you start getting more and more loyal repeat customers. And each of these markets, which maybe from the start less efficient than a mature market like the U.S., actually becomes more and more efficient over time as you build your brand position. So the overall environment largely similar and really -- it's really a geographic mix story for us. Alan Pickerill : And Kevin, I would just add some of my commentary around the direct marketing spend last year. Q2 and Q3 are particularly tough comps there. Those were quarters when we were really getting after the overall marketing optimization. And there was quite a lot of goodness there in terms of leverage and we're comping over that. So that's part of the relationship between direct selling and marketing in this Q2 if you're comparing it to kind of what you saw in Q1. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Two quick ones. So first one on Vrbo. As you navigate through the challenges in the business and then as you move toward brand integration efforts that you talked about in the last quarter under the Vrbo brand internationally, how should we think about the magnitude on timing of sort of the marketing investments that you're required to make this push internationally? It doesn't sound like there is incremental investments in 2019. Is that more a 2020 event? Or should we expect a more gradual investment? And then second one on core. The 12% growth was really good improvement from last quarter. There was obviously some noise with Easter timing benefit, et cetera. But with international business particularly showing good results from the all the initiatives that are put in place over the past few quarters, do you think the core business is on track to kind of deliver improving growth continuously over the back half? Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Deepak. I'll take the first one and then I'll turn it over to Alan for the second one. The plan for Vrbo around international expansion is really we'll be looking look through the back half of this year and then into 2020 to really start to do the bulk of the, call it, brand consolidation works internationally. As we do that, we will start to put more money against the Vrbo brand. But again, as we do with the rest of the business, I mean, we're really looking to take a balanced approach here. We do it at Vrbo, we do it across the Core OTA business. I would also say that our international expansion efforts and our urban expansion efforts, as it relates to alternative accommodations, are in part Vrbo, but they are also part of the Brand Expedia and Hotels.com story. So Brand Expedia, Hotels.com have or building meaningful positions in places outside of the U.S., places like Europe, places like Asia, Latin America where Vrbo doesn't have a presence. A lot of that demand is real-quality urban demand. But they've also got great demand in resort and other destinations. So as we build the Vrbo brand and as we start to add international and urban inventory over the course of the next 18 to 24 months, the story is built Vrbo but also drive demand into those new partners as they come on the platform through the rest of the Core OTA brand. And that will help essentially us do this in the most efficient and effective way. Alan Pickerill : Yes. And Deepak, on your second question. I mean, I think the first answer really is that we're quite pleased with the execution in the Core OTA business. We're happy with that 12% room night growth that we saw there in the second quarter. We do have significant efforts, as you know, underway to grow the business internationally. And we think that we are seeing good execution there and benefits from that. As far as how to think about the trajectory into the back half of the year, I would say that we have many initiatives underway to help continue to deliver healthy room night growth as well as acceleration where we can find it. But I wouldn't necessarily count on vast acceleration in the back half of the year. We're comfortable with where we are. But the long-term story is that we're looking to drive as faster room night growth as we can. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Naved Khan : Two questions. One on Vrbo and one on international. On Vrbo, I think, Mark, you talked about some improvement during the quarter in the booking growth trajectory. Can you shed some light on it? And also in the face of these SEO headwinds and the platform changes, and when do you expect to start to see sort of return to more normalized growth trend in the Vrbo business? And then on the international front, if I look at the international room nights, there was a nice pickup. Obviously, Easter probably contributed to that. But even ex that, it looks really strong. What are the factors contributing to that other than Easter, I would ask? Mark Okerstrom : Great. So on Vrbo, we did see some acceleration in the quarter sequentially from month to month. But I would say, listen, the overall story for Vrbo is that if you adjust for Easter and a few other factors, the Q1 to Q2 story was broadly consistent. The team is working hard on all of the tactical improvements that they need to make to get predominantly the SEO volume back on track in addition to continuing to drive essentially best-in-class marketing efforts and delivering amazing products to both their customers on the travelers' side and then also their hosts. And the team has come a very, very long way on that front. So we're comfortable with the activity the team is doing. How that plays out in terms of growth rates, we're kind of expecting more of the same for the next couple of quarters. We're going to try to do our best and the teams are doing their best to do better. But we're probably into 2020 before we see a meaningful pickup. And I will tell you again that underneath all of this is very healthy growth we're seeing at the Vrbo brand itself. This really is a flanker brand story and underneath is kernel of a real healthy business. Alan Pickerill : Yes. And then as far as the international room nights, I think that you hit the nail on the head, Naved. The execution is good. We're seeing progress internationally in our focus market. We've talked extensively about all the efforts underway to close supply gap to make sure we've got locally relevant content across the board. And there's still a ton of work to do around the world but we do think that we're starting to see some good results there. Easter was a contributor factor as well and plays a decent role, especially in Europe. But overall, quite pleased with the execution there. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin Patterson : I wanted to double click on Mark's earlier comments on the third strategic theme, leveraging the global platform. You've had many of these brands for a while. Could you talk more about why you're focusing on collaboration now? And any investment or conversely savings that you expect to realize around this? Conceptually, it seems like this could be a net benefit to conversion rates, marketing ROI and your local relevance initiatives. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. Listen, we're super encouraged by what we're doing. And the real goal of this is that as we look across the company, we've just built some incredible technologies that exist throughout, some incredible capabilities on the marketing side. And aside from the fact that they exist, which is great, there is this huge opportunity for us to actually leverage that across the business. And historically, how we would manage this business was largely and essentially brand silos. And our belief is that by leveraging actually not just best practices, but really sharing the technologies across our businesses, it will actually be able to do things that none of us could do independently that make the product better for our customers and do so in a more efficient way. And the great thing is, if you take, for example, the Hotels.com post-stay review example that I mentioned, where they're using Brand Expedia's post-stay review platform, they got essentially a better product, better content, more features. And the team at Hotels.com that was working on that actually was able to go and work on something else that actually our customers can see as well. So it's one of these things where as long as you do it, as long as you do it right, you set things up the right way organizationally, you can get the -- sort of the magic of more effective and more efficient. I think for now, as it relates to brand strategy, we're happy with the brands that we have and what we're not saying is that we're doing some big consolidation effort. But what we're saying is that a lot of our brands have very unique value propositions. And there are ways where we can cross-sell amongst them and treat each other like essentially partners almost like third parties would do as opposed to being super focused on just competing with one another. And we think that is unlocking opportunities like the example I mentioned with respect to Vrbo actually putting Brand Expedia offerings available for Vrbo customers. So again, it's early in all of this, but we're very optimistic about what we can unleash across Expedia Group by doing this more effectively over time. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Benjamin Wheeler : This is Ben Wheeler on for Mark. I was just wondering if you could please provide any commentary on the macro environment in Europe, travel landscape in terms of what you saw in Q2, maybe your outlook heading into Q3, any specific commentary on regions like the U.K. given delayed Brexit decision. And secondly, I think you mentioned in the comments about continued modest growth in room nights in the Vrbo for the rest of the year, is that relative to the 8%, meaning does that imply a deceleration or is this just kind of more of the same? Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Ben. With respect to overall macro, I think it's largely a continuation of the same. I mean we've been seeing for some time healthy RevPARs but a slowdown in RevPAR growth, healthy airline metrics but a slowdown in a lot of the key metrics and a slowdown in the growth rates. So I don't know if whether we're at the top or we've sort of reached the plateau, I think the longer we go down this road, the more it feels like we might be set for a softening period. But it's nothing that we would call out right now. With respect to Europe specifically, again, it was largely a continuation of the same thing, the U.K. softness that we saw around the initial, call it, drama around Brexit, really did subside a fair bit once they extended the date. I wouldn't say that it's back up to full strength. But it is better than it was. And then with respect to the rest of Europe, again, it seems relatively stable to us and there wouldn't be much change that we would call out. Alan Pickerill : Yes. And Ben on the Vrbo outlook, as you know, we don't guide on room night growth. And so I don't want to be very specific here. I think for us, modest is not relative to any of the other quarters. It's just an objective term. And I would just encourage you to take a look at the recent trends across the business and come up with your estimates. But we're expecting modest room night growth and -- sorry, gross bookings growth, as Mark said, for the rest of the year until we get into 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : You're optimizing revenue pretty nice for Vrbo. Your commissions are still, I guess, smaller or lighter than what your competitors are. How much more room do you think you have to optimize for commissions? And then my second question, you're sort of seeing some larger companies start to get decent investments that are optimizing around Vrbo and some of the other alternative accommodation platforms. Do you ever think about investing in some of these platforms and just trying to get closer to your supplier base, particularly, as you think about growing internationally? Alan Pickerill : Yes. Thanks, Jed. So on the revenue and the take rates for Vrbo, as you know, the team has continued to test and learn to adjust and optimize as we've moved through the periods. And that continues to be part of the story here. Where we've got opportunity, we'll test that out. And if it looks like it works, then we'll go ahead and take advantage of that. But we're trying to just make sure that we've got a real reason and tested way of adjusting those. And I think the take rate on a trailing 12-month basis is about 10.7%, revenue divided by gross bookings for Vrbo. I think our understanding is that the industry envelope there looks to be kind of in the 10% to 15% range. And so we'll continue to navigate kind of in and around there. Mark Okerstrom : And then, Jed, with respect to some of the, call it, alternative accommodations, kind of, professionalized property management platform type things, and I think I know the ones you're talking about; we've looked at it from time to time. To be honest, it's not our core business. And so we have to date shied away from getting too deeply involved in it. I think some of them are interesting. We've never been a huge fan of exclusive inventory arrangements because we're not sure they're kind of sustainable over the long term for the asset owners and often those are the types of things that go along with platform like us investing in one of those type players. So I think do we -- have we thought about it? Yes. Have we done it? No. And listen, never say never. As we look forward, we're always interested in looking at interesting opportunities in the space. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : I know there've been a lot of questions along the lines of advertising efficiencies, but wondering if you can give us a little bit of a sense of sort of what your view of the competitive landscape is. Obviously, you guys have been able to do a really good job of maintaining the kind of bookings growth that you have and getting marketing efficiencies at the same time, whereas across the rest of the space, we've generally seen a more negative impact to bookings or revenue growth from these efficiency initiatives. Just kind of curious, to the extent that you can give us a sense of what you feel like is driving that and sort of what role the competitive landscape plays there? Would appreciate that. And then to the extent that -- the headlines in recent days about the growth in metasearch and the hotel direct channel sort of leveraging that, how you're seeing your relationships with hotels, particularly, around things like, as we've asked about before, the loyalty rate programs and direct booking initiatives evolving, particularly, given Google's continued push into travel? Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Heath. I think with respect to ad efficiencies, there is one story that has been around for a while and remains consistent. And that is there is a large advertising channel in the space, which is Google, who on one side is an absolutely great partner of ours and we're very happy with our work with them on international expansion. On the other side, they are a big player in the space. And they continue to do what you would expect, which is try to optimize their revenue over time. And that means that SEO is getting smaller, traditional, SEM is taking up more of the page and traditional SEM is being replaced with metasearch type product. And that has an impact essentially on the overall industry. For us, and I won't comment on what others have done, our position is a bit unique, which is we have some incredibly strong brands and properties in certain parts of the world. And we can be very disciplined about our marketing spend in these performance marketing channels, and understand with pretty good levels of granularity, what is incremental and what is not, and just get much better at optimizing our marketing spend. You saw us do this last year and we continue to do it today. But on the flip side of that, we also have got a huge growth opportunity for us in that we just don't have the property coverage that we could have across the globe. And as we've ramped up our property acquisition efforts and started to add more properties onto the platform and have been able to enter new auctions that we weren't in before, we're able to build this growth factor underneath that essentially fills the gap that you might otherwise be created by the marketing efficiency or optimization efforts. And then it's not to say that there hasn't been some impact to the top line, I think there certainly has. But it has been offset by just the underlying growth factor that we're driving with a lot of our locally relevant, globally themed push. With respect to our relationship with the large chains, listen, I think it's a good. I think we've got -- and I would hope they would say the same thing; we've gotten to a point where I think we both realize that everyone brings something unique to the table. We think they do a lot of great things for the industry; they do a lot of great things for customer. And we do a lot of things that aren't in their wheelhouse. And so the conversation is really about how do we leverage each other's strengths and create shared value as opposed to some sort of tug-of-war fight. It's a conversation that we started a couple of years ago with our great chain partners, it continues today. And it's a conversation that we increasingly have been having with our airline and other partners as well. And we think it's absolutely the right way forward. Operator : We'll hear from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two, if I can. One, there's been a lot of talk in the industry about getting more exposure to local and experiences and increasing basket size and sort of evolving the shopping experience for people on your platform. Maybe just give us a check-in on where you are on the asset front there? How you're investing against that opportunity? And then I just want to make sure I understood some of the key messages. As you look at maybe starting to reap some of the rewards from some of the investments on the hotel side from Europe, where could we expect you might make other investments globally to think about increasing supply and with it 6, 12, 18 months later possibly and hopefully increasing efficiency? Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Eric. With respect to experiences, just as a reminder, I think the last time we disclosed a number, we were north of $0.5 billion in bookings in terms of activities. The team, over the course of the last year or so, has really done a great job just reimagining the strategy there, building capabilities and starting to put us in a position where we can start to really ramp this up in a more effective way, and ramp it up in a way where we're adding more providers essentially to the platform at a faster pace. And on the other side of the platform, we're more intelligent about how we're offering it to people that have made bookings across the Expedia Group host of brands. So I think we got a big business. I think it can be a lot bigger. Very happy with the strategy we've seen in place from the team. And I think it's a great opportunity for us. And again, this is one of these products that just has a lot of potential, but in a big business like ours, where lodging ends up really in the roof, sometimes these things get underfunded. We are putting more capital into it right now and we're optimistic that it can be a bigger driver going forward. In terms of where else we can make investment to increase supply, listen, I think as we said on the last quarter or the quarter before, this whole locally relevant globally thing supply push, it has become business as usual. So the answer to your question is kind of everywhere. And we do have a road map in terms of where we want to go next. It's dictated by size of the untapped opportunity, ease of going after it, network effects between from country to country. And we're executing a pretty clear playbook here. And we think there is lots of opportunity in pockets all over the globe. Operator : Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Christopher Kuntarich : This is Chris on for Llyod. Maybe going back to market said about your mix moving more towards international, as you guys start to get some of the traction with your supply acquisition efforts. Some of those markets are skewed more towards -- you'd call out that some of the markets are skewed more towards performance versus direct bookings. So maybe how should we be thinking about the growth at direct versus performance bookings on a global basis over the next 12 to 24 months? Mark Okerstrom : Sure. Well, I think direct is a channel where it does continue to get stronger in our mature market. It's also something that gets -- it gets stronger in every market in which we focus on. And the only issue, if you can call it an issue, is that when you're going into these new markets, you're building brand presence, you're introducing yourself to customers, and then they have a great experience, and you deposit them into your direct channel going forward. Our app transactions, the last time we disclosed it, Hotels.com and Expedia were growing at 50% year-over-year last year. So it's working. But you do see essentially as you drive into these international markets, even though the spend that you're making most cases is basically profitable on a unit basis, is not as profitable as the base business. So when those international markets are growing faster than domestic, it just takes a while to get the overall international picture to look more like the domestic period. I mean, it takes multiple, multiple, multiple years. So we could see again, as we start to get traction, sales and marketing deleverage. But again, remember that in each individual country we're going after, the goal is to make sales and marketing get more and more efficient over time. Operator : We'll hear from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Mark Okerstrom : You there, Brent? Brent Thill : Yes, sorry about that. Just on the comment about leaning into the share repurchase a little harder, can you just remind us what you have left on the plan? Where you're at it? I think that is the [indiscernible]. Can you just give us the recap of where you're at right now? Alan Pickerill : Yes. I think there's a -- we've got an existing authorization of 12.2 million shares outstanding. So -- and I think the authorization is discussed periodically at the Board level. So it's not necessarily a gating factor in any event. Operator : Ron Josey with JP Securities has our next question. Andrew Boone : It's Andrew Boone on for Ron. I think Expedia transitioned Air to the cloud in 2019. Can you provide an update there whether you're seeing any additional benefits of cross-selling or conversion? And then secondly, I think you talked about car rentals now cross-selling on Vrbo. Could you just add any additional color on conversion or anything else you're seeing with kind of cross-selling on Vrbo? Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So this year, we are putting ourselves in a position to essentially be capable of putting our entire lodging business essentially end-to-end and our Air business into the cloud. We're ramping up volume both on lodging and Air as we speak, and we're going to continue to do that through the back half of the year. I would say moving to the cloud on Air has the similar benefits that it does across the business, which is better resiliency, less downtime, higher speeds and then also it just unleashes a whole bunch of capabilities around AI and other things that ultimately need more elastic compute capability than is generally efficient to do within your own data centers that have fixed capacity. So again, it's -- we're in the process of rolling out the Air platform. We're putting traffic into the cloud. But we expect there to be a good positive story there as we have seen in the other parts of the business. With respect to cross-selling on Vrbo, what we've done is essentially as customers go and book their vacation homes on a Vrbo, they are presented with the opportunity to book a rental car or a flight or any of the other product or activity, any other products that Brand Expedia offers basically right there on the side. And it's branded Brand Expedia. And we've seen a good uptake of it. It's just makes things easier. Obviously, Expedia is a very trusted brand. And again, it's a really -- it's a great example of what we can do. But it's encouraging. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Tom White with D.A. Davidson. Thomas White : I just wanted to dig into the international room night growth pick up a bit. I feel like maybe a couple of quarters ago; you sort of tried to maybe disavow a little bit of the notion that because some of these priority markets were smaller that we shouldn't expect that they were necessarily going to have a big impact on kind of consolidated room night growth. Is that -- is your view of that changing for some reason? Or is there kind of something else maybe helping out international as well? I guess, specifically I'm wondering maybe you guys benefiting from sort of moderating competitive intensity on some of the variable marketing platforms from some of your competitors. Mark Okerstrom : Right. Well, the two major dynamics that have been happening in international room night growth over the last couple of years, put Easter aside, all these quarter-to-quarter movements, is that we have been adding incremental supply, lodging supply. That has really fueled incremental room night growth for the business. But the international markets that we're going into are markets where the metasearch channel is also pretty significant. So you've got basically a headwind on room night growth, which has been driven by what's been happening with the big metasearch platforms slowing down that again has been masking, if you will, the growth that we see underneath from us adding new inventory and executing on the locally relevant playbook. So as we move through the back half of the year, the trivago comps get a little bit better, And you started to see a little bit of that this quarter as well, not a ton. But in any event, those are the two factors. And once the trivago and another metasearch channel comps ease, we should be in clear skies. Thomas White : Okay. Great. And actually one quick follow-up, if I may, just on the guidance. So if my arithmetic is right, it looks like kind of the implied second half growth rate of EBITDA is a bit of an acceleration versus the first half. But it seems like you guys have a bunch of sort of tailwinds that would be kind of helping you guys in the back half of the year. Alan, maybe could you just walk us through kind of the moving pieces to the guidance, and maybe what's changed as far as how you're going to do this...? Alan Pickerill : Yes. Tom, if you are looking at Expedia Group in total, including all of the businesses and trivago too, which is the way we guide, then, the all-in guide assumes much faster growth in the first half than you would see in the back half. Now that is coming entirely -- almost entirely from the comps for trivago and just how their year is developing. So they're delivering healthy profits throughout the year. But they are delivering it on a comp of loss-making EBITDA in the first half of '18 compared to profits in the second half of '18. So that's the biggest difference. If you look at it excluding that, then you would see that the growth rates are in and around similar ranges first half to second half. Some puts and takes obviously in there, but not any real start differences. Operator : Next we'll hear from Lee Horowitz with Evercore ISI. Lee Horowitz : Two, if I could. I guess, on domestic, you've seen kind of steady room night growth, 8%, 9% over a number of quarters now. I guess, to what do you owe the stability of room night growth in your core U.S. market? And then one on international, if I could. Take rates have come under pressure a bit over the last couple of quarters, perhaps, as you've expanded into your focus markets. I guess how you're thinking about how take rates should evolve as you take share in some of these focus markets? Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Lee. Listen, the domestic story is essentially us just -- honestly, it's just executing on the playbook in the U.S. that we've had for a very long time. And that playbook results in share gains. It is us putting money behind our big brands and we have many big brands that are very relevant in the U.S. It's us continuing to innovate on product features and functionality as we have been doing. You can see the Brand Expedia app, for example, now versus what it was three or four years ago. It's just phenomenally improved. It's us continuing to add incremental lodging inventory, both just inventory that is traditional conventional lodging and there is -- there continues to be some of that, that we don't have and then also alternative accommodations. And it's us particularly on our multiproduct or multiline of business brands such as Brand Expedia getting much better at essentially cross-selling and bundling activity through features like the quasi-shopping cart type functionality that we've introduced over the course of last couple of years. So it really is the playbook for us and it enables us to grow faster than the market and we -- our goal is to -- for that to continue to be the case for a long time to come. Alan Pickerill : Yes. Lee, and then your second question about our international revenue margins. I don't think there's any big story there. You're right that they have been kind of inching down over time. I think there is a couple of factors that play year. Overall product mix in international markets plays a role. I think mix between countries obviously can play a role because we don't have the same exact margins in every country. And in certain countries and areas, we do continue to make some minor adjustments here and there to our overall take rates with our hotel partners as we add the supply, making sure that we're going into those countries at market levels. But nothing major going on there. Operator : We have a question with Mark May with Citi Unidentified Analyst : This is Zach on for Mark. I believe Google recently made some algo changes in the May or June time frame so just curious what kind of impact you're seeing in your share traffic, if any, for both your Core OTA and Vrbo segments. And second, raising the low end of your EBITDA guidance, just curious if we look at any of the major expense items whether it be cloud migration or marketing. Have there been any significant changes relative to your initial plan you set out in the beginning of the year? Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Zach. With respect to the Google algo changes, this is just business as usual for Google and it's kind of business as usual for a large internet player. So there's nothing specific that I would call out from that. And then Alan, do you want to take the second one? Alan Pickerill : Yes, I think the primary factors there is really around the fact that we've just had a strong start to the year. And we started the year with a wide range of 10% to 15%. Given what we've seen in the first half of the year, we're comfortable going to a tighter range and kind of taking the low end off the table. There are some factors that are at play here that can go either direction. Clearly, trivago's year is panning out as they had -- as they -- largely as they had expected and described at the beginning of the year. But it is still relatively new territory for them, so some variability there. FX and macro obviously can work for us or against us. There's this new digital services tax in France that when enacted is going to be actually a headwind for us in the back half of the year. And then lastly, we just -- in terms of our guidance, we like to maintain some of flexibility to make some additional decisions as we move through the year to make investments where we think are appropriate. And so we kind of consider all of that as we put the range together. But overall, I'd say we're really executing -- we feel like the teams are executing well, and we're pleased with the momentum that we've seen so far in the year. Operator : That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mark Okerstrom, CEO, for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Okerstrom : Great. Well, I'd just like to say again thank you for joining the call, and a huge thanks to all the Expedia Group employs around the world just for your continued dedication and hard work as we press forward on our transformation efforts. We've made huge progress. But I'm incredibly excited about the opportunity in front of us. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Michael Senno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael Senno : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's Financial Results Conference Call for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2019. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Mark Okerstrom, Expedia Group's CEO and President; and Alan Pickerill, our CFO. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, November 6, 2019 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content, including today's earnings release.. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable efforts. These items include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange, returns on investment spending and acquisition-related or restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Michael. Although our room night growth wasn't a healthy range in Q3, adjusted EBITDA was lower than we expected, primarily due to a few key factors. We saw incremental weakness in SEO volumes, and a related shift to high-cost marketing channels. We saw lower average daily rates than we expected, which weighed on our lodging results and profit was softer than expected at Trivago and Vrbo. The majority of the ADR impact was in North America, which slowed more than we anticipated, while ADRs also came in light in Asia due to negative macro and geopolitical events. We expect the softer local currency ADR environment and makeshift to high cost marketing channels to continue to have an impact over at least the next few quarters. As discussed on their call yesterday, Trivago saw volatility in their market place related to new advertiser features they introduced, that contributed to lower than expected revenue and a significant year-over-year decline in Q3 adjusted EBITDA. Gross booking and room night trends at Vrbo also remain muted, and we incurred additional costs related to our payment processing migration. As a result, we have reduced our 2019 profit expectations for both Trivago and Vrbo. Given our third quarter results, and the expectation for continued impact from the factors we experienced in Q3, we are lowering our full year 2019 guidance for adjusted EBITDA growth to 5% to 8%. Over the past several months, we've been in the process of realigning teams across the organization, and overtime we expect these changes to improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. That said, with many people focused on that effort, it did likely impact our ability to anticipate, and react to the dynamics we saw during the quarter. In terms of the changes we've made, we've brought several customer facing functions closer together to help us collaborate more effectively and scale our international expansion efforts. We brought supplier facing teams closer together to better serve our travel partners and realigned many of our tech and product teams to drive increased collaboration, innovation and scale. These changes position us to draw better top and bottom line growth over the long term, and they will take time to realize the full benefits of this effort, the teams are eager to begin driving improvements. In spite of the disappointing results, we saw several positives in the quarter. Volume trends in Q3 were solved as we delivered an 11% increase in total stayed room nights, led by healthy 12% room night growth in our Core OTA segments. Domestic room night growth accelerated in Core OTA, and we continue to gain share in the U.S. Our execution on supply acquisition remained solid as we added again over 40,000 properties to our core lodging platform in Q3. We also increased the number of integrated Vrbo listings to over 650,000 and in total, we ended the quarter with more than 1.4 million listings on our core lodging platform. We are seeing progress on our initiatives to increase customer centricity and local relevancy, which are aimed at building customer loyalty and increasing our direct business. In total, the direct channels at our OTA brands are growing faster than the overall business, but by strong growth and mobile app. Expedia Partner Solutions continues to deliver solid results, and is also growing room nights ahead of the overall business. A recent agreement to become Marriott's exclusive optimized wholesale distributor is a great example of the power of our platform and technological capabilities, and we are seeing a long run way of opportunity at our partners solution business going forward. And Egencia had healthy quarter of new client signings, and delivered double-digit room night growth as benefits from increasing hotel attach rates. Although we were disappointed with our results in the third quarter, we understand the near term challenges and are actively working to navigate them. At the same time we are encouraged with our progress in many areas and are optimistic that we can further build on those trends as we execute on our key strategic themes, being customer centric, being locally relevant on a global basis and unlocking the full power of our global platform. Despite near term pressures, we remain confident that this strategy will position Expedia Group to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead of us, leading to healthy growth and attractive returns over the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan. Alan Pickerill : Thanks, Mark. In Q3, we increased both gross bookings and revenue 9%. Total lodging revenue growth was 11% in line with state room night growth, but given the factors Mark discussed, in addition to the headwinds we previously mentioned for the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was flat in Q3. At Vrbo, gross bookings increased 5% in the quarter, revenue was up a solid 14% driven by approximately 20% growth in transactional revenue, which represented more than 90% of Vrbo's revenue for the first time. Revenue growth was partly offset by continued investments in both performance and brand marketing to support the Vrbo brand and higher payment processing cost as Vrbo accelerated the shift to Expedia's Group payment platform.  As a result, adjusted EBITDA for Vrbo increased just 3% in the quarter. We expect the similar dynamic in Q4 with higher marketing investments as we head into the peak booking season. And additional cost related to payment processing, putting pressure on adjusted EBITDA. Total advertising and media revenue grew 3% year-over-year and was up 6% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Similar to the past few quarters, revenue declines at Trivago were more than offset by strong 18% growth at our media solutions business. Looking ahead, we see a nice runway of growth for media solutions as we increasingly leverage the reach of our global platform. Air revenue declined 3% in Q3 with lower revenue per ticket partly offset by solid growth in ticket sold. Revenue per ticket was down 10% largely reflecting a reclassification of certain fees to other revenue, in addition to shift in product mix and FX headwinds. That was partly offset by 8% ticket volume growth as we continued to benefit from new enterprise partnerships at Expedia Partner Solutions. Turning to expenses, cost of revenue grew 14%. Cloud expenses contributed 500 basis points to growth as we migrate more compute to the cloud. The inorganic addition of bodybuilding.com, which we acquired in the Liberty transaction added over 400 basis points to growth, although it did not have a meaningful impact on adjusted EBITDA in Q3. In addition, the French digital services tax contributed nearly 300 basis points to cost of revenue growth as we recognize the full year-to-date amount since the tax was retroactive to the beginning of the year. Because of the addition of bodybuilding.com and the digital services tax, we now expect cost of revenue to grow faster than revenue for the full year. It's worth noting that the global tax environment is rapidly evolving, and several other countries are currently considering adding transaction level taxes. It's still too early to know the specific implications, but we are continuing to closely monitor these developments.  Total selling and marketing expense grew 11% with direct selling and marketing up 14%. The increase in direct selling and marketing was due to partner commissions at Expedia Partner Solutions related to growth in that business, and higher investments in both brand and performance marketing in part, because of the shift in the high cost marketing channels we mentioned earlier. Indirect selling in marketing declined 5%, reflecting a reclassification of certain expenses to technology and content, and lower people related cost along with declines at Trivago. Technology and content cost growth was essentially in line with revenue for the quarter. Cloud expenses contributed approximately 250 basis points to growth. We continue to expect technology and content expenses to deleverage for the full year. In terms of our cloud migration, we continue to progress as planned. We are on track to largely complete the lodging stack by the end of this year, and expect to be positioned to complete the air migration next year as well as push further on our other products and back-end systems. We expect 2019 cloud costs to come in slightly lower than $250 million. We are still completing the planning for 2020, but based on what we know at this point we anticipate cloud expenses to be in the neighborhood of $350 million next year. General and administrative expenses increased 8% year-over-year largely due to higher professional fees and approximately 150 basis points of inorganic impact from bodybuilding.com. Looking below the line, depreciation expense growth remains muted, increasing just 3% as we continue to benefit from the lower data center CapEx over the past few years. Adjusted net interest expense decreased year-over-year or adjusted tax rate increased to 25% in Q3, which resulted in adjusted EPS declining 7% year-over-year. Year-to-date through Q3, excluding CapEx investments for our new headquarters, free cash flow increase a solid 15%. In the third quarter, free cash flow decreased more than usual due to a shift in the timing of certain payables and the comparison to settlement payments received last year. The balance of the change in Q3 related to supplier payments for merchant bookings from the first half of the year given the normal seasonality of our business. Looking ahead, we see an opportunity to drive further improvement in cashflow conversion over time. Turning to the balance sheet, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to issue a $1.25 billion 10-year note with a 3.25% coupon. Our approach to managing the balance sheet is unchanged, and we continue to operate within an investment grade credit rating. In addition, during the quarter, we redeemed $400 million convertible notes that we held following the Liberty Expedia deal. On the capital allocation front, we resumed share repurchases following the completion Liberty Expedia deal, repurchasing $418 million in stocks since Q2 earnings. Together with the Liberty Expedia transaction we were pleased to have brought in a total of 6.3 million shares so far this year. Moving to our financial expectations for 2019. As Mark noted earlier, our updated guidance of 5% to 8% adjusted EBITDA growth reflects the mix shift into high cost channels and the lower than expected ADRs, both of which we expect to continue to play a role over the next few quarters. In addition, we now expect lower full year 2019 contributions from Vrbo and Trivago. Overall, we are not satisfied with our results and will continue to navigate these changes over the coming quarters. We do however remain confident that executing our strategy will strengthen Expedia Group's position in the market and lead to share gains and healthy growth over the long term. Operator, we are ready to take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Couple if I can. First, just on the SEO challenges, can you maybe give us a sense of which brands or which goes or maybe what Google products are causing the most disruption? Any color you can give us there would be helpful? And I guess as a follow-up, specifically looking at the vacation rental category and Google moving to kind of mimic what they did in hotel with vacation rental, wondering does your strong presence in their new unit, their metasearch unit offset some of the SEO challenges removing kind of organic links further down the page? And when Google -- what do you expect in terms of the timeline for Google starting to charge for that product and kind of what kind of impact could we expect from that? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Lloyd. So the SEO challenges were I would say, things that we saw across multiple product categories. They were things that in some cases, we saw across multiple regions. So the impact was it was really something we felt a little bit more broadly across our multi line of business brands than we did the lodging specific brands. And generally, what we saw was a continued shift of essentially the freed links further down the page, by other modules that were inserted and ultimately a shift of traffic from the SEO channel over to some of the other products whether it's flight metasearch or hotel metasearch overtime. Now of course as related to the hotel product, the lodging product we are able to pick up some of that volume and that ultimately resulted in spending more on sales and marketing than we had otherwise would have. We are happy with the returns that we saw on it, but ultimately, not as good returns as we would see from the SEO channel  With respect to the VR category, right now it's pretty small, and it's something that we are actively looking at in terms of evaluating that product and looking at whether something that we think is going to be a good thing for us over the long term and not. But right now, it's still pretty small. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Thanks guys. Mark Okerstrom : You are welcome. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : A little more color, please, behind the lower ADR trends in Asia. Is that just -- a lot of that is just political turbulence around Hong Kong, but any other color there? And then any update on the ability to diversify more into social marketing channels, Facebook and the like, and whether there's possible -- there are any improvements there? Are you seeing the ability to tap into commercial intent? Or is that still far away? Thanks a lot. Alan Pickerill : Yes. Mark, this is Alan. So on your first question on the ADRs. I would just say a few things as you dissect those numbers. First is on a reported basis, the ADRs we're reporting are pretty consistent through the year. The key there is that the foreign currency impact was much more of a negative in the first half and much less of a negative in the back half year. And so that kind of masks the actual kind of decline we're seeing in terms of local currency. Relative to our expectations, we did not forecast the degree of slowdown in ADRs in North America that we ultimately ended up seeing. And in the industry, you can see that industry analysts and hotel companies also are just kind of systematically reducing their expectations on room night economics as we move through this period. So that's the largest area. In APAC, I think you're exactly right to point out the protest in Hong Kong. Some tensions between other countries is having some impact on travel and on ADRs, and we're certainly seeing that in our business, as well. Mark Okerstrom : And then, Mark in terms of social media marketing channels, we have seen some interesting progress in some of the social media channels, Instagram, for example to some extent, Facebook, largely around influencer-type campaigns. It's much harder to measure than traditional performance marketing channels. So it's tough to get a real read on the ROI. But in terms of just some of the softer metrics we're seeing around awareness and some of the other social metrics that you can take a look at, they are interesting but still in the grand scheme of things relative to other performance channels pretty small. We continue to see good progress around digital video. We see good progress and we continue to like brand marketing which has been something that's been part of our overall toolkit for a very long period of time, but again on social nothing that's significantly sort of needle moving at this point. Mark Mahaney : Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Justin Post : Thank you. Could you give us an update on the Vrbo rebranding and do you think you can start seeing better results next year? Are we near a bottom? And then secondly, you mentioned the cloud expenses up a 100 million next year. Anything else we should be thinking about when we do our 2020 models on a big-picture basis? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Justin, on Vrbo listen we continue to be happy with the trends we're seeing at Vrbo. They continue to see growth rates in the double digits, continues to be healthy. Unfortunately if that is swamped by some of the SEO impacts and some of the re-platforming work and sort of pulling spend away from some of the regional brands. The plan is to rollout the Vrbo brand in more markets over the course of the next couple of quarters and Vrbo does plan to put some marketing spend against those rollouts and then there will be further rollouts across 2020. In terms of better results I think we're going to see the next several quarters. We expect there to be continued muted growth rates and then we're optimistic that once we get past the lapping over some of these changes that became more acute in the first half of this year that we should be in a spot where we're able to return to growth rates that were more satisfied with. Alan Pickerill : Yes. And then Justin on your question about things to think about as we head into 2020, I would just say to be clear and as usual for us at this time we are right in the middle of planning for 2020, so nothing specific to share. You mentioned the cloud impact that is one factor. These factors that we laid out in our prepared remarks on SEO headwinds, mixed into higher cost channels and the lower ADRs are things that we think will continue to impact us for the next few quarters. As Mark mentioned, it will take a little while we think for Vrbo to get back going the way we want it to be going and certainly contributing from a profit perspective. So those are some of the things that would be I guess in the category of headwinds. On the other hand we are pushing forward on international expansion efforts. We're seeing good results from our supply acquisition efforts as you can see from our sustained room night growth. We continue to focus on driving direct business and seeing good results there and as we've mentioned, the Expedia Partner Solutions is doing well. We also will obviously work to manage our overhead costs very tightly as we have this year and we'll continue to do that as we move through 2020. So I think those are some of the factors that I would consider. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. I would just add to that was in the long term opportunity here the playbook we're executing skill very much does remain intact. I mean the focus areas we have around customer centricity for example are really focused on helping us deliver much better loyal customer relationships seem to squarely aimed at actually decreasing our reliance on a lot of these performance marketing channels that are causing us some angst I think are locally relevant globally effort. I think as Alan mentioned, we're going to continue to move out into international markets and we continue to be happy with the progress we're making on the supply efforts. And listen the recent organizational changes that I spoke about in my prepared remarks are going to set us up well to much more effectively leverage a lot of the technical assets we've got across the organization, the data assets we've got at the same time align our customer facing and partner facing teams just to better execute on the full strategy we've got in place. So long term opportunity remains very much intact and we've got some near-term headwinds that we're certainly navigating right now but we're confident we'll be able to get through this. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two if I can. One just following up on Vrbo, I guess just trying to discern out how much of this really is about the rebranding versus is there a change competitive landscape and shared accommodations? Obviously some of your competitors are trying to go after growth, some trying to highlight that growth and some of their own comments. Just trying to understand how much of this is within your control on the inventory level, on the execution level branding versus what you might be seeing for the broader competitive landscape for those that are likely to book shared accommodations? That's number one. And then number two, I would love to get a little bit the color on the Marriott agreement. I thought that was sort of an interesting nuance and highlighted by the company at your quarter. Maybe give us a little bit of color on the underlying premise behind the agreement and how you think it plays out in what you're able to bring the market via your partnership with Marriott? Thanks so much. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So listen with respect to Vrbo, we can certainly point to things that we have done in terms of platform consolidation, reducing spend on certain flanker brands and point to direct impact on our topline trends. That's that I think it's hard to ignore the fact that the overall competitive environment continues to be well competitive. But that said, Vrbo has got, it's got an excellent brand particularly here in the U.S. We're pleased with the growth rates we're seeing against that brand. They have got a great value proposition in terms of a lot of these large whole homes that exist that are great for groups and family and certainly they're working on continued customer facing and partner facing innovation to really press on that advantage. So again, I think to the core question is a competitive or is an internal I think it's a combination of both, but we remain optimistic that through great execution on product development, continued international rollout of the Vrbo brand, getting the inventory from Vrbo on to the core OTA business to help bolster that international expansion with ultimately more demand. All these things are things that point to a brighter future than Vrbo then certainly we've seen over the course of the last couple of quarters. With respect to Marriott, listen we're very pleased with that relationship and that deal, I think it's a unique first of its kind type arrangement and I think it's just an example of how we can bring the power of our platform to bear for our partners. We've really established an incredible network of connectivity and distribution reach across Expedia Group and what we're able to do is help Marriott basically make sure that they are having their rates in inventory displayed in a way that they intend them to be displayed for their customers and we think it's a great leverage of what we've got and I think it helps them achieve what they want to and we're optimistic that ultimately this will be the first of many because we think it's a great relationship. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Kevin Kopelman : Hi, thanks a lot. I just had a couple of follow-up questions on the change in the EBITDA trajectory. First could you talk about the increased payment processing cost and what were those and are those ongoing or more one-time in nature? Thanks. Alan Pickerill : Yes. Thanks. Yes, so Vrbo has been using a third-party for payment processing and we made the decision to move the payments on to the Expedia Group stack so that will become the merchant of record for those. In order to make sure that we had a seamless transition there and that it went well, we put in place some incentive payments if you will for the third party processor and that's what we're referring to. Those were accelerated based on this, the pace at which we were moving the volumes over. So not only were there expenses, but we pulled some of them forward from what maybe would have been in 2020. So that's the nature of what we're seeing. There will be an impact of those in Q4 as well. Mark Okerstrom : And again, I think that the rationale for getting onto the Expedia payment stack, we've got an excellent payments platform that has a broad array of payments methods, international exposure, world-class fraud detection, very good merchant arrangements with all of our providers. So we're confident this will unlock more growth for Vrbo going forward and we just need to get through this transition period. Kevin Kopelman : Great and then just a follow-up on Naved\u2019s question earlier about SEO, can you give us just more details on kind of specific changes that you saw in the search chain all that led to some of that SEO traffic ending up more on a pay traffic? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. Again a lot of it was around either different modules that they were introducing into search results that were putting traditional SEO links down the page and then in some cases just steering more queries over to the hotel ads module or to the Google flights module than they had been doing historically which ultimately just resulted in a traffic shift and as we were prominently featured in the Google hotel ads product of course we were the recipient of that traffic. Again pretty pleased with the returns that we see in that channel but not as good as they were in the place the traffic was coming from. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, very helpful. Mark Okerstrom : Yes, you are welcome. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Deepak Mathivanan : Great, thanks for taking the questions guys. Mark, sorry to be the dead horse on the SEO issue, this has been an obviously recurring and kind of highly volatile theme for several years now. Can you help quantify the exposure right now I mean you have for SEO traffic at this time and then you noted that you expect the issue to sustain for a few quarters? But what is the broader long-term strategy to steadily mitigate the exposure from traffic standpoint? Do you think is it more branding or are there any other kind of marketing programs that you can scare to offset some of the impacts from this? Thank you very much. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. Thanks Deepak. Well, I will tell you the SEO exposure is shrinking all the time. It is one of many sources for us and we haven't gotten into the specifics of how big it is, but it is becoming less important to us over time for better or for worse. Listen, the strategy to mitigate is really what we've been talking about is being much more customer centric and for us that means ultimately developing better loyal customer relationships so that we have customers come back to us directly. We've been very focused on for example, building out great feature functionality in our apps and across many of our brands working to ultimately provide differentiated features in the apps that are differentiated offers in the app that lead customers to come back to us directly. Obviously just having great product across the board whether it's in the app or elsewhere as part of the strategy as well we've got great rewards programs both at hotels.com, stay 10 nights get one free and then the Expedia rewards program again another reason for people to come back to us ultimately directly. And then, in terms of channels again we have been ultimately optimizing our marketing spend in some of these performance channels over the course of the last year and a half or so and ultimately putting more money into more of the branded channels. We mentioned some of the things we've been doing around influencers which is not huge yet, but that's part of it but also just television and digital advertising where we can really feature more prominently the brand and build the brand and really scream what's different about the brand has been part of the formula as well. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it, thanks Mark. Mark Okerstrom : Yes, you're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Jed Kelly : Great and thanks for taking my questions. Just with the success you're having rolling out core OTA outside the U.S., do you ever think about unifying your vacation rentals more through the Expedia brand than the hotels.com brand? And then, on your comments on ADR do you think that's more macro driven or are we finally seeing some of the alternative accommodation providers have more of an impact? Mark Okerstrom : Thanks Jed. Listen in terms of unifying the VR through [Indiscernible] we're taking a bit of a hybrid strategy. So one of the things that we have done as part of our recent organizational realignment is brought the partner facing or host facing teams closer together between the main OTA team and the Vrbo team with a view at a minimum having a more consistent go-to-market strategy and more alignment so that as it relates to our partners they really don't have multiple places to go to. They've got one. I think that's part of the equation. The other side of it is as we get more of the inventory from Vrbo onto brand Expedia and hotels.com over time it will provide us with the opportunity to drive more incremental volume to new properties internationally as we sign them up. Our plan is to still rollout the Vrbo brand and we'll be thoughtful about how we do that, how quickly we do it, how much money we put against it but really the end state here is that we do end up having at least in a number of markets pretty broad portfolio of brands where we've got the multi product brand and brand Expedia that has alternative accommodation. You've got some of our single lodging providers like hotels.com also providing them of course you've got Vrbo which is dedicated to it as well. But again, part of the goal is to harmonize on the partner side and then distribute where we can through as many brands as we can. Alan Pickerill : And then Jed, this is Alan. On your ADR question, I would say that the big factor there is going to be the macro trends and you can kind of see that throughout the industry. I would say our exact ADR trends do not match exactly with the industry and I do think that's because of mix. You referenced if there's an impact from vacation rental, I think to the extent that we're integrating Vrbo's vacation rentals and our core lodging team is adding alternative accommodations as well around the edges that could have a little bit of an impact, but I don't think it would be meaningful at this point. The other factor is, there is some geo mix in there so certain countries where we're strong versus other countries where we're weaker do have different ADR just different overall ADRs ours and so that plays into it as well but really the big story here is that the macro slowing. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Naved Khan : Yes, thanks a lot. It's Naved Khan from SunTrust. Maybe the clarification on the ADR, how much of the on the decline when I guess it's macro related, but how much of that is really travelers sort of trading down meaning booking lower price point hotels versus lowering in price point by the hotels across the board? And then, you talked about sort of the SEO changes impacting maybe more of the non-lodging kind of products versus lodging. Is that a fair characterization and how should we think about that impact across different geos? Mark Okerstrom : So Naved, on the first one it's really hard to say how much is travelers booking lower price point hotels versus the broader slowing that we're seeing. I would say that the slowing that we saw is not dramatically different from what we're seeing across the overall industry. So Alan called out rightly that there may be some mix impact in our channel. It's hard to call it specifically that it's consumer behavior or a trade down at this point. In terms of the SEO impact, I think the impact is pretty broad. It's just that when you have a lodging only provider, the only see it in one channel versus if you got multi-lines of business like the air activities, car etcetera. You can feel it in other lines of business. And in some cases those other lines of business can drive lodging business is well in terms of attach. So, it can have a bit of a larger impact on the overall business even though as between lodging and the other products in total, it's not that big of a difference. Naved Khan : Got it, thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Justin Patterson : Great, thank you very much. Can you talk about how OTA sensitivity differs today versus the last lodging cycle? It does seem like there is some more incremental headwinds this time through and it doesn't seem like some of the counters technical elements of OTAs are kicking in. And then, secondly on in the organizational realignments. Could you highlight how this realignment is a different function of the past ones and how we should think about the timelines toward seeing operational efficiencies? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Justin. Listen, I think OTA is in a cycle in terms of will be in that what we saw during the last slowdown. I think we continue to be in a good spot. I think we are much larger than we have been historically. And therefore our importance as a channel is more significant. What we've seen in past cycles is that corporate and meetings business starts to essentially get shrunk essentially as corporate start tightening the belt. And that ends up creating more of a spot market in our channel where our partners are able to discount and in many cases discount in more opaquely as either through our hotwire product or through our packages product so that ultimately they can offer incredible deals to our customers in a way that doesn't undermine the overall pricing structure. I think that continues to be a big opportunity for us. I don\u2019t think they were necessarily at that point in the cycle yet. You continue to see occupancy rates continue to be pretty healthy for us and healthy for the overall industry. So, I think if we were going to see as it's a bit earlier. I would also say that in terms of our position unit downturn, we have introduced a bunch of new products that help our pretty in our lodging partners target customers more effectively in a way that goes beyond just traditional discounting or travel ads product for example. Is a product that is more of a sponsored liftings product which allows our lodging partners to get demand in a really targeted way when they need it? And that's just significantly more sophisticated today than it was in the prior year. So, I think it represents an opportunity. In terms of the organizational alignment, listen we have not done a ton of organizational realignment over the years but this one is significant in that. It does bring a number of teams together in a way that does really align well with our overall strategy. Bringing the partner facing teams together. For example, I talked about the way that we'll have a much more unified go-to market approach between Vrbo and our lodging team. That and our traditional lodging team and I think that's going to bear benefits over time. It really allows us to unleash a lot of the benefits that we can deliver across the whole platform to our partners. Like we have with Marriott, like we have with United Airlines for example, bringing together more of our tech and data teams are aligning them more closely, really allows them to be more effective and collaborating with one and another and finding opportunities where they can leverage these other technology, leveraging others code and redeploy resources against things that are more differentiated in terms of what our customers and partners might see. And then we brought across some of the functions in our customer facing team to be more effective in terms of international expansion to find more opportunities to collaborate with one and other in ways like we have done between Vrbo and brand Expedia for example. Where on Vrbo, you're able to book hotels and cars on brand Expedia you're able to log in with your brand Expedia login credentials. So, these are all changes that are aimed at unlocking new opportunities that are aligned squarely with our strategy. In terms of how long it's going to take to scale these things. Listen, it is going to take some time to realize the full benefit of what we're able to do here but we're confident that is going to make us much more effective and efficient as we realize those benefits over time. Justin Patterson : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Daniel Powell on for Heath. Just a couple of quick ones from us. First, we'd love to get from an update about where you feel you are on international supply expansion. Should we continue to expect to see pretty elevated growths in those supply ads or do you feel like they're getting to a point where you have pretty competitive coverage across major markets. And then secondly, just curious if you could give us an update on what you're seeing on the reward side both from your perspective and what you run through Hotels.com but also on the hotel side of things or the branded side of things and injecting rewards rate onto your platform. Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So, in terms of international supply expansion, we're pleased with what we see, we continue to add properties at a healthy rate on to the core platform. These include traditional conventional lodging and also include alternative accommodations. I think we're again pleased with the progress we're making in the priority markets on that front and pleased with the lot of the work we're doing to actually enhance our product to make it more locally relevant as you've seen with our international room night growth adjusting for Easter, it's broadly consistent with what we saw the last quarter. And I think it's a testament to some of the benefits that we're seeing. That said, we have seen mixed results in some of these markets depending on what's happening in various marketing channels. And as we add new properties, we have to be mindful of making sure that we balance in both supply and demand. So, I think the good news is we've got the capability to add more properties, we continue to add to our assortment which is fantastic. And I think as we continue to expand international, we're going to blend those efforts with putting resources against other efforts that ultimately might move the needle more effectively to help us be more locally relevant. In terms of the rewards programs. Again, we remain very happy with the Hotels.com rewards program, results in higher customer loyalty, nice repeat rates that we see in that business. We do think that it is overall accretive to the P&L and we're happy to have that program and is a very strong program. In terms of putting loyalty rates, other partner's loyalty rates on our platform. We've had good success with a lot of the partners that we have rolled out within, again we're eager to continue to work in that way and other ways with our hotel partners as we move forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question; I have two. Just to go back to the SEO issues. I guess, I think you guys last updated guidance on July 25th. Can you just sort of let us know around what period you saw the SEO issues start just so we can sort of think about the sizing of our partial quarter impact on your ad spend for bookings. So what do you think about full quarter impact in 4Q and to 2020. And then, on the comment about higher cost marketing channels, you just help us understand what are the largest one or two marketing channels you're moving dollars toward and then sort of bigger picture, what marketing channel are you sort of most optimistic about longer term that can maybe help you diversify overall paid bookings mix away from Google. Alan Pickerill : Yes Brian, this is Alan. Just in terms of kind of how the factors that we talked about on the call developed. We were you referenced our last earnings call, we were just finishing up the first half of the year. That was a pretty terrific start to the year. We were ahead of our expectations at that moment. And felt like the things that we saw in the business in the first half would carry out into the second half. As we moved through third quarter, we could start to see the impact from these SEO challenges and we also started to see the trends in ADRs working against us. And with particular strength as we got to the very tail-end to the quarter. So, that's how I would think about it in terms of the challenges and the timing. As I said, we do expect them to continue to be a headwind for us in Q4 and into 2020. On the just the last part of that SEO question in terms of where is the traffic going. I mean, I don\u2019t have a specific answer for you other than to say if you're just thinking about the Google platform to the extent that SEO is pushed lower on the page and people who normally maybe would have transacted through those links are moving to paid links. You're looking at SEM and Google hotel ads. And as Mark said, it's good we see good returns on those volumes except for the fact that volumes through SEO are essentially free to us. And so, going from free to anything especially the other Google paid placements can create a sizeable headwind for us. And then Brian, in terms of other channels, I mean we're actively spending more in digital video, we're spending more in traditional television. I mentioned experimenting with some of the influence or type things on Instagram and other social channels. As I think you know we've got a sponsorship for Champions League in Europe which we've been pretty happy with so far. So, the goal here is to help start basically accelerating our direct business and we were happy with the growth in our direct channels in the quarter. And overall, our strategy is to continue to actually differentiate the product and build more direct business over time. So, I think you'll see us continue to find new channels that are more branded in nature to help build our direct business. Brian Nowak : Alright, thanks guys. Alan Pickerill : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks. A couple of quick ones. You mentioned the lodging stack would recover by the end of the year. Does how does that match up with the original plans. You see accelerating trends as you apply best practices or a get scaled or optimized tools. And then, related does your stack switch make for a lighter shift. So, that's first question. Second one is just simply around, Mark you mentioned removing friction with the unified sign on at point of sales across Expedia and Vrbo. Is that predicated on just to do the move off of the Vrbo, third payment provider? And then we'd imagine you get incremental or better a fresher data and as you unify those two. And do you see that levered into better first party data, means better targeting amongst the whole platform, so tailwinds in targeting. Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Thanks, Brian. I'd say broadly the cloud migration is moving along nicely. It's always impossible to estimate exactly when you're going to get it done. So, we're pleased with the progress and I think where we thought we'd be at the end of the year versus where we are. I think we're broadly in line with where we want it to be. In terms or the air stack, I think the teams done a lot of great work to actually get ourselves cloud-ready. They're obviously that the lodging business for us is one of the biggest lists. And so, the air business and the teams done a great job. And I think that's something that we'll be moving in towards the end of this year and into the following year as well. In terms of removing friction, really what we are talking about is enabling Vrbo users to login using their Expedia credentials. From that point on, yes we're able to collect more information on them and tag more of their intent towards a particular user profile. And we are interested in making sure that we can deliver the most tailored and relevant experiences to our customers. I think that type of thing represents an opportunity for us to do that better. It is not related to the payment side of things. So, it's completely deferred. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Okay, you're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Jew with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Steven Jew : So, thank you. So Mark, anything you can share about the consumer awareness as well as the willingness to transact in the 650,000 Vrbo properties you've now integrated. And is that improving quarter-on-quarter year-over-year or are you seeing any sort of conversion rate headwinds. Because it seems like conceptually if you present people with more choice that should respond positively. And also trying to think about when some of the SEO headwinds for Vrbo should and could and because our recollection from when it was a publicly treated company, was that Google will de-rate one property versus another if they see the same inventory on both. So, now where are you in terms of integrating what properties that can be integrated from Vrbo to brand Expedia? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Yes Steven, so on the basically the performance of the Vrbo properties on the Core OTA side of things. It's still relatively small, it's growing very quickly and the teams have continued to test and when the right thing, the right time to present the properties. I think as a reminder, each of these properties essentially represents one unit as opposed to a traditional until then maybe call it 50 different units. So, the total volume potential of these is just smaller than a traditional property, but certainly when you present these to the right customer at the right time, they definitely improve conversion. You just got to be smart about when you present them and do it in a very targeted way because customers also definitely want to have some curetted results that are relevant just to them. In terms of SEO headwinds for Vrbo, listen I think the key is here is that we are really putting our weight behind the Vrbo brand and as a result of that it's done a bunch of platform consolidation work. Really we saw the step up in the headwinds from SEO really start at the beginning of this year and I think we're into the end of 2020 before we see those types of things lapping, but I think SEO is a headwind for everyone. In the internet I think you saw us call it out and that's why Vrbo has been pretty focused on defining a real differentiated value proposition, being smart about their brand spend and exploring more digital video type advertising against the Vrbo brand itself which is growing double digits. We like the progress we're seeing there. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is Andrew Boone on for Ron. I'd like to go first to your supply strategy just with 1.4 million properties that are now on the platform. Can you talk about your strategy with priority markets? Are there more priority markets today versus a year, a year and a half ago? Are you going deeper or you guys adding more priority markets? And then secondly, Google rolled out BERT a few weeks ago just with all the talk on SEO, if you guys had any impact there? Thank you. Mark Okerstrom : Sure. So in terms of priority markets we did expand the number of priority markets from the first wave that we did. And we are essentially going not completely broad. We have expanded the numbers, but we are trying to go deep and sure that ultimately we have a broad selection not only in the primary markets but the secondary and tertiary markets which is important to make sure that you can develop locally relevant product that ultimately customers will go back to again and again and again. So with respect to BERT listen I think Google continues to experiment with new products. I think where we see that the biggest impact is when those products ultimately take away real estate from what was traditionally free channel. So I think it's too early to call an impact on that particular product. But generally, the trend is that Google does continue to push for more revenue per visitor and I think it's just the reality of where the world is in the internet and the importance of Google at the top of the funnel. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Mark on Europe, I\u2019m just curious how that fared relative to your plan and your outlook Alan for Q4 directionally how you are thinking about the region? Thank you. Alan Pickerill : Yes. I think Europe saw similar type of ADR softening that we saw across the U.S. and some of the regions. I think so that was a factor for us. We were broadly happy with our volumes in Europe. Again, we've been in a number of those markets with our champions league sponsorship and some of the supply acquisition efforts that we've been pushing I think maybe a little bit isolated from some of the things that may have been happening there, but it was mixed. I mean we saw weaker in the UK again I think on Brexit concerns and country by country there were mixed results either because of things that we were doing and performance marketing channels or whether it was because of macro environment it was hard for us to tell. But broadly speaking we were comfortable with the way that Europe played out. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. I have two, first if you could talk about competition in the dynamic there in APAC in particular just with some of the local players they're really getting more aggressive from a global perspective? And then second, on holistic travel it feels like the market and other players are kind of just shifting more in your direction. Can you just talk about what you're able to do there just to continue to differentiate the products and platforms? Thanks. Mark Okerstrom : Yes. Listen the competition in Asia continues to be fierce. You've got a number of regional players that continue to do really significant discounting and a couple of PAN regional and global players that are doing the same. In many cases leveraging rates that maybe shouldn't be online and actually putting them online. So it does continue to be a pretty fierce environment for us and I think everyone in the region. We are having success in a number of markets in Asia, but in other markets it does end up being a little bit more challenging. We do have however with our Expedia Partner Solutions business the ability to tap into that market and we are powering a number of players in the Asia-Pacific region with our inventory both in APAC and then around the world as well. So we are able to benefit from what's happening there, but for our consumer brands it does continue to be a pretty competitive environment for us. I'm sorry on holistic travel, listen we continue to innovate on finding ways where we can leverage our flights and car rental and hotel advantage not only in terms of just actually being able to offer discounts, but also ultimately being able to in the future provide just more information on flight delays, etcetera even for hotel bookers. So the team's got a bunch of plans to actually build more in the way of the connected trips experience beyond what is our traditional core competitive advantage which is being able to bundle things together, have your itinerary all in one place and do so in a way that ultimately can deliver great savings for our customers. Doug Anmuth : Great, thanks Mark. Mark Okerstrom : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Tom White : Great, thanks for taking my question. Just to clarify a question on the mix shift to higher cost marketing channels. Was that more just sort of a passive event Alan that you mentioned resulting from the search platforms kind of prioritizing their own vertical search experiences and that impacting your mix or was it also, was there any sort of proactive steps that you guys were taking to maybe lean into CPC bids or specific higher priced channels to kind of try and preserve unit growth in the face of some of the pressures you talked about? And then just secondly, on the free cash flow conversion comment Alan, I'm just hoping you maybe you could provide a little bit more color there, any thoughts on magnitude or potential timetable that you can share? Alan Pickerill : Yes Tom. So, on the first question I would say more of the former than the latter. I mean it's if you think about what we described here, it's principally Google pushing SEO down the page and there's just a natural outcome of that. Obviously, the team is very dynamic and is constantly looking at opportunities and trying to do a good job of balancing room night growth with our overall profitability. So there are elements of that but for the most part I think it's more just the natural shift as SEO gets tougher to come by. On the free cash flow bit, I think we've been clear that we do expect over the long term to continue to deliver healthy and solid adjusted EBITDA which is where it all starts. The next main factor here is that we will be moving through and completing our Seattle facility and so that will provide a tailwind on our free cash flow. We expect to continue to see a good tailwind on our working capital flows as our merchant business continues to grow. So all of that together, we think adds up to a situation where we can drive healthy free cash flow and good cash flow conversion going forward. Thomas White : Thanks. Alan Pickerill : You bet. Operator : This will conclude our Q&A session for today's call. I will now turn it over to Mark Okerstrom for closing remarks. Mark Okerstrom : Well thank you all for listening today and a huge thanks to...",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Expedia Group Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Senno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael Senno : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's financial results conference call for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2019. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by our Chairman, Barry Diller; our Vice Chairman, Peter Kern; and acting CFO, Eric Hart. The following discussion, including responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 13, 2020 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the Company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content, including today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange, returns on investment spending, and acquisition-related or restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period. And with that, let me turn the call over to Barry. Barry Diller : Thank you, Michael. I haven't been on one of these analyst calls, and I don't know, endless amount of times. So, I'm probably a bit raggie. But, I won't ask your indulgence. I'll just kind of plunge in. Since December 4, which is when we made the management change, Peter Kern and I, not a day\u2019s gone by that we have not been engaged in Expedia business. And during this period of time, I mean, having been Chairman of Expedia for I don't know, I think almost 20 years or so, I thought I knew a lot about the Company. But, there's nothing like being on the ground, and we've been on the ground. And I've gotten to know the leaders of the businesses. And I'm definitely impressed. I believe in the future of Expedia as do my colleagues emphatically. We bought in the last couple of months $634 million of our stock, which is more than we've ever bought in an entire year. And we're not going to end that process now. But, what we've really done is we've taken as immediate steps as we can to refocus the Company on the day to day operations of -- and the execution for what the Company is engaged in every day. Last year, we spent probably nine months of the year on this massive reorganization. We're contemplating changing 350 I think of 500 jobs. It was vastly complicated process that froze us. Management at the same time didn't really have a clear path how to grow the Company. It's just kind of a top-down commandment to deliver x earnings. And that misled a lot of people into actions that kind of made sense for a quarter of a day and rest of the day, results of kind of this top-down pressure without understanding how to actually execute and simplify the business and give a clarity. We\u2019d somewhat become a kind of consultant-led and wildly complex business. I said and I think sporadic and bloated. And I'll give you one anecdote that kind of rang in my ears that I'd heard, I don't know, I guess a month or half or two months ago, kind of out there in Seattle, that at Amazon -- whole concept of working life balance that at Amazon, it was all work and no life; and then Expedia was all life and no work. Now, that's an enormous exaggeration. We've got wonderful people in the business. This is not damning or employees. But for several years, we really lost clarity and discipline. So, we're changing a great deal. We're stopping this too large complexity. We're simplifying our strategy. We're stopping doing dumb things and starting to do what we think are good things. So, from doing that dumb to doing this smart, here are a few examples. From wasteful activities that weren't core to our business to actually driving sustained growth, from every brand working in silos around the world to one strategy on marketing, and geographies across all of our brands, from our reliance on Google and metasearch, to aggressively moving to grow our own direct business and have loyal relationships with our customers. So, separate teams and data that's dispersed all over the place to one platform, driving the entire Company. From an air business we basically took for granted, it's just another line of business to actually prioritizing it, energizing it as a true competitive differentiator, and from chasing all these grand goals, to focusing on day to day execution and making that customer experience great. So, we're in. We're energized, we're enthusiastic, and from now on, I hope I think, you'll see the effect of that and the excellent people of Expedia and what we can all accomplish together. So, with Mr. Karan, my colleague, my partner, in this process, is going to say a few things. Peter Kern : Thanks, Barry, and good afternoon, everybody. Let me start by reiterating what Barry said. I think we've learned a ton in the last two months. We've seen some great people and great things and we've seen a fair bit of wasted energy and calories going at things that may not have promised, may not get us to the promised land, and certainly we have not learned and been agile enough and willing to say no to things, and willing to acknowledge failure when it happens. I think we are getting about the business of that and being highly disciplined. And I think that is working its way through the organization. And it's just frankly a terrific feeling. And again, to a few specifics, I want to start by just covering guidance a little more closely. There's sort of three components to how we built our way that is broad guidance approach. One is the core business, the base business if you will with the new disciplines we put in, with some attention to wasted marketing spend and a few other areas. We believe the core itself will accelerate as against 2019. It will be somewhat backend loaded but it will accelerate. On top of that, as we said in the press release, we are going after $300 million to $500 million of incremental savings and that is across the waterfront. We are looking at every part of the business, whether it be tech licenses and procurement to geography, et cetera. And we think there's a lot of money there. The timing of which, however is uncertain as it lays out through the course of this year. But, we do believe by the end of the year, we will be at that run rate level. On the other hand, of course, there is the coronavirus, a terrible thing for humanity and also a not very good thing for our business. And that is highly tough to predict. We have a pretty good line of sight on its impact on the first quarter. But, in terms of its duration, and the depth of its impact, it is hard to predict. So, taking all that uncertainty, running a number of scenarios on the virus based on historic patterns, we have generally taken all that together and said notwithstanding all those uncertainties, we believe and are confident we will get into the double digits. Of course, the virus becomes something completely unexpected, who knows, but we feel confident about that. Moving on to the operations and digging slightly deeper on a few of the things Barry was talking about. This idea of bringing our brands together and out of silos and collaborating in a whole new way is super important to the future success of our business. I would add to that that the best example and the cleanest example today is probably geographical rationalization. We have many brands all over the world, they are -- different ones are strong in different markets. We have historically taken a brand by brand approach. And now, we are taking a market by market approach. And we will push the best brands in every market and we may take some brands out of certain markets. And we will do whatever is smart, both on an operational basis and on a marketing basis to advance the greater good. On the marketing side, as an extension of that more generally, we are looking to rationalize some of our spend, we are looking at common measurement, common tools. These silos didn't always look at marketing the same way, they didn't always attack performance marketing with the same metrics. We are unifying those things so that we have better ways of measurement, and therefore better ways to collaborate and cooperate for the greatest return. On Vrbo, which I know everybody has followed closely, the trends remained fairly muted through the fourth quarter. The replatforming last year and the rebranding were definitely a distraction, slightly different than the distractions Barry more broadly talked about. But now, the team is keenly refocused on fundamentals driving core operations, and they too are beneficiary of our geographic rationalization as they have looked at where they had really inefficient spend to drive reach and geographies that did not make sense, and candidly now that we have the capacity to drive their supply through our other brands, we don't need to have Vrbo in every market in the same way because alternative accommodations can be provided to the customer base through our other brands. Expedia Partner Solutions continues to be a very strong story for us. We believe in the momentum there. We believe in the opportunity to fill in gaps in demand, whether they're geographical or just customer based. And we believe that EPS can add to that momentum by capitalizing on all the things we are now going to be able to do with our core technology platform. So, a lot of exciting stuff going on there. It will give EPS greater configurability and improved customer experience for their end business partners. We recently also brought Egencia together with EPS under a business we're calling Expedia Business Services. It's simply an effort on our part to further simplify, get advantages between businesses. These businesses are not the same. They don't have the same end users, but they have a number of common practices from which they can learn and help one another, including sales and customer management and a variety of other business to business techniques. Our platform is perhaps the biggest story in part with the blame this reorganization to get us to this place. But it is in many ways our biggest opportunity to share technology across our businesses and bringing together groups. Barry mentioned that data and AI group, I'm really excited about what's possible here. It's early days, but for the first time, we are bringing together all the data in the Company into one place where our best data scientists and AI and machine learning engineers can use that data to learn faster and build solutions across the Company that will help us improve the customer experience and obviously our monetization. The teams in our marketplace have also come together and are working to better match supply with demand, which we believe again enhances the customer experience and enhances monetization. We've also brought together a group that will monitor cloud and work on the cloud spend. I know this has been an interesting area for everybody as we have migrated to the cloud. It's been a bumpy and expensive road. We are getting to the end of that road. But importantly, we are getting to a point where we need to and have to optimize our cloud spend. And we now have a centralized group that will look across the Company and work to optimize that and get the most out of it and ultimately get the leverage we've all been working for there. But overall, the common themes here, as we said, are really about simplification, precision, really bringing an efficient operating line to everything we do. We will be aggressive about that and we plan to get a lot out of that as we push through the year. And we of course will keep you apprised as we get through that. I\u2019d just like to point out before I pass it on to Eric that the year will be noisy, not only because of the virus but because the first half of the year. We are getting the benefit or detriment of a slow back half of 2019. We are also spending into our strength areas where we believe we can drive growth in the back half of the year, rationalizing out some of our less efficient spend areas. So, there will be noise between revenue and EBITDA. But as I\u2019ve said and Barry said, we believe strongly we will be in double digit EBITDA territory this year. We're excited about the future. And I think we'll have terrific momentum going into 2021 if we can pull all this off. And with that, I will pass it on to Eric. Eric Hart : Thanks, Peter. Before diving into our results, I want to lay out three main areas we're focused on in 2020.One, driving margin expansion and unit economics; two positioning the Company to move faster and invest back into key areas to accelerate top-line growth; and three, delivering attractive shareholder returns. Turning to the fourth quarter results. While gross looking and revenue trends moderated, disciplined marketing spend and overhead cost containment resulted in a 1% increase in adjusted EBITDA. And for the full year, we came in slightly ahead of our revised guidance range. The slowdown in gross bookings largely related to our air business as we started to comp the enterprise deals at Expedia Partner Solutions, which drives significant air volume for us. Lodging revenue grew 9% in Q4 on 11% stayed room night growth and a 2% decrease in revenue per room night, largely related to growth in our loyalty program. Domestic room night growth remained strong accelerating to 10% as we continue to gain share in the U.S. on the back of strong trends and direct channels. Cost of revenue was up 19% for the quarter. The majority of the growth related to the increase in cloud costs, inorganic impact of Bodybuilding.com and processing fees related to the ramp-up in Vrbo\u2019s transition to the Expedia payment platform. By leveraging Expedia\u2019s payment platform, we expect Vrbo to see improved conversion in unit economics as it benefits in several areas including fraud detection, order completion rates and flexibility on payment options. Also, as a reminder, Bodybuilding.com is essentially neutral to adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow grew 46% for full year 2019. Normalized for Vrbo\u2019s payments transition, free cash flow grew approximately in line with adjusted EBITDA to nearly $1.1 billion. Based on Vrbo\u2019s current payment structure, the funds are held at a third-party and are restricted. On a normalized basis, we expect solid free cash flow growth. And going forward, with declining capital intensity and favorable working capital dynamics, we're well-positioned to drive healthy free cash flow growth going forward. On the balance sheet, in September, we placed $1.25 billion and 3.25% 10-year notes. We will use the portion of that to regain $750 million notes that mature in August 2020. Our prudent approach to managing the balance sheet is unchanged and we are committed to operating within our investment grade credit rating. In terms of capital allocation, given our conviction and Expedia's growth prospects, we repurchased 5.8 million shares for $634 million from early December through this month. We believe our stock remains undervalued and plan to use our free cash flow and cash position to continue to actively repurchasing shares. Now turning to 2020. As Peter mentioned, we will continue to drive efficiency on direct marketing spend. That will lead to some tradeoffs and modestly slower unit growth for most of the year. But, we believe focusing on higher quality unit growth and on driving our direct business will lead to a stronger, more sustainable top and bottom line growth over time. On cost of sales, we expect growth to remain elevated the next few quarters due to same factors we saw in Q4. Our cost of sales outlook also incorporates higher digital service taxes as we currently expect legislation to take effect in additional countries this year. This remains a dynamic issue and we are closely monitoring developments. In terms of the quarterly phasing, it will take time to work through the carryover effects from the trends of the past two quarters. So, we do expect the majority of our profit growth to come in the second half of 2020. Now, looking at Q1 specifically, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be down substantially. Vrbo losses will be significantly higher due to the usual seasonal trends as we invest to drive growth that will come later in the year. Cloud costs continue to ramp and will have some carryover effect from the operational headwinds that we experienced late in 2019. Each of these is magnified in the first quarter as a reminder, given our seasonally low adjusted EBITDA base. In addition, the coronavirus outbreak is adding further pressure on the top and bottom line in Q1. Based on the current trends, we expect approximately $30 million to $40 million impact to adjusted EBITDA in Q1, and we expect some impact beyond Q1 and 2020 as well. But, the exact amount will depend on how long it takes for travel trends to normalize. Looking below the line, we started to recognize depreciation related to our new headquarters in Q4 and forecast approximately $30 million of incremental depreciation related to the building for the full year in 2020, which will account for the majority of our depreciation growth this year. In closing, we are excited, we are executing on a clear formula that we believe can create significant value, positioning the Company for consistent healthy revenue growth with leverage down the P&L to drive even faster profit growth. And with strong cash conversion, we expect to generate substantial free cash flow to fund capital returns through shareholder repurchases and our dividend. We believe executing that formula will create significant shareholder value over time. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe one big picture and one modeling question if I can. Barry, Peter, I want to know, maybe we can get a little more granularity on your vision where online travel is going over the next couple of years. And then, peeling that back to how you're thinking about the exposure to those big trends and whether Expedia has the right assets or not, how should we think about aligning the assets within Expedia against your longer term vision for online travels going? And then, on the model, with the $300 million to $500 million of cost savings, is there a way to think through what that might mean on a division by division basis or where you see the biggest areas where you could gain leverage in your model year-on-year from cost cutting? Thanks so much. Barry Diller : Thanks. Well, online travel started 20 some odd years ago. That was the easiest area to colonize when the internet came along. There's no indication that it is going to do anything but continue to gain adoption. There's been a lot of adoption, it will continue to grow. There is nothing in its path. There are existential issues that have been raised. Of course, one is Google and the other I just heard the other day is an existential issue, which is that we're losing share to hotels. I'll start with hotels first. Because this was -- I think it was an analyst who's -- Terry, I think he\u2019s been consistently wrong about. Actually if you paid attention to him, my other IAC, you would have given up, I don't know, enormous billions of dollars. But anyway, I won't do that. It\u2019s pointless. The point is that he said that hotels were gaining strength, gaining share et cetera. So, here are the stats. For the business -- whole business, the OTA share of online hotel bookings has basically remained steady at about 38%, I don't know for many, many years. But the OTAs continue to gain share in the overall market as this shift continues to go online. For instance, from 2015 it\u2019s gone from 17% to 19%. And at Expedia, our total room rights continue to grow, 11.2% in \u201819 versus 10.5%. So, I would say, yes, there are some direct channels that people like to use. But overwhelmingly, people use online agents to book hotels and are going to continue to do so. As far as Google is concerned, it's a much bigger topic, and I've been quite vocal about this that Google has certainly monopoly share all over the world. And it does what monopoly shares get you to do, which is extend its business in every direction they can. Now, so long as they don't use unfair practices, I got no problem with that. But, when they compete against their advertisers, and we are one of their largest advertiser, we and Booking.com are within their top five of advertisers, they're using their tactics to squeeze these entities that are delivering real service is among many things, anti-social. I mean, I think it's bad practice. I think, the government, which is getting engaged in this, whether it's at the state level or the federal level, which I absolutely believe in the next period, I don't think I ask anybody to come and save us from our mistakes. And by the way, we've made our own mistakes in our SEO practices, which we are fast correcting. I told the senior management of Google exactly what we feel about this and have implored upon them to basically stop actually taking away the profits from businesses that are probably one of their main contributors to their advertising revenue. And I don't know whether that'll have much effect, but I've been very straightforward about it. And I think that there will be -- look, when businesses get to this size, they absolutely have to have regulation, sensible regulation. I'm not talking about breakups. I'm not talking about any crazy stuff. But I do believe that will happen. But, we are making our own efforts. We're driving direct relationships with consumers. Our download apps, we have about 400 million of them and their growth, like [indiscernible] is actually up 40% this year. We're going to drive more downloads, we're going to do everything we can to diversify our traffic to more direct arenas. We also have an EPS, our business-to-business business, which does not depend upon Google, and that's growing terrifically. And we're going to push that too. So, sorry. I went on a bit. But, as I said, I haven't done this in a while. Peter, do you want to say anything? Peter Kern : Yes. I would just add to that a couple of things. One, around the question of cost savings by division, that's something we really can't identify yet and won't identify. There's a lot of shared costs and a lot of -- we're doing more to make the businesses collaborate. So, I think it's really not helpful, even for you, I think, long-term to think of it on a by division basis. I think we're looking across shared opportunities, shared inefficiencies, and where we can get out of things that don't make sense and eliminate friction. So, I think, it's something we're looking for anywhere it exists. And it's not a division by division question. I think, also just to add to Barry's point at the end about EPS, and you asked whether we have the right assets to compete. I think, actually, we have terrific assets to compete. We've got brands that are strong in certain places and not in others, we've got -- and vice versa. We've got to do a better job of differentiating our brands and the customer proposition that our brands provide. But, we have a lot of ways to serve a lot of different demand. And we're using EPS to fill in the gaps and serve geographies and certain demand pools that we can't get at directly. So, I think we have a very attractive way to go eat as much gross bookings as they are out there in the world. And that's what we're going to try to do as efficiently as we can. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Barry, it's nice to have you back on the call. I think, the question I want to focus on is. Barry Diller : It\u2019s not going to go on that long. Mark Mahaney : I think, I want to ask you about is, high level, the growth in the lodging business between alternative accommodations and Vrbo and the growth in core, kind of hotel industry. As you've kind of -- looking at it from a 30,000-foot level for a while and you're now getting back into the weeds. Where you think the growth is most interesting for the industry and for Expedia in particular and how confident are you that if -- it does seem from where we sit that the growth is superior in alternative accommodations. Is Vrbo where you need it to be? It seems like that you\u2019ve gone through like a branding strategy part A, branding strategy part B, over the last two years. Is Vrbo where you need it to be in terms of operations, in terms of marketing, et cetera, in order to attack that alternative accommodations market? Thanks Berry. Barry Diller : No, Vrbo is not where it needs to be. But, it is a lot different than it was, I'd say a few months ago. It has a new leader. We have confidence in, and he's also on the ground. And look, what happened to Vrbo is it was -- I think all of you know, a collection of a bunch of disparate businesses brands all over the world, basically that were bought together and put under the name of -- dumb name called HomeAway and -- which meant nothing to no one. We did have one business called Vrbo that did mean something to people and so -- called the VRBO, which we\u2019ve tried and I think are at the very beginning of branding Vrbo. And whether -- I don't know if we went too fast actually or too slow on this, but we did this absolute change day one, the day two, from everything to then one thing Vrbo. That caused us to lose a ton of SEO traffic. Given the trends in SEO anyway, that was hardly -- it was not well executed. So, we've been now cleaning all of that up. And I think it's -- I don't know, somebody here, one of my colleagues may comment on the progress of that to-date. But, look, Vrbo is in a great actually somewhat standalone category. It\u2019s not kind of rooms that are in the attic that people rent you and stand next to you while you go to the bathroom. It is basically accommodations, family of homes, large apartments, things like that in resort areas and other places. It's got great product. We just need to market it better than we have. But, it's got -- I think it's go -- certainly, it's got large opportunity for us. And we've also just plugged it into Expedia recently. That took six months of somewhat disarray. But now all of Vrbo I think is available on Expedia. Is that true or\u2026 Peter Kern : Almost all. Barry Diller : And -- but that was a difficult thing. As far as the category, look, I'm very impressed with what Airbnb has done over time. I wouldn't call it a revolution, but it has opened up. Not only has it opened up inventory that didn't exist, but it's also brought people into traveling that couldn't afford it before or didn't want to mess with big stiff hotels and also people wanted a different experience, older people who were lonely and didn't want to go to some cold place. It's not a great job. But basically -- but by the way, you put its inventory as against the hotel inventory, they have kind of different audience. I'm not -- I don't -- I'm not a big believer that they are going to merge. So, I think there's a very healthy standard hotel business. And there's going to be this business, we're participants in it. So, that's as much as I got to say about that. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, Berry. Barry Diller : You're welcome, Mark. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Justin Post, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Thank you. Berry, maybe you can give us an update on CEO outlook and how you're thinking about that role going forward. And then, secondly, I thought it was interesting in your prepared remarks talk about improved revenue growth. Is that just as you take out the fact this year, easier comps next year, or do you see some real drivers for improvement in revenue growth, as you look out to the second half of next year? Thank you. Barry Diller : Okay. We're not doing a CEO search. I don't know that we\u2019ll ever do an actual search. I'm not a big believer in \u201csearches\u201d. I think, they usually turn off the usual and obvious suspects. And when you only know somebody from interviewing and recommendations, I figure failure rate is usually certainly above 50% in my experience, other people's for sure. Anyway, we're not doing that. I'll say this. First of all, Peter and I are completely engaged. We are operating the Company, we are responsible for the Company, and we are -- definitely, it is our responsibility. That is not to say that during the calendar year \u201820, a chief executive will emerge from this process. But right now, look, time will tell. But, what happened is amazingly, once we had to make this management change -- unfortunate management change, and I have said before, it was not to demean Mark Okerstrom or CFO, but it really was a real difference in what we actually thought. And that happens. So, there's no damning here. But from that moment, I got incredibly energized about this because I actually began, other than superficially, as a Chairman, I began to really understand the levers of this business and what the opportunities were and what the condition of the Company was that I bought relatively quickly we could turn. So, we\u2019re at it. And it's not going to last beyond \u201820. But, that's where we are for now. As far as drivers for revenue growth, Mr. Kern. Peter Kern : Sure. So, Justin, I think, the way we look at the revenue drivers, it's not a comp issue. We want to drive healthy -- as much healthy revenue growth as we can find. In the near term, we are in a period where we are coming off of weaker back half of '19. So, that's a dulling effect. And we are being very clinical about, as I mentioned, geographies and marketing spend and trying to get rid of empty calories. It's not a bad thing to drive performance marketing and to drive throughput when you're good at getting repeat customers and you're good at turning them into being direct customers. But, when you're not as good as you could be, it's not the most efficient use of capital. So, we want to get better at all of those things. And so, in the near-term, I think you'll see some pressure on the top-line from those movements, which we think are very healthy. But, out of that we believe we will find much better ways to invest our capital geographically by brand. We think we will do a better job of repeat business and direct customer experience because we will be better at the customer experience side of the business. We have huge leverage that we can't even really calculate that will come out of the platform technology group, whether it be the data and AI side, the management and yield side, the cloud. There's just a number of places where we can just do a lot better. And so, we believe all of those things will drive conversion, will drive better customer experience, will drive stickier customer relationships, will allow us to invest more aggressively, and all of those things will accelerate revenue going forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Justin Patterson of Raymond James. Justin Patterson : Great. Thank you very much. Barry, you called out the consumer experience in your initial remarks, that and loyalty. What are the key things you need to do to get right, improve the customer experience and build loyalty? Barry Diller : Look, one of the things I think we suffered from is -- to a degree, we lost attention of the product itself, what the consumers get, what do they see, how do they interact with it, what is the user experience, et cetera, et cetera? How do we not only ease their path to travel, but how do we really add value? And so, one of the things that has come out of this is now an absolute focus on what that experience is, that's where a lot of the organization and investment is going to come from. By the way, it\u2019s investment in focus and time; it's not investment really in cost. But making -- look, OTAs have not had in my opinion, enough differentiation, and differentiation meaning that Expedia, which has the benefit to only one that's got the benefit, I mean God knows who poured money into it. It has the benefit of being able to get you hotels, air, cars, experiences, anything you need in travel is in one place at Expedia. It is not -- certainly, it has not been as efficient as Booking.com and hotels, particularly in Western Europe, and when the United States has been fine. But, that's not a solitary diet. And that's fine for some people. But, if you come to Expedia increasingly, you're going to have a product that is actually going to not only ease the process but can add value to the process. Because we're the only ones who can really package. We're the only ones who can officially put things together and magically offer people a lower price and probably a better experience. So, it's -- anyway, I think, I kind of said it. On loyalty, Peter will talk about it. Peter Kern : Okay. I'll talk about loyalty, but I was going to add that -- no, that's okay. I would say that the industry suffered or benefited from a high degree of commercialization around everything they did. It was an aggressive, how can we turn a customer into a consumer into a buying hotel room. And that goes for all OTAs. And I think ironically, to tie a few of these questions together, that Google's pressure and the pressure on performance marketing puts the pressure back on all of us to make it really about the consumer experience. You can't just cash your ticket every time and have the consumer feel like they're having a great experience and they have a reason to come back. So, it's on us to do. There is a lot of work streams going on against that. It covers a lot of activities, including what you serve up to the customer and how well you match content and supply with them, all the way through to how you take care of customer service calls and everything else. So, we are on that path and we are aggressively focused on that. And we may have Google and the rest to thank for driving us there. But, we should have been there and we will be there. As for loyalty, it's an important part of our consumer proposition from Hotels.com. Again, we are going to strive to better differentiate our brands. Berry took you through the end to end opportunity that brand Expedia offers, Hotels.com is another thing, Vrbo again another thing. So, we are going to differentiate those and drive to the biggest pools of demand, we can take them all, and hopefully they will work symbiotically and to the greater benefit. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Berry, it's great to hear your energy. I guess, I wanted to sort of ask about your view over the next two to three years for the Company. So, understanding that the near term, focusing more on higher quality room night growth, rationalizing some ad spend, really focusing on direct, pressure near term room nights. But, talk to us about how you think about the keys to really driving sustained, faster room night growth in \u201921, \u201922 and beyond as you sort of get through the important steps you're going to take in 2020.Thanks. Barry Diller : It\u2019s continued execution and focus and not resting, not being very patient. That is one of the things that we're going to have to imbue in this organization. And, again, look, I think the outlook is good. It's got some challenges. I'm less worried now, having gotten into it about these existential challenges than I was before I got into it. Those are what they are, but Expedia has -- and with its brands, with differentiation with -- by the way increased, hopefully more interesting forms of loyalty, rewards and things like that. Expedia is going to be able to which I think it's going to be able to do as against its competitors. I think, we're going to be able to build up loyalty. The whole concept of all of this was you paid a lot for your first experience with an OTA with what you did in advertising but you were hoping for the second.  From now on, it's going to be the second, third and fourth for us because what we're -- because all we're -- really I would say driving us down to is this kind of pragmatic focus on -- basically the verities, which is what is the experience, we are -- we have chased the tail. The tail was pretty good to start off. I want to travel, started off with the boom because it was obvious, better experience, kind of raw. But we have simply chased it with -- look, working on conversion, working on all those things is good. But the reason that I think 2, 3, 5, 10 years from today, Expedia can continue to actually beat its competition is because of what we're focusing on now. That will give us -- we won't have to do -- we won\u2019t have to look for other pools. There's enough there for us, if we just get back to pragmatic focus on streamlining our business, simplifying our business. As I said before, we were bloated organization. I mean, not because people were lazy or whatever. But over the years, just chasing the tail of growth and all that we're just adding people and people and complexity and all that stuff until, frankly, very few people figure out what the hell we were supposed to do during the day. So simplifying that has a great byproduct of cutting our costs. Our costs were too high and our costs are going to come down beyond this first level of $300 million to $500 million over the future, because we are going to simplify. Simplifying lets us pay attention. If we pay attention, given the opportunity, I worried about two or three years. Operator : We'll take our next question from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Thanks for taking the questions. So, two quick ones from us. First, can you elaborate on the cost savings? You noted that the expected cost savings to reach $300 million, $500 million run rate. Should we assume this progression to be relatively linear? Just trying to understand how much is factored in the low-double-digit guide? And then, the second question about coronavirus. Is the impact currently largely contained to Asia Pacific or is there demand softness in other markets as well? Thank you. Barry Diller : I'm just going to spout off something here on the virus thing. And I think it's going much beyond that. I think, people are worried. I think, people are just saying -- I mean, they are all over the place. New York City people are in buses and subways with masks on. I think, there\u2019s been one case reported in New York. So, I think, this is a damper. How far this goes? I mean, a week ago, it was supposed to kind of be lessening and yesterday, again, shot up in terms of infected cases and I guess deaths. I mean, do we have a pandemic? I don't know. I have to believe that now the activism of every country in the world on this is going to contain it quickly. Now, by the way, that's the statement with no facts and no knowledge, so you can all toss it. But we don't truly know the extent of it. And it is going beyond Asia and it will go beyond Asia. Peter Kern : Yes. And Deepak, this is Peter. I would just -- to your question of the timing and how to think about the expenses, I'm afraid we're not going to give you much satisfaction here. This is a work in progress across literally the entire Company, and all pockets of spend and all activities. And we are making progress on many, many fronts, but some will take time to germinate and some will be sooner. And, you'll know as soon as we know, but we can't give you much color except to say obviously as we take these things out and they stack up, they obviously get better as the quarters, they should. We should get more savings as the quarters go by. But how much and how volatile that number is, it's still pretty early to tell. So, we're committed to getting through it in an orderly fashion in a way that helps the business and doesn't break something new. And we believe we can get through the lion's share of that by the end of the year and be kind of at our full run rate. But again, it's across so many things that it would be impossible to give you a schedule of that. Barry Diller : I'll just add one more thing because I think it should be said, which is this process of simplifying our business and lowering our costs has an effect obviously on people. We have been in the process of going through this over the last at least months. I've never seen a process like this. I keep saying it to my colleagues that are involved, how impressed I am with the thoughtfulness, the deliberations that go on in every part. So, this is not just saying, okay, there's one little piece of the Company. Every one of our senior leaders has participated in this. And in a way I almost feel like we should publish the process we've gone through because I've never -- look, I have been around and I have been doing a lot of these processes. I've never seen one as thoughtfully and decently done as this. And the plan for communications is I mean, I'm sure we'll make mistakes here or there, but it's just impressive. Anyway. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. ChrisKuntarich: Hi. Thanks. This is Chris on for Lloyd. How are you guys thinking about driving app downloads from here? It seems like you guys have done some good download growth. But, should we be thinking about a rebuild of the app or spending to drive app downloads or expanding a loyalty program? Just any color you can share beyond what you guys have shared so far? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks for the question, Lloyd. I think, the specifics are taking place on many fronts. This isn't a rebuild or anything else. In fact, as you probably know, as well as Barry and I, the Company has been moving to PWA to drive mobile abilities across our brands. That translation has taken time. There's been some bumps in the road. But now, our biggest brands are there and -- or nearly there. And I think that's a big opportunity for us to improve on that app experience. In fact, the app growth and app conversion has been showing signs of being better than the rest of the business. I attribute some of that to PWA and any the experimentation people can do. We obviously -- once we have it nailed, we've got to push into it, push into it with marketing and push into it with getting our consumers there more, getting into sign in more and all of those things. So, it's across a whole waterfront. I think, the biggest sea change is just our push to the Company that this has to be our focus and this has to be where we want to move people. We need to get them out of refishing for them in the performance channels and into having real relationships with us. So, it's a holistic kind of approach. But it's taking place on the marketing side, on the product side, on the innovation side and everything else. And so, I think, we're going to push across all those things. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : So, I have a question on SEO. Can you give us a better sense of what happened to SEO in the third quarter, because externally looking into revenue and ad trends, it's really hard to tell how big of an impact that was and what changed there? And on that, how big ballpark is Expedia's exposure to SEO? Thanks. Peter Kern : This is Peter. I'll take the end of that, Kevin, which is we don't really disclose how big SEO is and don't intend to. But, it's still a significant part of the business and a good part of the business. We've been belaboring this. But clearly as we move to direct relationships and direct traffic with our customers, that is the single best way we can offset any declines that come from SEO. In terms of what happened in the third quarter, I think it was a compounding of a number of tactical things that Google did and we did not respond well to. Again, Barry mentioned in the very beginning, we were caught up in a rather large undertaking in terms of reorganization, and that took people's eyes off the ball and our view. And we could have done better, we should have done better, we will do better. There were also some changes to auction -- some auction dynamics in meta that we did not respond particularly well to. So, there are number of things that were going on that we were not really on top of. SEO's one of them. But, I think as you think about it, we expect SEO to be a continued headwind. Google, until someone stops them, is not going to stop doing what they've been doing. We've seen signs, as early -- as recently as last week, of some changes that may have impact. And hopefully they will think better of it and create a fairer marketplace. But, we can only control what we can. We're working really hard to offset those headwinds in pure SEO activity, as well as do everything we can around the rest of the business to make up for whatever we give up in SEO. Barry Diller : The SEO is not going to kill us. And SEO is not the future of our business. The trends have been -- these trends began seven or eight years ago. We should have been more alert obviously to the continued consequence of this session. As I said, I don't think we're going to be saved by some by some bill, government bill. I absolutely believe there will be regulation. But, we are doing all the things that we intend to do to deemphasize it. It\u2019s still a part, it's not a huge part, but it is a part of our business, but it isn\u2019t the future. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from\u2026 Barry Diller : So, you can go ahead. What do you want to add? Kevin Kopelman : I wanted to ask -- I appreciate that, Barry. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on coronavirus. Everyone's asking us about it. What are you seeing? Obviously you can't predict it. But what are you seeing quarter to date in the Asia Pacific business? And I appreciate the EBITDA guidance is very helpful but just in terms of how much\u2026 Barry Diller : Very good. Eric Hart is going to respond. Eric Hart : Yes. Hi. This is Eric Hart. So, if you think about how it has affected the business over time, it started in mainland China domestic, then inbound-outbound, then sort of going through APAC, and then, as we believe that it is impacting other areas of the business. We have broken down as best we can looking at the fundamental underlying drivers for it -- and of the business. And what we see is in APAC itself upwards of 50% plus and obviously higher that as you get closer to in APAC to China that that can get very much north of that. But, then, when you try to control for APAC, and you look at North America and EMEA, it does appear that there is weakening of the business as well in those areas of the business. So overall, concentration, APAC obviously is an issue for us. We do see that -- we believe that is having some impact in other areas of the world as well. And in the 30 to 40 is what we're able to estimate, based on the different scenarios Barry Diller : $30 million to $40 million. Eric Hart : $30 million to $40 million. Barry Diller : Yes. Listen, it truly is an unknown. I know everybody's asking about it. Look, you've got to believe it's going to be contained. If it's not contained, by the way, the entire world's going to shut down. So, all you can do is every day you read the news and react to it. I think, anybody as an investor, unless you think this is going to be the end of life as we know it, who cares? Believe me, I don't mean who cares a lot of people are going to get sick and whatever. But really, this is an exogenous list events, will end. And frankly, no one should count it. All we're trying to do is separate what we absolutely believe is the effect of the virus from our ongoing business, so we can prepare ourselves and make that ongoing business as strong as possible when this thing is over. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Back to Vrbo. It's primarily domestic and it seems like you're rationalizing your marketing outside the U.S. So, does that have the most opportunity this year to inflict back to growth? And then, I have another question. As you think of driving more differentiation, more loyalty, do you ever think about getting more-closer to the inventory, and taking more inventory risk? Barry Diller : So, I think I'll start at the top there. I think Vrbo, yes, we're rationalizing some international spend. But, that is by no means all international spend and ambition. And as I mentioned, now that Vrbo inventory is available on brand Expedia and actually went live partially in Hotels.com for the first time a few days ago, we have many ways to get that inventory into other markets that may be way more efficient than trying to build a brand in a place where we have no brand recognition. So, there's lots of ways to look at that. I don't think we believe Vrbo is on a path to any greater inflection than any other of our businesses. All the businesses are working hard. And there's a lot of -- various drivers. So, I wouldn't think of it that way. But, we do believe Vrbo will grow EBITDA and get back to growing top-line, again as we lean into our stronger opportunities in the beginning of this year. And no, inventory risk, no, not right now. We got plenty of other things to do before we get to figuring out whether we're going to take inventory risk. Michael Senno : Operator, we'll take our last question. Operator : Sir, we have no further questions in queue. Barry Diller : Thank you, all. Actually, I\u2019ve said before, I really am enjoying this process, and I think so too is Mr. Kern. And I hope many of our executives are enjoying that too. But, nevertheless, we'll plow through it on. In any event, thank you for being with us. And we'll talk to you in a few months and update you with our progress. Good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Senno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Michael Senno : Good afternoon. And welcome to Expedia Group\u2019s financial results conference call for the first quarter year ended March 31, 2020. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by our Vice Chairman and CEO, Peter Kern; and our CFO, Eric Hart. The following discussion including responses to your questions, reflect management\u2019s views as of today, May 20th, 2020 only. We do not undertake any obligations to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today\u2019s call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that, or similar statements. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and the company\u2019s filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company\u2019s Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content including today\u2019s earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense, excludes stock-based compensation and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Please note that depreciation expense is now reported in a separate line item and prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. Starting the first quarter, we have updated our segment reporting to reflect our platform operating model and align our reporting with customer segments. Our new segments are, retail, which includes our consumer-facing brands, B2B, which includes Expedia Partner Solutions and Egencia, trivago and corporate. Services provided by our technology platform and supply organization are primarily allocated to the retail and B2B segments. Please see the 8-K we issued earlier this week for restated segment data for the prior two years. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thanks very much Michael and good afternoon everyone. I hope you are all safe wherever you are and your families, and loved ones or likewise. Let me start by saying this is our first virtual earnings call. So, if we have any technical difficulties, apologies in advance and likewise apologies that our Chairman will not be joining us. Eric and I will do our best to be as informative and transparent, but we may not be quite as quote worthy. So, I hope you can live with that. As for Eric and I, we are doing our first formal call today. And I want to first say that the company is lucky to have Eric in his seat as CFO. He\u2019s been with the company for quite a long time in a number of roles and has been a great partner for Barry and I, as we set up on this journey late last year in trying to simplify and reorganize the company to be as effective as possible and we are lucky to have him. And as for me, first of all, I am grateful to the Board for their support, for putting me in the role. I am really excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I am not crazy. I know it seems like an odd time to take on running a travel company, but the opportunities I saw, as Barry and I dug into the business, are just tremendous and I think great things are ahead for us and looking forward to telling you more about that. First off, I\u2019d like to talk about COVID and our response to it. It goes without saying that as a company and as human beings, we are obviously keenly aware of the health and societal impact of the virus. And of course, that is the most important thing going on in the world. But the human side goes beyond that because many of our partners, people in the lodging business and the travel industry are suffering mightily. And in addition to the health issues, we have got a lot of partners and friends with issues of their business survival, their jobs etcetera and we have been trying to do whatever we can to help, however many people we can. Our primary focus is initially was of course on the health of our people and on our customers and our supply partners, we did everything we could to try to make that easy on everyone as possible, though, of course, it was not easy on anybody. We saw enormous cancellation levels come in as did the entire travel industry. We had customers stranded. We had supply partners who had all kinds of issues with cancellations and policy issues and we were scrambling like everybody else. But our teams did tremendous work, I would say on a number of fronts, not least of all, trying to help the customers. I would just point out, we had levels of cancellations that were many multiples of our highest cancellation levels on any day ever experienced, and at the same time, at certain points just because of government closures and the inability for our teams to get to the office and our service people to get to the phone centers, we had as low as 30% of our available call center capabilities. So it was a real struggle. But our teams on the technology side did a great job of helping to solve that and quickly put in place a number of cancellation tools, self-cancel tools. We deployed our voice platform more widely and really helped a lot of people took the burden off of our customer service representatives, and frankly, installed, in a very short time, a lot of great work that will pay huge dividends down the road for us. We have also been working closely with our supply partners and I would commend them all in working through a terrible difficult time with us. We are trying to smooth the customer experience and make the policies work in a really unheard of time, when no one knew exactly what to do. We were not perfect. We certainly learned a lot from this. I don\u2019t think any company could have been prepared for this. And it is frustrating that we could not make every customer perfectly happy or service everybody at the speeds we wanted. But I think we learned a lot and we will be in much, much better shape for the future. And as I say, we will reap a lot of benefit from what was done. And finally, our other sort of immediate response to the virus was to raise additional capital. You all saw our announcement last month, we raised close to $4 billion of incremental capital, which we believe gives us ample resource to survive whatever might come from the virus. I am not going to belabor the first quarter. I know you have seen the numbers. Suffice it to say that, the first couple first couple of months we are looking pretty good. We were feeling quite good about the business. From a performance standpoint, we were installing a new cost plan to take out significant costs. And then the virus became quite real for us as it stated to shut down the globe and we, of course, suffered like everybody else as those shutdowns sort of dominoed through the globe. But as it spread, the numbers started to become less and less meaningful. And really, the response was the only thing that mattered and so I would encourage you not to get terribly caught up in the noise of the first quarter. Only that we were in a good spot before it happened. The virus has been painful. We will talk a little bit about how much damage it did and where the trough was, but I\u2019d encourage you not to focus too much on those numbers. On the plus side, we had begun, as we mentioned in our last conversation at the end of last year to make changes to simplify the company. We have done a large re-org of our tech capabilities and created a platform to serve both our consumer and business-to-business facing enterprises. And that work has been terrific. Our teams have done a great job. We are already starting to see significant benefit from that. And that\u2019s not just on the bottom line, on cost savings, but that\u2019s also in capabilities. Our data teams have done remarkable work. And again, all of those things will be hugely powerful on the other side of this virus. But we were ahead of the game, because we also, as I mentioned in February again installing our plan to save on the cost side. You will remember that this was a plan that went across the waterfront. It was people, real estate licenses, you name it. We were looking at every part of the business. And at the time, we have scoped that at about a $300 million to $500 million annualized savings. And all, I would say about that is that since the virus hit, it obviously created even more urgency and focus in the organization. And I would say our ambition has increased significantly and our speed has increased significantly and let me just head off questions for later. We are not going to put a new number on it. We are focused on going as fast as we can and taking out as much as we can wherever access exits but we are not going to re-scope that number for you this quarter. And when we know more, you will know more about the scale of that opportunity. We also began pushing the organization to drive change as fast as it could. What we saw was, as everyone has seen that our volumes have been significantly impacted. And we have had a history of being quite careful about changing technology, pushing technology changes through as one would expect with very high volumes and very high throughput all the time. But since we have had these lower levels of throughput, we felt the unique opportunity to try to push through significant technology change and things that might have taken months and months or years to push through and put them on an agenda to push then through much more quickly. So the company is just way more focused on changing, changing quickly and getting to the other side of a lot of what had been thorny technology issues as rapidly as we can. We also, last week, announced that we were reorganizing our retail group. This is the next stage in our simplification. It\u2019s a big step for us. You all know that, we have operated as brands for a long time. And beginning last week, we are operating as one retail facing organization. We will have a marketing group that is focused entirely on marketing the whole suite of brands in the most effective way possible all over the globe and we have a product and tech group on retail, which is focused entirely on building the best products, the best consumer interfaces and the best tools for our consumers that can be marketed down through the retail group. So we have taken down those boundaries. Again, we think there\u2019s efficiency there. But as much as there maybe efficiency, we think there\u2019s this huge opportunity to have the product teams working together to build the best products, deploying them as widely as possible across our consumer-facing fronts. And we think that our marketing teams will have a great opportunity to stop competing with each other and start optimizing for the group of brands instead of -- for a single brand against another. You will note, as Michael said, that we have changed our segment reporting to reflect that our real view of things today is that there\u2019s consumer facing retail business, there\u2019s a B2B-facing business and then there\u2019s the platform and the corporate organization that serves all of that. And I will say, for the record, we believe that all of those revenues and all those pockets of demand are equally valuable. We think both businesses filling gaps in the market. And we think that we can reach as the most demand possible by having those big chunks of business in retail and B2B to find all the demand all over the globe. On the marketing point, I just want to amplify. You have heard a lot of conversation about direct customer relationships. It\u2019s a nice thing to say. We believe in it. But this is more than just an emphasis point. This is about building better products, doing better brand and direct marketing, better merchandising, which has not been a great strength of ours. And in general, using the data we have, which again had never been pulled together as a company and has only been together for the last few months to power our ability to do all of those things, to understand our customer better, to serve them better, to serve up choices for them better, everything. So we believe we have huge opportunities on that front. And we have been overly reliant and we have heard this before on been performance marketing. We have not been disciplined about it. We have chased on healthy growth over the years. And Google and other performance marketing channels have tried to dis-intermediate us and we have made some not terribly smart choices along the way. We believe that this reset of the virus will give us an opportunity. I mean, we have been talking about this for a while, but as we wave back into the marketplace to be much more disciplined to only chase real growth, real valuable growth, healthy growth and not be stuck chasing performance marketing and entering into dis-economic auctions. So we intend to be much better about that. We intend to keep those customers longer. We intend to serve them better and keep those direct relationships going strong. And finally, I am sure you are all interested in the recent business trends. Like some of the other companies in our space, you probably heard that late March into April was the trough of the business. That is true for us. We saw gross bookings, new lodging bookings down about 85% year-on-year, which of course was terrible. And cancellations were extremely high. Since then, I am pleased to say, but I would not get overly excited about it, that we have seen nice growth coming into May. And essentially, what we have seen is both growing out green shoots in the areas you would expect, places where movement has become possible, where people can now start to think about their summer holidays, et cetera. We see that very quickly when that happens and cancellations have settled down. They are still at elevated levels, but they have stabilized. So the combination of those things has may looking considerably better than the trough. We are not making any predictions. We, of course, cannot control the virus. So we are merely adapting to it as it comes and trying to be smart about where the business is. What we can do to help the business along in places where it exists and be smart again about how we attract the demand that is out there. I\u2019d say it\u2019s important to keep in mind that, because we have a global footprint and because we are essentially in every line of travel business that\u2019s significant. We get demand wherever it lives, so I know there\u2019s been a lot of questions about international versus domestic, local, regional, et cetera. The truth is we have a way to capture whatever demand is out there, wherever it exists in the world and wherever it is local, regional, domestic or international, we have a way to participate. So I would say we are well-hedged against however it comes back. And what we are seeing clearly is what you have been hearing that local, regional, domestic is certainly coming back stronger sooner. And I would just point out a bright spot for us has been Vrbo, where we have seen really markedly better performance and that clearly seems to be around people who have been stuck in their city dwellings or wherever and are looking forward to being able to get away from those cities to some place for a vacation with their families this summer. And we are pleased to see the demand. It\u2019s clear that the Vrbo focus on the whole home experience is a real advantage over the competition right now. Vrbo is not big in cities. It\u2019s not big in rooms in other homes and those kinds of things that is really a fort wall whole home experience and we have seen some really nice signal out of that vacation rental business. So with that, I would pass it over to Eric and say thank you for your time. Again, don\u2019t get too focused on the quarterly numbers, I don\u2019t think they are meaningful. We are entirely internally focused right now, trying to do the most good we can to both navigate the situation, help our customers, help our partners reignite their businesses, and most importantly, from our perspective, get our business right and our product right and our offerings right. So when we come out of this, as tired as it is, we will be stronger and better than we were before. So with that, Eric? Eric Hart : Great. Thank you, Peter. I appreciate it and the kind words as well. So before I get started, I also wanted to echo Peter\u2019s comments around thanking the employees. It\u2019s a very stressful time. It\u2019s quite difficult. And I have seen heroic efforts across the organization to tackle some pretty difficult problems for fellow employees and customers and partners as well. So thank you to all those involved and that have really put in tons of effort and very stressful time and I just want to say thank you on behalf of myself and TLT and Peter and Barry as well. So thank you. Coming into the year, and as I mentioned in Q1, driving margin expansion and improving unit economics were key priorities for us. And with COVID hitting, we moved with even more urgency on these efforts and took additional actions, further improve our cost structure and preserve capital in the near-term. I want to tick through the major cost items, just to give you a sense for what we are seeing and some of the actions that we are taking. So from overhead perspective, the cost savings initiative that we started earlier this year is driving significant savings in overhead costs and it\u2019s putting us on a path to reset our fixed cost basis. And then in addition to that, shifting to the platform operating model that Peter talked about, really positions us to scale the business far more efficiently going forward. So during COVID, we have made additional cost cuts to help preserve capital, but that\u2019s within the context of trying to reset the cost basis of our business. From a cost of revenue standpoint, those are mostly variable or semi-variable expenses. So as you can imagine, as our volumes have decreased, there\u2019s a natural offset due to COVID and those reduced volumes. We have unlocked significant cloud savings through optimization efforts, benefiting from centralization -- centralizing the cloud management in our platform, which we talked about last quarter. We have also made temporary changes to lower cost -- the cloud costs as well during COVID and now expect cloud costs for 2020 to be well below 2019 levels for this year. We are also accelerating progress on vertical agent and self-service tools to make customer service more efficient and if you take the cloud plus the customer service efficiencies, we do expect those to continue to contribute to better unit economics as volume comes back. From a direct marketing standpoint, it\u2019s clearly our largest expense and it\u2019s almost entirely variable. Starting in mid March we cut expense to nearly 0. Now as we started to see green shoots and as we expect the market to go down and we start marketing efforts we will remain very disciplined and run performance marketing channels at much higher ROIs going forward, as Peter mentioned. Regarding cash burn, the headcount reduction that we have talked about previously as part of the overall cost plan, it does -- it also drives savings and capitalized labor. So that\u2019s incremental to the P& L benefit. And in addition, we did defer several real estate capital projects, another nonessential CapEx to preserve liquidity. However, we recently restarted construction on our new headquarters, since it is more efficient to do so and we now expect it to complete in the first half of 2021. Across overhead, CapEx and interest expense a pro forma for the recent debt issuances, we expect our monthly cash usage during the COVID crisis to be below $275 million within the next couple of months. If COVID were to have a protracted impact, we do have additional cost waiver that we can pull and will do so at the appropriate time. Our Q1 results did not fully reflect this cost structure given the impact of COVID and timing of our cost initiatives. So a couple of specific areas I want to call out. Costs of revenues grew 28% to a higher provision for bad debt related to future collection risk from the impact of COVID-19 on customers, as well as inorganic impact from bodybuilding.com and higher cloud expenses. We recently sold bodybuilding.com as part of our simplification effort and savings as I mentioned previously, those benefits will roll in through the year. Overhead costs were roughly flat in Q1 as the benefit from our cost savings initiative did not kick in until March. We expect overhead expenses to decline at a double-digit percent starting in Q2. So turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, free cash flow was negative $1 billion in Q1, primarily due to the use of cash for working capital. The working capital charge largely related to lower merchant account payables from the significant stayed room night decline late in the quarter and an increase in prepaid assets, including deposits to fund future refunds. Deferred margin bookings increased modestly in the quarter due to an increase in Vrbo merchant bookings. And our typical seasonal pattern, deferred merchant bookings, they increased in the first half of the year as customers book, travel and then decline in the second half of the year as more customers are staying than actually traveling. This year, started with a similar pattern through mid-to-late February and then as new bookings dramatically decline and calculations spiked in March, deferred merchant bookings declined significantly. This dynamic continued in April as customers canceled travel plans, mostly for near-term travel dates that were impacted by COVID-19. And as of the end of April, our total deferred merchant booking balance is $4.3 million and excluding deferred loyalty, the balance was approximately $3.5 million. As we manage through this near-term liquidity capital headwind, in addition to cost cuts, we have taken step to preserve in both the equity, we suspended REIT purchases and dividends and we also closed few transactions which totaled nearly $4 billion in capital. The $1.2 billion preferred equity investments Apollo and Silver Lake has a dividend that can be paid in time, first three years as well as redemption options. We also issued a total of 8.4 million warrants as part of that transaction. We also raised $2.75 billion in unsecured to senior notes. The notes were issued in two tranches, one of which is callable after two years. We plan to use proceeds from this debt race to repay the $750 million senior notes that mature in August, performing for these transactions, as of the end of April our total cash balance was $6.5 billion. In addition to cash, across restricted cash, accounts receivable and prepaid in current assets, we held amounts covering 40% of outstanding deferred merchant bookings, excluding deferred loyalty. As travel begins to recover on booking trends rebound further, we expect to see immediate cash flow benefits from the merchant model, even with new booking levels well below 2019. We believe our liquidity affords us flexibility to navigate a prolonged impact from COVID and position a leader as travel recovers. While we have a higher debt balance and pro forma a leverage that we historically carried, we remained committed to investment-grade credit ratings and fully intend to work back toward our historical leverage levels as the business recovers. In addition to the $750 million notes due this year, we have a tranche of notes maturing in 2022, notes callable in 2022 and the borrowings under our revolver, all of which gives us a lot of flexibility to quickly get on a path back to desired capital structure in the coming years. Given the uncertain environment, we are not providing guidance for 2020. In the second quarter, we currently expect revenue declines to more closely mirror recent booking trends and our adjusted EBITDA loss to be significantly higher than in Q1 as we will have a full quarter of the global impact from COVID. While we remain optimistic that travel will bounce back, we know it could take time to return to prior levels. We are going to keep driving efficiencies and we are going to position the business to operate faster and more effectively in the past, as Peter talked earlier. And when travel demand returns, we expect to emerge with better margins and be in position to drive the level of growth we plan for as we enter 2020. Operator, we are ready to take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : So that May was looking considerably better than the trough. I mean, can you try to quantify that for us? That would be -- that would be helpful. And then secondly, you talk about taking a fresh look at the business cutting back potentially on some performance based marketing spend Google spend, that obvious been a key part of the OTA story, I don\u2019t know, for two decades. Your level of conviction that you can -- how you -- just talk about how you hedge against the possibility that the alternative marketing channels won\u2019t be as efficient as that? When do you think you will really get visibility? I know, it\u2019s a hard time to run marketing experiments in this environment. Is this something that is probably going to take you a year or more to really figure out how to better optimize your marketing if really can optimizing away from performance marketing. Thanks a lot. Peter Kern : Sure. Thanks, Mark. So first of all, on May, no, I am not going to give you much to quantify that, except to say that we have seen week-by-week improvement. Again, we are a many product business. So some businesses like Vrbo are considerably off the bottom. Others are more modestly off the bottom, all the assumptions and all the prognosticators about the comeback of travel locally recently. Is it vacation rental or hotels? I think we are seeing improvement everywhere. We are seeing more marked improvement in vacation rental right now. And I would say we are fortunate in that we are relatively heavily weighted towards the U.S. and the U.S. is relatively stronger. But of course, there are places all over the world that are beginning to open up, be it parts of APAC, parts of EMEA, et cetera. So I think we are seeing week-by-week improvement. It\u2019s encouraging, but we are still at greatly reduced levels. And the numbers candidly are not terribly meaningful right now. Directionally, they are meaningful and they are hopeful. But the delta between minus 85% and minus some other big percent is not really terribly telling. I think the question will be how long does sustain itself? Does it continue to grow? And frankly, do all of us do our part to make travel safe so that we don\u2019t end up with any future constraints that stopped the improvement. So I think that\u2019s all I can really give you on May. As far as the bigger cutting back marketing OTA story. I recognize, as Google and others have pushed their way into the -- to intermediate all of us. That has created challenges. I think there\u2019s also been challenges as we have all tried to continue to drive growth and weren\u2019t finding other ways to drive it as effectively. I would say the things that give me encouragement are, first of all, while we don\u2019t have the volumes to test it right now, we do have an opportunity of an entire reset, because we have essentially gone to virtually no marketing. And as we weigh back in, we are able to be more precise, be more constrained, watch and learn and grow into it and not just dive back in head first and spend back to the levels we were at. I also think we have not done our job on a couple of fronts. One is, as I mentioned, as our own brands competed, whether that\u2019s broadly or locally, we were creating our own dynamics in the marketplace, but I think we probably never fully understood. We are now an integrated marketing team, led by two great executives who will figure out how to make sure that we will spend appropriately and not be pushing price against ourselves. Secondly, we have done precious little with all the data we have and all the merchandising capabilities we have and we haven\u2019t done an exceptional job of retaining our customers and giving them reasons to want to come back directly to us, directly to our app, et cetera. It has been a growing area of business. We have done a good job, but if you think about not having all the data on your customers aligned in one place, not having the tools to tell them, hey, you went to Vegas last year. At this time, would you like to go to Vegas again? We just have a lot we can do to continue to drive the business without the only idea being, how about we spend a little more in performance marketing. So I think we have a lot of opportunity there. We have also seen that as we have gone through these very low levels of performance marketing that our brand is quite effective. People come back looking for our brands because our brands have import and it\u2019s an imprecise science, but knowing what your brands can drive themselves without performance is an important part of this. So I think this low will give us more insight into that as we climb out. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you very much, Peter. Peter Kern : You bet. Operator : And our next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Naved Khan : Hi. Thanks a lot. Just a couple of questions. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what the integrated marketing effort does in terms of the trade up between growth versus just marketing more effectively and profitably? And then, if I had to just think about the margins in the business over the medium term or maybe longer term. And considering what you have done over the last several months in terms of just cost takeout and streamlining, where do you think margins can be in the business? Peter Kern : I will let Eric take the second part of that. But I would say the trade-up on marketing growth, it\u2019s one of the benefits of having this giant reset is we are not sitting there with a run rate number. And saying, do we go for profit, do we go for growth, do we go for whatever? I think we are trying to just be smarter overall as we climb back into the market and I think we want to clearly be focused. We have clearly said to the company, we will be focused on simplicity and profitability and efficiency, but that is not to say that we do not want to keep growing. We believe we can keep growing on a more profitable base in a more healthy way, retain customers more, have lifetime value increase, all those basic building blocks. So I think we are hopeful that we can drive both. We certainly won\u2019t -- as I said, we won\u2019t be headlong into driving top line growth just for the hell of it. We will drive top line growth where we think it makes sense. And listen, it may turn out that as we get better and better at retaining customers and creating longer-term stickiness and lifetime value, we will have yet another approach to performance marketing as we think about how many customers we keep for the long-term. So these things are evolving and we are going to no doubt we are in a lot. And all I can say is I am not telling you it so. I am telling you what we are going to do and you will judge us on whether we deliver it or not. But that is the orientation of the company and that is how we are going to approach the market. And as for the margins, I will let Eric talk about that. But I would just point out that a lot of the work we are doing is not only about efficiency, it\u2019s about unlocking real opportunities. So these data things -- many of the things we have done and will do, that will unlock efficiency will also unlock opportunity on the top line, I believe. Eric Hart : Yeah. And then from a margin standpoint, listen, we are not giving guidance at this point, that includes what the ultimate margin profile will look like. But we are going after every cost in the company in one form or another and if you think about how the business was run historically, which was independent brands competing out in the marketplace, you can imagine that we were doing the same thing in multiple places in the organization. And there wasn\u2019t a lot of central management of areas that arguably should. So just to give you an example on the unit economic side, I talked a bit about it already, but we centralized the cloud management team and especially given COVID, that team has ferociously gone after that expense. And I think the profile of that spend is materially different coming out the other side of COVID. Customer service, we started the journey of using more technology to help solve questions from customers and delivering their needs with COVID. We have accelerated that. We are putting real investment behind it. The teams are energized. We are seeing great returns from that and customers really love it as well. Our NPS scores, when they engage with those tools, are quite positive too. So to Peter\u2019s point, there\u2019s cost efficiencies, there\u2019s margin opportunities and we are actually stepping up the customer experience at the same time. Peter has already talked about marketing, so I won\u2019t get into detail there. But on the fixed cost basis, we are still working through, the plan we have executed large parts of it. We continue to push that forward and as we have gotten into COVID and just generally peeling the layers back. We just continue to find opportunities to work with vendors where we have multiple contracts to get to a single global contract and work through a lot of those details to push our costs lower and to be more efficient while we are doing it. We will come out the other side of this we will be leaner, we will be more nimble and we will -- we believe have more attractive and higher margins on the other side. Naved Khan : Great. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Eric. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Maybe a long-term question on supply. Peter, you already mentioned sort of continuing to work with suppliers through this difficult period. What are some of the long-term goals about aligning your goals with supplier goals? And how do you see the supplier landscape evolving and what that might mean for the OTA business over the medium long-term? And then maybe a second part, historically, the OTAs have generally benefited from returns to normal from economic shocks as suppliers are looking to sort of fulfil yield and inventory? Do you expect that this time as well? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Yeah. Thanks, Eric. I will sort of take that in reverse order. I do think there\u2019s no reason to assume it won\u2019t be similar to historic events and that suppliers, broadly defined, we will look to platforms like ours to drive as much volume as they can to fill up their planes and hotels and everything else. It\u2019s hard to say how -- I think -- I don\u2019t really have a view yet on how that market will shape up or shape out. I think it clearly depends on how long the virus persists. How deep it all goes and how things come back. But I do think from our focus standpoint, there\u2019s a few areas that we are keen to collaborate better with our partners on. One is on the service end of things. Both Eric and I have talked about the opportunity to make the service side more seamless to improve the customer experience. Some of that is our own fault. Some of that has to do with how we interact with partners. And I think we have all learned a lot from that and can do better. So I hope we take the opportunity to do better. I also think this has been a time when we have been focused on how can we help our supply partners come back better from a product standpoint, from an offering standpoint, from an data and information standpoint to help our suppliers optimize their performance on our platforms and present themselves in the best way and take as much opportunity of the demand that is out there. So I think we have used this downtime to work with lots of supply side partners in terms of just simple basic things like you need better pictures, you don\u2019t have all your rates loaded. There\u2019s issues like that. I think we will try to help everybody with that. I think we are going to build better tools to work better with our suppliers and I believe we will build better tools for the customer. We know our suppliers want to upsell more. We know they want to make sure there\u2019s clarity around right now their safety practices, but in the future, other things. And we have to do as good a job as we can do to show all that make the customer experience better and allow our suppliers to succeed more. So I think between our improvements in data, our improvement in supply side tools, our improvement in consumer-facing tools. And look, that\u2019s all work we have to do still, but we are pushing it hard. I think we will -- we hope to help the entire industry come back as quickly as possible. Operator : And we will take our next question from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions from us. So first, historically, Expedia has benefited being a full-service OTA. Now coming out of COVID-19 shock, as we think about travel rebounding first to a more local or even regional basis, do you think you are a little bit of a disadvantage from a market standpoint, from a consumer awareness and recognition areas? For certain Expedia brands, if we were in this, an intermediate phase, where air travel remains muted for a long time? And then I was going to ask second question about the retail versus B2B business. Some of the B2B assets have been strong growth opportunities for you in the more recent few years, like particularly the partner for Solutions area. And as we come out of COVID, do you expect to see a trajectory difference between retail and also the B2B assets? Thank you. Peter Kern : Sure. Thank you, Deepak. Yeah. I think on your first question, I think Expedia, I would argue, probably hasn\u2019t benefited as much as it could have from being a full-service OTA. In fact, in the minds of many consumers, whether you are just looking for a hotel, they might look at Expedia bookings, hotels.com, Travelocity as all quite similar opportunities. So I think we are doing a lot of work to try to differentiate our brands. That\u2019s why we brought our brand group together into one so that we could be more clear, in terms of the brand proposition, the offering, how we express it to the public, et cetera. But I think being in the full-service OTA business long-term is a great place to be. For sure, air travel maybe -- or international air travel maybe more challenged, domestic, a little less, whatever. But I think over the long-term, being really the only folks who took on full-service OTA as a real undertaking and have kept to it and there\u2019s a lot of harry stuff that goes on in providing all those services, give brand Expedia a strong consumer proposition in the market place, might it be a little slower, because the air part doesn\u2019t comeback, instead of maybe. But again, we are indifferent to which brand or which line of business can grow fast enough. We just want to power and allocate capital and resource and human resource the best we can to drive wherever the fastest pockets of growth are. So if that\u2019s in the near-term, if that\u2019s domestic or local or Vrbo, we are going to drive that and over the longer term -- but over the longer term, we believe each of our brands, at least as currently constructed, we will have an opportunity to succeed. And certainly, the full-service OTA model will have an opportunity to succeed. As far as the B2B business grows, it has particularly our partner services business has enjoyed quite strong growth over the last few years. One of the main sort of underpinnings of our strategy longer-term is getting our own teams away from the idea that retails somehow better than B2B, or one brand is more important than another brand, there a $1 worth of profit wherever it comes from is $1 worth of profit. So we see the B2B model as a great opportunity to fill in pockets of demand and reach pockets of demand that we are not reaching or cannot reach through our retail brands. So that might be geographically focused, that might be offline travel agents, that\u2019s all kinds of things frankly. And our B2B business, particularly that partner services business has been very strong. We think it will has tons of opportunity and can continue to be strong. There will no doubt just like in the lodging and other businesses, there may be some shakeouts, because business environment is tough and some of our partners said we may not make it. I mentioned that in the beginning. There\u2019s a human cost to all this business disruption, but we believe longer-term that our B2B business has lots of legs, is an important leg in our stool and will continue to drive it with as much energy and urgency as we drive our retail business. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Peter Kern : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. A couple of quick questions, maybe I will start with a high level strategy. When you made your comments about becoming more efficient, are you thinking about maybe Expedia being a little smaller market share, but much higher margins or do you think you can have it all where you kind of maintain your share, but also get the margins up? I know you are not going to give us a target, but how are you thinking about that? And then secondly, I am just wondering, when you look back to last year, how inventory-constrained were you, were there markets where you just didn\u2019t have any inventory availability? And going forward, do you think a lot of that would open? And would you see start seeing some really good deals or maybe unique deals on Expedia. Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Sure. I don\u2019t believe we have to give up share to be more profitable. We will be -- if we were just at the same volumes as before, we would be much more profitable today than we were a year ago. Now my hope is that as we have that benefit, as we get more benefit even than we have gotten so far and as we improve our marketing efficiencies, our product efficiencies, conversion and everything else, then in fact we will be able to continue to grow certainly at pace to maintain and hopefully grow share. And still be more relatively profitable. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trade-off. I think we have a lot of work to do on ourselves to get to the right place. But this isn\u2019t about, okay, everything has been optimized to the nth degree. And now we are just deciding if we would like to make an extra dollar and give up a dollar of revenue. I do not believe we are at that place or even close to that place. We have a ton of opportunity to be more efficient throughout the process, throughout the product, throughout our own internal operating features. And if we do all of that, that should give us more margin, more ability to invest in growth, whether that may not be performance marketing growth, that may be brand, there may be other tools, that maybe merchandising and all kinds of things, but I believe there\u2019s no reason we should assume that one has to give up growth to get greater margins. Now, can it be bumpy? Well, is it a straight-line from here to there? Probably not, but over the course of coming out of the virus and everything else, everything is going to be bumpy. So we believe we can play for both. As far as the inventory question goes, I don\u2019t think we were inventory-constrained last year. I would say, though, that there\u2019s always opportunity and gaps and this is as much an information question as it is just a cooperation question. So hotels very often may not have all their rates in every place. They may not have -- they may think they have a deal on offer, but it\u2019s only in one place or they may have a deal on offer somewhere that gets into the wild and is offered in places they didn\u2019t intend it to. So I think our issue is not about not getting the inventory we want, but getting all of the opportunities that a supply side company has to win in our market. So if they have some rates for loyalty or something else where we are not participating, those are all opportunities. So I think we did not feel inventory-constrained as in we were bumping up against nothing to sell. I don\u2019t think that was the issue at all. I think it\u2019s really just our supply partners participating in every way they could. And going forward, can they get more out of our platform, if we are giving them better information and they are responding more rapidly and everybody can take the best advantage of it that they can. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks a lot. I had a quick update, a quick follow-up question on working capital dynamics. Given May has been considerably better, has the working capital outflows stabilize at this point? And how do you see that playing out? Thanks. Eric Hart : Yeah. I will take that one, Peter. So May is improved. We obviously aren\u2019t going into details on where that\u2019s falling quite yet. But I would say we are still on the -- I would think about it still being in the zone, we are in survival COVID mode focused also on recovery. So we are still at a stage where we are still burning cash, if you will. Peter, anything that you would add to that? Peter Kern : I mean, I -- ultimately, I am trying to get away from giving you specific numbers associated with it, but we are still off a very small base. We are seeing green shoots that ultimately gives us optimism for to be able to push into marketing and getting confidence that consumers are coming back. I think those are all great things, but we are not out of the woods yet. Kevin Kopelman : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. Peter Kern : Yeah. I would just add, Kevin, when I say it\u2019s considerably better, it\u2019s obviously percentage improvement off the low number is considerably better, though not awesome. We would rather have double and triple-digit improvements. So it\u2019s not better is better and we are glad to see the trends. The working capital issue, obviously, a lot to do with what\u2019s happening on cancellations, what\u2019s happening on the nature of the bookings and whether they are merchant or agency, et cetera, but -- and there have been some mix changes in the short-term. But I would say, it\u2019s definitely improving. But for Eric and I and the company, we still are on fairly defensive posture as we watch it play out. And we are glad to have the incremental capital on the balance sheet to protect us. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go head. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two questions, if I can. First trivago suggested on their call that they expect paid search marketing to be structurally less competitive going forward. So curious, beyond your company specific plans to increase ROI targets as kind of part of a broad brand consolidation. Do you think there can be structural performance marketing advantages coming out of this across the broader OTA space? And then secondly, you talked about already starting to see the benefit of the tech re-org. I was wondering if you can just give us some examples of some things you have been able to achieve, as we think about the ability overtime that continue to squeeze benefit out of that? Peter Kern : Yeah. So on the first point, I guess I would say that, I certainly can\u2019t speak for the rest of the industry. It does seem logical to me that all of us in travel have been somewhat capital-constrained by the virus, in some cases highly capital-constrained. And therefore, the robust performance marketing auction environment we saw before may take a while to come back because people just don\u2019t have the money for direct marketing. I don\u2019t know if that will be the case, but I could imagine that be the case and perhaps that is what trivago is speaking to. Certainly, we will take our own discipline to it. We will do what\u2019s right for us, I am sure everybody will do the same. But there could be a difference in the number of players and the available capital to invest in direct relationships in the near-term for some of the other players and direct hotel and other kinds of players. So I guess that would be my perspective on that. In terms of the benefit of the platform, honestly, their myriad and many of them are in the weeds. But Eric talked about the work our team has done across optimizing for cloud, right? We honestly had barely done anything to optimize for cloud before. It just wasn\u2019t an urgent push. The greater urgency was to move to the cloud. And we took a huge opportunity run by our team in our platform to drive a level of clinical approach to cloud that we just haven\u2019t had before. And that went across not just the platform but the entire enterprise. And the savings there are meaningful, really meaningful. So we are doing that across many things that\u2019s kind of on the cost side. I mentioned on the data side, we have had -- we probably have as much more data than virtually anybody in the travel industry, but we have never compiled it in one place. So we had bunches of different data storage that\u2019s put aside that, that\u2019s not terribly efficient. And it means everybody is rotating on different data and learning on different data, but all our algorithms, all our learnings, all our stuff was against pockets of data instead of all of the data. So when you get all the data together and you simplify it and you standardize it, now everybody can use it. The algorithms and machine learning tools can learn much faster and we can just apply it across a much broader breadth of our business more quickly. So I think we are going to see a lot of those. They are really hard to put numbers on. They are not like, hey, we took these people and these people and these people and put them together and we saved 3 people and we took out a tool. Those are -- that\u2019s simple math and there are some opportunities that exist like that we\u2019ve obviously gotten after a lot of them. But I think that probably the bigger opportunity and the one that\u2019s hard to define is all of these unlocks that exist for us. And for a huge organization, we were complicated. We didn\u2019t make it easy on ourselves. We didn\u2019t make it easy to do things. And as I say, I believe there\u2019s great opportunity in the merchandising front, but we have work that\u2019s going on in earnest on our CRM tools. We have work that\u2019s going on around data. All those things have to happen to unlock that opportunity, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s big and we are going to get after it. Lloyd Walmsley : Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Hope that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Stephen Ju : Commentary in merchandising better to your customers, presumably this means better cross-selling of products and packaged tours and things of that nature. But I think some of your consumers are used to shopping on Expedia in a certain way. So do you think this requires any sort of retraining or awareness marketing efforts to reeducate folks? Or do you think you will be able to just take advantage of existing behavior? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yeah. I would kind of break that -- Stephen, thank you for the question -- into two bits, which is, one is we can just be stronger at the blocking and tackling. We can be better in our core product. We can be better in helping people find their way through our product. We talked a little bit about our voice platform. We even think there\u2019s opportunity for -- and that\u2019s been principally used as a service tool, but we think there may be opportunities to use the underlying technology there to help people through the buying journey, help them make the right decision for them, potential help upsell and so forth. So this isn\u2019t about necessarily reinvention, I mean, our product should be as good as it can be, but this isn\u2019t about, hey, you are used to going on entering a date and doing this and now you are going to enter a dream and a place and something like, I don\u2019t think it has to be re-imagined. I think there\u2019s a lot of it that\u2019s just core functionality, creating great products that are really engaging with the customer and helpful for the customer and their journey. So I think that\u2019s, at its core, what are our consumer offerings will be online. Merchandising, I think, is not necessarily a separate piece, but another piece, which is once you really understand your customer, once you understand their journey, you know where they have been on your site, what they have done, what they have bought before, what their predilections are in the future, you have a real opportunity to I think, change the game for them and that goes everything from the -- letting them know about deals that are out there that might be interesting to them, whether that\u2019s through email, text, whatever, all the kinds of usual CRM tools that exist in the world and/or when they come to the site that, the sort is particular to them, or certain things are particular to them, because you understand them and they have logged in and you know what they have done before. There\u2019s just lots of opportunity to do better there and I think we are at the beginning of our journey, frankly, for that, because until you could understand where the customer was and where they have been and have all the data in one place and everything else, it was really hard to do any of that. So we are maybe even before the early days. We do some of this, but it\u2019s hard for us to do. It\u2019s not efficient for us to do and we have to get to a place where we can really do it at scale, kind of scale we operate at. And I think we can drive a lot of business separate and apart from the core. I go to Expedia and I type in my date and an airline. I think there\u2019s just a lot more out there for us. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Operator : At this time, I would like to now hand the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Peter Kern : Yeah. Well, thank you, everybody. I hope Eric and I covered as much territory as we could in an hour, obviously, again, I think our first quarter numbers don\u2019t mean a whole lot. And frankly, our numbers for a while won\u2019t mean a whole lot. We have got a lot of work to do to come out of this in a great place. We think it\u2019s there for us, as you have heard and that\u2019s what we are focused on and we are honestly not trying to talk anybody into anything. We are just trying to focus on what we can affect and you will have to judge us by what we deliver. But in the meantime, we wish you all safe and happy and same time through the virus and be careful out there and wear a mask and we look forward to talking to you again. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thank you, everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like welcome everyone to the Expedia Group Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now like to turn the call over to Michael Senno, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead sir. Michael Senno : Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to Expedia Group\u2019s financial results conference call for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by our Vice Chairman and CEO, Peter Kern; and our CFO, Eric Hart. The following discussion including responses to your questions, reflect management\u2019s views as of today, July 30th, 2020 only. We do not undertake any obligations to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today\u2019s call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that, or similar statements. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and the company\u2019s filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company\u2019s Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense, excludes stock-based compensation and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Please note that depreciation expense is now reported in a separate line item and prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you very much, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope everyone has been safe and sound during this difficult time. As we said in our release, second quarter was obviously a very challenging one for the travel industry and for us. But we were pleased to see generally speaking that after April, we had consistent growth out of the troughs, and May and June got considerably better. I would point out that we view this not simply as a positive for the business in the short term, because obviously our numbers remain very challenged relative to prior periods. But I think it speaks to humanity's demand and desire to travel. And then when they can, and when the opportunity avails itself and when they feel safe, and there are no restrictions, they all are really dying to travel, and we've seen that this summer. And I have every expectation that we'll continue to see that hopefully as the world opens up more. But we will have a bouncy recovery. There's no question. We've seen virus numbers go up in certain places. We've seen new restrictions come into certain geographies. And it appears like that will be the state of the union until things change scientifically. And so, we expect this not to be a linear recovery, obviously, and we expect some bumps in the road. Having said that, there's a lot of things there we can't control. And so, as I said in our last call, we are keenly focused on everything we can control. We're focused on helping our customers and suppliers obviously get through a challenging and complicated time. We're focused on our own cost structure and making sure we are being efficient. But more broadly, we're just focused on our internal functioning, our structure, our speed and agility, and building for the future. And while we recognize, it will take time for all of you to see the benefits of all that effort, that is really our focus. So in a little bit here, Eric will take you through our second quarter numbers. They are noisy, obviously, and frankly, I don't think terribly telling. I would not try to dissect them. I think it's a waste of a lot of energy. Most of what's happened is really a function of whatever is going on in the macro world and we are a reflection of that. And we are keenly focused on our long term fixes and strategy and less focus on the day-to-day tactics of finding another dollar in the marketplace. It doesn't mean we don't care. We just think there's so much more upside and doing the real foundational work that we need do. So if you don't see us chasing every last dollar, that's why we're doing that work. As far as the work goes, I just want to spend a little time on the things you can't see through the numbers, which is, we talked about simplifying, we talked about accelerating our business, we talked about pushing through initiatives during the COVID time, that might be harder to do in regular times. And we've made a lot of progress on this front. And there are threads all over our company working towards this. But just to give you a sense, we took down our HomeAway brand in the U.S., which was something that was scheduled to take probably another year to do. And we deprecated it just a few weeks ago, and have moved all that traffic to Vrbo. And now we will be a single brand in the U.S. And that will allow us to go much faster, and do more around Vrbo. We folded our car rentals business in Europe into brand Expedia. Again a smaller initiative, but just a way to simplify and allow us to go faster and put our talent against more important projects. We sold bodybuilding.com and shut down pillow and ApartmentJet, which were in our Vrbo business. Again, just small, distracting, interesting things we tried, but didn't have long term benefit we believed, and so we took the action to simplify the company. And that's really on the brand side and the business side. On the tech side, perhaps even more importantly, we were able to accelerate a lot of technical projects we had in the works. And just to name a few here; our Media Solutions business had relied on a third-party vendor for its auction technology. We brought that technology onto our own platform just a couple of weeks ago here, that was about a quarter early -- earlier than we expected to and our teams were able to push that across the line. And now we have that much more time to optimize that platform. And that's not just a cost savings from no longer licensing a third party platform, but it also gives us much more latitude to grow that business. And we believe there's a lot of upside there. Our hotels.com brand was able to move its mobile traffic to a new platform. Again, a project that was scoped for to take another six -- up to another six months that we finished in about a month ago. Again, another opportunity to just accelerate, get things done during the virus and get to the other side. And finally, just to name one more, we talked about the opportunity for our virtual agents that help us on the cost and the customer satisfaction side. It's something you'll hear again and again, because it's a big opportunity for us and one of our better platform technologies. But we launch that on our Egencia Corporate brand. We launch it in the U.S. and France. And that was literally two years, practically two years ahead of schedule. So we've just been moving on every front we can to try to accelerate. And that's really all about being faster, getting simpler and being able to move the business much more quickly and agilely. And that's because we really want to be able to attack our big strategic goals. And those revolve much more around how we use our platform, particularly data where we have a unique competitive advantage with the best data set of travel data in the world, where we believe we can help our customers, our B2B partners, and our suppliers, make much better decisions, be happier and drive their own businesses where the business customers and help the customer, the end customer, just make better decisions that make them happier or make our products stickier and generally drive the long term appeal of our business to third party. So we are keenly focused on that. That is our long term goal. And we have a bunch of tactical work we are pushing through to clean up runway if you will to get there. And on the supplier side, of course, we continue to push to help our supply partners get stronger and come out of the COVID times. It's obviously been a challenging time for hoteliers and airlines. We've put in a relief and recovery program for hotels to help them get back up and running, to help them better utilize our tools. And likewise, we are looking at air and we're rebuilding our own air product in large part to make it just a better, more fulfilling product for our suppliers. So we are driving a lot there. And we believe and obviously helping our supply partners get out of it. But longer term, again, we believe in helping these partners to make better decisions and drive their business through our platform. On the more nuts and bolts of it, we know you're all interested in the cost side. We continue to drive our efficiency programs throughout the company. We've told you before that we had a target of $500 million that we expected to exceed. We've achieved about $400 million of that on a run rate basis. And again, we expect to do much better than our targets. The reason we're not being highly specific about how much better is that we're really attacking everything. And there are timing implications to a lot of what we're doing. Contracts that need to be run out. Things like releasing real estate, and other things that just take time to come into effect. So rather than get caught up in the some debate about how much and over what period, we feel strongly that we'll do better than the 500. And I would point out that there is much more to it than just the 500 of cost savings that we spoke to you before, because that doesn't really take into account the variable side of our business. And that's a place where we have the opportunity to drive efficiency through bringing down customer service costs, with our virtual agents that we've talked about, bringing down transaction costs by focusing on our payments platform, technology and opportunities there. And then of course, bringing down our variable marketing costs, where we have recently put these teams together. As we told you before, we've merged our brand groups. We've merged their performance marketing groups. And there's big opportunities ahead we believe in doing the work as a portfolio of brands and optimizing for that portfolio as opposed to optimizing each brand by itself. Now that is hard work. It is foundational. some of you may have noted that we gave up some share in some of the performance marketing lines in meta and SEM. That is something we willingly have done. As I said, we are not worried about the nickels right now in a market where there isn't a lot of volume. We are much more focused on the long term foundational work to drive the long term benefits when the volumes really are back at full scale, but we will continue to refine that. I wouldn't get used to scale the share we were at. I know there is often debate about can we grow and still be more profitable on the performance side? We believe absolutely we can. But there is a lot of foundational work to get these brands together, to get their strategies unified and their data unified. And we are doing that work right now as fast as we can. So as we come out, we will be in the best position to take advantage of that. And finally, what is probably the main event to most of you, which is, what is the recovery really looking like? Is there anything to glean from what we've seen? I would say, by and large, we've seen exactly what you'd expect. April was very tough for everybody. It was the bottom of the trough. We have seen consistent growth coming out of that. We were down on a net basis 90% for the quarter, but by June that was less than down 70%, and booking -- the lodging side of that was considerably better down less than 60%. So all of that is a very good trend, but still obviously well below anything we'd like to see in the business. As for July, I would say, it's roughly in line with June slightly off those numbers. And just Eric will get into it some more. But just to give you some flavor, what we've seen is Vrbo had a ton of business and has been a great leader for us out in the recovery. As we got into summer, people obviously, have a real interest in the whole home model, and being able to have their families alone and not in shared space. And so Vrbo really led the way for us. There was a lot of compression in the early part of the booking window and the early part of the summer. And so, as we've gotten to July, there's a lot of -- it's still quite a strong business for us and way ahead of our other businesses. But that compression has softened a little bit. On the flip side, the hotel business has been slightly stronger even into July. So there's some puts and takes and there's some geog geographical differences, but in general July has plateaued, cancellation rates have stayed consistent. So we haven't seen a real rise in those in July. So I think the world has sort of stabilized here. And we'll see what the next few months bring in terms of restrictions, virus growth, et cetera. And I think that will largely tell the tale. On the good side, I would just say in addition to Vrbo, being a great driver, and the strongest part of our story, we also saw terrific new customer growth, which is just -- this has proven a great opportunity to introduce a whole new group of people, Vrbo experience, and I think that will pay longer term dividends and help cement the Vrbo brand, which is you know, we pivoted to not that long ago, and I think that's, again, a great opportunity longer term. So to wrap up, I would just say, again, we've seen nice recovery from the bottom. It was strong through May and June and flattest through July. We expect it to be bumpy. Hopefully, we'll have some good and some bad in there. And it won't be linear. I happen to be a huge believer in the scientific community and expect them to all the great minds working on this, save us all from ourselves. And we have seen clearly that the world wants to travel again, wants to get back out and move around. And we believe as soon as every time those opportunities become greater and safer, that people will indeed take the opportunity to travel. So with that, again, I would encourage you not to get too caught up in the ups and downs of small numbers. Broadly, we are focused on the longer term. And we believe we're making real headway, even though we acknowledge it will take a little while for all of you to see it in the numbers. And I will turn it over to Eric. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thanks, Peter. And thank you for everyone for joining us well. As you can see our financial results this quarter are indicative of the severe impact COVID-19 has had on our business and also the rest of the travel industry as well. As Peter mentioned, we've been focusing our energy on what we can control. And coming into the year I discuss several priorities aimed at delivering margin expansion. And that includes resetting our fixed cost base, premium variable cost of revenue and driving marketing efficiency. The impact from COVID has made these priorities even more important for us. And I'm pleased with the progress our teams have already made across these areas. And I expect it will become increasingly evident in our P&L as our business recovers. Peter also noted, we are running ahead of our initial cost savings target. And we now expect to exceed $500 million on a run rate basis. Over the last several months as we've accelerated and deepened our work across our cost initiatives and identified additional opportunities across the board for those in cloud, real estate licensing, procurements, people related cost that push the expected savings higher. We're still working across these areas and continue to look for more potential opportunities as we drive efficiency and simplify how we operate the company. The progress to date is already evident in our overhead cost categories, which collectively declined 22% in Q2. About half of that year-on-year decline reflects savings achieved thus far from these costs initiatives. While temporary cost measures related to COVID-19 accounted for the rest. We expect that over the next few quarters, the temporary benefits will phase out, while the savings from our cost initiatives will increase. In addition to the progress on the cost savings initiatives, we're also making nice rise on approving variable cost of sales. It's not evident in the P&L yet given the low booking volumes, but we expect the progress we're making the drive efficiency and customer service among others areas and to be another source of leverage on the P&L as revenue recovers. Looking at our cost of revenue as mentioned, it did not scale down with revenue with given it was 22% decline. One factor is that only some of the costs are directly variable with revenue. Credit card processing related fees are the biggest component and will fluctuate with our merchant revenue. And for contacts, that accounted for roughly a quarter of our cost of revenue in 2019. In Q2, we also have higher bad debt and customer charge backs related to COVID and also had cost related bodybuilding.com before it was sold. Customer service costs are tied more to call volume, and particularly early in Q2, we saw unprecedented levels of call volume due to cancellations that required additional staffing. Since April, these costs have started to decline year-over-year, as the environment is stabilized and we deploy more automation and self service tools. Longer term. We believe this is going to be a big opportunity for us to improve variable costs through further innovation on our virtual agent platform. We expect cost of revenue will remain a source of the leverage, while revenue remains depressed, but we do expect it to scale nicely as the business recovers and contribute to better gross margins as we return to more normalized volumes. On direct marketing expense, which is another area we're focusing on to drive efficiency, we slowly restarted marketing as the quarter progress and demand began to increase. We plan to continue working our way back into performance and brand marketing as we see demand signals in different geographies. But we intend to remain discipline operate at higher ROI than in the past, both near term and going forward. As Peter mentioned, the results this quarter are distorted in several ways through the impact of COVID. And I want to spend a few minutes going through a few key areas to help you understand what's happening to the business. In terms of our lodging results. ADRs were up 1% and revenue per room night increased 15%. On ADRs Vrbo, which carries high which carries higher ADRs and saw ADR growth given the strong demand that Peter talked about previously. It accounted for a much higher mix of room nights than it has historically, and more than offset declines at hotel ADR. A similar dynamic impacted revenue per room night with a growth driven by the increase in mix and approved monetization of Vrbo. Revenue take rate was abnormally high at 21%. While there's a lot of noise in the quarter, the biggest factor was the impact of lodging cancellations, which are netted out of gross bookings, but do not impact revenue contributed to the sort of take rate. This metric can remain volatile in the coming quarters with seasonality and product mix taking a different shape than we usually see. Air revenue was negative in the quarter unlike lodging. We recognize air revenue at the time of booking and make an assumption on cancellation rates. Given the unprecedented disruption to the air business during the last few months, cancellations are in excess of what we previously estimated. And for certain types of bookings, we refunded customers their airfare. We also reverse previously recognized revenue that was based on reaching certain volume thresholds. All of these factors were offsets to revenue which exceeded the low volume of new revenue in the quarter. Moving on to cash flow in the balance sheet, free cash flow in the quarter was negative $2.1 billion. And if you exclude Vrbo's merchant business, most of which goes to restricted cash. Free cash flow is closer to negative $2.2 billion largely due to the negative working capital impact to fund the decline in deferred merchant bookings and are adjusted with the loss in the quarter. cost action to full : As booking trends improve deferred merchant booking started to increase in June and ended the quarter at $4.6 billion total or $3.8 billion, excluding deferred loyalty, with Vrbo accounting for most of the inquiries. fit: If you exclude the financing completed back in May, the decline in cash moderated each month in Q2 and was down only modestly during June. Thanks to the stabilization and deferred merchant bookings and moderating profit loss. In addition to cash holdings at the end of the quarter, we held amounts and restricted cash and other balance sheet assets that covered approximately 60% of outstanding deferred bookings, excluding deferred loyalty. Turning to our capital structure. Earlier this month, we opportunistically raised a total of $1.25 billion and senior unsecured notes across three and seven year tranches with a weighted average coupon of 4.2%. We currently plan to use these proceeds to redeem the outstanding preferred equity stock when the redemption premium steps down in May of 2021, which was deliver significant cost savings and reduce our cost of capital. We continue to have flexibility in our capital structure to reduce our debt load over the next couple of years, which will be a key capital allocation priority and provides a path return to our historical leverage levels as the business recovers. Overall, we're excited by the improvement of travel demand over the last few months. As Peter talked about, it shows the consumers love and have a strong desire for travel and will find a way when they get comfort to do so. Nonetheless, there's still a lot of uncertainty about the virus. And we expect the recovery will have ups and downs along the way. And look different in different geographies, depending on the ability to control the buyers, travel restrictions and consumers general comfort with traveling. We feel like we're in a great position to participate as travel recovers. But right now we're primarily focused on what we can control internally. We're rapidly continuing down the path of reshaping how we do business. We're on track to come out of this disruption a stronger, more nimble company with better margins and positions deliver attractive growth for the long term. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Naved Khan with SunTrust. Naved Khan : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just have a few. Maybe just on Vrbo first. Is there enough supply available to you to fulfill demand as you look out in to the back half? Or is it mostly booked? And then, I have a follow-up. Peter Kern : Sure. Thanks for the question I would say, it's definitely not mostly booked. We have seen certain compression in a few markets. And in fact, you may have heard that the pricing has been higher as our suppliers have been able to get higher pricing as there's more demand in their markets. But there's very few markets where we have real issues with sufficient supply to satisfy demand. And certainly as you look out over the next several months and into the fall of Christmas season, there's no shortage of supply. This summer has gotten a little tighter again in a few spots. But by and large, there's ample of supply around the globe. Naved Khan : That's helpful. And then, maybe just on the performance of different GOs [ph], as you look back into the July trends. Anything to call out with respect to performance of Europe and Asia. And how that compares with the U.S. business? Peter Kern : Sure. I'll just say quickly and Eric can jump in. I think what we've seen, again, it's one of those things that rarely surprises you. It's kind of what you think it would be. The U.S. has been strong, and with the increase in viruses slowed a bit, Europe and Asia have been less strong, but slow and steady and kind of beginning to -- continuing to improve. We're seeing a few spots of virus issues in Europe. So never know and Latam has been a little bit more like the U.S., but it's quite small for us. So I would say, it's pretty much exactly what you think it would be based on what you're hearing about virus and openings, et cetera. And there's no real mystery inside of that anywhere. I don't know, Eric, if you want to add anything. Eric Hart : Yes. The only thing that I would add to it is that the story as we evolve over time, it's going to be a series of micro stories and intersections of different geographies. And just to give you a flavor of that. When you look at air, that ultimately if you just look at our overall number, you'd see an improvement from April through to June and then a slight weakening in July. But if you then split between the various geographies, North America and Latam look pretty similar, which will follow a very similar curve that I just mentioned, whereas EMEA and APAC really haven't recovered very well yet from an air perspective. If you then look at lodging then however, Its somewhat of a different story where North America and EMEA look the same. So they will follow a curve or April was down quite significantly, but has rebounded a bit through June and the order of magnitude mentioned previously. But whereas APAC and LATAM are. So its going to be a story of comfort on domestic travel. How much of a given market historically and in this environment has domestic versus International. How comfortable people are across lodging versus air? But hopefully that will give you a sense for the various curves across two major problems, major geographies and products Naved Khan : That's helpful. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Eric. Peter Kern : Yes. And I would just add before we take another question. That on the Vrbo side, one interesting part is that we have seen historically when you get economic downturns, you often get more people come -- more supply coming into the market. So we do have a hope that we will see. And we have seen some early signs of more supply coming in to the market, so that should help alleviate any inventory issues as well. Naved Khan : Got it. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Peter, I wanted to ask you a little bit of a big picture question. Given the trends that you have seen over the past few months, do you think there is a secular change in consumer behavior towards alternative accommodations in a more permanent way? Obviously, you have Vrbo. But where do you see incremental opportunity if this theme becomes sticky and significant for the whole travel industry? And then the second question is on the market share. You noted that you are willing to lose share gains in the near term on the performance marketing channels. How do you think about that shares specifically something where you would like it to sustain? And is there a level where you would like demand to get to before you become aggressive in the performance market channels? Thank you. Peter Kern : Sure, thanks. On the first question, I would say, I personally don't think there I noticed there's been a lot of comments out there from my peers and others about the future of travel. I don't think we've seen anything to suggest that people's travel behavior will materially change. I do think that to your question specific to Vrbo, we are getting a lot of people experimenting with and hopefully being very happy and satisfied with the alternative accommodation experience and in particular for us Vrbo's main emphasis on the whole home. So I think there may well be people out there who are not as familiar either with our brand or with the experience who are now getting to experience it and having very satisfying great trips. And I think that's a great opportunity for us to create long term customer stickiness and value. And as you may know, we've been working over the last couple years to get more and more of that alternative product available through our main OTA brands, still a work in progress, but we are making real inroads there as well. So I think it will continue to be a great alternative for travelers. But, again, I am not want to believe that anything about what we're going through will be permanent. I recall very well, people's commentaries about the future of travel after 911 and the future of New York City after 911, all of which turned out to be untrue. So I am a general optimist in this regard. I think, again, people have shown -- I think travels like water it finds its way. If I can't go international, I'll go domestic. If I don't want to fly, I'll drive. If I don't want to stay in a hotel, I'll stay in an alternative accommodation. But I don't think we've really seen long term any reason to believe there's long term behavioral change. Sorry, and then to your second question on performance marketing. I would say, my comments were really about the short term week to week, little differences, they're blips all over the world. blips in demand, as Eric talked about, and you can spend all day chasing all those little blips, or you can work on the foundational work and we are working on the foundational work. That does not mean in any way that we're willing or desirous of yielding share. It just means that we're trying to keep the team focused on the bigger long term pot of money as opposed to getting an extra share point in a market that's doing a little better, but it's still down 70% or something. So we are willing to make those short term little changes. We still want to have share. We still want to drive our rightful share of market if anything, and I said it last time we spoke. I believe that we can grow share while growing profitability. That is my strong belief. But we have to do a lot of work to do the foundational stuff to get there. And one, I've talked about it before, but being able to optimize for multi brand is a complicated exercise, being able to figure out geographically where we push and where we pull back. All of those things are going on right now. So I think, again, we won't land it till we come out of this, but we have no general thesis that we're going to give up x many share points for x much profit. We would like to keep our share and just be much, much more profitable and thereby be able to drive even more share. And that is our goal. Deepak Mathivanan : Right. Thanks, Peter. Peter Kern : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer & Company. Jed Kelly : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about the flexibility in your brand on spending in the latter part of 4Q if hopefully, optimistic here that we get some positive data on the vaccine news and travel could be recovering, your flexibility on brand. And then just Vrbo, can you talk about -- are you benefiting on the shoulder seasons and fall bookings with people being able to work from home? And can you talk about the Vrbo booking window? Peter Kern : Sure. Thanks for the questions. I would say, on the Vrbo part, we are focusing on the new realities around working from home. We have been pushing a variety of campaigns around helping people with that idea, home work, home school, the importance of WiFi and kind of products like that in this changed world. And as many of you are probably experiencing the question of the school year and how kids will go back to school varies greatly across the U.S. latter on world. And so I think there will be kind of different and unique opportunities to capitalize on that. We are using some campaigns, testing something out. We do thing the fall will be different that it has historically been. We do think the Christmas season could well be different, whether it just longer or we have seen over the summer these extended booking windows where people are booking for longer periods of time as they just recap to somewhere different with their family for a month. And I think we'll see some trends like that. But its too early to tell what the fall, honestly, what the fall will really look like. And I think candidly that's because probably uncertainty in the world that people still don't know if their kids are physically going to go to school or not. Are they going to need to go into work or now, all of those things. So I think as we get some clarity on that, which of course is coming in the month of August. In a large part, I think we'll start to get better picture. As far as brands can goes, whilst the lot of tools to push our brands. Some of them are historically the classic linear television or that matter all the new on-demand or streaming service. It include advertising. There's obviously digital products that can be use for branding and video as well as performance. So we have a lot of different levers to push. I would say, we have fair amount of latitude to dial things up we want to. We have obviously dial things down considerably. But again during period, going to back to sort of being really internally maniacally focused, our focus on brand separation, we're doing a lot of work around our branding, around particularly our brand and in brand Expedia to really define the brand stands for, separate and apart from hotels and Vrbo et cetera.  So there's a lot of really good going on, and I think we'll be an excellent position to kind of go through the stages or recovery as people start to get more comfortable and we land some messaging around that. And then with big push when things get more normalized about where we want to put and place each brand and what each brand is going stand for. So that's important work. Candidly, we haven't done that way ever being now as one group, defining each brand and each brand proposition. We're basically doing that work. We just put those groups together, couples or maybe not even two months ago. So we will be ready. We will have ample capital when the market's ready. And I think we will have much better brands separation and positioning for the future when we're ready to probably trigger on all. So -- but we certainly have many ways to do it. And frankly, each brand is effective in different ways and different lanes. So some brands had great success with YouTube. Others have been strong in classic television, and others have found other ways. So we have a lot of tools to use. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman. Kevin Kopelman : Thank you. So question on the revenue trends. You noted that new bookings from June were down about 45% and it fell off a little in July. Can you help us translate that new bookings metric directional into what it would mean for revenue given some of the puts and takes there? Thanks. Eric Hart : I'll take that one. I mean, generally, I guess there's a couple of components that I would point to in there. Cancellations just going back in time and the impact of COVID, cancellations obviously spiked in the April and March time. There's a largely come back down to near but still elevated historical levels. I point that out, obviously that was a big driver, some volatility in our P&L. There is -- when you look at the ADRs and revenue rev per room night, the reason I'm pointing -- I'm pointing out a couple of different areas that maybe different than historical. So that there maybe some noise. On the ADR side, you saw that that go up or increased 1%. And that's 45% numbers that you mentioned -- that ADR is driven by Vrbo. ADR is higher because there's strong demand. We're mixing the Vrbo. But our -- that offsets double digit decreases in hotel. And then revenue per night has some of the similar impacts as well. So I would say that the P&L is going to be noisy. And I just gave you a few examples of how the amount of noise that has flowed through in Q2. So I would love to say that it's -- that whatever the range falls in July for the rest of the quarter will hit our P&L in the way that it has historically, or as we've seen in last year, if you will. But as Peter and I both mentioned, there is a bunch of noise. I think Q2 at least the latter part of Q2 probably gives us some indication. But it's going to be a bit noisy over the next few months. So I can't give you a definitive answer, if you will. Kevin Kopelman : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then if I could just ask one other question. Can you talk about what you're seeing in Europe? And to what extent has Europe travel been picking up? And is that having a meaningful impact for Expedia in terms of offsetting their kind of recent role on U.S.? Eric Hart : Yes. I was going say -- I would say Europe was a was a bit slower than the U.S. could pick up. I think we've mentioned that a number of different times during the fundraising process, et cetera, where the U.S. started rebounding earlier, particularly in lodging, particularly as Peter mentioned, and the intersection of domestic drive to and whole homes, whereas EMEA was slower. Now, We have seen EMEA on the lodging side, start recover a bit. It's just more of a methodical improvement over time. I mentioned earlier on air, air is challenged more so than hotel and all geographies. And I would say, what we've seen thus far in Europe is continues to be quite challenged. There's a different mix between how domestic and international in Europe versus the U.S. And even though in the U.S., air still declined, still quite low. In EMEA, you just got a high rate of international travel, and there's just a lot of uncertainty that that remains. So. Europe continues to be pretty tepid on the on the air side. So good signals in EMEA. Time will tell. Slow on the air side. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Peter. Eric Hart : Yep. Thanks, Kevin. Peter Kern : thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. And your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe one for each of you. Peter, just understanding the industry dynamic, with demand where it is, anything you're seeing interesting on the supply side of either more alternative accommodations being listed broadly on a global basis, or hotels more willing to work with the OTAs? Typically, if go back and look historically, those are periods of time where the OTAs tend to gain some share of supply when end demand has never been as low as this, but low generally. So I'm just curious what you might be seeing on the supply side as opposed to the demand side looking at the marketplace? And then, Eric, you made a point in the 8-K of the merchant liabilities starting to improve. Wanted to just get a check in on the balance sheet. How you guys are thinking about merchant liabilities is the drag? Has that stabilized? And how should we think about aligning the balance sheet against both your growth goals and your capital return potential goals over the medium to long term? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Yes. Thank you very much. So I'll take the first one and say, it's a couple different buckets. I mentioned the opportunity we think there is around more supply coming into the Vrbo rental base. People are all looking for ways to monetize their assets. And we do believe and we have seen some early signs, nothing, not a tidal wave or anything but some early signs that there's opportunity there. And we do market to that audience, and we do try to build that side of the platform. So, that's ongoing. I think there's solid opportunity there. But it's relatively early days. And I think, again, again, you all have your own views about what the economy will look like coming out of this and all -- globally, et cetera, but we think there's opportunity there. As for the big players on the air and lodging side, look, our main goal is to get everybody back in business and drive as much business as we can to all those players. We are trying to be as collaborative as we can. But I would say, yes, there is by and large a willingness and openness to work together on new ideas, things that have been sitting on the shelf for a while that have been talked about but never moved on. I think there's some interesting things we can do with some of our lodging partners that we're looking at. There's a lot of opportunity for air, and we're working to improve our air product and we're working with our air suppliers, so we can make that good for everybody. And yes, there is a general sense of collaboration and willingness to work on new ideas to drive business for everybody. And I would say that in times like this you would expect and we are making up more share of everybody's wallet on the supply side. So we're not trying to put the screws to anybody who are trying to collaboratively look at how we can grow their business, help grow our business. And we are keenly focused on that. So there is definitely opportunity. Again, I don't think it's about leveraging a moment. It's really about an openness that you get at a time like this where everybody's in a bit of a crisis to look at opportunities, to work together to grow the business, to improve both sides, and that's what we're focused on. Eric Hart : Hey, this is Eric. I'll take the second half of the question. And thanks for the question. I'm going to give slightly a longer update, because I think there's a fair number of questions I suspect we'll get during the call. So let me try to give a bit of a holistic update on the balance sheet and cash. So if you look at the deferred merchant bookings, and again, for everyone's edification, deferred merchant bookings is where we accept customers cash, we then hold on to that and remit it to suppliers post stay, if you well. It did decrease $1.3 billion during the quarter. But if you look at the trend over that quarter, it was a significant drop in April, a slight decline in May, and then actually increase in June. The increase in June is driven by Vrbo, which we've talked a lot about the strong bookings, growth actually year-on-year that occurred in Vrbo. If you look at non-Vrbo within that deferred merchant booking, it was essentially flat between May and June. So if you would go in reverse and we look back and what we are observing in the April and March, April, May timeline where that DMB or that Deferred Merchant Booking was really declining. I would say we feel pretty darn good about how the latter part of the quarter looked from a Deferred Merchant Booking standpoint. I then move to cash. I know a lot of this is in the financials that we publish. But essentially, we started the quarter with $4.1 billion, essentially a change, call it, operating of negative 1.4. We then raised approximately $4 billion of financing. Obviously, it was a little bit less than that from a net standpoint. So at the end of the quarter, we had $5.5 billion, and that's excluding the 1.25 incremental raise that we did earlier this month. And then lastly, which is related to all of this is and I suspect there's a question coming just around that $275 million cash burn rate that we talked about. And over the -- when we've talked about over the last couple of months and quarters. Remember, this is effectively contribution neutral. Revenue, less cost of revenue, less marketing, we assume that zero. And then what is the cost to run the business. So i.e. what is the cost to keep the site up? What is the cost to keep the lights on? We had said previously that we would be at approximately at $275 million burn rate per month. And we said, we would get to that by the end of the year. I'm happy to say that we are operating broadly in that range right now. So we have achieved it faster than we anticipated. Just one point of clarification, because I know it comes up occasionally. It does exclude restructuring costs associated with our cost program. And then because we raised $1.25 billion, we will have about $5 million of incremental interest expense. But sort of net-net feel very good about the DMB where the trend is. We're in a strong cash position and feel really good about our overall cost program and what that burn rate looks like. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for all the color. Eric Hart : Yep. Got it. Thank you for the question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line Lee Horowitz with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Lee Horowitz : Great, thanks for taking the question. So you're sticking with Vrbo with obviously booking trends remaining really strong for the pandemic. I guess, is there anything you're seeing there as it relates to traffic next in terms of paid traffic versus direct to Vrbo? And how you would expect that to perhaps evolve over the course of this crisis? Eric Hart : Yeah, absolutely. One of the things that I think I have heard other places as well, as you know, many of us retrenched that out of competitive advertising and ad of the auctions, to a large extent when things got really bad in March and April. We have been waiting back in with all our brands. But much more delicately with Vrbo, because candidly, Vrbo has been the beneficiary of a huge amount of direct traffic, and essentially organic traffic. So, the mix of business has been extremely profitable on a relative basis for Vrbo. And that has been terrific. We're not against using performance marketing in Vrbo. And we certainly are trying to use it definitely. But our mix and our returns on marketing are at massively higher levels than they -- we were historically running at in, call it, late 2019. So, yes, there's definitely been and I don't want to say, its a structural shift. We'll see what the world like, when everything normalizes. But what we have seen that the brand is quite strong that people can find us. And that we're important as an organic option and a great option for travelers. So I think the mix is terrific there right now. And, you know, no doubt as we grow --- but as we continue to grow and other players get a little healthier, we may see a mix change a bit, but right now, that makes it terrific. Lee Horowitz : Great. Thanks for taking question. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Great. This is James on for Brent. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had one for Eric. Can you give us an update on what your CapEx spend is looking like for the back half of 2020 and then first half of 21. I know you have the headquarters which should be completed by early next year, but just want to know what your other capex spend might look like and how we should think about that from a modeling perspective. Thanks. Eric Hart : Yes. Our CapEx presume you saw was $206 million. Of that 34 million was of headquarters, again, we gave an update last quarter that we restarted on headquarters, and that's been 115 million for the first half of the year, excluding headquarters to 172 million. Just to give you the components up there to highlight level. the vast majority is uncapitalized labor, that's essentially employees that are doing tech developments. And we should see some improvement in that capitalized labor, just given the cost program and some of the actions that we've taken to date. We've got the data center is where we continue to move more into the cloud. That data center CapEx should moderate as well. And then by -- essentially the cap labor on data center captures most of it. So what I would say, not giving you too specific numbers, if you will, is that for 2020, we should come in less than we were in 2019, with all the various moving parts. And then as we go into 2021, as that headquarters rolls off, we should be much more efficient. We should require less CapEx and ultimately see better cash conversion. But hopefully that gives you an order of magnitude on 2020. And then over time, it should it should get more efficient to. Unidentified Analyst : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Kuntarich with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chris Kuntarich : Maybe just start on the vacation rental side, just kind of parsing out the difference of what's going on in vacation rental and hotel. I think you has mentioned that VRVO was growing. So just maybe first, since you guys have seen sort of the plateau in July. Is there any difference going on in the cancellation and new bookings From the two? Eric Hart : Yes. I would say broadly, cancellation rates have stayed pretty consistent. We won't . I would say there's anything noteworthy between how hotels and vacation rental is performing except that hotel has taken longer to, you know, is on a slower trajectory to recovery. Clearly vacation rental was very strong. We saw demand exceed prior years during some of these compression periods, which in a world like this is great to see and hotel just been on a slower pace to recovery but I think on the cancellation side we haven't seen anything noteworthy. And again broadly, cancellation have remained stable for the last -- for July, June et cetera, its not -- there's no big uptick in cancellations that we've seen. So the real different is, that compression of early bookings that were in the vacation rental space that the hotel shouldn't see I would say. And then easing of that compression period into July. And where the hotels have been slowly making up ground on a more leaner basis. Chris Kuntarich : Got it. And maybe just a follow-up. As it relates to cloud cost, I think you been called up previously that 2020 level should be below 2018. And I was curious as you guys got further into the year. If you can put any bit of a final point on that? Thanks. Eric Hart : Yes. I think the story remains the same. Just to recap for those that may not have full story. We brought all of our cloud teams and do a singly unite, they have the ability to optimize the right side of the computer. So we've been able to really push and accelerate that in the COVID environment. So it gave us some short term benefits and we think that overly bear fruit over the long term as well. Better economics with our vendors etc cetera. But over that by 2020 we do expected to be down. However when volumes start a year. It does obviously have a variable component to it. And so, as that volume comes back you would expect to grow a long method as well. But I think sort of magnitude or the story that we tell before still holds. Chris Kuntarich : Got it. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. And your line is open. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, guys. We want to ask just sort of hypothesis on. Generally, when consumers travel close to home, I think you see shorter durations and less expensive accommodations versus when you're traveling farther and internationally. Is that valid? Is that valid in old days? But are you seeing those dynamics change now with more local travel coming back, replacing longer international trips. You see consumers trading up verse what they would normally spend staying longer on durations. Anything you could tell us about kind of the propensity to spend as local starts first versus International? Thanks. Peter Kern : Eric, I'm going to first. I'll take a whack at if you want. Eric Hart : Yes, sure. Peter Kern : There's a lot going on in that question. But I would say a few things. We have seen pricing and propensity to pay et cetera and long duration very evident in the vacation rental business. People in compressed markets have been able to push what they charge and suppliers that is. And people have, as I mentioned, they're staying longer. And so that, if anything driving up as you think about from an ADR standpoint that I think broadly find in hotel space. There has been not the inroads [ph] but there's more pressure on pricing and more discounting? Why do you look for keep those comfort and propensity to go to hotels has been less robust. So its kind of exactly what you'd expect from a supply and demand standpoint. I think in terms of local versus non-local and duration on the hotel side, I don't know, if Eric has any good data there. But I don't think we've seen dramatic change there. I think that's been similar. And yes, in terms of total wallet share of a domestic trip is tend to be smaller than an international trip. But again, I think this is just everyone's finding their opportunity. So of course, air is suffering more than lodging, even though as far as I know, nobody's yet said they've gotten sick on an airplane. But air still is something people are less comfortable with. And so, people are driving and finding other ways to get to hotels and things. And -- but I think domestic -- local domestic is sort of slowly filling up the holes of international. So I think it's really just a volume game. I think the ADR question is really just a function of overall supply and demand and its acting exactly as you would expect it, which is if you're in a compressed market on the Florida coast, and there aren't enough homes and a lot of interested people, you can push pricing. And you do. And if you're a hotel somewhere where not a lot of tourists are going maybe like New York right now. You have to compete, and therefore you try to compete on price. Eric Hart : Yes. I think you've covered it. I'd be careful extrapolating too much on any of the trends you'd see. It's really people solving for the travel that they can and still want to travel. I think the real positive though is that, and Peter mentioned it earlier, that we've just got a lot of people that are getting exposed to the Vrbo brand and alternative accommodations and it's a bit of a fast-forward in that exposure, and we're going to take the approach to build a relationship with those individuals. And I think people are having a great experience. At least that's what I can -- in my conversations anecdotally. So I think that -- it's a very positive outcome for Vrbo from that perspective. Peter Kern : And apologies, I would just triple down. Don't extrapolate too much from any of this. I think this is really a unique moment. And I said it before, but I don't think this portends any difference in how people think about things. It may expose them the more or may make them open to things they weren't open to before. But I don't think we're seeing some structural shift in people's views about hotels or other things. It's just a moment. And it's just about their comfort and their safety and what they're able to do. Brian Fitzgerald : Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Eric. Eric Hart : Yep. Thank you. Operator : We will now the call back over to CEO Peter Kern. Peter Kern : Okay. Thank you everybody for your questions. I hope we gave you a good perspective on the business. I just want to reiterate. We're feeling really good about the internal work we're doing. I commend our teams who have done amazing work in impossible circumstances where everybody's working from home and everything is harder. So can't thank all of them enough. And appreciate you all your questions. As Eric and I said, we hope that you'll see the benefit of all this hard work we been doing as the numbers come back. And we look forward to talking to you in another quarter. So thank you for your time. And everybody stay safe. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Expedia Group Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  I'll now turn the call over to Michael Senno, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Michael Senno : Thanks, Christine. Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by our CEO, Peter Kern; and CFO, Eric Hart.

And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Please note that depreciation expense is now reported in a separate line item, and prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you, Michael. And good afternoon, everybody. I hope you're well. We appreciate we are not the most newsworthy thing going on right now in the country, but thank you for spending a little time with us, and hopefully we can help give you some more color on our quarter. I'll start by saying, as I said before, that travel generally performs in this period as everyone has expected. And in general closings, openings, worries over the pandemic, have the - the exact influence you expect. But we were pleased to see in the third quarter that we\u2019re stabilizing travel trends and significant improvements on our cost structure, we were able to post markedly improved performance. I'm going to get into some of the internal workings, including margin, expanding on it, which actually Eric will cover in his remarks. But first, I just want to make a few comments on the recent trends in travel. What we saw over the third quarter was basically a stabilization, as I said. July was down in lodging gross bookings net of cancellations. This was a function of two things. You may recall there was a slight increase in COVID cases being reported then, and that had some impacts on travel, along with Vrbo for us, which had a very, very strong June. And that strength subsided a bit. It still was strong in July. So July again, lodging gross bookings net of cancellations was up about 65%. And in the months that ensued, that got to the low to mid-50% range down. So a reasonable improvement, a steady improvement, and that obviously helped with our third quarter results. Vrbo continued to be quite strong, as I said, coming off that June high which was a lot of pent-up demand. But the third quarter was strong. We were up year-over-year, which brand travel business of course is terrific in the world we're living in. And we think it bodes well both because we brought in a lot of new customers and we believe those customers will have long-term value for us. And we're - it's helping to land the Vrbo brand and making people more familiar with it. On the hotel side, North America actually has been pretty steady and improving since July. But Europe for us in general has been a little rockier. Cases were rising in the ensuing months. And of course in the last week or two, we've seen a lot of changes, and I'll get into that in a minute. But - so North America was generally positive through the period in conventional lodging, and Europe was slightly subsiding over that period. Air continues to lag lodging. Obviously, international air is very injured at the moment. But I think generally air has been improving. We've seen that across domestic here. And we think that people are getting more comfortable with the safety protocols and understanding the safety of flying, and we think that's good news. And obviously the airlines all reported and they have higher hopes, subject to this third wave of course for the holiday season. The last couple of weeks, which we're all acutely watching, again have had the impact, I would suggest, that pretty much most of us would expect, which is to say Europe has been acutely hurt by it, but North America has remained pretty strong. It's down, but still showing relative strength compared to Europe. Obviously in our case, that's a little beneficial given our mix of business towards North America, but nothing can be known yet about how these trends will continue. And of course if there are more closures, if there are closures in the US in any way or if there are other lockdowns in Europe that will have an impact on the overall business. I want to talk a minute about market share because you may have observed that in some cases, market share has been shifting around in world ways during COVID. And for us, certainly that is true. There is a few things to note here. One is obviously alternative accommodations have been quite strong, not just for us, but for others. Obviously, that's been great news for Vrbo and we\u2019ve been a big beneficiary area of that, but that has shifted lodging share significantly across geographies. We've also seen that there's a lot of unique use cases during the pandemic, much more not only domestic and not only secondary and tertiary market travel, but very purpose-driven travel going to visit family, needing to do specific work, needing to go to one of these small markets. There's much discovery going on and price shopping. And there seems to be more direct bookings in the smaller market independent hotels as people are calling to make sure they're open, make sure that safety protocols, et cetera are happening. And conversely, the places where we typically have the most share is things like big urban markets, international travel, international packaged travel, et cetera, have obviously been among the most impacted. So we have seen some share shift in that. And I want to reiterate and I've said it before, that we combined our performance marketing team during this period. And we are doing a lot of plumbing work to retool and recalibrate all the algorithms and everything we do, so that we can optimize a multi-brand instead of brand against brand. There's a lot of work going on. It is a significant effort. But during this period while we do that and while there is so much uncertainty in the market, we clearly have a bias towards profitability, which you've probably seen in our numbers. And the bias to towards caution given that cancellation rates and other things are very volatile and very hard to predict. So we are not chasing share that might be unprofitable or the brick wall we might run into with closures and COVID cancellations. We're trying to be prudent here while we rebuild everything, on the theory that we will be at our end state by the time COVID is over. Or more precisely travel trends come back to more normal levels. And we believe, as I said before, that once that plumbing is rebuilt and once we're ready for multi-brand that we will be able to not only maintain, but grow share at similar or better profitability as we have had before. Moving on to what we are doing internally. Again, I won't belabor this, but we're focused on several areas, one of which I've talked about before. That is our brands and how we join those groups together. We're focused on brand differentiation, clearly showing and demonstrating what those value propositions are to the market, and how they differ from one another, making choices about which brands we market where geographically, and how we lean into all the marketing channels for different brands. And there's a lot of work going on for their coming out of COVID and through COVID brand marketing side. We're obviously leaning heavily into Vrbo. We think it's having a moment. All the research shows that it has gained share and it has gained awareness, and there's some very positive things going on with that brand. But we are also looking at and we'll start to lag in, we're obviously being cautious given the last couple of weeks' news. But we will lag into our other brand marketing, including Hotel.com. and Expedia just signed a long-term sponsorship with Liverpool, the soccer team in the UK, that we think will be important to landing that brand and pushing it in UK and in the end, particularly us, and there's a brand new raft of creative coming out on the back end of the virus. So a lot of work going in there, to be really clear on what we're doing, where we're doing it and how we're investing behind each brand. We're also heavily interested and excited about the opportunity in the B2B side and in helping our supply partners. We've talked before about our Expedia Partner Services business. We are a leader in this space, and we feel very good about our opportunity here. In fact, we believe we can grow share here during COVID as we help our B2B partners come out faster and help more partners over time. We have expanded our partnership on the supply side with Marriott in terms of their wholesale distribution partnership. And we are spinning [ph] that partnership, similar partnerships to optimize distribution with other chain partners. And we think that's going to be a great opportunity to help our supply partners and also build our B2B business. So a lot of exciting things going on there, including extending a lot of the technological advances we've made on our platform things. We've talked about before, like our voice conversation platform, which we had externalized to some of our B2B partners. And now we've done that with our advertising platform, media services, MeSo, we call it. So there's a number of places we've been able to take advantage of improvements technologically in our B2B business. So lots more to go there. And finally and perhaps most importantly, the underpinning technical platform and architecture that we have talked about, that work continues. It is big, structural, foundational work. It is part of what helps us, on the efficiency side. We've had great wins on the cloud and licensing areas, which we've talked about before, but there's a thousand small wins across the business. I'm getting out of the business and talking about little ones here and there. And so they're really noticeable and impactful. But the whole idea of putting that platform together, re-architecting it for the future, was so we could be agile, make these improvements that will win across much more of the business, not just the brands, but the B2B businesses. And we're starting to unlock those things. And obviously a lot more work to do here. What we're doing as much as we can as fast as we can, while we suffer through COVID. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric, except to say that, we obviously can't control, what's going on there - out there in the travel market, or in the scientific community. We are hoping for all the same things you are in terms of vaccine, and other treatments that will help us get through this. We do believe that people have been up, until this recent wave, getting increasingly comfortable with the idea of traveling. This will obviously have an impact recently. But, it will remain bumpy and unpredictable. And we can't control that. In the meantime, our teams are highly focused internally. And I'll just say I want to thank our teams that have done tremendous work, in a very unpleasant environment and really done a lot to help our customers, help our suppliers help the company do better. And also importantly done some very hard work, around how we manage our human resources and how we structure our organization. And unfortunately, we had to make some significant moves on people, which is of course the worst work we do. But the teams have done a terrific job. And I'm very optimistic about the work they're doing for the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Eric Hart : Thanks Peter. And thanks, everyone, for joining as well. While we continue to see significant year-over-year declines, in our business in the third quarter, taking into account the impact of COVID is having on travel, our financial performance was better than we expected, with over $300 million in adjusted EBITDA and reaching essentially cash flow neutral in September, for the first time since February. As you know and I've discussed in previous quarters, we are keenly focused on driving margin expansion, which largely falls within three buckets, resetting the fixed cost base, reducing variable costs of revenue, and increasing marketing efficiency. I'm going to touch on, excuse me, each of those individually. So first, on fixed cost bases, as you'll recall, we started the year targeting $300 million to $500 million, in annualized savings. And we were tracking ahead of that amount, as of our last call. Since then, we've identified additional headcount reductions in certain areas. And incremental opportunities across the P&L to drive efficiency, in areas like real estate and software and licensing. We are now targeting $700 million to $750 million, in annualized run rate savings, compared to our 2019 exit rate. And we've already actioned over $550 million. As you project this forward, please keep in mind, we'll have annual increases in the remaining cost base. And also make targeted investments in some areas. But overall we've made great progress on fixed costs. And longer term, our platform operating model will position us, to scale the business, far more efficiently going forward. On variable costs of revenue, there are three primary areas, we're targeting. First is on our payments platform. We're lowering our transaction fees and improving economics on our virtual cards that we use for merchant payments. Second is, we're extending the conversations platform to handle more customer calls through self-service and virtual agents to lower customer service costs. And we're reducing our variable portion of cloud spend with the optimization efforts we've already executed and will continue to do so. Given the variable costs are volume based, these savings will not be fully evident until we return to normalized operating levels. We still have work to do in these areas, but I wanted to give some context. But if we overlay what we believe, we can achieve on these initiatives on our 2019 business level, they would collectively deliver savings of over $200 million, which is incremental to the $700 million to $750 million fixed cost savings that I mentioned previously. The third area of margin improvement is around marketing efficiency. As we've discussed, we expect the combination of operating at higher ROIs, the benefits of lower variable costs and optimization across our brands result in lower direct marketing expense as a percent of revenue over time. Turning to our Q3 results. The impact from COVID-19 continue to distort some areas of our P&L, but the bookings improvement that started in the middle of Q2 led particularly by Vrbo, and the progress on cost initiatives led to the improved profitability in the quarter. ADRs in our lodging business increased 8%, due to solid ADR growth at Vrbo and a mix shift to Vrbo, which carries significantly higher ADRs than hotels. Hotel ADRs declined double-digits, but improved sequentially from Q2. Revenue per room nights grew 14% in the quarter, also boosted by the mix shift of Vrbo. In addition, with Vrbo's shift to merchant of record over the past year, we now recognize transaction fees as revenue, which added to the growth in revenue per room night. Do keep in mind that the fees recognized as revenue are largely offset by merchant expenses and cost of revenue. And lastly on take rate, the product mix shift from air to lodging, as well as the incremental merchant-related revenue at Vrbo contributed to the elevated 17% revenue take rate in the quarter. Moving on to cost. The progress we've made on the margin expansion initiatives I've mentioned are becoming evident in our P&L. On overhead costs, which include indirect selling and marketing, tech and content and G&A collectively declined 29%. Excluding Trivago, about two thirds of the overhead savings stemmed from our fixed cost savings initiatives, with the balance from temporary cost savings related to the current environment. On cost of revenue, they declined 32%. Two items impacted the year-over-year comparison. First is incremental transaction costs related to Vrbo's shift to merchant of record, which are highest in Q3 due to Vrbo's seasonality. And then second, they were offset partially by a benefit from the disposal of bodybuilding.com. Excluding these two factors, cost of revenue was down 40% year-over-year. And as we noted, we expect to deleverage on cost of revenue until booking volumes return closer to normalized levels. On direct marketing, we continue to see leverage on direct marketing expenses. We are prudently increasing activity and brand marketing campaign and in performance marketing options where we see demand, but intend to remain disciplined and lean toward profitability. On our segment results, our retail segment performed significantly better than B2B. Retail benefited from growth at Vrbo in the quarter and the higher mix of business in North America, which has a stronger recovery than Europe. Meanwhile, the slower recovery in corporate travel impacting Egencia is a drag on the B2B segment. On cash flow and balance sheet, our reported free cash flow was nearly US$1 billion in Q3. The [Technical Difficulty] driver was approximately $670 million working capital impact from Vrbo's merchant bookings, mainly due to a seasonal decline in Vrbo's deferred merchant bookings given the increased stays over the summer. But as we've noted, Vrbo's merchant bookings largely flows through restricted cash. If you exclude the working capital impact from Vrbo's merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately negative $325 million as the seasonal working capital impact from the decline in deferred merchant bookings, plus other cash items such as CapEx and interest, more than offset our adjusted EBITDA in Q3. On deferred merchant bookings, they declined to total $1.4 billion in Q3 to $3.2 billion, or $2.5 billion excluding deferred loyalty. Vrbo was the biggest contributor to the decline as it ended Q2 with a relatively higher balance, and the seasonality of its stayed room nights is even more weighted to Q3 than the rest of our business. In addition, booking windows have been significantly shorter than usual, which reduces our outstanding deferred booking balance. On our capital structure, as we noted last quarter in July, we opportunistically raised $1.25 billion in debt. Subsequently, we repaid the $750 million notes that matured in August and used the funds raised in July to repay $1.25 billion of our outstanding revolver draw to reduce interest expense. We currently have $650 million drawn on our revolver. As of the end the third quarter, unrestricted cash and short-term investments totaled $4.4 billion. Excluding the capital markets activity I just mentioned, cash declined roughly $325 million, similar to our free cash flow excluding the Vrbo merchant activity. And total cash was essentially flat in September for the first time in February. In addition, amounts held in restricted cash and other non-cash balance sheet assets covered nearly 60% of our deferred merchant booking balance, excluding deferred loyalty. Looking ahead to Q4 adjusted EBITDA, as you can imagine, it's a very difficult environment in which to forecast or predict the business and also will result in a wider range of outcomes. With our current trading volumes and what we're seeing in the business, we do expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be negative. There are two primary factors that are contributing to it. One, is Q4 is seasonally a quarter with lower revenue and profit, so it's just lower relative to our cost basis. And then number two, given the recovery in lodging, bookings has essentially plateaued relative to the recovery over the summer months. We currently expect the revenue decline to be in a similar range as it was in Q3. In closing, this remains a tough environment for our business, and we're going to be dealing with the COVID impact for the foreseeable future. As Peter mentioned, we have clear priorities that our teams are making great progress on. And we're confident the actions we're taking now will benefit us through the recovery and over the long term. Operator, we're ready to take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two, if I can. First, I just wanted to make sure I understood you correctly earlier. When you said - I think you said the core fixed cost savings target is now $700 million to $750 million. But then you said you've been able to reduce variable costs, if I heard you right. Which overlaid on 2019 for example, would be an additional $200 million in savings, so approaching $1 billion on kind of a normalized basis. So the question is just did I catch that right? And does it feel like you're getting to the kind of edges of the scope of savings there, given the magnitude we're talking about? And then the second one would just be, as you work to bring all the marketing data from separate brands into kind of a consolidated kind of new data storage for marketing. Any - is it early enough that you \u2013 in enough that you can see some early learnings, or is it too soon to say in any sense for the timing on when you guys will be in a place where you feel good about that, that transition. Thanks. Eric Hart : Peter, do you want me to take the first. Peter Kern : Yeah, I'll take the first you take the second. So I on the first, yes you did hear correct may so [ph] the $700 million, $750 million is on the fixed cost basis. It's in relation to the $3 million to $500 million that we spoke of earlier in the year, of the $700 million, $750 million we've actioned $550 million of that, so we are feeling like we are making good progress against it. We of course continue to leave no stone - no stone unturned. And just as we continue to work through it, we get more cost that we've identified, we get confidence and those that we get better line of sight in. And then also, obviously we've actioned a fairly large percentage of it. So yes, it's the $700 million, $750 million on a fixed cost basis, and then the incremental $200 million on the variable cost of sales with spent approaches to your math, approximately a $1 billion in savings. Now you mentioned it, but I just want reiterate as well, that is on the 2019 exit rate if you will, so that \u2013 those numbers presume that we\u2019re back in a range that is approximately at the 2019 levels. And then lastly, there will be some offsets for that, over time, you can imagine inflation on contracts or increases and headcount costs, et cetera. So there will be some offset. But we feel pretty confident in the numbers that we're going after and then continue to \u2013 the teams are doing a great job. And I guess it was the last part of your question just around, are we reaching the edge of it, and I would say, you know, we're still flipping over rocks. But it's, you know, diminishing returns to a certain extent, so I would say the range that we shared with you is sort of the probability adjusts where we think we will get. Eric Hart : Yeah. And Lloyd, I'll just jump in on the other question, I would say the answer is no, we haven't. It's not wired together yet in a way that we can see the early wins. I think we are, you know, getting closer, but it's not simply a matter of taking three different groups and putting them together. I've mentioned on previous calls that we've been also consolidating all our data. And, you know, doesn't - you know 17 data [indiscernible] into hopefully one soon. And all of these things, you know, are kind of linked together. So there's a lot of great work going on. I think we are getting closer and I'm excited about what we're going to be able to see when we can see the granular level of detail and profitability by, you know by customers, by geos, by everything, which we haven't had the granularity we like. And that has made us, I would say blunter instrument then we\u2019d like to be and we believe there's significant you know, good guys from getting this all wired together and that again is why we want to make short term trade-offs to that important work, to get that done, but we haven't seen any early returns yet. I think will be a little while still. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay, thank you. Impressive job on the cost side, guys. Thanks. Peter Kern : Just one other quick add to that and thanks for the question again is. We are still taking the action to achieve those numbers, so just make sure as you're building those, and there's the lens of [ph] we need the volume to come back to see particularly on the variable cost side. And we are still actually [ph] in the \u2013 and as I mentioned, the 550 on the fixed cost side is going to take us still some time to get to the gap of that and the seven to 7 to 750. And the same thing on the cost of revenues as well. It will take us a bit of time to get there. But that's what we're shooting for and what we think we'll get. Lloyd Walmsley : All right. Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line from Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yeah. Thanks a lot. Just a couple, one on the costs side. Eric, you called out the incremental $200 million in variable cost savings, and you named three areas. We tried to think about the relative magnitude of savings in each of these areas? How would you stack them up or number them? And then I had a question on the gross bookings side. So you talked about a plateauing in October versus Q3. Is that overall for the business or just US? How should we think about that? And is that plateauing on gross bookings or on net basis? How should we think about that? Eric Hart : Yeah. I'll take the first one. And Peter, perhaps you can take the second one, but I'm happy to take it as well. But on the cost of revenue, there's three components. There's the conversation platform and the cost of savings, the credit card and the variable. And I would effectively put them in that order to a certain extent. But I think the one that has the largest opportunity for us is on the conversation platform. We are historically primarily a phone-based contact center-type of conversations with customers and with our supply partners as well. And with the technology that we've developed, we have the ability to move a lot of those either to self-service or virtual agent. And on the virtual agent side, we are able to get more - service more customers, if you will, per agent. And so both of those add leverage to the system. And we've really started the rollout into that. We've gotten good NPS scores and good returns, if you will from doing that. And it's really a process of rolling that out, making sure that we have more and more use cases, we get it embedded into the right flows into the site, into the mobile apps as well. And I think that is likely the largest opportunity. And then credit card costs and variable cloud as well are meaningful, but I would say that those two are a distant second, if you will, after the conversation platform opportunity. Peter Kern : Yes. And then I guess Eric, you can follow on, and I'll do cover\u2026 Eric Hart : Yes. On the volume side, I think this recovery is going to be a series of many stories. And so if you take hotel, for instance, and I could say that that's been flat for the last couple of months. But if you de-average that number, what you actually end up seeing is that there are areas that are flat to declining, and there are areas that are gradually improving. And so using a hotel as the example, Europe has been more challenged. Peter already mentioned that. And they've got even more challenged over the last week or two, just given the increasing lockdowns that are reoccurring. Whereas the US is had a more steady increase over time on the hotel side, we will see what happens with the wave three that's occurring right now, and something that we're looking at very closely. But as we say it's plateaued, it's actually many stories underneath. And I think we're going to see the same thing. We've got international versus domestic. And we wait in some regions of the world in one versus the other. And that's the series of many stories that will make up how we see overall the business is performing. Peter Kern : Yes. And the only color I'd add to that is our numbers also include bookings from our B2B partners and people in other parts of the area. So it makes the many stories even more vast in terms of our exposure to different geographies, our exposure to different types of business. So I would say thinking of it as a whole is probably the simplest way, but all things being equal with the trend the way they are in the last two weeks, its probably good news that we're weighted towards North America. But there have been times when it's been something else. And we wish we had more China business since domestic China is doing quite well relative to the rest of the world. Naved Khan : Got it. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Eric. Peter Kern : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Two questions, please. You mentioned market share, but in North America, do you see any evidence of material market share shifts amongst the different providers, Airbnb, Booking, Expedia? Secondly, you mentioned those three areas of cost efficiency, the fixed, the variable, and then you talked about performance marketing. Can you just drill down a little bit more on performance marking? I know you've had some pretty bold robust plans for bringing performance marketing efficiencies. And then all of a sudden, we had COVID. Is it clear to you that you've got enough evidence that you can really - that there are new found efficiencies in performance marketing? It's still TBD to when we get real robust recovery in travel conditions. Just spend a little bit more time, please, on performance marketing efficiencies. Thanks a lot. Eric Hart : Peter, are you there? Did we lose you? Peter Kern : Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Unmute button was on. Sorry, Mark. I'll jump in. I was saying, I'll take the second one first, and then you can remind me the first one. I would say on the Performance marketing side, you are correct. We have talked historically about bringing more efficiency out of it, getting our return on marketing better, more precise, et cetera. The problem was I think that was to, to some extent, wishful thinking because we did not have all the data, all the tooling and all the approaches synchronized, if you will. We let our brands compete. That has some dis-synergies that never were quantified, but certainly existed. We did not have the benefit of all the data, because each brand had its own data and on and on and on. So I am positively optimistic that when we have all data flows right and we have all the algorithms rewritten for that and when we have the tooling right, there should be significant upside for us in actually getting \u2013 bringing out that return that you've heard about over these many years. I think that is what is required. And it is real, and we will get to it. We have to do it obviously. We haven't done it yet. But to otherwise sort of mess around the idea of taking one brand higher or lower, it was a very blunt set of instruments and I think candidly, it was optimistic to think we could do a lot better. We certainly could have run more profit at the expense of share. That we certainly made some trades for share over a profit historically. And we certainly make trades like that in certain geos and for certain reasons over time. But I think more broadly, the opportunity to just perform better is really unlocked by stringing all of those work together and really making it powerful. So I'm a total believer in it and I think it will happen. But we haven't done it yet, so we have to do it. And then sorry, Mark, your first question? I apologize. Mark Mahaney : Yeah. Do you think that there's clear signs of a market \u2013 you brought up market share. Have there been any signs of market share shifts in North America? Peter Kern : Yeah. I think well, definitely you've seen alternative get an outsized share relative to where it was. And we've been beneficiaries of some of that. Airbnb have been beneficiaries of some of that. So the more concentrated you are towards the things, the use cases that are working well, I think you're going to get share benefits.  The \u2013 more broadly, I think share has moved around for a lot of little reasons, and you're dealing with low volumes. So I look at markets where share points move around. And then you look at the dollars related to it, and they're tiny. And you say, okay, it doesn't really matter. It could just be a bad weekend or good weekend. But I think nothing we're seeing is \u2013 portends to anything for the future for like a long-term effect. I don't think there is anything that suggests anyone's winning or losing in a way that will give them long-term benefit. I think for us with Vrbo, we believe it's really good for the brand and people are getting a lot of exposure to that use case. And people are seeing how nice that vacation can be. I don't think that means that people will never go back to hotels, but I think it helps us relative to Airbnb. So that's good for us. And I think beyond that, we don't expect anything going on in any single geo or overall is really a long-term effect, which is partly why we're not overly exercise if - we're not perfectly tuned as a machine to \u2013 on the performance marketing side because none of this is with levels down 50, 60, whatever plus percent in certain markets. It's hard to think that any of that is sustainable or meaningful for the long-term. So that's been our approach. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you very much. Peter Kern : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can, following up on some of the topics talked about so far. On Vrbo, with the success you're seeing in terms of the demand and the new customers that are coming into the platform, is there anything to call out in terms of your go-to-market strategy, your marketing strategy, that you might think portend for sort of longer term, better returns on marketing spend or margin structure in Vrbo as a business? And then on your brand strategy and sort of the realignment of the marketing platform, are you also of the same time thinking through whether you need to be in the same number of brands? What I'm saying scope of brands on a multiyear view towards an eye of like managing a mix of sort of growth versus profitability? Thanks, guys. Peter Kern : Sure. So let me do Vrbo first. Yes. Well, a few things. One, there's a lot of work that's been going on over the last several months on Vrbo and its margins in terms of \u2013 Eric mentioned or we've mentioned in the past. Bringing it on to our payments platform, that's been good for us, saves us money with a third-party provider, allowed us to use power of Expedia's payment platform, which itself is getting stronger every day and more efficient. So those kinds of benefits are there. There's work being done on the consumer process, on the fees and other things that \u2013 where we think we're under market. So I think we've had opportunity and we found opportunity to withstand margins at Vrbo. But to your bigger question, we definitely think that we did not land the Vrbo rebranding as strongly as we wanted to, that there is opportunity now given that so many people are using it and the use case is so attractive right now and that we are concentrated in whole home, which is like the most attractive part of the alternative market right now that we intend to and are already pushing into a much more aggressive part to broadly push the brand. We've turned the brand over in a few more markets in Europe, just a few weeks ago, and we will keep pushing. But yes, there's an opportunity there, and we think that is a place we want to be more bold even in a down market, and we will continue to be pushing into that. To your second question about how many brands we have, yes, we have a lot. We certainly won't keep any - that we don't think makes sense. But right now, we think the number of brands creates opportunity, as long as we have segmented them and thought about them geographically, et cetera, to their greatest effect. So my big push has been, if we have a brand, frankly, that maybe none of you have heard of, like Wotif in Australia, that is our strongest brand for the moment in Australia, then we need to concentrate on building that brand and not worry about whether it's Expedia or hotels.com or anything else. Likewise, Vrbo has a different brand, a different company that acquired in Australia that we're not going to change that brand, because it's a strong local brand and we should push into that. We have historically had this record of, okay. We have an existing brand or we bought a buy brand. We're also going to push Expedia into that market. We're also going to push Hotels. And that kind of, I would say, took away the value of multi-brand, because it didn't allow us to optimize for each one. So that's why we're doing the segmentation work. That's why we're trying to figure out what the proposition is for each brand. Some brands admittedly, we have historically run for more profit, whereas others we have pushed. We are looking at the whole kind of plate of options and driving the best result by country, by brand that we can. And that may mean, we closed some brands in some countries. That may mean, potentially, we close some brands, we\u2019ll stop. But we have no intention right now to do that, but we are looking at the whole thing and trying to optimize for it all. But we think, in general, having more gives us the opportunity to do more, if we do it smartly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of ones on Vrbo. So first, can you talk about where you are currently in terms of in a merchandising Vrbo's augmented accommodations inventory on Expedia and hotels.com? Is that something that you're seeing benefits from currently? Is like, this is a perfect time to kind of channel logo inventory at a higher level into your other strong brands, since consumers are looking for that type of inventory? And then second question related to it, how you feel about the inventory levels on Vrbo, particularly given the strong demand that's there for authentic foundations. Are there any markets where there is inventory pressure on Vrbo at this time? Thanks. Peter Kern : Sure. So a couple of things there. I would say on the latter part, no, there's - we've seen some pressure over the summer a little bit in a few markets, but we haven't generally seen literally not \u2013 no inventory. There's a few spots, but in summer, recall, was everybody getting headlong into the only alternative they were comfortable doing. So there was a really acute demand spike there. We do think there's more opportunity to serve them - more opportunity. And I think we will continue to try to grow our inventory. The question is - and obviously anywhere we see demand, we will want to drive inventory. The question longer term is, we\u2019ve historically had deficit, in particular, in cities in studies and those kinds of use cases, and that is a bigger strategic question for us. It's a place where Airbnb obviously has made great hay, although it hasn't helped them during COVID. Likewise booking has done a nice job with city-based inventory, and to your point, a more integrated experience. And so moving on to that question, the product is not great when it comes to surfacing vacation rental opportunities or alternative foundations through our main OTA brands. We've been slow to get there and it's not where we want it to be. It's definitely an opportunity, but we have found that there is a little bit of a conflict from the standpoint of people don't generally go to our alternative \u2013 go to our OTA brands for alternative accommodations. It's not what they think of. So even though it's there and present, it hasn't performed perhaps the way you or I might think it would. So I think we've got a combination of work we need to do on that front, which is we can definitely make significant improvement in the product and how the content will surface, how people see alternative accommodations and where they see it and et cetera. But also we need to lean into it, and we need to market particular in places where our big OTAs are \u2013 have good reach and brand recognition and Vrbo does not, it may well be more sensible for us to lean into you know, get a vacation home on Expedia as opposed to trying to introduce \u2013 called the Vrbo brand. So we are looking at all that. I would say dual work streams where we're trying to materially improve the product experience with alternative accommodations on the main OTAs, and then how do we market that and how do we test to push that into those markets. And I'll just say while that seems like that would be job one, and we'd be all after it because of the appeal of alternative right now. You have to keep in mind that we are re-architecting literally our entire technical infrastructure and platform. And some of these things have to sort of get prioritized. And it's in the works, but it's not the only thing we're working on. Deepak Mathivanan : That\u2019s help. Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Maybe first question on hotel supply, are you seeing any inroads there or good deals on Expedia that you might otherwise get, any reason for consumers to come directly to Expedia versus other sites? And then secondly, thanks for the Vrbo update. I know you said it grew in 3Q. I'm assuming that's bookings and revenues. Can you give us a year-to-date update on Vrbo? Thank you. Peter Kern : Eric, you want to start to answer the second one, I'm not sure we can. Eric Hart : I don't - we've not shared or disclosed on the Vrbo. The year, I would say we are healthily up for the year. We clearly had the spike in June, just given the summer compression where people felt comfortable traveling. We continue to be up year-on-year in Q3, let's call it at more reasonable levels than June. But both revenue and gross bookings were up year-on-year, and I think you can extrapolate back to the start of the year as well. Justin Post : Got it. And then on hotel supply? Peter Kern : Yeah. On the hotel supply side, we have obviously among the most competitive hotel supply in the world. There's not a lot of discounting that is unique to them. The hotels are discounting, but I don't think there discounting is unique to us. And I think what we provide, what Expedia provides obviously beyond just very good value, is a bunch of ways to find what you want, a bunch of ways to book multi-product, a way to do everything in one place. So there are a lot of offerings with hcom, hotels.com, you get very robust rewards. So there's other offerings that are differentiating for us on the brand side, including where we're trying to go with a product to get a much better personalization, helping make good value choices, et cetera. So, I would say that is where we have to push our business, the differentiated hotel supply, even when we can get it is usually not sustainable. It's not like something that's consistent, but we do want our hotels to be in a better position to optimize our platform. So we are doing an inverse, which is trying to give them better data so that they can be much more effective at pricing and moving the inventory they want to move on our platform. So if that's suites or certain kinds of rooms or whatever, we want to be heating them, the inbound information, so they can understand the market, understand where there's opportunity to price up or down to gain both rooms, et cetera. So that's where we're pushing, and we think that's going to make us a much more valuable partner for the suppliers. But I don't think it's going to be about, if you get a $5 better deal than the next person. I think it's really going to be about how you can help them build their business. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks a lot. I just have a quick follow-up on Vrbo. If you could comment on the seasonality patterns there that you're seeing into Q4 and the current environment? Are you seeing any change there, any kind of continued shift into Vrbo even as we get outside of what is typically the peak season? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. Eric Hart : Sorry, go ahead. Peter Kern : No, no, no. Eric Hart : Thanks for the question. Vrbo is I mentioned earlier, it is much more seasonal than the rest of our business. So it's concentrated in the summer months, even more so than North America given summer. So we would naturally expect to see it come down into Q3 and into Q4, and that is what we're seeing. It continues to be at healthy rates and continues to be a product that I think consumers, in the environment that we're in particular, find compelling to be able to continue to travel. So you can think about our \u2013 the normal travel seasonality of looking in the early part of the year to stay in the middle part of the year and then less activity in the latter part of the year, just magnified in Vrbo relative to the rest of travel. Kevin Kopelman : Right. And then \u2013 well go ahead. Peter Kern : No, I was just going to add that, that is an area we believe there's opportunity and a lot of the advertising and marketing we've been doing with Vrbo have to do with sort of Staycations, if you will, in North America where kids may not be going to school, people may not be going to work. Sort of take your life somewhere else, and we think there is opportunity to break some patterns, while this going on. But that is just a COVID-centric issue. Kevin Kopelman : Got it. And then longer term I think on a like-for-like basis, Vrbo's take rate has been a little bit lower than traditionally you would get with hotel. How do you see that playing out longer term in term of revenue take rate? Eric Hart : Yes, there is a \u2013 I'm happy to take that one. Thanks for the question again. There a is gap between us and Airbnb in particular, and it's something that we do feel that it's \u2013 it gives us a bit of an advantage with consumers, but it is something that we are looking at. This is something that we test. We do think there are opportunities to increase monetization over time. But I would say there continues to be a gap, we are actively looking at that. We are actively testing it. And I do think that there is upside in our monetization over time. Kevin Kopelman : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jed Kelly : Just on Vrbo, just circling back, I mean can you talk about the supply into the winter travel season? It seems like that's going to be premium supply, and then how you think you're there. And then just a follow-up on virtual agent, I mean, what's your confidence level in virtual agent as travel volumes start to normalize? Like is that just around handling normalized volumes? Peter Kern : Yes. So just on the Vrbo supply, I think we are well equipped and well quoted [ph] I think you know, we think they are watching good-value, high-value inventory show up in lots of places people want to go in the winter, do that for Thanksgiving, Christmas, et cetera. And we think there's an opportunity that those trips will be longer in duration than they typically are, given school holidays, et cetera, around the U.S. in particular. But we don't feel like we're deficient on the inventory side. That does not mean we don't have opportunity, and it doesn't mean we have parity everywhere on everything. But we think we have plenty of inventory to power a very robust winter season if the demand is there. So we're not worried about that. And sorry, the second part was... Jed Kelly : Confidence around virtual agent. Peter Kern : Yes, the confidence virtual agent. So I would say to you a couple of things. One, despite the fact that our volumes are down, given COVID, given cancellation rates, given all the issues that travelers have, I wouldn't necessarily assume that our servicing volume is proportionally down. Because we've had \u2013 there's been a lot of traveler issues going on in the world that have created huge relative spikes in traffic. So we've been testing the conversation platform into all kinds of use cases. And we will ultimately have it in virtually everything we do, including our dealings with supply partners and other things. So it is being rolled out broadly. As Eric said, the NPS scores have been strong on it. People generally like to deal with the machine if they can and just get it over with and not have to talk to a person. It's not true universally, but that seems to be true for most people. And we feel very good about it. So it's scaling up. It's a platform tool. It's the kind of tool we want to have in our company, across the company, that we have a platform technology that needs to be taught and taught different use cases and applied consistently. So we have high confidence in its ability to continue to roll out and handle as much traffic as comes in. So no issues there. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Operator : We will now take our final question, Lee Horowitz from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Lee Horowitz : Great. Thanks a lot for the question. Just one if I could. Peter, you had mentioned some of your North American [indiscernible] seeing greater direct bookings, perhaps as people shop less. I'm wondering if you could comment at all on your mix of direct bookings through the quarter. How that may be trending, what you're seeing through this crisis and perhaps your view on how sustainable those trends may be beyond COVID? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Yeah, surely. I would say that what we've seen is mix-wise, we've mixed towards a lot more direct traffic. Bookings are up considerably. Direct is up considerably. But I would caution anyone from taking too much from that because we have been less aggressive in the performance market. So it's a little bit of self-blending, if you will, down to a mix that is more free, which of course has helped all our margins and helped us post the numbers we posted last quarter. But that is inherently in part because we have taken our foot off the gas in certain areas in terms of performance marketing and uprofitable performance marketing. So I think again as we blend back into normalcy, assuming we will be more proficient and have these tools we've discussed about on the performance marketing side, et cetera. My sincere hope is we can grow more share through those performance channels at attractive levels and attractive profitability. And I believe that will happen and if that's true, of course, we'll mix our way back to a more historical balance.  But the trends have been very good, credit to our brand loyalty, or brands loyalty I guess. And app has been very strong. And of course, we are putting lots of energy into improving the products for all those things and make them stickier, because it is gratefully not been a topic today, we do want to have more direct traffic, avoid the performance marketing pools as much as we can and create recurring business. So that remains a core goal for us. Eric Hart : Hey, Peter, before we end, I just wanted to clean up one quick comment I made earlier, just on Vrbo on the year-to-date. Year-to-date, we have seen declines due to the impact earlier this year on COVID. Q3 was up year-on-year, and we were growing early in the year before COVID. So just wanted to clean up the fact that in the early days, if you will of COVID that if you aggregate them for the year, it is down relatively, but was up before and up during. I just wanted to clean that up. Peter Kern : Okay. Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thanks. I will now turn the call back over to Peter Kern. Peter Kern : Great. Well, thank you, everybody. Appreciate the questions. Hopefully, we helped to give you some clarity. Again, we're keenly focused internally still on everything we talked about. And I suspect our next call will sound a lot like that. And hopefully the world's health will get better, and that will help our business along the way. But appreciate the time. Thanks again to our people, and appreciate you \u2013 listening [ph] into questions today. So take care. Bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Please note that, depreciation expense is now reported in a separate line item and prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you very much, Pat. And good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us. I'll be fairly brief as the fourth quarter, of course, kind of reflected what the rest of the year looked like and so much as it was a bumpy ride. COVID news dominated, of course, everything in travel. And I would say that, we saw a mixed world of some optimism coming from the vaccine rollouts beginning, mixed with obviously very bad news on caseloads across the globe, closures in many countries, restrictions all over the various geographies. So with that, as the background, we're happy to turn the page on the year and move into 2021. I will say that, on the whole, as you saw in our release, booking trends in the fourth quarter pretty much near the third quarter at about down 60% for total gross lodging bookings, net of cancellations that did moderate towards the holiday season. And the end of the quarter, and we saw that moderate into the high 50s down. And that has - that improvement has seemed to continue through January. And in the latter part of January, we've seen down in the high 40s. So, the trends are generally good, although, very bad or for all, going in the right direction. But I would caution everybody that, we continue to expect it to be bumpy as this is a story of a thousand different geographies. And a thousand different facts sets around the virus and, of course, vaccine rollouts, et cetera. We did see that improvement overall, driven by Vrbo, not a big surprise. That continues to be a terrific use case with the whole home market being very attractive. Family travel being very attractive in that form. And North America generally has been a relative bright spot, of course, our relative strength in North America certainly helps us in that. So we continue to hope and expect vaccine rollout to drive consumer confidence and drive things forward. But we certainly are not trying to predict what consumer sentiment will be as the buyers changes over the ensuing months. So we continue to expect a bumpy ride. We are watching for what governments are doing, what the rules may be on international travel or things like travel passports, et cetera, with the goal just of making that process as soonest as we can for our travelers and getting people back moving again. We know there's a lot of pent-up demand, and we certainly want to serve it as much as we can. With that market background in mind, in the fourth quarter, we were investing more heavily in marketing. This was intended to get ahead of what we thought would be the coming demand from the vaccine rollouts, but it was largely focused certainly on the upper funnel brand marketing side on Vrbo, where we knew there was a lot of momentum, and as I've said before on these calls, we are using this moment to try to drive as much brand recognition and long-term value and to the brand over time. So we pushed into Vrbo. On the Performance marketing side, which we view as more of a quick twitch muscle. We have continued to be relatively conservative. Again, we saw lots of closures happen across the globe. Those closures drive massive cancellation spikes. And they can make performance marketing very unattractive very quickly when it goes the wrong way. So we have been relatively conservative. And in that vein, we have actually removed Vrbo from Google's vacation rental meta product. Again, our focus is as much as possible, on driving direct traffic, driving incremental profitability from all our performance marketing and as we see opportunity to remove unprofitable activities, we do that. And as we leg back into a more normal market, we think we'll be able to drive more into the upper funnel, more direct traffic and be much more calculated in performance marketing. On the rest of the marketing side, and this is really about brand differentiation and geographic differentiation. I've talked about this before, but we continue to focus on driving whatever brands make sense, wherever they are in the globe. So for example, we have leaned heavily into our Wotif brand in Australia, a company we bought years ago. It's a very strong domestic brand in Australia, particularly associated with domestic travel, which has been the primary use case, and we're seeing good reaction from the market by doing that. And we are looking at that everywhere. That goes for Vrbo as well, which is not a global brand. It has strength, particularly in North America, but there are parts of Europe where we have other brands that are stronger. Australia, we have another brand called Space - that's stronger. So we are leaning into those and seeing good growth across all our alternate accommodation brands in our strong markets. Longer term, I would just point out that, in addition to driving that brand neutrality, if you will, we are also intending to drive alternative accommodations through our OTA brands. We haven't - we've been saying that for a long time. We are now highly focused on doing it. It's not ready to roll yet. We do, do it, but it is not - the consumer experience is not yet where we want it, but we are highly focused on driving that in the future. And that will be the way we attack markets where we don't have an existing Vrbo or other alternative accommodation brand. And then finally, we continue to do work on the marketing side on just brand differentiation and segmenting the market and Brand Expedia, our biggest pool of OTA brand, will be rolling out in the spring with a new campaign focused on essentially the complete trip, Brand Expedia is the most complete OTA and we are going to focus on people who are trying both multiple things, more complex trips, we think there is a big opportunity there and the brand does sufficiently ran the message over the years, so we are optimistic about the new approach to that. On the other side of the house, and perhaps the most important place we are investing our time, energy and calories which we've talked about frequently, is the tech platform. That continues to be a key focus of ours. I just want to point out this is an area of opportunity for us. It will be years of mining that opportunity, and 2021 is an important year where we expect to have significant delivery on important steps forward on simplifying our tech platform. And we are keenly focused on that, along with being focused on turning ourselves into a Tier 1 tech company and looking for and building systems to find and retain and recruit great talent and retain our great talent that we have and build Tier 1 tech enterprise that focus is keenly on solving consumer problems and our business partner problems, and we think we're well on our way to that. And finally, I'll end with something that's a little less easy to calculate by revenue or margin, but I think it's equally critical to the success of our enterprise going forward, which is that end of this year, we re-landed, reset our company mission, purpose and values with an emphasis on travel being a force for good, bringing people together, broadening horizons and strengthening connections. And we think, obviously, in this time and place that the US and the world is in, that is obviously an important role we play in the world. But we want to bring that to everything we do, everything we do in the product, and really express that through the experience. And in doing that, we also acknowledged as a company that what we do has impact on the environment, and we are refocusing ourselves on the facts that travel creates on the environment, particularly and initially around tools and information to help our travelers and help our suppliers make better choices to help drive better outcomes for the environment. So that's an important push for us. And then finally, we've made some bold, ambitious goals for ourselves around diversity and inclusion in terms of our workforce. And it really goes beyond our workforce because we really want to express that through travel as well. There are many people who have challenges and having successful travel outcomes, we have not done enough to help all people in that. And we want to drive that through everything we do, every time we roll a product out, every time we think about building a product and the consumer experience, and we intend to drive that through the business. So with that, I'll just close by saying expect things to be bumpy for a while. I don't think this is linear, what we've been going through, and I don't think we should expect it to become linear. We are optimistic that when consumer confidence comes back, when people feel confident that the vaccine rollout is going well, that they will be able to travel. We clearly see demand and I think we're just going to power through it. And when consumers are ready to travel, we're going to be there. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thanks, Peter. Thank you, also, for joining the call as well. Coming into 2020, we've talked a lot about driving margin expansion as being one of our key priorities, and we're pleased we've made significant progress in a number of areas along those fronts. The first, I want to touch on is on a fixed cost basis. We talked since start of the year at a range of $300 million to $500 million. We upped that during the year last year and then upped it to $700 million to $750 million range. We now believe that we will be at the higher end of that $700 million to $750 million range for fixed cost savings, relative to our 2019 exit rate. We have achieved approximately $675 million on a run rate basis. And we expect to realize largely all of the cost savings by the end of 2021. As mentioned previously, when projecting for, do keep in mind that we will have annual increases and expect to invest in areas of the business where we see attractive opportunities as well. On the variable cost of revenue side, we remain on track for over $200 million in annual savings based on 2019 volume levels. The three key drivers are improved economics through our payments platform, expansion of our conversations at costs and lower variable cloud costs as well. Similar to the fixed cost initiatives, we expect to realize largely all of these variable cost savings by the end of 2021. Although given the costs are volume based, the savings will not be fully evident until we reach more normalized business levels. Shifting to our Q4 results. I wanted to start by providing details on two one-time items that distorted our P&L and reduced adjusted EBITDA by approximately $65 million. First, we recognized approximately $125 million of contra revenue, related to third-party travel insurance due primarily to higher pandemic related cancellations. We restructured our commercial terms and recorded the expense in Q4 and so that we will not impact our unit economics of those products and also our P&L going forward. Excluding this impact, the Q4 revenue decline improved by 4% to 62% year-over-year. We continue to believe insurance products are a key part of our offer, and also provide terrific customer experience and protection for them going forward to continue to - we plan to continue to invest in that area. And when you look at 2020, the insurance line of business was profitable, despite the adjustment that we made and despite substantially less revenue. The second one-time change was a favorable adjustment to personnel costs. Given the impact to our business in 2020, we decided to shift cash bonuses, which we accrued at 50% throughout the year to equity this year for the vast majority of our employees. As a result, in Q4, we reversed approximately $60 million of bonus expense that accrued in the first three quarters of the year. The related cash savings will come in Q1 of 2021, when bonuses are typically paid. We recognize the majority of this bonus benefit and overhead expenses. Excluding the bonus accrual reversal, overhead expenses declined 31% year-over-year in Q4, similar to the year-over-year decline in Q3. The bonus reversal had minimal impact on cost of revenue, which declined 47%, and the disposal of Bodybuilding.com provided approximately a 5% benefit. Moving generally on to bonuses. We also made the strategic decision this quarter to shift our compensation structure away from annual cash bonuses going forward, with the vast majority of our fully funded annual bonus program being converted to salary. We anticipate approximately $50 million in extra quarterly payroll costs, starting in Q2 of 2020 relative to Q1 2020, mainly due to this change. Moving on marketing efficiency, we have been investing more in brand spend, Peter mentioned that, to drive direct traffic at the top of the funnel, while at the same time, operating at higher ROI and variable channels. We believe this approach, along with the benefits of unifying all of our retail marketing data and technology will enable us to be much more strategic in how we balance volume, profitability in both the, short and the long-term. As Peter mentioned, we leaned particularly heavily into additional brand marketing Vrbo to take advantage of the demand in alternative accommodations. And we have continued to prudently weigh back into performance marketing, where we see demand. Overall, the efficiency initiatives, we've executed during COVID will enable us to emerge from the disruption leaner, faster and with improved margins. In total, adjusted EBITDA was negative $160 million in Q4 and when normalizing for the two non-recurring items I just walked through, it was negative $95 million. On to free cash flow, it is typically negative for us in Q4, due to seasonality of our profit and working capital. And as such, was negative this quarter as well in Q4 as well, 513 negative - negative $513 million on a reported basis. Moving on to cash, we ended the year with total unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $3.4 billion, which is about $1 billion lower than we, ended Q3. During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $650 million outstanding on our revolver, which accounted for the majority of the change in cash. We head into 2021 in a strong liquidity position, with the $3.4 billion in cash and an essentially untaxed $2 billion revolver. As the business recovers over the next few years, we remain committed to deleveraging back to our historical capital structure. Turning to 2021. While, we remain optimistic about, the vaccines and look forward to travel recovering. As Peter mentioned, visibility on what the recovery will look like and near-term trends remains low at this point. Given the current trends and typical seasonality, we do expect a significant adjusted EBITDA loss in the quarter. As a reminder, Q1 is historically the lowest revenue and profit quarter of the year. In terms of 2021 forecasting, just to give you a bit of insight on costs, overhead costs are the part of the P&L, where we have the most visibility. We expect overhead costs in Q1 to be similar to Q4, before the impact of changes to the bonus accrual. We expect overhead in Q2 to step up by approximately $50 million, principally due to the shift away from bonus compensation, that I mentioned earlier and a lapping of temporary COVID-related savings from 2020. In closing, while there is considerable uncertainty remaining on what the recovery will look like, we feel good about where we are from a margin expansion. We feel good about our liquidity position. And we're confident that we're taking the right steps to accelerate in the recovery. With that, thank you. And Katrina, we're ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe two follow ups on alternative accommodations, when you're seeing the strength there, can we get a little bit better sense of whether that's coming through the branded sites and apps for what's already in the marketplace? Or is that coming through the core Expedia brand? Can we understand a little bit better, how you're thinking about conversion and including more alternative accommodation inventory within the Expedia brand? Or do you think that might be, as you optimize for outcomes as demand returns? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Eric. Happy to address that. So just to be clear, the vast, vast, vast - virtually off of the success in alternatives and Vrbo has been through the branded Vrbo sites or as I mentioned, some of the sub-brands that are specific to countries. We have a very modest business in the alternative space that happens through our OTAs. It has been a less than satisfactory product that we are working on aggressively, but it is a small, small part of the business. We do believe, though, that in time, that can be an important part of the business, particularly when you think about markets where Expedia or Hotels.com or any of our OTAs might have strong brands, but Vrbo is basically non-presence as a brand. So we think that's a scenario where being able to pipe that through is really valuable. We think even in markets where they overlap, there can be use cases where customers are coming into Expedia or another brand and could absolutely want an alternative accommodation and want to see that option revealed as against hotel and other kinds of options. And then I would just add that, while you didn't ask it, I think there's - we believe there's a big opportunity for alternative accommodations through our B2B partners, which it is not currently really piped to do. So those are all opportunities to continue to expand on the alternative space. And I think to take advantage of what we have in terms of supply, but what we don't necessarily have on the brand side to drive it in certain markets. Hope that\u2026 Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes. We are ready for the next question, yes. Please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yes. Thanks a lot. Maybe just a quick clarification. On the lodging trends that you called out here in terms of January into like 50s and maybe 40s recently. Is it fair to assume that most of the improvement versus Q4 is driven by the US and not much of a change in the geos? And then with respect to Vrbo, could you guys just to break it out separately and then more recently, you've been consolidating. Is this - does it make sense for you to, again, start to share more details with investors so that maybe we can give more credit to performance in that in the business? Peter Kern : Okay. I'll take those questions in order, I guess. First of all, the - I would say the lion's share of the improvement, yes, is due to strength in North America compared to other places. I mean, it is a tale of many stories in different markets, has come back at different rates, but I would say in terms of any big drivers, North America has generally retained more willingness to move around people engaging in more travel, less we haven't had government shutdowns in the way we have in other places. So yes, I would say North America is probably the bulk of the story over that month or so. The - to your second question, no we don't intend to break it out not because we don't want to make all of your lives easier, but because we because we believe it's one business. Essentially, as I mentioned about piping Vrbo content through the OTAs, and we view this as just another product that a traveler will want. It's not - obviously, it's having a great moment, and we're glad that we own it, and we believe we can ride some of the success travelers being exposed to the product type in a new way. But we view it collectively, and we view it as one business that we're driving whatever the best outcome for the consumers and driving that outcome across all lines of business. So, we think this separation has been artificial effectively, and we're not planning to report it that way in the future. Naved Khan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question, we have Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I have 2 guys. The first one, curious to hear about how have your conversations and your relationships with your hotel suppliers sort of evolve throughout the crisis and then the recovery? And sort of what are some of their tension points that you're really hoping to solve better through the recovery than maybe you have in the past? And the second one, I know you've done a lot of great steps to sort of improve data sharing and sort of optimize processes. Any new examples of areas you found where you weren't sharing data enough for sort of other ways in which you've been able to optimize the business more coming out than you were previously? Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks for the question. I might sort of smash those two together a little bit, which is relations have been quite good with the hoteliers. I think we're all aligned and hoping and working towards helping them come out of it. We've renewed a number of agreements without much debate. And I think our focus has been really on doing more to help the hotelier, as you alluded to, through data, but some of the examples include things like optimized distribution, which we've talked about before where we essentially become the wholesale distribution point for a number of hotels. We've done this with a few chains now. And that gives us an opportunity to help them clean up the marketplace, where they might have a wholesale market that is perhaps being abused by some players and driving the wrong outcomes for them. And with our technology and with our approach, we can help clean that up for them, and we think that's a net positive for both of us. Similarly, we have been sharing more data. We're working hard on new tools to provide more data to drive real-time decision-making for hoteliers, so that they can optimize revenue in better ways. And of course, we're doing our part to try to drive and improve the product so that we can sell higher value rooms, room types, upsell product, et cetera, so that we can help drive ADRs and overall revenue. So there's a lot of work going on. I think we're tightly aligned in wanting the hotel to come out and be successful. I think the hotels understand and appreciate the role we play in a rebound, and it's been a quite good environment and good relationships all around, and we're all working hard to try to rebuild the market. Brian Nowak : Okay. Thanks Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Great. Thanks. Two, if I can. First, it sounds like you're making some big moves like pulling Vrbo out of Google Metasearch. As you think about performance marketing coming out of the pandemic, any other big shifts you'd call out strategically? And kind of how do you see direct marketing spend as a percent of revenue, maybe when we get back to a normalized environment? And then just second one; if we go back to when you took over, I mean, Barry had some pretty harsh comments about over, I mean, Barry had some pretty harsh comments about the work-life balance at Expedia. Curious, what have you all been doing to kind of change the culture at the company? How is morale holding up given a tough travel environment and all the changes going on? Anything you can share there would be great. Thanks. Peter Kern : Yeah. Well, maybe I'll take those in reverse order. Thanks for the questions, Lloyd. I think morale is quite good. I think people are energized. I think in the early days, there was fear of survival and all those kinds of things. We're long past that. I think we are trying to drive a performance culture, a culture that gets a lot done, and we've shrunk the company considerably in terms of manpower. So people are working hard. People are tackling big issues. This replatforming of our entire tech stack, it's a big undertaking and there's a ton of work going on there. There's a ton of work going on with suppliers, as we just talked about, ton of work going on for the customer. So I think morale is quite good. We're trying to build a culture where people who want to win and want to thrive, feel inspired to do their best work. And I think that's what we're doing. Does that appeal to everybody, maybe not, but that is what we're driving? And I think there's a lot of energy behind that. So I would say morale is good. People are engaged. People feel good about our new mission and our purpose, and I think we're all aligned behind that. As far as the performance goes and Eric, jump in, if you want to as well. But I would say, we're very sharp-minded about it in the sense that we're happy to invest in anything that drives incremental profitability, good revenue and good profits. And we're not keen to continue on a path of just continuing where investment was not productive. So we didn't find investment in the Google VR product, particularly incremental. We didn't think the customer experience was particularly valuable. And we are, of course, also in a period where we're seeing great direct traffic for Vrbo. So we found other ways and, in our view, more profitable ways to drive traffic. As far as the rest of performance marketing goes and performance marketing for hotels and Meta, et cetera, the different products for the consumer. It's a different proposition and clearly has historically had value for the consumer. I think we feel like we will continue to play at it. I think we will continue to improve at it. I've talked before about how we've smashed together our performance marketing teams, where we wiring all the data streams. We're pushing towards multi-brand algorithms and things we haven't done before. So we think we're going to get much better at it in terms of being able to optimize for the portfolio. And continue to use it, hopefully very effectively. But right now, there are no - I wouldn't say there are big tectonic shifts in what we're seeing as to how we would apply that money other than we're going to be very clinical about it, in terms of looking for and driving the best veins of profitability we can, wherever they are. Eric Hart : Yeah. This is Eric. Thanks for the question. And just on the marketing as a percent of revenue, just to touch on that. We're not at this point, solving for a specific percentage. Ultimately, we're in this COVID period. And so we're - as we talked about, waiting back prudently into performance channels and then investment in brand where we think it's appropriate, particularly on Vrbo. But, as Peter mentioned, there's just a ton of work that's going on, for example, in performance channels, leveraging our overall data, multi-brand bidding, as Peter just mentioned, but ultimately multi-brand bidding, as Peter just mentioned, but ultimately trying to understand as well, lifetime value and incrementality as well. And so, those are new muscles, in particular, given the scale, the way we're running the business now and the scale of the data that we're aggregating together. So I think there's more to learn there. And then on the brand side, that just has a very different profile than performance and that it has longer return periods. And so, we're confident to invest behind the brands, obviously, doing that behind Vrbo. We expect to do that even more, in some of our other brands as we narrow in on specific value propositions. And line of product behind those. And then, the marketing associated as well. So a long-winded way of saying, we don't have a specific percentage that we're solving for now. But we're certainly spending a lot of time trying to improve on the marketing side and the value proposition and related marketing. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Thank you, guys. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. I just had a couple of follow-ups. So I was hoping to drilling to, some of the improvement that you've seen, in the January trends, as the declines have gone from the high 60s to the high 40s, at the end of January. So, what do you see as the key drivers there? And did you get a sense if, the decline in COVID-19 cases and the vaccine rollout that, we're having impact on the consumer demand there? And then, what kind of - within that, what kind of growth rates did Vrbo experience in January? Thanks. Eric Hart : Yeah. Peter, do you want me to take this one? Go ahead. Peter Kern : Jump in anywhere, Eric. But I would just say, Kevin that broadly, as I mentioned, the improvements were in North America and Vrbo was a strong part of it. It's hard to say, whether it's correlated to the improvement in cases that tends to be - sometimes you think everyone should be feeling better and it doesn't show up and sometimes you feel the opposite. But I would say that, Vrbo tends to be long dated. The summer, obviously, is a strong opportunity for the Vrbo use case. And we're seeing people lean into that as the year opens up. And so, by and large, the blending towards that, we have seen some improvement in conventional lodging, again, particularly in North America. But I would say it's a little bit of a Vrbo continued health and even amplified health going into the summer months, et cetera. And a little bit of improvement in the more conventional spaces. And I don't think we'll break out exactly, how good it was, but Vrbo has been strong. Eric, I don't know if you want to add anything. Eric Hart : Yeah. The only add that, I add to that is just around - and you touched on it, which is the booking windows and what we've seen is a bit of a bifurcation, which we've talked about before. But historically, during COVID, we saw a shortening of booking windows. We've continued to see that on the conventional lodging or on the hotel side of the business. But what we've seen is, Vrbo elongate again. And look much more like we would have expected to see any other year, which gets back to the summer bookings that Peter is mentioning. And so I suspect we know there's pent-up demand. People want to travel. And I think people have confidence that they're going to be able to travel at least domestically using the U.S. as an example. And so they're starting to book those summer months now. Kevin Kopelman : Great, it's very helpful. And then on, kind of a follow-up on the last question and along those lines, how has - how should we think about as being - how should we think about ad spend kind of playing out? You've seen the bookings picking up as a base case, should we just kind of assume that - ad spend is trending in kind of, similarly on a year-over-year basis? Or do you see having to spend ahead of demand in the kind of rebound scenario? How has that played out at the start of the year? Peter Kern : Yes. I think, we definitely don't want to be behind. So if anything, we will - we'll certainly invest in getting - capturing the demand. I think, as Eric mentioned, there's its funny thing that happened where stay dates and book dates were much closer together for a large part of 2020. If 2021 starts to look more normal, which it seems to be doing, then we'll start to see that expand again. And I think in that vein, you may see us investing in capturing that demand even if that demand is not staying for some time. And so you may see some dislocation, I would expect or bumpiness in the numbers in terms of when the marketing spend is versus when the revenue recognition is but we certainly don't plan to be back on our heels. We - as I mentioned, we have a strong campaign that we're working on for Brand Expedia. We've got - we've certainly consistently stating, and we'll stay in the Vrbo upper funnel work on brand, Hotels.com, the same. So I think, you'll see that continue, and we will continue to lean in as we believe the market and demand is opening up, no question. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks so much. Eric Hart : And yes, Kevin, just one quick add on that. Hopefully, it's helpful as well. And Peter mentioned it briefly, but just around the revenue recognition, just a reminder for everyone, when it comes to lodging, that we recognize that revenue at the time of stage, generally speaking. And as we mix into Vrbo with their longer booking windows, particularly in the summer, then you're going to see more of that revenue on the transactions that we're - a lot of those that we're seeing now, get pushed out into the later months. So then when you go back to look at marketing, it's a bit bumpier to use Peter's word, just because we're spending now elevated in Vrbo in lots of different ways where the revenue may be more down the line. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. I guess, just wondering if you're seeing anything in your traffic for your core businesses that give you any optimism on the summer, very front end planning or through some of your other sites that you have. Are you seeing any uptick there as people start looking forward to the summer? And second, do you have any thoughts on how you're doing market share-wise in the industry right now, especially in alternative accommodations. But just overall, how do you feel about how your market share is trending right now? Peter Kern : Yes. I'll take that one first, and let me come back to the other question. But I would say, to be specific in this question, in alternative combinations in our strong markets, we believe we have seen very good share and share growth relative to our competition. But I would say, overall, each of we and our main competitors have different warts and different good guys. We have a very good guy with Vrbo and the use case and where we have supply and where people are wanting to travel. But conversely, we also conventionalizing have a heavy - a strong presence in major cities and international travel, both of which obviously have been hurt equally. I could point to any one of our competitors who has the inversion of that and has is better in secondary cities, et cetera, maybe better in alternative accommodations in markets where we don't even have a presence. Some of those markets are shut. Some of those markets are strong. It's a tale of many stories. So I think as it comes to share, we think we're doing well, where we're strong, certainly in alternative accommodations and overall in North America. But there are certainly competitors who have better solutions for certain use cases, and they're seeing benefit from that. So I think it's really - I would caution anybody to get too excited about share, one way or the other during this because the dislocation really creates a bunch of unique stories. And you can - I would think one could get fooled by a trend that's not a trend. It's just a moment of how people are using travel right now. So - but we have gained and we're happy about that, and in our strongest markets and, particular, in VR. I think your other question was on traffic. The answer is we see a lot of booking. It's not entirely clear that it's all for summer or - which - not - I don't think there's anything that tells you there's something specific people are searching for specific time zone, but we are seeing interest in the holidays already at the end of next - the end of this year. It's still relatively small, but stronger than it had been a year ago. We're seeing trends like that. Some are very strong in alternatives, still highly muted in conventional lodging. And I would just say, there are a lot of things we're seeing that contra being what people think is going on. We see a lot of interest in cities, in terms of quick share and people looking not necessarily booking, but there's plenty of people looking at travel to cities and other things. So, I think it's - I think the looking is not yet indicative of a pattern of booking, but there's tons of interest for sure. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks. One housekeeping maybe and then one other one, just to confirm the - that 500 bps of contra revenue related to the COVID claims and the third-party insurance, that was not added back to EBITDA, I think I heard that. And then Trivago talked yesterday about the trend towards apartment hotels and chains getting into that as transient and group business may struggle to come back or slower. Any thoughts on how hotel inventory might lean into that leisure or long-term stay for pneumatic workers or your thoughts on how you guys would benefit from that trend? Thanks Eric Hart : Thanks for the question. I can take the first part. It was contra revenue, as mentioned, and it was not added back to EBITDA. I think I just gave in the upfront portion, just what the EBITDA would have been if we would have taken that ounce or yes. Peter Kern : And I'll just - yes, Brian, I'll just say, haven't given a tremendous amount of thought. I think we've seen hotels historically try to play at in the alternative space in different ways. Hasn't been a particularly large part of anybody's business. No one's made it into a big success, really. I think many of these trends; I think most of the hotel industry thinks will be relatively short-lived. Then they'll be back at it in a conventional way. But I'm sure we'll see experimentation there. I don't think it particularly favors or disfavors us. We play in virtually every product class. And if we can help hotelier sell those kinds of longer stay, apartment-type stay products through Vrbo, we're certainly delighted to do that. But I don't think for us, it's a trend one way or the other that will - that is particularly good or particularly bad. I think it's just maybe a slight shift for some it's just maybe a slight shift for some hoteliers, but not a big difference for us. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Peter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you so much. So Peter, maybe go back in history a little bit. I think part of the pain point for Vrbo in the past when it was a public company was to make sure you don't get de-ranked in the search results because of duplicative content. I think as you try to integrate, say, Abritel's inventory onto Homeaway.com or Vrbo.com. So, as you work to integrate the Vrbo content itself onto your OTA properties, is a potential traffic loss or degradation something that we need to worry about in the future? And I guess, what do you think you need to do to address from a consumer experience standpoint for that seamless integration of inventory, so that to the consumer, they are more willing to pick either or maybe more the alternative accommodations on Brand Expedia? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yeah. Thanks, it's a good question. And to the first part, I think, yes, there's lots of stories in the panels of those of us who play in the world of Google, et cetera, of being de-ranked things and a lot of learning has gone into that. Obviously, we'll have to watch that as we roll it out. But I think you shouldn't think of this necessarily as a peanut butter approach, not all lodging is sort of parallel. So if someone's looking for a hotel for two people in Paris, offering them an apartment for 10 people, not necessarily a solution or a house in the south of south of France. So, I think there will be different solutions. I think we're working through what the consumer experience should be. Some of our competitors have done well putting those things next to each other. But again, it's particularly when they can sort of match up relatively the use case, so the small apartment versus the small hotel room. Right now, Vrbo is largely oriented towards the whole home experience, mostly in secondary places, vacation places, et cetera. So it's really a question of as you get those opportunities, and you want to go to the beach somewhere, how do those things line up, how does the product reveal it in an attractive way and not confuse the consumer, et cetera. So it's really an end-to-end so we have to do, which is what - how does the consumer want to digest it? How can we service the right things for them? And then how do we give them the benefit of the information and the service and all the things one might be used to in a home rental that are different when you rent a hotel room essentially. So, there's a lot of work going into that. I don't have an absolute answer for you, except we know that there is demand. We know that there's a question of getting discovery in places where we don't have brands. We know there is demand from our B2B partners. So we know there's opportunity, but we still have work to do to make sure the consumer experience makes sense. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, you mentioned that Vrbo isn't global, and you have other VR brands in Europe, for example, just trying to understand what you're doing to build out Vrbo there? Or are you content letting some of the other brands do more vacation in those geos? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yeah. I think where we have strong brands we are perfectly content to drive those brands. I think we have opportunity to drive them with the same techniques, that we have created and made effective in Vrbo, whether that's from our creative, our approach to performance marketing, et cetera, et cetera. So, there's no reason we can't take a brand like Space in Australia. And drive that through. And there is no little benefit to absolutely turning it into Vrbo. That being said, there are some markets, where we have converted to Vrbo. And we are going to invest behind that brand. And we'll do that in some places as well. So I think you'll see a combination of places where, Vrbo is the right answer. You'll see a few places where we're intent to use some strong local, long-dated brands that have real brand awareness and stickiness. And then as I say, we'll use our other OTA brands and other things to drive it in places where or neither exists. And where we don't think it's worth trying to start a brown from scratch. Douglas Anmuth : Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Your line is open. Richard Clarke : Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. Just at the top of the call, you mentioned using alternatives in B2B more. Just wondering what that will look like? Is that going to be a sort of white label product? Or how would you see that coming through? And I can just ask another one. With the charge you've taken this quarter. And the pandemic in general, is there any sort of change in the way you think about the flexibility of that to consumers that's changing kind of looking into next year and any uncertainty continues? Thanks. Peter Kern : Eric, do you want to take the second one first? I'm sorry. I'm happy to take it. Well, we're constantly trying - I think we've got a number of initiatives to build out more insurance and assurance products. It's one of the areas that we think is consumers want it. They're telling us they want it. We have some offerings there. We think we can expand those offerings. We've got a great team that's going off and executing against it. So I would say generally, we think it's a great product for everyone all around. And we're going to invest around it and innovate around the offerings. From a flexibility standpoint, that's certainly something that's top of mind for us. I don't think it necessarily dips into insurance itself. But of course, we've looked at the terms associated with those, and those have been modified relative to the situation that we're in, i.e. whether you have COVID or been exposed and so on and so forth. And so there's, adjustments that have been made to those policies to make them relevant. But generally speaking, we're trying to make sure that we give offerings. We communicate flexibility. Most of our products have flexibility built to them in one form or another. And we're making sure that we're promoting those on the site, so that customers can make appropriate decisions. I hope that's helpful. Eric Hart : Yeah. Thanks. And I'll just say, Richard, on as the B2B through our - excuse me, alternatives to our B2B partners I remind, everyone that we have a quite healthy B2B business. It takes many forms, including powering rewards programs, powering regional OTAs in places where we are not, in some places where we are and even offline travel agents. And we think there's a lot of use cases and all of that for alternative accommodations. We have not been wired to do it, goes to our tech platform that I talked about frequently. And - but we believe when we can do it, there will be significant demand opportunities in those vectors. So it could take the form of a white label product in certain kinds of circumstances. It could equally take the form of being part of a broader template where we power everything in our rewards program, and that's flights and conventional and alternative right now because the alternative product has not been strong even in our own OTAs. We just don't have a product offering that's particularly compelling for our B2B partners. So that's coming as we build the flexibility into our platform and as we master the alternative accommodations on our own OTAs. We just see it as the opportunity space. Peter Kern : Yes. And just to add to that, I mean, there's certainly demand from our B2B partners for that inventory. And as Peter said, that can get distributed based on different types of B2B partners, but that's a rewards program, et cetera, that could be template. That could be API. And we just got to make sure that we have, on the template, the right experience and on the API, the right data that folks made to be able to incorporate it into whatever site or however we're powering it. Richard Clarke : Wonderful. Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Your line is open. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So just curious to hear your high-level thoughts on capital allocation with $3.4 billion of cash on hand. Do you see this environment as one where you might find some value via M&A, where it might make some strategic sense despite still waiting for a recovery? And the second one, you guys are removing Vrbo listings from Google. Any color you could provide on what percentage of bookings came from that historically? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes, I can take the first part, Peter, which is I think, our focus continues to be for the moment on stabilization and recovery. I think, we've gotten through the stabilization, and we're in that recovery phase, if you will, and call it the early innings of that. So I do think that we feel like we're in a great position, as mentioned, with the $3.4 billion, plus the $2 billion on the revolver. But I - from a capital allocation standpoint, I want to make sure that we can invest behind our brands and feel comfortable we'll be able to take whatever level of risk we decide to do so that we can be relevant in that recovery and be in that conversation with consumers. When it comes to the debt side of the house, which you didn't ask, obviously, we paid the $650 million off of the revolver to get that back up to the $2 billion. But at this point, I would say we're in that recovery phase, and not obviously looking to return capital. But down the line, I suspect we will want to take down our debt, get back to investment grade, all the good things we've talked about in previous quarters. And then we could talk about how do we think about returning capital. Now more specifically on your question on M&A, I would say, we're more in an opportunistic posture at this moment. We've got a strong legacy in M&A as a company, as you will know. We are certainly out and having conversations and seeing what might be opportunistic, if you will. But right now, I would say we're primarily focused on ourselves and making sure that we get our data platform right. We got our marketing right, we can invest behind the business. Eric Hart : Yes. And I would just cap that answer with our historical M&A, which was successful also is what made us as complicated as we were as a company. And we are keen to make sure we don't make those mistakes again. It doesn't mean we will never buy something, doesn't mean that we won't find opportunities, but we are not - that is not going to be the core of what drives us. And then on the Vrbo question, Google VR was not particularly significant. And we concluded that it was not additive, which is why we made the move we made. And so it's not - it wasn't like we set a substantial part of our business and just took a shot across the value. We just believed that it was not a particularly critical piece of our business, and we're not adding value, and we made a decision. Mario Lu : Great. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you, both. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our final question coming from the line of Andrew Boone from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Andrew Boone : Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me in. One of your alternative accommodation competitors talks about kind of the exclusivity of their listings. Can you talk about any of your efforts there to expand your alternative accommodation listings? And I think you guys historically have talked about lack of inventory in more price-sensitive areas. Can you just give an update there? And then secondly, as we - we're seeing the first signs of recovery, can you just provide an update on your marketing tech stack and whether you guys feel like you're ready to lean in there? Thank you. Peter Kern : Sure. So I would say on the listing side, we and our competitors have a fair amount of exclusivity. Sometimes that's because of geography, sometimes that's because of tight. It's a bunch of different things that drive it. We're not spending a huge amount of time trying to figure out how to just make our inventory entirely exclusive. We're trying to spend our time building the category. I think that's probably broadly true for them as well. As far as increasing inventory, hasn't been a particularly great market for doing that between home turnover between people living in their second homes and other things. It's been a challenging time. We have seen some compression in certain markets that we serve, and we are focused on expanding inventory in those places. But because of the challenges broadly in the market, we haven't just been really knowing trying to grow supply all over the place. So we are focused on the places where we know there's lots of demand, where we know there's compression as a first order of business. And over time, as the market normalizes and we see an opportunity to attract good quality content, we'll be back in the market doing that. As far as far as the tech stack goes on marketing, we're making lots of progress every day. Are we where we want to be yet? No. Are we going as fast as we think we can? Yes. And we're making improvements every day. So I think, again, converting all of our brands to one common tech stack, one common set of data, one common set of analytics, is a big list. We've been doing it throughout this crisis, and we're still doing it. And - but we are beginning to reap real benefits. And I think at the time, I think you said now that we're coming out of it, I'm not sure how to measure that. But if we are indeed coming out of it, it's probably not going to take 10 months or three weeks. It's going to take a while over the course of this year. I'm sure we'll be coming out of it, and hopefully, we'll be back to some more normal level. And I hope we will be in a good place in terms of the tech stack. We are a long way ahead of where we were and we will continue to make progress every day. So it depends when that recovery comes, but we're making really good progress. Andrew Boone : Thank you so much. Peter Kern : Yeah. And I think that's it. So again, thank you all for your time. I hope you all stay safe. Hopefully, we can all get back to traveling soon. You probably miss it as much as we do, and look forward to talking to you again, so take care. Eric Hart : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you, presenters. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Expedia Group First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Thompson, Senior Vice President and CFO. Thank you. Please go ahead. Patrick Thompson : Good afternoon. And welcome to Expedia Group\u2019s financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. I\u2019m pleased to be joined on the call today by our CEO, Peter Kern, and our CFO, Eric Hart. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management\u2019s views as of today, May 6, 2021 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today\u2019s call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we plan, we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that, or similar statements. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC, for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the Company\u2019s Investor Relations website at, ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. And with that, let me turn over the call to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you, Pat. Good afternoon, everybody. And thank you for joining our call. We have some brief remarks [Technical Difficulty] take questions. I\u2019ll start by talking about the Egencia deal, which we announced a few days ago. That proposed deal is extremely exciting to us. And in a few minutes, Eric will share the details. But, I\u2019ll just say, it really highlights three core things we\u2019re trying to do. One is, find the best opportunity for all our businesses. And in this case, we felt that putting Egencia together with Amex GBT created a great new combined corporate enterprise that could focus entirely on the corporate customer, and really provide a best-in-class suite of services to serve those customers. And our ownership in that company, we\u2019re very excited to have. Secondly, we signed a long-term lodging supply and tech agreement with the company. And you\u2019ll recall, we have a big B2B business. Expedia Partner Services, it is core to our strategy long-term, and driving and powering the industry broadly is an important move for us. So, this deal enhanced [Technical Difficulty] significantly, and just gives us more throughput to continue to innovate, both on the supply and technology side to provide great services to the entire travel ecosystem. And finally, as we\u2019ve talked about endlessly this past year, we are trying to simplify our companies, so we can focus on the most important and largest opportunities. And with Egencia in a great new home, should this deal proceed, we will be in a great position to focus on our B2C and B2B businesses, and our core technology platform. And that\u2019s really a great chance for us to get simpler, and get agility and speed in the rest of our core business. Moving on to recent trends, I would say, as I said, travel remains a study in contrasts. As for different geographies, some are still shut down, some, like the U.S., are quite open now. And equally, a study in differences between vacation rentals, domestic travel versus international travel, business travel is more challenged, conventional lodging, particularly in big cities is more challenged. So, it\u2019s really a study in contrasts. It depends where you\u2019re strongest, we have benefited greatly in our vacation rental business and our domestic U.S. business, but other parts of the business still remain challenged. I would say, and many have reported already, but, the summer looks strong, particularly in the U.S. and in other markets where vaccinations are well along the way, we are already seeing booking trends, well above 2019 levels for leisure destinations, beach, mountains, et cetera. And that goes for not only vacation rentals, but also for conventional lodging. To give a little more color on bookings themselves. We said on our last call that we were down somewhere in the high-40% in the gross bookings net of cancellations in the January period. That has moderated to down around 20% in March and has improved on that in April. So, the trends remain strong, again driven largely by those strongest markets. But still, the trends are very good, and we\u2019re excited about that. I would just keep in mind, while summer looks great and we are ambitious and feeling good about the overall recovery, that calendar is still a question mark. We don\u2019t know what seasonality will look like, as long as COVID is here. And the usual trends that might come in the fall and winter are still unknown. So, while we\u2019re extremely excited about summer, it\u2019s a little too early to predict how those trends with work-from-home, whether school is in session, et cetera will change travel behavior, going into the following quarters. On the Vrbo front end vacation rentals in general, we continue to lean into that business. We have grown share in all our strongest markets and invested heavily in marketing and in acquiring hosts, and we feel like that continues to be a great opportunity for us not just in this moment, but in the future as we capitalize on landing the brand and getting more people to experience Vrbo and staying in vacation rentals. We are seeing some compression in summer. People ask about that frequently. And I\u2019ll just say so far, we have seen replacement as a pretty good solution. Most people look for something they can\u2019t find it, they\u2019ll find something nearby. And increasingly, as more people are vaccinated, they are willing and happy to stay in resorts and in conventional lodging. And I would say some portion of them would actually prefer it that way. And we\u2019re seeing in those leisure destinations for the summer, very strong conventional lodging numbers. On the marketing side, I\u2019ve mentioned in past quarters that we have taken a relatively conservative bias on how we\u2019ve approached marketing, rather leave a little money on the table than get too far out over our skis. But in the course of the first quarter, we have sort of changed that bias and moved more particularly in the back half of the quarter towards investing and getting in front of the wave of demand we think is coming. That\u2019s taking the form of a number of brand marketing rollouts, including a brand new Expedia brand marketing campaign that started at the Academy Awards. We\u2019ve relaunched our Orbitz brand with a focus on LGBTQIA plus. And that\u2019s sort of again, of course, as we try to differentiate brands and really focus each brand on who their market is. And later this month, we have a great new summer ad campaign coming for Vrbo that we think will be really impactful. So, that investment in brand building is really important to us. We\u2019ve talked before about going up funnel, creating that brand love, pushing for direct interactions, direct consumption. But keep in mind, it\u2019s not a quick twitch tool, like performance marketing. So, we have to invest over time to build that. So, we think it does have returns ultimately for performance marketing, as the brands become more well-loved and more highly thought of. We are starting to see wins. I\u2019ve talked at some length in the past about combining our performance marketing teams. They\u2019ve been doing yeoman\u2019s work and a terrific job. We\u2019ve actually put in a new leader who came from the outside, and is a great new addition to the team. But I just wanted to -- I\u2019ve said that before, I wanted to give one stat to give you a sense of the acceleration we\u2019re finally starting to get, which is that 75% of our SEM spend is now on a new consolidated technical and data platform. And just for point of reference, at the end of last year, that was at 15%. So, it is starting to accelerate. We\u2019re starting to get the wins, we hope to get as we combine these [Technical Difficulty]. And as we invest more and get more aggressive, and we\u2019re getting these wins, we\u2019re seeing our quick share go back to historic levels or higher in our main products on our key markets. We continue to refine our marketing spend in general, and we will continue to test and learn and there will be balancing as we learn. But, I will say, we mentioned last time on our last call that we went off the Google meta products for vacation rentals. And actually, over this last quarter, we have we have pulled back from other vacation rental meta players. And so far, the results have been excellent, and as good or better than we could have hoped for in terms of the returns we have seen in getting more direct traffic and traffic other ways, more efficiently. So, that has been a great move. And we will continue to focus on that. But again, we will be upfront more, we will be focused and leaning into the wave ahead. But, it could be bumpy and we may be a little early, but we believe now is the time to lean in and we will be leaning in, accordingly. On the platform and technical side, I made a promise that I\u2019m not going to get into the business of telling 100 great stories about our technical platform. We are making great strides every day in it. It is definitely where we are putting the most energy, time and money. But, I just wanted to point out one area of wins, because it really goes to how this is going affect, not just us as a business, but the customers. And that\u2019s in our AI and data products. We recently launched a reinforcement learning algorithm, which allows us to power different shopping journeys on a given page for different customers. And we are using it now not universally, because again, all of the tech is coming along. And it will be launched as it can be in more places. But we\u2019re using it to adapt and improve the customer experience to the specific customer journey, [Technical Difficulty] opportunity for conversion and improving the business. But most of all, it\u2019s a great opportunity to improve the experience for the customer and make it easier for them to find what they want. And then, a related point. We\u2019re also using AI and telemetry data to track customer experience to track friction points, and again, focus on taking that friction out of the customer experience and making it great. So, these are, first tier technologies that the best e-commerce companies in the world use. And we are now using it to make our consumer experiences better. And it\u2019s really exciting, great for business, but in many ways even more exciting that we can drive customer love and a better customer experience. And so, finally, I\u2019d just say, we are clearly benefiting from our relative strength in some of the best markets, BR, the U.S., et cetera. But it\u2019s a bumpy ride, and we\u2019re hoping for reopenings. I would say, the announcement about New York City. You\u2019ll remember, we\u2019re very strong in big cities and in international travel, neither of which have been doing well, but the announcement about New York open up hopefully, some international travel between EMEA and the U.S. this summer, will start to open even more as we go forward. And I\u2019d just like to say, it\u2019s nice to report that we\u2019re making progress, but we are mindful of our friends and colleagues and everybody really in India. We have a big operation in India. We\u2019ve got many sick colleagues and family members, and our thoughts are with them every day. And whatever the world can do to help, we are doing everything we can to help, but we all should do more. And I would finally say, that\u2019s a reminder that this is an unpredictable time. We still don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in many markets. Anything could happen. Things could get worse before they get better. But, we are optimistic. We are seeing a lot of improvement across the globe. And we are feeling good about the work we\u2019re doing at the Company. So, with that, I\u2019ll just say, hopefully, vaccines continue to roll out. Hopefully, you all have your vaccines and tell everybody you know to get a vaccine. And we have little doubt that as that continues, the world will open up and travel will come roaring back. So with that, I will pass it off to Eric. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thanks, Peter. I\u2019d like to start by providing more details on the binding offer we received from Amex GBT to acquire Egencia. I echo Peter\u2019s earlier comments. We are very excited about the deal, and I\u2019m optimistic about the success we would see from the combined company. Now, [Technical Difficulty] which includes two major pieces. First, we have approximately 14% ownership in the combined business, presuming close, which we currently estimate is valued at approximately $750 million. Second, we would also enter into a 10-year lodging supply agreement between Amex GBT and EPS, as Peter mentioned earlier. And then, to put this commercial deal into perspective, the supply agreement would have generated in excess of $60 million in EBITDA at 2019 volumes. We anticipate the proposed deal would close in 9 to 12 months. Next, I wanted to provide an update on our cost saving initiatives. In 2020, we made considerable progress on rightsizing our cost base, and these efforts continued in Q1. We still expect to be towards the higher end of our $700 million to $750 million range for fixed cost savings relative to our 2019 exit rate, and we have now achieved approximately $700 million on a run rate basis. We remain confident we will realize largely all of those targets of cost savings by the end of 2021. As we have spoken about previously, when looking forward, we will have annual increases in the remaining cost basis from items like annual comp increases, and we expect to invest in areas of the business where we see attractive opportunities. On variable cost of revenue, we remain on track for over $200 million in annual savings, based on 2019 volume levels. As a reminder, the three key drivers are improved economics through our payments platform, expansion of our conversations platform to reduce customer service costs and lower variable cloud costs. Similar to these initiatives, we still expect to realize largely all of these variable cost savings by the end of 2021. Although given the costs are volume-based, the savings will not be fully evident until we reach more normalized business levels. We\u2019ve also spoken in the past about driving marketing efficiencies. And we\u2019ve continued to make improvements in Q1. But, I want to be very clear, we are spending into the recovery, as Peter mentioned. As it relates to Q1, we increased our investments, particularly in the back half of the quarter and that continued [Technical Difficulty] and we also expect a further increase in Q2 as we look to further capitalize on the pace of travel recovery, particularly within the U.S. As a reminder, we incur the marketing expense in the quarter if it occurs, but we don\u2019t realize any associated lodging revenue until the stay actually happens. In terms of the balance sheet, we are investment-grade rated today, and as the recovery continues to unfold, we remain committed to delevering back to more historical leverage levels, while also continuing to reduce our cost of capital. Our ultimate goal of being in a strong position -- to be in a strong position, restart our capital return program to shareholders, as we talked about the early part of last year. To that end, we recently took advantage of compelling market conditions and raised $1 billion in 10-year unsecured notes, which have a coupon of 2.95% and $1 billion in zero coupon 5-year convertible debt with a 72.5% conversion premium. Together, we used the proceeds of the new debt issuances to redeem $1.7 billion and debt due in 2025 at coupons of 7% and 6.25%. This will yield approximately $80 million in annual interest rate savings. From a liquidity standpoint, we have $4.3 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, which is about $1 billion higher than we ended Q4, with the increase primarily due to positive free cash flow. We also have essentially $2 billion in untapped revolver capacity. As it relates to deferred merchant bookings, it has improved in each quarter since the height of the pandemic and with a total of $6 billion at the end of Q1. We have witnessed positive recent trends and are cautiously optimistic about the pace and shape of the recovery. We are also confident in our liquidity position. And therefore, we have elected to pay down 50% of the preferred stock issued in 2020 later this month. And as a reminder, regarding the preferred stock, we also have the ability to pay off that balance at any time when we book [Technical Difficulty] to do so, and is something that we\u2019ll be watching over the coming months. Now shifting to the P&L. Total revenue was down 52% versus first quarter of 2019, which was a notable improvement from last quarter, with revenue down approximately 62% year-on-year. And that\u2019s normalized for the insurance contra revenue impact that occurred in Q4 of 2020 that we spoke about last quarter. Overhead expenses totaled approximately $500 million in Q1 and came in slightly better than anticipated due to some timing benefits. As a reminder, we define overhead as G&A, tech and content, indirect sales and marketing, while excluding stock-based compensation. Moving on, we made a change during Q1 in managing our software licensing and maintenance costs, which led to a modest reclassification to prior results, we have moved from a decentralized approach, which we\u2019ve talked about previously, where each individual team manages their own spend, which resulted in increased costs and duplicative tools to a much more centralized approach across EG. In 2020, the change resulted in approximately $60 million in costs being reallocated to tech and content, with the majority coming from cost of sales and the remainder from sales and marketing and G&A. There was no change to total costs or EBITDA from this reclassification. In total, adjusted EBITDA was negative $58 million for the quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. On an absolute basis, adjusted EBITDA was down approximately $235 million versus Q1 2019, while revenue was down approximately $1.4 billion over the same time period. On the free cash flow, which totaled $2 billion in Q1 on a reported basis. If you exclude the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by Vrbo\u2019s deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately $800 million. Looking forward, and we mentioned it last quarter, we do expect our overhead cost to step up by approximately $50 million sequentially and from Q1 to Q2 of this year, relative to the bonus payments and other issues we talked about last quarter. In closing, continue to be very encouraged by the recent trends within the business, have increasingly confidence in our liquidity position, given the change that we just made, especially in paying down the preferred. But, we remain cautiously optimistic about further improvements in travel recovery as we head throughout the rest of the year. Operator, we are ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney Mark Mahaney : Thanks. I had two questions. One, just a clarification, Peter, on your comments about the down 40 and January down 20 and March improved and April. I think, you\u2019re just referring to domestic bookings. If that\u2019s so, could you just give those things for the trends on a global bookings basis? And maybe I misunderstood that. And then, secondly, kind of a high level question. If you think about what you\u2019re doing with the business to help. You\u2019ve done a lot of things to improve the cost structure as you\u2019re going into and out of COVID. What about -- how would you describe what you\u2019ve done to try to improve the bookings growth and the revenue growth pre versus post-COVID? What have you done to -- what do you think are the best ways to get the growth to reaccelerate from where the business was prior to COVID? Thank you. Peter Kern : Thank you, Mark. Sure. I\u2019m happy to answer those. First of all, the answer to your first question is, those numbers are global. That is our entire business, collectively, not just the U.S. The U.S. is stronger for sure, helping that number up. But, that -- those are global numbers. As for beyond the cost structure, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re doing tons of work, and I\u2019ll start by, unfortunately, reiterating all the work we\u2019re doing on the marketing side, the work we\u2019re doing to simplify and combine our performance marketing, team, tools, capabilities, data analytics, that\u2019s a huge benefit for us as we go into the post [Technical Difficulty] into the future into the post COVID and our ability to compete in the performance channels in the most effective ways. We believe we can do better and do more on the brand building side and to create that direct customer relationship. And then, that bleeds all the way down through, of course, the importance of doing the product right, getting the engagement right, improving the apps, improving the technology, using AI to improve the customer experience. So, all of those things are the classic sort of virtuous cycle of can you get them in the door, can you make them love you, do it -- is the experience great, does it help them find what they want. So, there\u2019s a ton of work. All that work I talked about on the platform side is not about efficiencies, although it does create efficiencies. What it really creates is agility and the ability to serve the customer better and create a stronger tie to that customer and repeat and loyalty and lifetime value. So, it\u2019s really an exercise in all the pieces, but we are getting sharper on all elements, whether it\u2019s the brand proposition for every brand, whether it\u2019s the geographic proposition for every geo and brand, and then what that customer experience is like all the way to the end, through service. And it\u2019s all those pieces. So, [Technical Difficulty] investing across the board in terms of our energy and time. And I think those pieces will start to multiply on themselves as we get more and more of them sort of across the road as it were. So, lots of good work going on. Some things are a lot further along than others, but I think you\u2019ll continue to see improvement across all those categories. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from BofA. Justin Post : A couple of questions. First on Vrbo, obviously, high valuations in that sector. Wondering if you can help us understand the percentage of bookings and maybe the growth rates in the quarter for bookings or revenue. And then secondly, obviously, very interesting disclosure about the Expedia marketing spend. And I believe you said it to be the biggest in the last five years. So, could you help us understand, first of all, how you think about that affecting EBITDA in the second quarter? And are you seeing very positive marketing returns that give you kind of -- are encouraging you to spend that much? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Justin. I\u2019ll maybe take the second one first. Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time getting to a new brand proposition, a bunch of new capabilities and things we wanted to talk to the consumers about and just at the early stages of rolling out our Expedia Brand campaign. That is a heavy brand campaign across multiple markets, and we think it has great opportunity. But to be clear, brand marketing is somewhat are not just all science, and it does take time to pay its rewards. We do believe though that by being more a funnel, by being more efficient in performance and allowing us to put more money upfront, we can drive greater long-term returns. Now, it\u2019s not a quick twitch muscle. As I said, brand marketing is now like you run a great ad and tomorrow, everybody books. It takes repeat. It takes sinking in that brand proposition and getting everybody focused on your name, and then it starts to pay rewards and performance. It starts to pay rewards and direct. It starts to pay rewards across a lot of things. So, we believe in that opportunity. We will invest in that opportunity. And it will take some time to pay out. It\u2019s not like performance. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re buying the transaction every time you do it. On the Vrbo front -- let me just look at the percent of bookings and growth rates. So, I think we don\u2019t break those numbers out separately. I would say Vrbo is doing great. The U.S., particularly strong, but as I said, in all our strongest markets, we are showing share gains. And Vrbo is clearly -- and vacation rentals in general, clearly in very positive territory, and that is helping bring up all our numbers, no doubt. But, we don\u2019t break them out separately. And so, I think it\u2019s just we view it as part of the business. And as I\u2019ve said before, the long-term plan for Vrbo or vacation rentals, more generally, is to have them available through all our brands in the most optimal way for the customer. So, that\u2019s where we are. Eric Hart : Yes. And two things -- quick things to that. This is Eric. Also on distributing that inventory from a vacation rental standpoint, ultimately through EPS or Expedia Partner Service as well. We think that\u2019s a meaningful opportunity for us as well. And then, on the marketing side, if you look at year-over-year going to 2018, 2019 and 2021, our marketing spend as a percent of revenue has come down quite a bit when you compare against those. And yet, we are spending heavily into brand, and we\u2019re continuing to spend in performance channels as well. And we\u2019re also seeing, given all the work that the teams have done, where we\u2019re getting good share of voice, share of wallet, if you will, at ROAs that are higher than we\u2019ve traditionally seen. So, still a lot to learn how that\u2019s going to flow through the P&L over time, as Peter mentioned, but we feel pretty good about the investments that we\u2019re making at this time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. If we start on the cost side, you\u2019ve taken the business kind of down to the studs during the pandemic. How are you feeling about your positioning as the tempo increases in the market? Are you able to handle strong upticks in volume? Do you feel like things are running in a stable fashion kind of operationally, any areas that might need investment? And then, secondly, kind of as you lean into the new brand campaign, would you characterize your posture on the performance ad side as kind of leaning in or more kind of neutral there and focus on the brand side and hoping that that will have benefits in the performance channel that allow you to kind of get some efficiencies there? Anything you could share there would be helpful. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Lloyd. I would say, first of all, we didn\u2019t take it down to the studs. We did a lot of things that we thought were the right things to do for the long-term health of the Company. But we have invested in lots of people, talent, marketing, all kinds of things, technology. So, I think, we\u2019ve done the right stuff across what we thought was the right way to shape the business. And as you\u2019ll recall, we set out to do that before COVID even hit. So, that is the -- that was the plan, that has been the plan, and we feel good about where we\u2019ve gone to. Now, are the places we want to invest in? Absolutely. Do we want to bring in and retain the best talent at our Company? Absolutely. We are making those moves. We\u2019ve brought in lots of great new talent. We have changed, as Eric alluded to, our equity and bonus structure to reward our people for growth. So, we will continue to invest in the things that will drive our business, much of which is people and their ability to build great tech and tools and products and services and then people to help externalize all the great stuff we\u2019re building on the B2B side and of course on the consumer side. So, we don\u2019t feel like, in any way, we\u2019re in an unstable position. Where we have a lot of moving parts, we\u2019re trying to change a lot. There\u2019s no question. And we think all of it has great opportunities. And will we break something along the way, stumble once or twice? I\u2019m sure we will. But in general, we are feeling like we are in a good position. And if anything, we\u2019ll continue to invest into the growth as the returns come in. As far as brand campaigns come -- are concerned, no, we are not about hoping that works and just shifting money around. Our whole proposition is that we believe we can do better on the performance marketing side. We can be better, be more efficient, be more competitive, and by doing so, free up capital, if you will, to go upstream, up funnel to push into the brand side. [Technical Difficulty] way through all that, just as we\u2019ve tested coming off Google meta for VR and other meta for VR. That\u2019s had a really positive impact. We will test more things. We will get smarter. And as I alluded to quarters ago, we are getting into being able -- our goal is getting to the point where we can build algorithms to maximize for multi-brand and do things we\u2019ve just never been able to do before. So, that\u2019s the opportunity. And we are leaning into both of that from a technical standpoint. And yes, we are spending up more now that the market is coming back. So, both of those things are true, but we believe we can do it more efficiently, as Eric said, maintain higher ROAs in that and then redeploy some of that capital back to the front end to drive that brand awareness, where we think we can also do better than we have historically and spend that money more efficiently. So, it\u2019s sort of, again, a virtuous cycle. We got to do all those parts. It\u2019s a lot [Technical Difficulty] but it\u2019s not a hope and a prayer and just moving money around. We want to be as efficient as we can and buy good growth in performance marketing where [Technical Difficulty] and we want to use brand to its greatest effect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Naved Khan : Yes. Thanks a lot. A couple of questions. So, maybe, Peter, you talked about ROAs. As you are discovering whether optimum ROAs can be, how should we think about the split between -- split of your ad budget between performance and brand advertising as we look forward? Where do you think -- how do you think it compares to where it has been in the past? And then secondarily, you are making a big push towards loyalty. I think you, in a recent announcement, talked about gaining around 25 million new loyalty members. How does that affect the P&L in terms of how you accrue for the loyalty rewards? Peter Kern : Yes. So, maybe I\u2019ll take those in reverse again, Naved, which is on the loyalty side, we felt like there\u2019s a big opportunity, particularly in Brand Expedia to drive loyalty. And those learnings will no doubt help other brands for us. But we were -- we felt like we were leaving a lot of customers on the side because of the -- how we made them sign up, what they had to go through, et cetera. And the truth is, for a customer, it\u2019s a much better experience if they become a loyalty member, they get to see loyalty rates. They get to -- they get a lot of benefits. And in general, they consume more. And the returns on those loyal customers are higher than the returns on people who are not members. So, while there may be accounting that has to get accrued for over time, the return on that customer\u2019s performance is much greater. It\u2019s been proven over and over again in our brands. So, this is really just opening up a window, making it easier and better for the customer, helping them see the benefits, allowing them to see the benefits earlier, if you will. And I think there\u2019s nothing but upside and good stuff there, so both for the Company and for the customer. As far as the ROAs goes, we talk about this a lot. We don\u2019t really know where it\u2019s going to balance out. We are trying to take a scientific and approach as we can to driving returns through our marketing area. So, it will be a bunch of learnings as we go. We are testing and learning, even as we speak, a bunch of things across on and off different brands in different geographies and seeing what happens. From a performance marketing standpoint, we will be testing into brand spend as well by geography and by brand. So, it -- we\u2019re going to learn. It\u2019s going to take some time, but we believe with the benefit of a really strong team on the brand side and a really strong team on the performance marketing side, for the first time, once we get all these things consolidated, and the technology working the right way, we are going to have -- it\u2019s going to be a fair fight, and we\u2019re going to be in a position to perform -- outperform the competition in a way we just haven\u2019t been for a long time. Eric Hart : This is Eric. And I would just add on the loyalty side, we are working through ultimately how to account for those going forward. We have robust teams. We actually have three different teams that look at and quantify it separately. We have an internal team, a third-party provider, and then our auditors go through it as well. And so, we\u2019re going to be going through that math to effectively, say, there\u2019s going to be a lot more points perhaps with a respective lower probability of redemption, at least for those that don\u2019t get actively engaged, which again, the point is getting them actively engaged in that journey. But, we\u2019ll provide updates as we go through, but it is something that we\u2019re working through. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one, Peter, sort of a high level one. When you came into your role, you outlined a number of strategic priorities, brand reorg, the cost reductions, improved product merchandising, et cetera. Just sort of help us understand, which of your priorities you think you\u2019ve made most progress on? And then, as you sort of look into \u201821, \u201822, where are there still sort of the most low-hanging fruit to continue to improve the execution of the Company, both top line and within OpEx? Then the second one, just a little bit on marketing. Talk to us about what you\u2019re seeing on performance marketing ROIs and your mix of overall direct traffic as you sort of head into the spring and summer. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Brian. So, on the strategic priority standpoint, I think, we\u2019ve made a lot of headway in many fronts. I think the hardest, biggest lift is really on the platform and the technology and the product. And a lot of that\u2019s been organizational, getting the right pieces of the Company together in the right way and organized under the right leaders, so that we could drive this journey we have to drive from getting to this complicated siloed technology we had before to a much more clean, high-efficiency, agile construct. So, that\u2019s where the most -- I would say the most energy is going in. And frankly, it\u2019s a tale of 1,000 stories. Different parts of that journey are in different states of completeness. But that creates, to your second question, I would say, the most opportunity going forward, because every time we get a win there, and I\u2019ve talked in the past, whether it\u2019s about multiple checkouts becoming one checkout or multiple identity features becoming one identity, it gives you both speed and better consumer experience and better ability to improve on that as well as efficiency and the ability to redeploy that resource to other higher return opportunities. So, that\u2019s both, an efficiency opportunity, but I would think of it more as the opportunity to invest that talent into new growth, as we go forward. So, we are still in the middle of many of those things still being fully equipped as if they were run as 6 or 8 or 10 separate things. We will get to a place where we have one strong, robust thing and those resources can -- some of those resources can get to higher-value returns. And then, as far as marketing and the other and cutting costs, again, the cost side will come from what I just described. I don\u2019t think -- we continue to see opportunities. Many of the things Eric has talked about that have already borne fruit in terms of cost savings, like our voice platform, et cetera, have much more opportunity to go and more running room. So, we see that continuing to happen. We\u2019re creating great new tools on the service side, which are creating the opportunity to serve our customers much more efficiently, not just through technology, but also through technology assisting humans. So there\u2019s all kinds of places that I think there\u2019s more opportunity to get more efficient. But, we really view it, I think Eric and I think about it as it\u2019s really the opportunity to reinvest back in the business when we have those efficiencies as opposed to, do we just keep cutting for more margins. So, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity on the margin side, I would say, as we reinflate with travel. And on, the flip side, we believe we\u2019ve made good progress, but there\u2019s still a long way to go and a lot of opportunity. What did I miss? Sorry, on the ROIs for direct traffic -- for mix and direct traffic, I would say, sort of a warning here. I think, during COVID, it can be very misleading. Most of us in the travel space have seen really good numbers on direct traffic, on mobile use and all that because our most loyal customers, when we weren\u2019t marketing as much were a bigger part of our mix than they might otherwise be. I think as we start to reinflate again in terms of a more natural travel market, those dynamics may shift somewhat. But definitely, we continue to push all in on app usage, on direct relationships on getting out of the auctions as much as we can. So, the mix has definitely shifted in our favor in terms of direct traffic, in terms of app and mobile use, et cetera. But I don\u2019t want to put too much on it because I\u2019m not sure where it\u2019s going to normalize out when the market returns globally. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Couple ones. So first on Vrbo, can you talk about your efforts on the supply side? You talked about rotation into traditional lodging a little bit. How are you optimizing for -- on the supply side during this period where demand is spiking? And then, the second one, I wanted to ask about the booking window trends. Is there any notable changes now that you\u2019re seeing recovery nicely coming up? Are these mostly attributable to kind of summer bookings or more near-term bookings? Any color you can provide there would be helpful. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Deepak. I\u2019ll take the Vrbo part of it. So, we\u2019ve amped up our investment in marketing and attracting Vrbo host, if you will, or owners. It has been successful. We are driving it as fast as we can. There is a lot of demand, and we\u2019re focused, as you would imagine, in the most -- the most high-traffic areas where we need and can sell as much new inventories we can get. We introduced a new product, which we called the Fast Start program, where we essentially take successful hosts that are highly rated from other platforms, and we launch them quickly into our platform, and instead of having to rebuild their stature as a highly reviewed host, we sort of take as a proxy, their experience elsewhere. And we put them, if you will, very high in the sort and allow them to start up their business with us. But the reality is that Vrbo hosts on balance make more than Airbnb hosts on average. And it\u2019s a great opportunity for people to monetize their assets. We think it\u2019s better than any other similarly situated one. And we think owners of properties are increasingly becoming aware of that as our brand becomes more ubiquitous and as people become more used to the products. So, all our stats make for a great sales story. We just have to get it out there, and we\u2019re spending more to get that story out there. Eric Hart : Yes. And I\u2019ll just add to that, this is Eric, as well. There\u2019s also, listen, as there a compression or when there\u2019s supply selling out, if you will, there are alternatives that we\u2019re then providing. That\u2019s part of the product experience on whether it\u2019s a nearby alternative or a peer or whatever else. So, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working from a product standpoint. In regards to your question on the booking trends, we continue to see elevated in the next 30 days, unconventional lodging, but it has come down from what we saw during the, call it, the depths of the pandemic. We\u2019re continuing to see, obviously, very strong demand for the summer. And even off a very small base, we\u2019re seeing healthy demand for the holiday period as well. So, we\u2019re starting to see it extend into away from the zero to 7 days or very near term into more healthy time periods as well and more distributed to what we have seen historically. And I would say, that\u2019s a similar story on the Vrbo side as well. But typically, it has longer booking cycles, and we continue to see that as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. I had a follow-up on the April trends that you mentioned. So, you saw a pretty dramatic improvement between January and March. Can you give us any additional color on to what extent April improved versus March because you did note that it was better? And then, within that, can you talk about the U.S. a little bit more? And did you -- have you seen the total U.S. market return to growth yet versus 2019? Peter Kern : Kevin, I\u2019ll -- as far as April goes, I would say that we\u2019ve seen modest improvement off of March. It\u2019s not linear from the negative high-40s to 20s and keep going. So, don\u2019t get too excited. But, it is directionally positive, and we hope and believe that will continue. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of summer bookings through that spring period, and you can assume appropriately that has a lot to do with Americans getting vaccinated and being more comfortable booking their holidays for the summer. So, we expect something like that trend to continue for a while. But again, as I mentioned in my remarks, if -- we need cities to open, we need international travel up, we need other things to open. U.S. domestic travel itself cannot get us back to where we used to be on a standalone basis. Having said that, U.S. domestic travel is higher than U.S. domestic travel used to be and was in 2019, we\u2019ve seen that effect. And we\u2019re not disclosing the U.S. market -- the market\u2019s growth or not, but in terms of our performance, but yes, the U.S. is strong. It\u2019s driving a lot and it\u2019s carrying the weight for a lot of other markets that are still closed, frankly. So, we feel very good about where the U.S. is. We hope for a lot of reasons that the rest of the world comes back, not just for our business but for their own lives. But, that\u2019s where we need more to open up. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, That\u2019s really helpful. And then just on Amex, did you mention expected timing on the close here? Peter Kern : Expect 9 to 12 months. Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, guys. A couple of clarifications on Egencia. I want to ask about the enterprise value for either Egencia or all of the combined entity on the deal. And then, clarification on the supply agreement. Does that apply just to Egencia slice of the biz, or will all of that organization be relying on EPS going forward? So, first one on Egencia. And then, the second one was just a follow-up to Naved\u2019s question at Vrbo. If you\u2019re seeing any indications of other long-term shifts in travel behavior, maybe have you seen repeat usage, hey, what we rented last summer, we\u2019re doing again this summer or tailwinds with the inventory, making inroads in urban centers and resort areas where the competition has been tougher, like California? Thanks. Eric Hart : Great. This is Eric. I\u2019ll take the first part of that question, just around Egencia. We did mention -- or I mentioned in the call that we have approximately 14% of ownership in the combined entity, and we estimate that to be worth $750 million. So, I think you can essentially do the backwards math to get to the overall estimated enterprise value and equity value for the business. On the commercial agreement itself, that in excess of $60 million based on 2019 volume. That is for the entire supply relationship that we will have with the combined business. And there are components of that that\u2019s obviously Egencia and distribution that we\u2019re putting in. And obviously, we want to have a much larger relationship with them as well. So, it does represent the combined and the full estimate of that agreement. Peter Kern : Great. And I\u2019ll jump in on the last one, which is, we haven\u2019t seen a ton to suggest that things are changing. And as you\u2019ve heard me say many times, I\u2019m loath to extrapolate too much from this COVID period. But for sure, there are a lot of new users of the Vrbo experience. And in general, I think the data suggests they are going back to it more frequently. But again, we are in COVID. And as long as you\u2019re comfortable with that use case, you\u2019re still comfortable with it. Now, is that sustainable? Will people go back to resorts and other things? I\u2019ve said publicly that I believe, in general, the trends of the past will continue. But, one of the trends of the past was that people were getting more and more into the use case of vacation rentals. So, I think we have accelerated that. We\u2019ve exposed more people to the product. And that\u2019s a good long-term trend for that category. But, I don\u2019t think -- and it will make people consider vacation rental as part of their choices where maybe before they had not. But, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re necessarily going to be seeing a huge shift that sustains itself long-term so much as maybe a reset at a higher level for vacation rentals and then growing off of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you so much. So Peter, I guess, more of a macro question here. So, as we look to maybe next year, I think there may be reasons to believe that the travel industry may be seeing elevated growth for the next few years, especially as the personal savings rate in our country seems to be at the highest it\u2019s been in probably 50, 60 years. So, maybe the consumers are ready to go out there and maybe do some revenge travel. So, anything you\u2019re seeing so far in the data to customer-by-customer level or otherwise that can either confirm or deny the notion and the activity that you\u2019re seeing? Whether they seem more willing to splash out for more luxurious accommodations or staying longer, that sort of thing? And I think you brought up reducing friction, I think in your prepared remarks. Anything you can share in terms of where you may be now in terms of rolling out real-time bookings among your Vrbo property owners, and how much of the Vrbo inventory has been integrated into your OTA brands so far? Peter Kern : I\u2019ll take a crack at the first one. Thanks for the question, Stephen. I\u2019m rooting for revenge travel, whatever that is. We -- the more -- whatever kind of travel people want to do, we\u2019re happy to accommodate it, revenge or otherwise. I think, we\u2019ve seen -- we definitely were seeing earlier in the pandemic, these longer stays, certainly in the Vacation rental space, et cetera. I think things have normalized somewhat from that. But in general, those days are longer still on an average basis. And I think we\u2019re seeing ADRs are higher and -- for us, and people are spending more. Now that\u2019s a little bit of mix, but it\u2019s also that hotels and Vacation rentals and desire both places have been able to push price, and consumers have been willing to pay for it. And I would say that revenge or otherwise, places like Miami demonstrate that there is huge pent-up demand to go to places where people can experience a relatively normal travel experience. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been to Miami recently, but it is packed. The hotels are full. People are out everywhere. Restaurants are full. So, I think that -- and their booking levels are well above two years ago. So, if you just think about that in a macro way, you say, okay, where people can travel, where they can have a normal experience, where they feel like they\u2019re comfortable free, whatever your words are, there is a huge amount of demand for that. So, obviously, it will spread out across the globe, as more places are like Miami. But, I think that demonstrates in a sense that there is pent-up demand for the places and the things where people can spend money. Eric Hart : And this is Eric. I\u2019ll take the second part of the question, just around Vrbo and getting distribution on the OTA brands. So, we don\u2019t disclose the number of properties that are live on our other OTA brands. But what I will say is that we continue -- two things. One is we continue to add more properties. It was higher in Q4 than Q3, and it\u2019s higher in Q1 than it was in Q4, and so we continue to make progress. And also, we continue to increase the number of OTA brands where we\u2019re distributing that inventory. So, making good progress on both of those. What we ultimately need to do though is continuing to improve the customer experience. It is a different product. It has a different use case. As Peter mentioned, it has a different operational flow and customer experience. And we\u2019ve made progress there. We need to make more. And it is our full intention to continue to invest behind that, get that better user experience, which I think will then continue to get more properties, and again, higher booking and a better customer experience. So, all in all, making progress, more to do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Just a follow-up -- just following up on some of the Vrbo. Where would you think, I guess, since you\u2019ve talked to property managers over the last five years, sort of the integration with Vrbo into Expedia has probably been a little slower than they like. So, could you just give an update on how you\u2019re doing with integrating Vrbo with Expedia? And then, it seems that some of these work-from-home trends could actually benefit leisure travel by giving people more flexibility. So, I mean, as stuff opens up, I mean, is there any brand campaigns, or how are you thinking of sort of leaning into this work from anywhere trends, and how can you benefit from that? Eric Hart : Thanks for the question. This is Eric. Just to touch on, I think, I was giving some components of your first question a few moments ago. But, we are improving the customer experience to invest in it. It\u2019s something we have made progress and continue to invest on it and need further improvement, but we\u2019re excited about the product. And I think, we don\u2019t disclose the number of properties that we\u2019re distributing through our OTA brands. However, we are increasing the number. It\u2019s -- as I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, Q4 was higher than Q3, Q1 is higher than Q4, and we\u2019re also increasing the number of OTA brands where we\u2019re distributing that inventory. So, we\u2019re making progress. I think, everyone on this call will agree, it was slower than we would have wanted it to be, but we\u2019re certainly putting the organization\u2019s weight behind it because we think it\u2019s a big opportunity for us. Peter Kern : Yes. This is Peter. I would echo that the management companies were right. It\u2019s taken us too long. We\u2019re working hard on it. We want to change it for them, for us and for the consumer. But it\u2019s -- getting the right consumer experience, as Eric said, is the key thing to making it successful for all of us, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really working on. As far as the work-from-home trends go, yes, we\u2019ve been leaning into this from the beginning. Vrbo was pushing a lot of sort of staycations, stay nearby, school from home, and making sure people understood what the Wi-Fi and other things were. So, we\u2019ve understood these trends to the extent we could, and we\u2019ve tried to lean into that consumer interest. I think, longer term, we, like every company, and certainly, like every tech company are dealing with the work-from-home questions and the flexible work of the future, I think, clearly, what we\u2019ve seen suggests that the world will be more flexible. And whether that means people will have the opportunity to work from other places, take longer weekends and work from somewhere, et cetera. We\u2019re going to have to see how that plays out. We hope it adds to travel, obviously. But, it\u2019s too early to tell. Operator : We will take our final question coming from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Mario Lu : So, just one on the revenue per room night. This quarter, you mentioned it was up 10% year-on-year, driven by the mix shift to alternative accommodations. Just curious what was the revenue per room night if we kind of looked at it on the same room basis? Is that trending higher based off of pent-up demand? And how sustainable do you think these trends are as we continue to approach 2019 levels? Thanks. Eric Hart : Yes. This is Eric. As you mentioned, what we have in the release is revenue per room night was up 10%. That is due to two primary factors, mix to Vrbo and then mix to the U.S. as well, where there\u2019s typically higher ADRs. We don\u2019t get into the detail of breaking out individual components. But, I would say, anecdotally, we\u2019re certainly seeing ADRs improve. They continue to be down relative to, call it, 2019 levels, but sequentially improving. And Vrbo is obviously seeing some nice ADR improvements, just given the demand in that sector. Operator : There\u2019ll be no question at this time. I will now turn the call over to Peter Kern for closing remarks. Peter Kern : Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. I hope we got your questions answered. We\u2019re feeling really good about our improvement, and we hope the world continues to open up. Please get your vaccines or tell your friends, and please keep your thoughts with all our friends in India. And thank you for joining us. We\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to SVP and CFO Retail, Patrick Thompson. Please go ahead. Patrick Thompson : Good afternoon and welcome to Expedia Group's financial results conference call for the Second Quarter ended June 30th, 2021. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by our CEO, Peter Kern; and our CFO, Eric Hart.

Please refer to today's earnings release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the Company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, exclude stock-based compensation. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thanks, Pat. Good afternoon everybody, and thank you for joining us today for our Q2 earnings call. I will be relatively brief, and then Eric will take over and we'll take some questions. I'll open by saying that in general, Q2 was quite strong and a major improvement on Q1, and we were pleased with the progress we made with particular strength in North America and the U.S. As I've said before, the market has been driven by a lot of COVID-related changes and patterns. Domestic travel has been stronger, VR stronger, whereas international travel, corporate travel, even big-city travel has been relatively muted comparatively. The good news in that is that we find ourselves in a relatively stronger position in the U.S., our largest market and the largest travel market. But in places like APAC where we have a largely international business, that obviously has not responded as quickly. So, as we look across our performance, there are all those moving parts in the mix, and together what that delivered in the second quarter was a general improvement in the April-May time period, and another step-up and significant step-up in June, not unlike what we saw in the first quarter with a step-up in March.  July has been impacted somewhat by Delta, and the Delta variant, and we've seen some backwards movement in July, but in general still relatively stronger performance compared to earlier parts of COVID. As it pertains to travel patterns, I think it's important to keep in mind that, obviously, we don't know where Delta is going. Places like Australia have had shutdowns. Whereas other parts of the world, including parts for EMEA, things are opening up somewhat more, but there\u2019s a lot of unknowns including the U.S. and we're starting to see some of that percolate through cancellation rates and more volatility in the numbers.  I think it's also important to keep in mind that as we move into the fourth quarter, where traditional trends would have had leisure coming off and corporate coming up, etc., there remain a bunch of unknown across the globe in terms of back to school, back to work, and how people will travel in this portion of our COVID times. That being said, as we focused on marketing, Q2 was obviously a time of relative strength, and we aggressively pushed into marketing. We saw the opportunity to get in front of the building momentum and travel.  And as we've talked about before, we have a long-term goal of building more brand recognition and pushing more into brand marketing, creating longer-term relationships with customers. Performance marketing, on the other hand, remains considerably volatile, especially as we've seen cancellations rates more recently growing slightly. So, we were relatively leaned in into Q2. We expect to be leaned in in Q3, but with a bias towards brand building for the long-term relationships with customers.  And we do believe whenever COVID subsides in a way that gives people real comfort, there\u2019s so much pent-up demand that travel will outstrip anything we've really ever seen before around the globe. And as we move [Indiscernible], I just want to emphasize that this is an area where we felt there was an opportunity to be stronger. Jon Gieselman joined us in middle of the quarter. Jon is a great talent coming to us from Apple. He is a terrific brand builder. And brand and performance marketing work together, and we have to really define and build our brands.  And I've talked extensively in the past about rationalizing brands, making them work together, and allocating capital appropriately. And we have great confidence in what Jon will bring and has already brought to the organization. Likewise, on the tech side, we brought in a new CTO, Rathi Murthy, from Verizon Media. This again is an emphasis, I've spoken about this several times, but we have to be a technology-first Company, and to do that we need great technology leadership. Rathi brings a world of experience to us, and as we move from our multi-stack, multi-domain enterprise that we've had historically into one platform that can service all our brands and all our business partners, it was really important to have a great technical leadership across the organization. So, I won't belabor every technical gain, but are making real progress. We have plenty of work still to do, but we're feeling quite optimistic about Rathi and the changes that she is bringing. So, in general, as we watch COVID play out, we're focusing really on investing in our technology and people, organizing our brands, and allocating capital appropriately among them, simplifying our business, and of course maintaining the rigor we've had around driving margin improvement. And more broadly, we believe that as vaccines continue to roll out across the globe, that will bring greater security, greater comfort, and greater willingness to travel. But the road may still be bumpy for a while as we watch all the variants play out and various government responses to them. I'll just close by saying we launched today something very important to us that our employees are passionate about, which is a partnership with UNICEF wherein we will drive for every app transaction we have in the Company, we will donate to UNICEF to drive vaccination into the developing world. It's clear that not everyone has the access that the western world has to vaccines, and it's our view that until the world is more fully vaccinated, we really can't expect travel broadly to be back to normal. So, we believe in the movement, we believe in the equitable -- equitable distribution of vaccines. We want to drive that for all the obvious societal benefits and ultimately because it's good for our long-term business goals. So, with that, I will turn it over to Eric. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thanks, Peter. In early 2020, I outlined multiple areas of focus and I wanted to provide an update on them. It is around driving margin expansion through better unit economics. And since that time, we've made significant progress reshaping our cost structure through the fixed and variable cost initiatives we've outlined in detail on previous calls. Another major focus has and will continue to be on simplifying our business to help enable the Company to do it faster and also ensure we're focusing on the most attractive opportunities for future growth and profitability.  This has included selling or shutting down businesses we viewed as non-core to the business going forward. To put this into perspective, since the beginning of 2020, we have either shut down or sold eight businesses. And these simplification efforts have continued with the sale of ALICE last month, which I would point out will have an immaterial impact on our financials. In addition, in early May, we announced the binding offer from Amex GBT to acquire our Egencia business. Since then, we have been diligently working through different aspects of the offer, and this week we officially accepted GBT's offer.  Based on where things currently stand, including all relevant regulatory authorities have cleared the transaction and all relevant employee consultations have been completed, we now anticipate closing the transaction during this year, 2021. As a reminder, the deal includes two major pieces we outlined last quarter and remain very excited about. First, we will have a minority position, an ownership position in the combined business. And second, we will also enter into a 10-year lodging supply agreement between Amex GBT and EPS.  Finally, this deal further illustrates the continued progress on simplifying our business. Now shifting to the P&L. On revenue, total revenue was down approximately 33% versus Q2 2019, which was a meaningful improvement from last quarter with revenue down approximately 52%. We saw continued strength from Vrbo and improving trends within our hotel business, while ADR\u2019s were effectively up across the board from last quarter. From a geography perspective, on a revenue basis, the U.S. showed meaningful sequential improvement in Q2. EMEA revenue also improved, and LATAM and APAC revenue remained roughly flat versus Q1. On costs -- on our cost basis and overhead, we have significantly improved our cost basis versus pre-pandemic levels, which is reflected in the considerable progress we've made on the cost initiatives outlined in detail over the past 18 months or so. While we won't see full benefit in the financials until we've returned to more normalized business levels, we remain confident in realizing largely all of the fixed and variable cost savings target by the end of this year. Overhead costs totaled approximately $544 million in Q2, an increase of approximately $40 million versus last quarter, which was in line with our expectations.  The increase sequentially was largely a result of the shift in compensation structure from bonus to salary, which took effect April 1, and we outlined on previous calls. As it relates to sales and marketing, we increased our spend in Q2, driven by signs of a recovery, although total marketing spend was still well below pre-pandemic levels. For Q3, we are balancing investing into the recovery to build our brands with recent softening trends and bookings that we've observed in July and that Peter mentioned. The net of all of this is we anticipate that we will further close the gap versus pre-pandemic spend, although it will still be well below Q3 of 2019. And in total, adjusted EBITDA was $201 million and included a negative contribution from Egencia, which showed some improvement but continued to lag our retail business. We attribute the approximately $260 million of sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA to typical seasonality as well as the improving trends we've mentioned throughout the call. On the free cash flow, which totaled approximately $2.3 billion in Q2 on a reported basis, excluding the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by the change of [Indiscernible] deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately $1.8 billion. Moving onto the capital structure, in terms of the balance sheet, we continue to be investment-grade regular today and will point out that [Indiscernible] recently changed our outlook to stable from negative. There's also no change in our financial strategy.  Going forward. We remain committed to de-levering back to more historical levels as the recovery continues to progress, while also continuing to look for ways to reduce our cost of capital with the underlying goals to be in a strong enough position to restart our capital return program to shareholders. In May, given the positive trends we were witnessing combined with the confidence in our liquidity position, we paid down 50% of the preferred stock that we issued in 2020. We have the right to pay off the remaining balance at any time and we're closely monitoring and intend to pay off when it's prudent, excuse me, to do so. So that's again something that we'll continue to watch over the course of the year and going forward. That said, I remain confident in our liquidity position, which includes approximately $5.5 billion in unrestricted cash as well as $2 billion on a revolver. In closing, we're pleased with the further stabilization of our business in Q2 and remain optimistic about the future of travel and that it will come back as Peter mentioned earlier. And it will be like something that we haven't quite seen before. And with that, Emma, we're ready to take our first question. Emma, are you there? Operator : Hi there. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Naved Khan : Yeah, thanks a lot. A couple of questions. Maybe just one for Eric. If I look at the deferred merchant bookings, they are up 25% versus 2019. Reported bookings were down 26% versus 2019. Could you just maybe help us understand the gap there? What is driving the \u2013 differences in the two numbers? And then I have a quick follow-up, maybe just on the simplification of the business. Are there other opportunities that you see on the horizon to simplify the business further? Eric Hart : How about I take the first one and Peter perhaps you take the second one. So, on the first one, we -- our deferred merchant bookings balance was approximately 8.24 billion as of the end of June, and if you compare June to previous year, it was approximately 4.6 billion. There was an increase in what we call core deferred merchant bookings, which is our more traditional or conventional lodging business, and that reflects obviously improvements on our, I guess that's compared to 2020.  So, I think you'll see on the core business that it's largely in line with where the real differences are coming on the Vrbo side of the business that ultimately is -- and remember that is restricted. There\u2019s approximately 4.26 billion that\u2019s in that deferred merchant bookings for Vrbo, and that just reflects the healthy growth that we've seen at Vrbo, that we've talked about a number of times before. I would say that there's no increased risk, if you will, on that core DMB relative to, I think, where we were in 2019. Peter Kern : Thanks, Eric. And I'll just add now to that in terms of continuing to simplify, I don't think that we expect many more sales or mergers or those kinds of simplifications, but there continue to be opportunities for us to simplify how we do business, and I think what I referenced about some of our new leadership, the opportunity to simplify how our brands work together.  What we're doing on the technology side, we believe we'll continue to unlock opportunities for us but it's not as simplistic perhaps as a sale of the business or something like that. I don't think there are many of those left. Naved Khan : Got it. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Eric. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Please go ahead, Kevin. Your line is now open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks so much. Could you give us a sense of where lodging bookings shook out relative to 2019 both in the second quarter and then what you're seeing in Q3 quarter-to-date? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yeah. So, I'll take it and Eric can add color. Basically, we saw, as I mentioned, a good step function, improvement in the second quarter, particularly into June, and we're feeling quite good about that. July started out a little down as Delta had -- relative to June, and as Delta has reared its head, we've seen some more volatility, and July is sort of in line with the earlier part of the quarter -- of the second quarter. So, hard to tell how the rest of Q3 will shake out. It's been very responsive to the news cycles, but we're obviously optimistic that more openings talk of the U.S. opening to international vaccinated travel, etc., will create more opportunities, particularly, as I mentioned in the international business, which has been a relative strength of ours. So, June was the high point and July's looking a lot like April and May. Eric Hart : Then, in regards to Vrbo in particular, and we're not going to go into the detail if you will on the trends in Q2, but as you think about it going forward, the business continues to perform well. We continue to be excited about it. We're seeing terrific consumer engagements. And then one of the things that we are seeing is that they're continuing to be longer booking windows associated with Vrbo.  And as we project forward into Q3 and beyond with those longer booking windows, our hypothesis is that people have been exposed to the category and the category experience. They're looking to book again.  They also saw compression that was occurring, particularly during the summer. So, people are going in and reserving the house that they want for, whether it's the holiday season or even in into next year as well. So again, time will tell in Q3 and Q4 going forward what seasonality looks like in the state of the world that we're in, but we continue to see some really interesting trends from longer-dated bookings for Vrbo. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Peter. Very helpful. Peter Kern : [Indiscernible] Operator : Our next question today comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Please, go ahead, Mark. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Maybe I'll try two -- one, I just want to ask just a numbers question. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue, and I know this is a shortcut, but was higher in the June quarter than we've seen in quite some time. I think it was the highest we've seen in the June quarter in several years. I know that you've gone through a lot of efficiencies.  I think Peter, I think the expression you used was volatility in performance marketing. So just talk about how illustrative the June quarter was in terms of the optimization that you want out of your brand and performance marketing spend. You look at that number and you say, well that's the opportunity or do those -- to that level of sales and marketing spend come in largely as you had expected. Peter Kern : Yeah, I think -- sorry. Go ahead. Eric Hart : Peter, maybe I'll just give a little bit of context. I think one of the things to keep in mind, Mark, is that remember that our revenue is on a state basis, and oftentimes our marketing spend is generating bookings that we're not going to get revenue for until another period if you will. And as I just talked about on the Vrbo side, we're continuing to see very long booking windows as a higher mix of our overall transactions.  So, it is quite difficult and we're seeing other shifts and booking windows across different products as well. And so, being able to compare quarter-over-quarter to historical again -- historical quarters, it is quite difficult, so I'd just caution you that simplified forum that you admittedly said was simplified. We have to be a little careful of that because of those booking windows looking around and the difference between marketing spend, booking, and stay days. Mark Mahaney : Fair enough. And then the second question had to do with -- go ahead, please. Peter Kern : No, no. Go ahead, Mark. Mark Mahaney : The second question has to do with brands, and you still have the staple of brands, can you talk about different strengths in different regions and you talked a little bit about Vrbo. What about some of the other brands? And would you call out ones that you think are doing in this environment, are doing particularly well, and those that seem most challenged from a -- just comment on the business, just from a brand perspective, and the brands other than Vrbo? Peter Kern : Sure. I think broadly the brands are acting within a range, I would say, of performance. But we have seen, as I've mentioned, I think before, opportunities, for example, in Australia where our local brand Wotif and our local VR brand have performed very well because they had a domestic travel bias in that market, and therefore, in a world where there was much more domestic travel, we leaned into those brands relative to leaning into let's say, Expedia brand, which has more international appeal or an international travel appeal. So, we've seen regional moves like that. I think broadly though -- and you see some reactions and we believe hotels.com has a slightly higher percentage of unmanaged corporate travel within it. And, of course, corporate travel has been greatly reduced during COVID. So, we've seen some movements like that, but I would say broadly, the brands have performed within a range of one other. We are doing a lot of work to figure out long-term how we want the brands to work together as a family of brands rather than as competitors. I've mentioned some of that within Performance Marketing, but I think you'll see that broadly across the enterprise. As Jon and the team get to rationalizing how those -- how we can make those brands all additive to one another as opposed to competitive, and we are continuing to market, again fairly aggressively behind the brand spend. And my comment about the volatility in performance marketing is just to say there continues to be a lot of risk in getting over your SKUs in performance marketing because of the volatility in cancelation rates, shutdowns, and others things. So, on balance, we are slightly more biased towards brand building. And yes, this is a time where we feel, for the reasons I said, that travel is going -- when it can rebound fully, it is going to be extremely robust.  And this is not a time where we want to be quiet in the market, so we are doing lots of things including our recent move to support UNICEF, etc., to get in line with our customer base, get them invested in our brands and the relationship, and drive that for when the future comes pouring in, and while that is volatile, we don't exactly know when that will be, we know it's coming, so we want to make sure we're there for it. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Eric. Peter Kern : [Indiscernible] Operator : Our next question today comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great [Indiscernible] guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of ones. First, Eric, can you help us think about taking rates and booking window dynamic for the second half. With all the moving pieces, it's a little bit of a challenge to translate bookings to revenues. Any additional calls that you can provide thereon take rates and booking window are based on what you're seeing in July would be great. And then the second question.  Can you talk about the supply acquisition campaigns on the global side? How has the supply side generally has been at [Indiscernible] and how should we think about the benefit of this translating into bookings, maybe in the back half and then also into next year? Thank you so much. Eric Hart : Thanks for the question. I -- listen. I understand your question on the first part when it comes to taking rates and booking windows, and it's something that we have caused us a lot of work and volatility if you will on our assessment on our side as well. And I would love to be able to give you more granular responses on what that projection would look like in Q3 and beyond. But the truth be told, that things are just moving around quite a bit when it comes to those booking windows and then from a take-rate standpoint, it's really going to depend on those mixes. And as Peter and I both mentioned, continues to be strong, we've seen conventional hotels come back. Sequentially, we've seen that in the air. We continue to see that in-car which has been quite strong as well it's nice to be associated with it. And again, I'll stop there, but you get the point through the various products. And so, between a combination -- Peter Kern : Don't know what happened there? Apologies. I think Eric cut out on us. Hopefully, you can still hear me. I'll just finish by saying that where he was going is the combination of mix has been really different during COVID, so it's a hard thing to tie back to historic levels.  Air and other things were down more considerably than launching a car, etc. So, it's a little hard to give you much guidance there except to say, we expect to see continued mix shifts during this somewhat COVID period we are in. But we also believe that over time, and broadly, everything will revert to the [Indiscernible] in terms of mix and we should see more predictable take rates in that period. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay. Thanks, Peter. And then the second one on Supply acquisition campaigns related to wellbore -- Peter Kern : Oh, yeah. Deepak Mathivanan : -- Navarre. Can you talk a little bit about that? Peter Kern : Yes. Sorry about that. Yes. We've been focused, I think, we said the last quarter. But we've -- our principal focus has been on compressor markets and we've seen good growth there and good additions. And when we can add inventory there, we see a very good return on that effort. We have not gone to sort of a broad global return to everywhere acquisition strategy because we just don't think it's a prudent use of resources and so many places are still closed down.  But we are taking a much more targeted approach. And as the world opens up, I think you'll see us expand those targets. But in general, when we've been able to add inventory, again, focused on compressed areas that have been quite productive for us. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Eric. Peter Kern : Yeah. Thank you. We'll find Eric. Operator : Our next question today comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Justin, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. I think we're all trying to figure out what your earnings can look like on the other side of this, and so the market share is important. People are going to compare you're down 26% bookings versus [Indiscernible] to booking, which is in the low double-digits. So just wondering if you can help us understand how you think about market share in your core U.S. and Europe markets right now. And second, maybe you can explain some of the differences, maybe your percent of air bookings or how much of your bookings are international versus domestic. Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Justin and I will just say so a couple of things to think about there. First of all, as I mentioned, broadly, when you look at conventional lodging plus press [Indiscernible] we believe our position is stronger in the U.S. than pre - COVID. But, again, that's not the same for all markets. And if you look at a market like EMEA, which came back strong over the summer and came back principally in domestic, that obviously favors some of the other players. And our business in places like EMEA and APAC, as I mentioned, is more international focused. Now that goes to airlift as well because we're very good at delivering long-haul air, which has been virtually non-existent during the COVID period. So, you've seen again, a bunch of these principles at play where we've benefited from some. Others had benefited from others. And we generally believe that international will be the next major thing to open up and that favors our position in many of those markets, and we and we will see that rebound through that side of our business and through the air and all the pieces that are attached to that. But that's really what's going on in market share more than anything, is this a domestic versus international extra start.  There are also more bookings into small markets as people have stayed domestic and gone to the equivalent in the U.S. is a small motel near national park etc., that has not been a traditional strength of ours. We have been better in big cities. Big cities have lagged somewhat : New York, San Francisco, etc., Paris, London. So those factors are all at play. and I would just say that there's been a lot of activity at the lower end of the market and because of their domestic thing. And that's been driving a lot of room nights, but not necessarily a lot of dollars. So, you're seeing shifts like that. We feel pretty good about our position definitely in the US.  We'd obviously love to be strong in all dimensions of our game across the globe, but we think, again, that most of this reverts to the mean over time. And as it does, we will benefit from the return of international travel, significantly where in many places in the world that is the biggest part of our business. Justin Post : Great. And maybe 1 follow-up. Have you disclosed ever how much air bookings were as a percent in 2019? Eric Hart : No. It's fair [Indiscernible] back and I get [Indiscernible] up. Peter Kern : Eric, yeah, yes. Eric Hart : Yes. Now, we've not broken that into 50,000 points. Justin Post : Right. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Our next call today comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian, please go ahead. The line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have to just go back a little bit, kind of drill into the U.S. Can you just help us better understand where your U.S. lodging business, excluding Vrbo, is now versus 2019? And then secondly, again, focusing on the [Indiscernible] in lodging. What can you sort of tell us about the customer dynamics? Are you -- is it mostly existing customers, talking about the contribution from new people you're bringing into the platform? What has sort of driving the growth of the core lodging business in the U.S., in the U.S. ex Vrbo so far? Eric Hart : Yeah. Perhaps I'll take the front end of that. Peter, you want to take the back end of it. I understand that trying to [Indiscernible] Vrbo into conventional locking. We're not going to go into detail on it at this time. On the Vrbo side, I think you've heard us a couple of times anyways, continue to see -- we're seeing a nice performance. We continue to gain share in our primary markets in that business and feel really good about it. And on the conventional logic side, we have seen continued improvement each month of Q2. We've seen a bit of softening in July. But again, at this time, we're not going to go into detail on the breakdown in between those 2, but [Indiscernible] of both of those is that we feel good about where we are in the recovery that we're seeing during the quarter. Peter Kern : Yeah. And all those go into the customer dynamics a little bit here, Brian, which is to say, I think during COVID broadly, as everybody was marketing somewhat less, we saw a lot of direct business. We're all -- we're happy about that, but it's more of a function of not going on the searching market unless we have people out in the market searching.  I think as rebounded tethered more towards usual norms, but again, we've been perhaps somewhat more conservative on the performance marketing side because we -- with cancellation rates so high and other things -- other factors going on, closures, et cetera, it\u2019s easy to spend a lot on performance marketing and not get the return because people don't end up traveling. So, we are seeing, I would say, a mix relatively towards existing customers. I think that's what you'd see across the industry.  Its why app usage is up and other things are growing. But, again, I think as the market is rebounding and more people are out in the market searching, you just start to see us get back to a more normal relationship between all the new Now, I will say a big part of our focus as an enterprise is to create longer-term relationships and greater lifetime value and stickiness and love for our brands with our customers. That involves many things, obviously, on the marketing side, on the product side, on the service side, all things we're focused on improving. So that 360 kinds of end price efforts.  But we do intend and we do plan to build those customer relationships in a different way. We hope, and historically, where we've all had to go fishing in the Google client or whatever and that was the only place to find their business. So, we're hoping to change those dynamics over time. But we have been -- we have seen, in general during COVID, a greater performance from existing customers. Brian Nowak : Got it. And just to go back to Eric's and it's -- we just go back to Eric's answer. So, the bit of softening in July, is that more pronounced on the traditional lodging side, there is the Vrbo side, or is it sort of evenly spread between the product sets? Eric Hart : I think we're seeing it largely across. Now, even expanded beyond the lodging across all of the product types. And whether that persists or not [Indiscernible] Brian Nowak : Yeah, okay. Thanks. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Thank you so much. So, Peter, I think you wanted to kind of talk about potential permanent changes to consumer behavior. I think vacation rentals versus a hotel are fairly well understood. but are you noticing any change in terms of folks favoring agency versus merchant because I'm sure they probably learned last year they're paying ahead of time and trying to get refunds later on? It's probably something that they probably don't want to do again. So, are there kind of [Indiscernible] sort of meaningful differences in the conversion rate between the 2 types of transactions you can call out? And does that positively or negatively influence your customer acquisition strategies going forward? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yeah. [Indiscernible] Stephen. Go ahead. Eric Hart : Yeah. I'll take the front end of that as well. I would think about it [Indiscernible] about merchant and agency that we have seen continued. I think we talked about this a couple of quarters ago. waiting for the agency side of the businesses, consumers want more flexibility, but ultimately, what they're looking for is that flexibility. So, it's more of non-refundable -- refundable is that what they are looking for given the uncertainty in the environment.  And, Peter, feel free to add. But that hasn't necessarily changed our customer acquisition strategy, our [Indiscernible] strategy, or whatever else in the end where our marketplace is running a travel Company. And our job here is to meet with customers and what they're looking for that meets the needs and the use cases that they have and I will continue to do that. But as I said on the front end, and there is continued waiting to the refundable side and the agency side. Peter Kern : Yeah. And I will just add, Stephen, that we're not trying to drive, as Eric said, we're not trying to drive the customer to any particular outcome. We provide choices by and large. And what the customers do, what they want. There has been a relative bias during COVID for pay later. As you say perhaps, I could later do something security around the idea. But there's nothing that I think suggests that that's necessarily a permanent thing. I don't think we know enough yet and we'll see as we come out of COVID, but certainly, we've seen merchant rebound considerably and that may well persist. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Operator : Our next question today comes from Mario Lu. Mario, please go ahead, your line is now open, from Barclays. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I have 2 on ADRs. They're up 21% This quarter year-on-year, I believe 22 versus 2019 levels. So, any further breakdown you can provide in terms of this growth, whether it's a deal mix, organic rate increases, or shifts Vrbo? And how sustainable do you think this is part of the back half of the year? Eric Hart : Peter, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. And I think the 3 categories that you've laid out, the answer is yes, yes, and yes. So, it is a geo mix and into the -- into the U.S., it's a mix into Vrbo, which typically has higher ADR s as well. And then we're seeing for core ADR s increased in some products more than others.  So, it gets more color there. On the Vrbo and car side, I would say in particular, have seen meaningful increases in their ADRs, whereas Air has started to recover, but clearly not to the extent of those other 2 and would say the same for conventional lodging, it's sort of somewhere in between that's a higher than Air, but not to the [Indiscernible]. Projecting forward, we are, as I mentioned earlier on the Vrbo side, for instance, continued to see bookings with those long booking windows.  And if you end up with any kind of supply compression and the word that that's what customers are comfortable traveling with and again, as I mentioned earlier, I think people have really enjoyed that product experience. You can continue to expect a -- very possible to expect that you would see that in Vrbo going forward. On the car side, which may get a supply issue. I think that's been discussed in various forms before, and that's going to take some time to work through. But how much demand remains for far as we get out of the summer season is a bit TBD.  And as generally presuming that July is a bit of an anomaly if things start to recover again, I think you'll continue to see our ADR increases or are in healthy levels, if you will, going forward. So again, not going to get into specifics of trying to predict where exactly those are going to land. But it gives you a sense of the trends that we're seeing across the different products. Mario Lu : Okay. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Jed Kelly : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Questions 2, if 2 if I may. Just can you give us an update on the Vrbo integration with brand Expedia? How's that trending and how are you trying to think about that ahead of the winter? And then as you look out in terms of the international clever recovery, I mean, have your thoughts changed? You even see countries like Iceland and Israel that are really highly vaccinated dealing with higher spikes, higher case cascade. How has the change in the interim, how do you view the international recovery if it looks like we're going to have to change, a multitude of different government policies towards COVID? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Thanks, Jed. I think I believe the second one first. It's, It's frustrating and confusing and complicated. Countries have taken different approaches even within the EU, where we spend a lot of time with the EU commissioners about trying to synthesize the rules and make them consistent because people traveling within the -- who have issues with what the protocols are. So, it remains a big unknown.  I would say we know that vaccines are definitely the biggest part of the answer, at least that we can see so far and of course there's lots of work going on, and other treatment protocols, etc. for COVID. I think we will continue to see improvements and, ultimately, COVID will be something the world learns to live with. And people will be traveling again, so we're starting to see international travel. It's not 0.  We're starting to see conversations. Today U.S. government was quoted that Biden is considering opening up to the U.S. to foreign travelers who are vaccinated. So, I think we'll continue to see that push as countries want to get their tourism businesses back and their business travel businesses back. So, the countervailing issues, and I think they will continue to pressure people to find ways to make it happen, but, clearly, we're not done seeing pockets of issues with COVID and reactions from local or national governments to that issue. So, I think that's why I say there's a variety of unknowns out there and we're just playing it out and trying not to end up upside down over-marketing to a market that ends up with a problem. So that's one part of it. And then on the Vrbo integration, I would say it's worth it, it continues, it's not where we want it to be, we have more content on that and actually on hotels.com, but the end-to-end process, customer experience is not where we wanted to be.  So, we are iterating on that as we continue to make progress towards unifying our tech staff up for our lodging business. It's a core part of that process. But I would say it's not the most important. I mean [Indiscernible] is a good opportunity for us and something we believe in. But there's a series of steps as we bring those stacks together. And it continues unabated, but it is -- but it's not where we want to be it. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. Operator : Our next question today comes from James Lee from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. James Lee : Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about with the new CTO coming in, maybe talk about some of the top priorities that you will be undertaking. And also secondly, I think last quarter you guys talked about the success of integrating the marketing platform, something like 75% on that platform. Can you give us an update? And maybe a little bit implication on the efficiency of the marketing in the back half? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yeah. So, thanks, James. In terms of the CGS top priorities, it's really, as we move to one unified technology team and one unified architecture, the will -- the CTO is to define where we're going, how we're doing it, what the, what the rules of the road are, and how we do this integration from going to many stocks to few. And we created this multi-tenant extensible kind of set of capabilities. And I think that's an -- it's a broad process. it cuts across all the technology in our enterprise. And we're at this hard at work driving that. There's also, as we get to the backend, there's also the customer-facing side, which is all about the UI and UX.  We want to be the first Company, and while driving progress to be that we want to be designed, focused and we have a focus on a new head of design, building out that capability and enterprise. So, it cuts across many things. And it's really about bringing excellence to all those disciplines so that we can just give the best customer experience we can and drive improvements across all the pieces, conversion, engagement, all the things we want to have.  As far as the marketing question goes, and bringing our performance marketing together, I would say that number's up from 75 to probably closer to 85 to 90. But again, more than sort of a benchmark, which is to say it's how we're getting everything on common tools, common datasets, common algorithms, but it isn't -- what's exciting now is the opportunity to begin to test new algorithms, test opportunities across brands, test the opportunity to gain efficiencies and how we market multiple brands and performance marketing, et cetera.  We're in the early days of that, but that is what these achievements of getting through this state have given us. And I would say, we're in a funny time where traffic patterns are unusual because of COVID. So, you're sort of testing into new algorithms and doing a lot of new performance marketing against the backdrop that's a little bit unusual and confusing.  So, we don't always have the volumes to test everything, but there's a lot of exciting work going on there. And as I've said all along, we believe that we'll generate meaningful efficiencies and better operation in terms of performance marketing. But it is hard to benchmark because we don't have normal traffic levels and normal patterns.  So, it's hard to say. It's going to give us an X percent more efficiency or why we have to see it as an action against the more typical backdrop. So more to come on that, but we are making steady and strong progress, and we're a long way down their consolidation of tools and data and all the things that those percentages reference. James Lee : Okay. Thanks, Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Boone from JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Andrew Boone : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On marketing, on-brand spends specifically, can you talk about what brands and where you're investing? Is this supporting brands that are strengths or are you guys building brands [Indiscernible] And also, should we think of this as more of a permanent change to your marketing strategy, or has cancelation rates normalized? Are you guys going to shift to spend back to more [Indiscernible] high quality? Thank you. Peter Kern : Thanks, Andrew. I would say a couple of things. One, yes, we're investing in relative strength. So, for example, Vrbo has been an area of considerably increased investment, during the past several quarters. Other opportunities regionally where we've put money, whether that's in traditional brand spend or social or other things. So regional brands, in some cases, we've seen increases as well. I would say while we are leaning into that and we're leaning into our biggest brands, obviously, in strong markets like the U.S., we believe we can do a lot better in terms of brand messaging, getting cleaner on the brand propositions and, as I mentioned, getting all the brands to work together as a family of brands as opposed to a sort of traditional on most competitors. So, we think there's a lot of opportunities to not just spend on-brand with a bias towards brand-building, but spend that money more efficiently against even stronger, creative, and more efficient ways to build the brand.  So, I think there's a lot of opportunities there. And yes, we intend to also grow in new geos as we refine our capabilities there. And pick markets where we are going to go on the offensive. And then I think as far as performance goes, I think what we're talking about when I say we have a bias towards brand building, is we want to build long-term relationships. But brand spends and performance work together. But stronger brands are better performing, your performance marketing is.  And as long as performance marketing can return the kind of returns and bring us the kinds of customers, those that are sticky and build long-term value, we will spend into that and we will spend as much as that makes economic sense to do. So, I don't think it's an either-or question. It's a question of right now, having a bias again, towards that brand-building while we see how performance marketing shakes up.  But as we get better, we believe we will be able to continue to invest in the performance market and more efficiently than we ever have, and bring the right kinds of customers with the backdrop of brand building that really creates sticky customers for the future. So, I think you'll see us do both. Don't exactly know where the ratios will bear out. We think the Company was over bias towards performance marketing because we just didn't have all the tools, we needed across the brand enterprise. But we think, now, we're in a much different place, so that's where we're going to go. Thank you, Andrew. I think we're at the end. So, I just want to say thank you, everybody. Thanks for your time and I hope we got all your questions answered and we'll speak to you in the quarter. Take care. Operator : That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a nice day. Peter Kern : Thank you, Operator.",

[ Operators Instruction] For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to SVP and CFO Retail, Patrick Thompson. Please go ahead. Patrick Thompson : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30th, 2021. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by our CEO, Peter Kern and our CFO, Eric Hart. Following discussion including responses to your questions, reflect management's views as of today, November 4th, 2021 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.  As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we plan, we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic, we're confident that or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.  You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the Company's Investor Relations website at ir. expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content. Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thanks, Pat. Thank you all for joining us today. Eric and I will make some brief comments and then of course, take questions. Let me begin by saying we're very pleased with the quarter we had in Q3, nearly matching our adjusted Net Income and EBITDA from 2019. But I would add that if not for Delta, this would have been our most profitable quarter ever, and I think it's a tremendous milestone for the Company to be here while we are still in the throes of COVID and still coming out.  And a testament, really, to the work we've done to simplify the Company, to focus on technology, and to run the business more efficiently. And with that performance and what we're seeing in the market, we have the confidence to further pay down our preferred stock, which we did a few weeks ago as you would have noted. On which of course is not a big milestone for us putting COVID behind us. As far as the trends for the quarter go, I'll do high-level and Eric will give a little more detail. We went into the quarter following a strong Q2 and good momentum.  But as we remarked last quarter, Delta had begun to have impact. We saw it impact cancellations, we saw it impact booking trends. But as we got through August and into September, the Delta fears particularly in the U.S., began to wane and we ended stronger in the back half of September and that has continued through into the fourth quarter with even greater strength. We've seen improvement across all segments, really. Well, we heard domestic have led even though segments which have been harder hit by corporate and international travel have been coming back.  Cities have been returning as well. And so all-in-all, it's been a broad-based recovery, but it has been led obviously still by Weezer and domestic travel. And for us, Vrbo has been a particular highlight and beneficiary of that. Few highlights on Vrbo, since you've always asked. We've seen a strong share growth in our focus markets. And in particular in the U.S., about half of our customers so far in 2021, more than half have been new customers.  We expect to book in excess of $2 billion of earnings for new Vrbo hosts who came on the platform this year. And looking ahead, we are already seeing better bookings for next summer than we saw this time last year. So, the trends continue to be quite strong there. And while the story will continue to be impacted greatly by mix effect, which I talked about before, we are feeling more and more confident. And as international vectors open up, which you've no doubt all read about, this is a particular strength of ours historically, and we think again that is a mix effect which will generally benefit us.  And COVID recovery of course remains somewhat bumpy and as unpredictable, to say the least. But we're feeling good and at every turn we are seeing demonstrated that when people can travel, they will travel for business, for pleasure, and everything in between. And we are looking forward to seeing the rest of our business return. In terms of some of the details in the business on the marketing and brand side, our focus continues to be on bringing customers efficiently back to the platform and retaining those customers for the long term and building those long-term direct relationships.  Obviously, the better our product is, the better our customer experiences and the proposition, all those things add to that direct relationship and we're feeling confident about the work we're doing on all fronts. But marketing, of course, is the typical sphere. And with our new focus on being a family of brands, we have launched -- announced that we will be launching one loyalty program which will actually cross all our brands and all our products. We think it will be the most powerful loyalty program in the industry. And we're really excited about bringing that extra usability and an added value to our customers through that loyalty plan.  Because when we get to a place where people can use it across all brands, across all products, we think that just adds tremendous value to the customer. And you should expect to see us do more of that. We will be looking for more ways to unify our brands in a united front of bringing value to the customer in every way we can. We spent the better part of the last 6 quarters building out the organization. And in particular, in the last few months, building our creative organization. We've improved, as I've talked about before, all our performance marketing tools and technology. And we're very excited about our position right now. But we went into the third quarter and specific with a much more aggressive posture. Delta hit, we have -- we've pulled back somewhat. And now again, that we are seeing things growing and recovery building again. We are winning back in. We intend to go on the offense with all the new tools we have in our arsenal and our marketing group. And we expect to go on offense and expand share across the world. On the B2B front, which we haven't talked about a lot in the past quarters, I just want to highlight a few things here. We brought our groups together as I remarked. Last quarter, our supply team and our business we have called Expedia Partner Solutions, which is a business we have used to power other partners in the travel industry.  We brought those together, officially on the last few months, and we're seeing lots and lots of opportunity for those businesses to build on the relationships we have with our supply partners, with our B2B partners and find increasing ways to drive their business and drive their success on our platform. But in particular, UPS itself has done well even during COVID. We've won wallet share with our partners. We've had many new signings. And for the first time in late October, we actually booked more business than we did in 2019 in that business and that has continued into November, so great signs there.  And then finally, on the Egencia front, you've all seen earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of our transaction with Amex GBT. We have merged Egencia and the Amex GBT. We will retain a significant equity interest. We feel really good about that corporate. We believe this will become -- coming roaring back. And Egencia even during this time of transition had its highest signings this year that it's ever signed in terms of new clients in the first-half. So, lots of good signs there. But I think that deal is also emblematic, as I said before, of our desire to power more of the industry.  We want to power Amex GBT with our Expedia Partner Solutions business, with our technology, with our supply, and that is something we will continue to build on as the months and years unfold. So very exciting. And I just want to thank the Expedia team who did a tremendous job building that business, getting it to a place where we could find such a great transaction, put it together with someone else, and in working through the time we had during the transaction and doing just a terrific start. So, I thank them, Expedia team, in getting to help closed that transaction. And then finally, while I've talked a lot about technology in the past, and I will see this brief.  I am as excited as I've ever been since I started about a few months ago about where we are in terms of our technology evolution. We certainly have a lot of work left to do, but it can't be understated the importance of finally being aligned on our technology, on our roadmap, on our architecture. We have one plan and everybody is rowing together and our velocity is increasing. And I think delivery, most importantly, the customer, will increase along with it. But just for clarity on the front-end, we're focused on being at first, data and design driven and focused really on personalization and using all the data and machine learning and the opportunity is great, better and better experience for the customer and for our suppliers.  And on the back-end we're really re - architecting everything. As I've talked about, we've moving from this many technical stacks to one stack on one pool of data that serves all the outcomes, all our partners, all our customers and it's really getting exciting. And finally, I just want to say this moment for us is really important as we move into 2022, getting all of this aligned, getting the work streamlined, getting everybody on the same roadmap is a really powerful opportunity.  And it reminds us that we're finally getting to what we wanted to be getting to which is delivering new value to the customer. We've been internally focused for a lot of COVID. COVID was a tough thing to get through. But we are now in a position where the entire Company is aligned. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of COVID and the opportunity to innovate for the customer and bring great new products and value are really exciting to us and we're looking forward to doing that. And with that, I will pass it over to Eric. Eric Hart : Thank you, Peter. I'm also pleased, as Peter mentioned, with the overall recovery of our business. As you will see, it includes 2 quarters in a row positive adjusted EBITDA. And in the -- in Q3 excluding [Indiscernible] was roughly on par with the third -- third quarter of 2019. And with that, I wanted to start by providing an update on the booking trends that we're -- we have seen and we are seeing. Following a pullback, we witnessed for much of the third quarter and into the first part of September, due to the Delta variant, we saw a notable broad-based improvement across geos and product lines.  Overall, total bookings for all products net of cancels were down 30% versus third quarter of 2019, which was slightly worse than the 26% decline we saw last quarter. Given the continued volatility recovery, we also provide additional monthly detail on our total lodging bookings, not of cancels. That, of course, includes books Hotel in Vrbo. And those were down approximately 17% in July, approximately 25% in August. 19% in September, and further improved to down -2% in October. And again, that's September was also down, of course. The trends in October that we saw in that with -2%, they did improve throughout that month.  So, we exited at a much-improved rate relative to the start of that. Moving to the P&L, starting with revenue, it was down approximately 17% versus third quarter of 2019, which was a meaningful improvement from last quarter with revenue down approximately 33%. We saw a significant improvement in both Vrbo and hotel revenue, which benefited from seasonally strong summer travel. Revenue margin for the third quarter was approximately 15% up from approximately 10% last quarter. This was primarily due to typical third quarter seasonality in the business and product mix weighted towards launching. On sales and marketing, direct spend in Q3 was approximately 1.1 billion, which is down approximately 19% versus third quarter of 2019 levels.  And as Peter mentioned, we've reduced spending, given a reversal in trends we witnessed in the third quarter. However, going forward, given the more positive recent trends that we've discussed, we are again leading into marketing expense in Q4. Moving onto overhead costs, they totaled approximately $530 million, a slight decrease versus last quarter and below our expectations. We saw lower than anticipated discretionary spend, which was down roughly 90% versus the third quarter of 2019 as employees continue to largely work from home in the quarter. I would also call out slower than anticipated hiring as there continues to be a high degree of competition for talent, especially for technology roles.  Looking ahead, we expect overheads increased by approximately $40 million sequentially in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower capitalized labor, due to the holidays, as well as higher anticipated headcount and people costs. In total, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $855 million, which is approximately $650 million improvement over last quarter driven primarily by typical seasonality. Moving on to free cash delivers total negative $1.4 billion in Q3 on a reported basis.  If we exclude the change in restricted cash, which was primarily driven by the change in Vrbo deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was negative for approximately $450 million. As a reminder, the third quarter is traditionally a low quarter for free cash flow due to seasonality. In terms of the balance sheet, we continue to be investment-grade rated today and remain committed to deleveraging back to more historical levels. So, this will further reduce in our cost of capital. As you may recall, we refinanced some debt earlier this year which yielded $80 million in annual interest rate savings.  And last month, as Peter mentioned, given the improving trends and continued confidence in our liquidity position, we paid off the remainder of the preferred stock. In total, paying off all the preferred stock this year, it will save us approximately $150 million in annual dividend payment -- payouts onboard. Finally, on the Egencia, I want to echo Peter 's comments and thank the Egencia team, as well as all of those Expedia employees who're involved with Egencia for their dedication and hard work. I would also like to point out page 17 of the earnings press release which provides details on Egencia financials.  For the third quarter, Egencia generated $55 million in revenue and negative 18 million in adjusted EBITDA for again, the third quarter. As it relates to Egencia costs in third-quarter 2021 rough numbers, but approximately $35 million was recorded in cost of sales, $20 million in sales and marketing, and remaining roughly $20 million spread across tax content and G&A. Going forward, we will report our minority stake in the combined Company within the other net line or income statement.  And in terms of the 10-year lock-in supply agreement with Expedia Partner Services business has entered with a combined Company, we will account for it like any other standard EPS deal. As a reminder, at 2019 volumes, we expect this deal, the EPS deal to worth in excess of $50 million on an annualized basis breakdown. In closing, as Peter and I both mentioned, we're quite encouraged by recent trends. And the pace for recovery is clearly improving. Things are getting better. And I remain truly and very optimistic about the future of travel and our Company. And so, with that, Charlie, we are ready for our first question. Operator : Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Naved Khan of Truist Securities. Naved, your line is now open. Naved Khan : Yeah, hi. Thanks a lot. A couple of questions. Maybe -- Peter, maybe you can give us some color on your thoughts around marketing spend. Do you continue to see scope for what efficiencies here going forward, where do we stand today on the -- and then the second question I had is just around the organization structure going forward? I think you guys had outlined cost savings from the reorg, $750 million in fixed cost and $200 million in variable. As we think about the organization bailout from here on, where do we stand with respect to the aids. Peter Kern : Sure. I'll go first and Eric can take on the cost issues. I would say we're still working towards a better marketing world for the Company overall, which yes, means more efficiently being able to get customers. But it's a many pronged attacks. It's the performance marketing issues that I've talked about before. We have come a huge way in terms of the tools, the data and the algorithms, etc. But COVID has been a bumpy time and we have not found normalized time to really get everything tuned exactly how we want.  So yes, we believe there's opportunity ahead to that. We also believe there's significant opportunity for our brand teams to really be much more impactful than they have historically. And that has impact not only on driving direct customers, but it has impact on how people respond to performance marketing, and other things. So, there's many places where those teams can have more impact and ultimately be more efficient in attracting customers. But it's not entirely on that, right? We've got to build better products.  We've got to have better engagement circles with the customer. We've got to improve our service every -- we need to improve in every part of our game to continue to make the customer stickier and bring them back and want them make this their phrase to come for travel. So, marketing can be more efficient, but it's really a virtuous cycle and how we've streamed marketing together with the experience. And with the new efficiency, the second question goes to all of that gives us more opportunity to reinvest in more profitable long-term customers. They create a long-term value for the enterprise. Eric Hart : Great. Thanks. I'll take the second part of your question regarding the call. So just to remind everyone that the program is both fixed and variable costs. On the fixed side, we -- the most recent update that we provided was $700 million to $750 million, and we expect it to land in the higher end of that range. And on the variable side we set to achieve greater than $200 million, but remember that at -- call it normalized level of 2019 levels because we need the volume to come back to get to see that fall into the end of the P&L. I would say both of those are substantially completed.  There's been a ton of work by the team to simplify the business. And I think we're feeling really good about the fixed and variable side. But I'll also add, we are a technology Company, we're going to continue to invest and improve our services for our customers, and in the way that we operate this business. So, while this program I think has been a tremendous accomplishment of ours in simplifying our business, we don't expect to stop there and we'll keep going, but I think from a program perspective, I think we can put the billion dollars to go to rest. Naved Khan : Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Eric. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Kevin, your line is now open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks so much. Could you dig in a little bit into this -- the significant improvement that you saw in booking trends in October? If you could talk about key segments, geography at all, maybe Vrbo versus hotel? Thanks a lot. Peter Kern : Thanks, Kevin. I would just say generally, I know it feels planned, but we've seen it everywhere. Cities are picking up, international has picked up, there are -- virtually, every area has seen growth. I will say that some of the benefit we have seen and I've talked about mix effects before, when cities were forbidden places, that obviously hurt us. Cities have been a great market for us. And as we've seen cities come back, there's greatly -- they're still greatly lagging major leisure destinations like beaches.  But they're coming back, and that return benefits us probably disproportionately compared to some others. So that mix effect thing, we have some winners and some losers as always, but we've seen cities come back more. We've seen -- relative to the growth, we've seen in the consistently strong leisure areas. And the opening of international channels, the announcements from U.S., from Singapore, etc., about allowing international travel, we see that whip up basically, as soon as it's announced.  We see search queries go up. And again, in places like EMEA, where we're traditionally stronger in international travel as compared to domestic, those openings, I think all go well for us going forward. So, it really is a broad-base recovery. It is every -- not down to every country because there are lifting countries that have COVID spiked, etc. but down to every region. And some regions are trailing dramatically, like APAC and Latin America, but they're improving too. And so, it's really broad-based and it's just what the base you're building off of, and some are different than others. Eric Hart : And then only to add to that, that is as we've talked about over multiple quarters now, there will be volatility in the recovery of the series of many stories and a lot of the intersection points that Peter just mentioned, so we'll continue to monitor, manage our marketing spend appropriately, as we did in Q3. We have the brakes on some areas of that just because of -- we saw a bit of a slowdown, but so far so good in October and going forward. Kevin Kopelman : Very helpful. Thank you. Peter Kern : You bet. Operator : Perfect. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Deepak, your line is now open. Zach Morrissey : Thanks. This is Zach on for Deepak. Just 2 questions. First, you're kind of large main competitor in the space before the last name. Your room rates are still lagging. I think it's down 33% in the third quarter versus 2019. That's lagging kind of bookings performance. I just -- is there any kind of driving force or explanation, driving that Delta and performance? Is it mix -- certain market lagging? Is there a timing to land or there's a difference in reporting structures? Any kind of color there would be helpful. And then just on COVID restriction, I know it's very dynamic and hard to predict, but are you seeing any differences in terms of travel restrictions in implications on demand when we see COVID cases rising in certain markets now versus 6 or 12 months ago? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes, thanks, Zach, lot of good questions in there. I would say, first off, yes, you have to remember that they report on book, we report on stage, so it's sometimes challenging to compare. But I would say, as I've said before, and I mentioned regarding cities, the mix has helped them. They've always been better in smaller markets, long-tail markets, etc. We've always been really strong in big cities.  When cities were dragging, cities get built by international travelers and we also have been strong in long-haul air for those travelers, like all those mix effect actually impact things. And so, some -- some of them we want in, Vrbo has been a beneficiary, some of them we locked in big cities and international travels. So, it's always been a balance. We are less focused on room nights rather than room dollars, if you will. It's a little misleading. We could book a million more one-star hotels -- nights and it wouldn't mean much to our P&L, and we could book 100,000 5-star hotels, it wouldn't mean a lot.  You have to take it all in balance, but we are feeling good about the recovery. And in general, our numbers, domestically, are running ahead, in lodging, of where we were 2 years ago. So, I think we're in good shape there and we feel good about that. And again, we have had a somewhat conservative bend along the game with COVID. We've been, Eric mentioned, tapping the brakes. We tried to respond. Sometimes we get over our skis, sometimes we're behind the recoveries.  It's a balancing act, but we are getting more confident, more aggressive. And I think you'll see us continue to lean in to gain share across the globe. In terms of the COVID question, it remains to be seen at every, as Eric said, every story as its own. But I will tell you if you look at recent news, for example, of the COVID cases in the UK, spiking from recent openings and I was in London and it was amazingly open. I would say that queries have remained elevated since the international announcements to the U.S., and they remain elevated and we have not seen a pullback from the caseload news, so I think that remains strong.  And of course, science is helping us out along the way. We just announced that kids will be able to be vaccinated in the U.S., which is a great benefit for society, let alone our business. And likewise, the announcement today about the UK approving the Merck pill for treatment. This is I think we all agree is probably going to be an endemic not a pandemic. And the more treatments we got, the more ways we got to deal with it, the better off we're all going to be. Zach Morrissey : Very helpful. Thank you. Peter Kern : You bet. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Eric, your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question, maybe following up first on the growth initiatives when you're looking out against the recovery. Are there any things we should be keeping in mind in terms of the ability to continue to grow, supply, or align some of your supply priorities, especially outside of North America, to capture as much of that growth as you can? And 2nd question, guys, coming back to capital return and how you're thinking about a more normalized environment, Booking called out the ability to possibly return capital to shareholders as we get into early 2022. Any updates there on how you're thinking about return of capital on the Balance Sheet over the medium to long term? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Sure, Eric. I'll take the first one and Eric can comment on the second one. But I would say that we continue to look tactically around the globe at what the right vectors are to focus on in terms of supply. I don't think we feel like we're terribly deficient, but we've been a little bit peanut buttered around the globe. As we did with Vrbo during COVID, we're very focused on those compression markets, freeing up a supply there, making that supply really successful right out of the gate.  And that is the virtuous cycle that we think is most valuable. So, we will continue to see us do that for Vrbo, but you will also see us do that in a very targeted way around the globe. And that's where the focus that's tied into where we are marketing, where we are driving our brands, where we think we have the opportunity to win. And again, remember, in many markets around the globe, our B2B business or Expedia Partner Solutions business, drives those markets more than our direct relationship with consumers. and so, driving the right supply to feed those businesses as well is a critical piece.  We will continue to drive into it. I would say, if anything, we've been relatively modest in terms of supply growth during COVID, with a particular focus, again on Vrbo, which was different use case. But as thing as a reopening, we're seeing more demand. You will see us go after in a targeted way, more supply and again in a very targeted end-to-end way, keying on the markets we're focusing on growing and where those markets want to travel to. So, we feel very good about that opportunity. It's just a question of focus. It wasn't a big focus during COVID, but as things improve, we will continue to roll that out. Eric Hart : Yeah. And thanks for the question, Eric, I'll take the second component of that and I would say just from a macro level that our philosophy is and strategy is consistent. First and foremost, want to remain -- we are going to remain investment grade rated, will commit to that, of course, going forward. Second is our commitment to continuing to lower our leverage ratios and get our cost of capital down. We've taken some great steps on that this year and will continue to make progress as we move forward on it. And the third, we have the Company traditionally been committed for returning capital to shareholders in different forms. I would say right now is again, not necessarily the right time for us to do it, but it's certainly something that we're committed to doing over the long haul, and we'll just continue to observe and make what we deem to be, if you will, the right choice at the right time to move forward. Eric Sheridan : Thanks, guys. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Mark, your line is now. Mark Mahaney : Thanks just 2 quick questions. You referred to those growth rates for the 4 months, July, August, September, October was I'm sorry, was that room nights or was that bookings? And then secondly, I know you said that generally all the regions are recovering just to be specific about it and I know that there are flareups and countries markets here or there. But in the major European markets like Germany, you didn't see a -- you have not seen a -- whatever, a dampening of demand at the end of the -- at the end of October recently. Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. I'll take the second part first, Mark. There are some blips here and there. For better or worse, I wish our business we're bigger in domestic EMEA, but we don't feel those flips in quite the same way and we had the countervailing issue of more interest in international. So that has probably offset some of what others may have seen. But yes, there are blips here and there. As I mentioned, even in countries that are more COVID challenge, in general, we have seen sustained interest probably buoyed by the international factor as opposed to, perhaps, what was going on in the summer. Eric Hart : And then Mark, on the first question, it is lodging gross bookings, no cancels. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, both, very much. Eric Hart : Thank you. Peter Kern : You bet. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mario Lu of Barclays. Mario our line is now open. Mario Lu : Great, thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask you about your comment on continuing to gain share. And I'll turn it accommodations and your key markets. Can you expand on the initiatives that you guys have made on your end to allow you got the gain share and whether you think that is sustainable? Peter Kern : Yeah, thanks, Mario. Look, I think it's a combination of good work we've done and popular use cases. We know that the whole home solution has been a very popular solution during COVID, and that has helped us as compared to say apartments in cities where we might be less strong. But on the, what are we doing side, we felt a tremendous amount to Mario Lu : work on the brand, to land the brand, to make people really think about Vrbo as a primary source of vacation options. We've invested more than ever, much more than ever in that brand. And we've really driven that hard. And as I mentioned, more than half our users so far this year, our customers have been new customers to the experience and we think the experience is great.  So, we do think we have sustainably landed the experience on the use case and the brand, and that will continue to benefit us for many years to come. How share exactly shakes out when the market moves back, or people who go into cities to things will change. We're not -- we're not strong everywhere Peter Kern : In terms of Vrbo supply, we are more focused on leisure destinations. But we think we have sustainably put Vrbo in the minds of many people and other brands in other parts of the world that are strong, like stays in Australia, etc. And that is really a powerful long-term benefit for us. Mario Lu : Great. And just a quick follow-up. In terms of the new users onto the platform, has those user behaviors matched those of prior users, or how they've been stronger during this time? How should we think about the new cohort? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yeah, I think it's early to say. I like to tell you that people use Vrbo every 2 weeks, but they tend to need vacation time, and they tend to need school vacations and other things. We'll know more as things unfold, but again, as I said, bookings for next year are already running well ahead of this time last year when there was a lot of pent-up demand for Vrbo s already.  So, I think we are seeing the multiplication effect of adding new successful customers to the experience and piling those things up and people figuring out that they better book next summer, they better book next Christmas, they better book spring break. And that's really a powerful wheel -- cycle that works for us. So, we're really excited that we've added so many happy customers to the experience, and we believe there will be a tremendous long-term value from them. Mario Lu : Great. Peter Kern : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mario. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Doug, your line is now open. Daniel Delfico : Hey, this is Daniel for Doug thanks for taking the questions. First, Peter, you talked about improving these experienced a few times in your prepared remarks so, I assume combining the loyalty program [Indiscernible] those, but curious to hear where you see the biggest opportunities looking ahead. And secondly, could you guys talk a little bit about how you're booked to [Indiscernible] looks like today and how that compares to what you saw earlier in the year and historically? Peter Kern : Sure. I'll take number 1 again and let Eric take number 2. I would say, frankly, we see enormous opportunities across a wide swath of work to improve the customer experience. Some of that is yes, things like loyalty, things that we can do to enhance what it means to be part of our platform.  But it's also in the product, it's also in payments, it's in our CRM relationship with customers, how we give them information, how we reveal and give them discovery and find the right products and the right value at the right time. All of those things are real opportunities and ripe for innovation. We invented this industry 25 years ago. And I wish we had done more along the way to innovate for the customers.  We've done a lot, but there's tremendous opportunity ahead for us in virtually everything we do from service, to on the product to how they discovering book multiple products in a trip to how they get informed about cancellations or delays or other things in the trip and how the app becomes their companion in terms of the experience. We are working across all those fronts and determined to keep bringing innovation to the customer every week, month, quarter for the next many years in a way out of velocity, we haven't done in a long time. Eric Hart : And then on that, your second question, just on booking my noted, we continue to see it revert back in trend towards more what we would have seen or expected in 2019 though it's still a bit skewed. For example, on the hotel side, it continues to be a little bit on the shorter-term side than Vrbo, a bit on the longer-term side of the macro level, so still a little bit impacted by COVID and booking patterns, but generally trending back to normal levels. Daniel Delfico : Great. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Thank you [Indiscernible] Our next question comes from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer and Co.. Jed, your line is now open. Jed Kelly : Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just what you mentioned on the loyalty program across all the brands, can you sort of talk about how your tech stack is going to be able to do that, sort of merchandise say flights with Vrbo and then developing more of like a vertically integrated tech stack around your loyalty program? Peter Kern : I wouldn't describe it quite that way, Jed. but what -- the way I would think about it is we're building every domain where we -- that we own. Think loyalty, checkout, etc. to be multi-tenant and to work across our brands and our partners, because we have many, many B2B partners. And in doing so, we enable our brands or multiple of brands to live on one stack, to live in one currency, if they wish to allow you to burn that -- earn that currency and burn that currency wherever you want.  And this is one of the powerful things that we talked about new Vrbo customers coming on the platform. But imagine when they're not only in the Vrbo product stream and enjoying that, but then there are earning value that they can use across air and other things when they have different travel needs. And likewise, the inverse, the Expedia and Hotels.com travelers who might want to rent a Vrbo for a vacation. So that expansion of being able to spend across all those brands, is that architecture for our technology, which is really building everything we do into multi-tenant, ultimately having all our -- 1 app all on 1 stack, and 1 way.  That doesn't mean we want to separate brands, but they'll run on the same technical infrastructure. They'll have their own differentiation for brand, etc., or product, but it's all going to be built for multi-tenant. It's all going to be built for us and for our partners. And we have the richest dataset, really -- travel dataset in the world. And that dataset powers all our machine learning, all our AI, and our ability to innovate constantly in terms of what the customer sees, how the partners participate. And that's just super powerful once we get it right. Now, there's a lot of work still to do, but we can see the path now and we're all aligned on that path. Jed Kelly : And then, any update on where you are in terms of having more Vrbo supply on-brand Expedia? Peter Kern : Yeah. I mean, it's tied up in the same question, Jed, which is, we have Vrbo supply on Brand Expedia, but the experience isn't terrific. It's a little disjointed for the customer. We can't do everything. This is the -- one of the many things that are the power of bringing these tech stacks together that allow us to seamlessly move content around onto different stacks, make the checkout process seamless, make the servicing seamless, make it all feel like it's coming from the right place. It's not just 1 piece. It's not just about getting the content up. It's got to work all the way through the customer experience, because we're in the business of getting and retaining customers, not just getting transactions. That is a process we need to solve end-to-end, and it is more than just what you've historically heard about on, hey, can we get to contact on Brand Expedia now we need to do it. It's a big opportunity frankly, it's one of a dozen of equal opportunity. But all of it is enabled by getting the tech right. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Jed. Our next question comes from Andrew Boone of JMP Securities. Andrew, your line is now open. Andrew Boone : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, with travel coming back and booking calling out, leaning into marketing channels yesterday, can you talk about any changes you're seeing to the competitive dynamics within performance marketing? And then question number 2, is with it sounds like nice progress being made on the technology rebuild, kind of kind of re-stacking. Can you help us just more tangibly understand what this [Indiscernible]? Do you have any examples, even call out? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : You're on my favorite topic there, Andrew, on the second 1, which is there are myriad opportunities. We have massive opportunities on the CRM front. We're not at first adequately and the app is not a seamless product across all our brands, that's a huge opportunity. The ability to sell multi-products, which we've been a leader in the industry for years, but honestly could be so much better at, in terms of how our checkout pass work and how we get there. So, there's -- and everything I just said is measured in the billions or 10s of billions of GBB opportunity, in my opinion.  So, I think they are really all over the place and many of them unlock and enable really big opportunities on the B2B front and our ability to power partners, power suppliers, etc. So, it's really -- I can give a dissertation for the next 2 hours on it, if you want to miss the Vrb call but in the meantime, suffice it to say that there are dozens of them around the Company and they are big rocks and big opportunities. As far as [Indiscernible] coming back and our friends leaning into marketing, we've kept it pretty consistent model. We've leaned into brand marketing and frankly we've been leaned into brand marketing even when maybe our brand marketing could be better and sharper and that's why we rebuilt that team.  We're bringing the creative teams in house now and really going at it in a different way. But we expect to be balanced. We've seen our competitors move around and gyrate a bit. We've kind of kept to a balance between brand and performance. We feel like there's opportunity to be more aggressive as our performance marketing machine gets sharper and better and all the tools right. We're seeing vectors of opportunity that we can lean into. So, we definitely will have opportunities to lean in.  And I'm really excited about what our brand teams are going to do. Our brand teams are second to none in the industry. We will be the best in the industry and our performance marketing is phenomenal and finally brought together in a way that will be really powerful. So, I think what that balances. As I mentioned, the market's got a normalized, we don't exactly know yet. But it is a virtuous cycle and a better brand marketing of the better performance marketing will do. And we believe strongly in both, and we'll continue to lean in a balanced way. I think our friends have gyrated a little more than us in and out of some of those things. Andrew Boone : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Andrew. And our penultimate question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo. Brian, your line is now open. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, guys. Very thorough call. We want to ask a little more color on the mechanics of the GBT Egencia deal. We think Egencia traditionally has gone to market with low air fees and make up for that by making margin on hotels, leveraging the supply footprint. I just want to check on the mechanics and see if the margin there would be comparable to Partner Solutions as a whole or any other color there? Thanks. Eric Hart : Hi, Brian. It's Eric. I'll take this. And thanks for the question. And I don't mean to be flipping in my response, but ultimately, I think you've got to ask GBT and Egencia going forward what their ultimate strategy is around, how they plan to monetize and develop customer solutions. I can't say that they can -- they plan to run against it to be a core part of their offering and in fact expanded into some of their existing customer base.  So, we see a great opportunity with that relationship that we have, but we see a great opportunity in the equity component that we had and we also see on the ETF side, not only for the existing [Indiscernible] volume, but also potentially upside with some of their other volume as well. Peter Kern : And I would just add Brian, that our goal longer-term is to continue to export more of our technology to power more of our partners, and we think that is our true advantage. And so, as a partner, we hope that we find more ways to help Amex GBT monetize their customers better long-term and serve their customers better. So, we'll be working on. Brian Fitzgerald : Very clear. Thanks, guys. Peter Kern : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Perfect. Our final question comes from Dan Wasiolek of Morningstar. Dan, please proceed. Dan Wasiolek : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just 2. So, on the verbal bookings strength you talked about for summer '22, wondering if you have any comments looking at rate in occupancy, the split between that. And then the second 1, just direct mix maybe how that's been trending and how you see that direct mix evolving with the investments you're making in tech structure Vrbo and loyalty. Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes. I'll take those in reverse then, I think, which is Vrbo has consistently had a very strong direct business. I mentioned our continued investment in brand across the globe really on Vrbo or its sister brands. The -- We mentioned, I think 2 or 3 quarters ago, that we got out of performance marketing for Vrbo in the U.S. and it benefited from that with more direct traffic and having felt the effects of it.  So, I think we feel very good about the direct nature of that business. As far as how the product will continue to improve, how royalty will add to it, again, that's just other veins of opportunity for us across our Expedia customer base, our hotels customer base, etc. So, we want to create that universe of people that want to move between our brands and use them and build value and use that value. So, I think we will continue to see that. As far as rate and occupancy goes, your rates have been ADR has been very strong throughout COVID. There's been a lot of competition for the product and owners and managers know that and they have first price where they could. And so, we've seen a lot of price increases and those have held, there seems to be no abating of those. And likewise, occupancy in those compressed markets.  If you want to be on a beach in the Southeast or on a beach in Hawaii at Christmas, good luck. It's -- can't be done. So, we're going to keep seeing that. I think that's why you're seeing this effect of, okay. I want to get out in front next summer and get the house I want. And that's a great -- that's smart for the consumer and it's great for the business and it gives us a lot of confidence going into next year that this use case will continue to be highly top of mind for many consumers, and we are well-positioned, so. With that, I will thank you. Thanks, Dan. Thanks everybody. I hope you all stay safe. We'll come forward to us in trail will recover and feel free to start their corporate travel now it's safe out there. Thanks for your time. Eric Hart : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to IR Director, Jon Charbonneau. Please go ahead. Jon Charbonneau : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's financial results conference call for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by our CEO, Peter Kern; and our CFO, Eric Hart.  The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, February 10, 2020, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.

And I encourage you to frequently visit our IR website for other important content.  Unless otherwise stated, any references to positive revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you, Jon. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Let me start off with a few broad comments about what we experienced in the fourth quarter, which I would say, even though we had to deal with a meaningful Omicron wave and a bunch of disruption in travel, and of course, that was not great for travelers worldwide, it was encouraging in many ways. And I think what we observed most notably is that the issues that involved were really issues of inconvenience. There were border shutdowns. There were planes out of service because pilots and crew were sick, things of that nature, but there was far less consumer fear over traveling. And really, it was an issue of the inconvenience of the health issues.  What we believe will come from this, presuming the next waves continue in ever lightening way, is that the world has essentially gotten accustomed to the pandemic. It will enter perhaps an endemic stage. And governments and industry, et cetera, will adapt much more easily as the next waves come, and in turn, this will continue to disrupt travel less and less. And certainly, the consumers have remained willing to travel throughout. And with the return of staff to the air and the relief of border issues, we are seeing a solid return to travel. Eric will take us through the numbers and the trends, but suffice it to say that we are pleased to see that bookings have strongly rebounded since opening, anywhere the Omicron has tapped out. And certainly, we're seeing that broadly across our biggest markets.  I've talked before about mix effects, and I won't belabor those, except to say it continues to be real. Certain areas are doing better than other areas, more challenged than other parts; geos -- certain geos are more difficult than others. But in general, we feel good that big cities have not recovered as much yet, and that is a good guide for us. International travel is still yet to return as strongly. That is another good guide for us. So we feel like directionally, the things that are -- will be coming back generally benefit us and we're looking forward to the days of those returns. With that said, I'm not really prone to doing retrospectives, but we are starting to focus much more on the future of our business and what we're going to deliver instead of how we manage COVID day-to-day. And I thought it would be useful perhaps to just reflect on where we've been and where we've taken the company over the last couple of years since we entered COVID.  So first of all, the thing you've all observed and clearly have light is that we've been able to simplify and make the business more efficient. And it's easy to observe and it's important -- obviously, there are more important things to our long-term future, but I'll spend a minute on simplification.  We've been able to use our push for new technology solutions, our push to reorganize the company in a more single-goal fashion. We've optimized third-party spending and tools and many things, and we've become a much more efficient enterprise, in fact, today. And I should mention, as you know, we've also shut down or sold off certain businesses that we believed were noncore.  As a result of that, we're running the company now with roughly 10,000 fewer people than we were at the end of 2019, which is a great credit to the people who are here, who have driven a ton of hard work towards that goal of really running the company in a smarter, more efficient, better way.  So that's been the big push there. And I would say that as we still face challenges of hiring people. We're like all the tech companies, but we have had a great influx of terrific talent. I think that momentum is increasing. And that mix with the great talent we have has really created -- put us in a great position as we move forward. And as we start to move to really being focused on delivery of new tech, new experiences and improving the traveler experience as our core fundamental goal.  But as I say, efficiency is not the story here. Efficiency is a great thing we've been able to achieve, but the real story of our future is about what we're doing to drive the business forward.  So just to break that into a few parts. On the demand front, as you know, we've combined our multiple brands working in silos into one unified house of brands with a singular focus on driving travelers to the right product at the right time. This strategy is built on superior creative, making the brands make sense together, buying together in an efficient way and, of course, using performance marketing along with brand to really drive a more efficient way of bringing travelers into our universe.  We believe we are well on our way to that journey. Hope you enjoy our Super Bowl ads in a few days. I think they're terrific. But it is a unified strategy that's about really delivering end-to-end, a great demand generation strategy that is efficient and we believe can drive better outcomes in the future for us.  We also believe, as you know, that loyalty will play an important role, and we are bringing our loyalty programs together. And that will begin to take shape over the course of the year and I think, pay dividends for years and years to come, and we're excited about that. On the technical front, now this has really been the heart and soul of what we've been working on, which is getting to a singular platform so that we can drive a velocity of innovation for travelers and for our partners and really take travel to the next iteration for the online app-based travel business.  We've been on this journey for a while. We've talked about how we're moving multiple stacks into a single stack. That's more than just like efficiency story or anything else. It's really about building it at a set of micro services with APIs that can be externalized and can more easily be used internally to drive these great outcomes for our travelers and our partners. And when I say travelers, I really mean all travelers because for the first time as we build this out, we will be able to create innovation in our stack that impacts all our travelers, our B2C travelers, our B2B travelers all in the same moment. So when we make an improvement in the checkout path or we make an improvement in the app, all those benefits will enure to the traveler wherever they come from, and it will be able to drive real impact instead of the siloed way we used to have to work our way through it.  So I think it's a really important step for both how we run our business, how much innovation and velocity we can bring to the travelers and partner experience, and frankly, just generally, how we innovate and drive the entire industry forward.  We're really excited about what's coming. It's a big year of delivery for us, but there are amazing things coming, we think, for the traveler, from the discovery elements to the service elements and everything in between. And again, that will enure to the benefit of all travelers in our ecosystem.  And finally, on the B2B side, which is really now an amalgamation of our B2B partners who drive demand and our partners who bring us supply, and more and more, we see that as one universe. We combined those teams into one group that essentially can have a 360 relationship with any partner, and therefore, any partner can benefit not only from selling into our platform, but also taking services out of our platform. And we think that approach is going to be really powerful. We've kept very close to our partners over the pandemic. Obviously, we've kind of shared challenges and opportunities. And we've renewed a lot of deals across lodging, air and car. And most of these deals have come with expanded capabilities where we've delivered more for our partners and we believe help them drive their own businesses to better outcomes.  We're excited about this partnership approach. It's no longer just about supply or just about can we drive them in, it's really about can we make our partners' businesses better, and we're keenly focused on that. So to close, I'll just say we never count COVID out. We've dealt with a fair number of body blows over the last couple of years, but the industry has proven and resilient. I think demand has proven even more resilient, and we expect a significant rebound. And while we're excited to rise the rebound, the important thing for us is really delivery. We have to deliver on all the promises we've made about how we're going to improve the product, traveler experience and how we're going to continue to run an efficient and effective business. And I would just say, ultimately, we believe in the reigniting of travel. We think we're going to play a central role in it. We're not intended to just sit back and ride it. We want to be important in driving the future of the industry. And we believe we can bring that not only to travelers, not only to our own business, but to the entire travel ecosystem, and that as well we will be focused on this year. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric. Eric Hart : Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I too am optimistic around the travel recovery this year. And along with Peter, I'm excited to see us deliver more for travelers and partners.  With that, I'd like to start by providing an update on booking trends. While we witnessed a notable pullback due to Omicron in December, which continued into January, I'm encouraged by the improvement we have seen in recent weeks.  Overall, in the fourth quarter, total gross bookings for all products, net of cancels, were down 25% versus Q4 of 2019, a slight sequential improvement versus third quarter. And when compared to 2019, we have continued to see a mix shift towards lodging, and more specifically Vrbo versus air. Given the continued volatility of the recovery due to Omicron, again this quarter, we are providing monthly detail on our total lodging bookings net of cancels, which includes hotel and Vrbo. For October, it was down 4% versus 2019. It was down 5% in November, 27% down in December, down 11% in January, with trends improving throughout January and with us up versus 2019 in the most recent weeks.  From a geography perspective, this improvement has been driven by the U.S., followed by EMEA, while APAC and LatAm are lagging.  Now on to the P&L. Total revenue was down 17% versus Q4 2019, roughly the same level of decline we saw last quarter. As a reminder, we closed the Egencia deal on November 1. In the quarter, Egencia contributed $29 million in revenue. Note this does not include revenue tied to the 10-year lodging supply agreement our EPS business entered into with GBT.  Revenue margin for the fourth quarter was 13%, down from 16% last quarter, largely due to typical seasonality. On sales and marketing, direct spend in Q4 was roughly $875 million, down 12% versus Q4 2019 levels compared to 19% decline last quarter. As you know, Q1 is a seasonal low point for EBITDA given the timing disconnect between higher marketing expense ahead of summer travel and lower stayed room nights in Q1. And this timing impact could be further amplified this year due to lower sales in Q1 due to Omicron and our spending into the recovery based on the recent improvements in trends we're observing.  Moving on, overhead costs, excluding Egencia, in both periods was up $23 million versus Q3 2021, primarily driven by the lower ability to capitalize labor in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to this year, as we compete for great talent, we anticipate higher-than-normal annual compensation increases, which take effect on April 1.  In total, adjusted EBITDA was $479 million, up $1 million versus 2019 levels despite revenue down 17%. This marked the third consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and our highest Q4 EBITDA ever. And I believe the fourth quarter performance further illustrates how we are running a much more efficient business versus prior to the pandemic.  On to free cash flow, which totaled roughly $142 million in Q4 on a reported basis. Excluding the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by the change in Vrbo's deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was $35 million.  Now shifting to the balance sheet. In 2021, our debt refinancing yielded approximately $80 million in annual interest expense savings, and paying off the full $1.2 billion in preferred stock last year saves us approximately $115 million in annual dividend payments -- payouts. More recently, we informed the holders of our 650 million eurobond last week of our intention to pay off the notes at the beginning of March, which is 3 months ahead of their maturity date. This allows us to save approximately $5 million in net interest expense this year or $19 million annually while also improving our leverage ratios. Overall, we are pleased to have maintained our investment-grade rating through the pandemic and remain committed to deleveraging while also looking for ways to further reduce our cost of capital.  In closing, despite the continued impact of pandemic in 2021 and most recently from Omicron, I'm encouraged by the continued progress made last year to reshape the company to further improve our financial position going forward. As mentioned, I am optimistic about the travel recovery this year and excited to see how this year unfolds for the company. With that, Emily, we are ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : First, I want to ask about the loyalty program. Can you give us more details on when you expect to roll out the consolidated loyalty program, how that might change? And if you can give us a sense of how important your loyalty programs are today and maybe where they could go. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Well, I'll say a couple of things. First, this is an ongoing effort. As recently this quarter, we just revamped our Expedia loyalty program to create a construct that we think is better for travelers and kind of directionally in where we're headed more broadly for a loyalty program. But there is a lot of migration going on. We're migrating the old stack, as I talked about. We're migrating the brand front ends onto one set of rails. And we are rebuilding our loyalty platform to accommodate one broad loyalty construct that can serve all the different brands.  And so the big difference that's coming is really that the loyalty program will cover all our brands, all our products, and you'll be able to earn and burn across all of them, which is a great innovation. All the research shows that it's the most important thing to customers is having the breadth of products. And so we think it's going to be a great win for them. All the details are still being worked out on exactly how that policy and planning will work, although I think the Expedia construct is more or less in line with where we're headed in terms of how points work, et cetera.  But it will take the better part of this year to get all those pieces lined up. And of course, a rollout of the loyalty program, including converting loyalty people over from one to another and adding it to front ends that haven't had it in all of those pieces, it's not just like you flip one switch. It's a switch after switch after switch.  So I think it will take us the better part of this year to be -- really have the product where we want it and be starting to convert everybody over to it. But -- so I think next year will be the big impact here of the whole stickiness and totality of loyalty. But I think it's a big year for us as we build into it. And hopefully, we'll be moving some of the program over that in the course of this year. Kevin Kopelman : And if I could just ask about the latest trends. You noted that lodging is now up in the last week versus 2019. Can you talk about how that might play out given cities haven't fully come back yet and international travel is still certainly not fully back given the restrictions are not up yet? Peter Kern : Yes, sure. Well, I think, look, there's a lot of benefit in that for us in the sense that historically, big cities and international have been an area of strength for us relative to some of what we've seen during COVID like domestic travel into tertiary markets, et cetera, which have been historically weak.  On the other hand, we benefited greatly. Vrbo has been super strong. It's benefited from the leisure travel and the longer-term travel of vacation around, some people liking that during COVID where they can isolate with their families, et cetera. So it's a little tricky to predict. But I would say broadly, the stuff that's left to come in many ways favors our strongest areas. So I think that's positive. But the mixes have been hard to predict over time. And so I don't want to get too -- get too much into prognosticating, but I think we've got some good runway ahead in where the puck is going. Mixed 2 metaphors there. But -- and we feel good about that. You never know what the back-end unintended consequences are, but I think being positive now and with everything that's left to come is making us feel pretty good. Operator : Our next question today comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Naved Khan : Great. Two questions, please. Maybe just one on the comeback in travel. As it continues to build in '22, how do you see the mix of direct versus paid traffic coming to your platform? Can you maybe just touch on the opportunities between the different levers that you have to pull between CRM versus branding versus performance channels?  And then maybe just another one on capital allocation. So you continue to deleverage and also you have kind of gotten preferred out. How do you kind of see the scope for M&A opportunities here and maybe other use of capital, like share buyback? Just maybe talk about that a little bit. Peter Kern : Sure. I'll go first and be able to come back in travel. I think -- I'm glad you mentioned CRM. We have so much opportunity to improve our direct relationship with consumers. We've historically fished out of the big ponds of Google and Meta, et cetera, and brought customers in, and candidly, not done a good enough job in retaining those customers and making it sticky and making sure the experience is good.  We are keenly focused on bringing travelers in now, making sure they enjoy all the benefits of what we have to provide, member pricing, loyalty, et cetera, and that they get a better app experience, better CRM which we are rebuilding like everything else. And we really focus on retaining them and keep them coming back as often as possible directly. It doesn't mean we don't expect to use performance marketing in all the usual channels, but we want to be able to derive much more long-term value from those customers we acquire and then in turn keep. So we hope very greatly that the denominator will be expanding. We'll just be bringing in more travelers, and that more and more of them, we will be able to create direct relationships where they are coming back. They recognize the benefits we give them in price and service, discovery and everything else. Obviously, there's more to come there because as the products improve and the experience improves, it all gets easier and that flywheel presumably turns faster. But that is our focus, and that is what we hope to derive from this. We're not projecting what percentage will be what, but it is very closely tied to all the work we are doing to drive the traveler experience. Eric Hart : Great. And I'll take the second part of the question around capital allocation. I know we've talked about it in previous quarters and I think our message remains the same. We are keenly focused on cleaning up our balance sheet, if you will, given the disruption that we've experienced over the last couple of years. That includes delevering the business. We've talked about the preferreds that we paid off. We've talked about the Eurobond we're paying off, and we're going to continue down the path of delevering which, of course, can take the form of growth in the underlying EBITDA, but also -- and pay down debt as appropriate.  We want to lower the cost of capital as well. In my prepared remarks, I talked about a couple of areas where we are quite significantly reduced the cash flow required to service, whether it's the preferreds or different debt instruments. We're keenly focused on maintaining investment grade and quite proud that we've been able to do that over the last couple of years given the amount of disruption that we've had. And then a slight other lens on that as well is, if Peter's talking about the growth opportunities ahead of us and the opportunity for the company and want to make sure that we are enabling that as best we can so that we can go as fast as we can in achieving that vision.  Specifically on 2 components that you mentioned on M&A. We're always open for business. Even during the heart of COVID, we were open for -- to business to a certain extent, but obviously, that wasn't necessarily the right opportunity or the right time as things coming up, but we are looking at different opportunities opportunistically and a few themes that we're thinking about. And then on buybacks, I think you can look at our long history. It's something that we have done regularly and consistently. I fully suspect that we will get back to that at the right time and something that we will think about over the coming months. But again, we're going to observe COVID. We're going to clean up the balance sheet, if you will, and all the components that I've talked about, that's where we're focused right now. Peter Kern : Yes. And I would just add just to close that one out that on the M&A front, we're much more focused. It has to fit with our long-term strategy, our platform strategy. It has to integrate. We're not going to be just buying things because they're good deals, we're going to buy things that fit our long-term strategy to drive what we're trying to drive if we buy it. Operator : Our next question today comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe just teasing out more on the capital allocation front, but bringing it back to margins. Peter, Eric, can you help frame for us -- I know you've laid out before that you've exited sort of the efficiency program that you laid out from a couple of years ago. And there's obviously investments against your ambition you feel you need to make in '22 and '23 to capture some of that growth.  But how should investors think about elements of where there is leverage driven by volume that can flow through the model over the next 12 to 24 months versus areas where you want to take incremental margin or incremental leverage and invest it back because you're playing sort of the long game over the next 3 to 5 years against the bigger travel opportunity? Just some of the variables that could flex margin leverage one way or another in the next 24 months. Peter Kern : Sure. Thanks, Eric, and I hope you're well as well. We -- the way I think you should think about it is this, we have -- as I mentioned, there's a lot of work still going on in building the platform to getting the platform right. When those things are right, they will drive further efficiencies.  So when you say we've exited the program, it wasn't like a program with a goal that we ended and said we're finished. This is an ongoing drive for us to create the most efficient enterprise we can, which is not about taking people out, it's about being efficient in how we work, what we work on, how technology aids us, et cetera. There are lots of places where, for example, I'll give you one, service. We continue to build the best service technology, I believe, in the industry and scale it consistently. We are building skills across the enterprise, so the customer is getting service their own issues themselves and easily. It's an ongoing process. But the benefit of the efficiency borne of those improvements has not really been seen because COVID has had this enormously elevated service demand on the industry. So as we normalize out to historical propensities for service calls, et cetera, et cetera, there is real benefit down the road on how we do that.  Now you alluded to there are places we are \"investing\" in. I mean that is really just our way of saying we are pushing to drive this innovation and drive us across these bridges as quickly as we can. And if we have -- if we need to invest more in people and resources to drive some of this innovation, we will do it. But the innovation in and of itself will drive incremental efficiency.  So I don't think this is a long-term like -- this is a long-term sideways to down -- or I should say, expanding margin story, we believe, driven by the technical efficiencies that the product will drive. And if there's some bumps in the road as we get there, we have to flex up to drive on innovation faster, we may do that because we think it's the right thing for the traveler and for our partners. But overall, there's still much more opportunity to become more efficient over time for margins to expand, and we believe that's what we will continue to drive towards. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Lloyd Walmsley : Two questions, if I can. First, any update on just the marketing integration consolidating data and ops into a unified group, like any early learnings there? And then secondly, can you kind of help us parse out the strong ADR growth? Like how much of that is a function of HomeAway growing in the mix? And I guess, more importantly, like what are the puts and takes of how you see ADRs migrating over the course of the year? Like is this still a big tailwind because like-for-like channel pricing is going up? Or there's like a shift back to core hotel to offset that? Like how do we think about ADRs over the course of the year? Peter Kern : Thanks, Lloyd. I'll take the first part. And by the way, watch the Vrbo ad this weekend. So you start saying Vrbo instead of HomeAway. But the -- on the marketing integration, we've made a lot of progress in moving along on the marketing integration and the data and analytics and measurement, et cetera. I'd say we're virtually all the way there, not quite all the way there, and the learnings have been coming.  Eric and I see reports weekly about where we're winning, where we're learning things where we're testing things. There's no silver bullet, like \"Oh, we found this, and it's going to win everything.\" It's really a game of 1,000 different wheel tests across 100 geos across 5 product groups, et cetera, et cetera.  So all of it is incrementally getting there. We're feeling quite positive about a number of things we've been testing and learning. We'll push heavily into mobile and other areas where we found the opportunity. We're pushing into new products, in social products and other things where we found opportunity that is sort of tantamount to performance marketing in certain ways. So there's a lot of interesting learnings going.  The reality is until things normalize, it's going to be really hard to measure us on this because you can't see what normal is anymore. And even for us, it's hard to see what normal is. And a lot of these new tests, new algorithms are learning on these very volatile traffic patterns because of COVID, et cetera.  So I think we feel good about the technical progress the teams are making about the way they've plotted out their course of learning and testing. And there's no question it will inure to our benefit. But being able to identify a single thing or a single win or how to quantify it is really hard to do at this moment. So I think you have to wait for the collective good to roll through our P&L, and hopefully, you'll see it as things normalize. Eric Hart : And on the ADR side, I'll give a sense for a look back and then a look forward. Obviously, I won't go into the details, but to help you frame it. When you think about the historic -- core ADRs, they continue to be strong across both hotel and Vrbo. I think you can see that across some of the other industry companies or metrics. And then our mix, in particular, has benefited from more weighting to the U.S., more weighting to Vrbo, more weighting to vacation destinations where there typically are higher ADRs. So our high ADR performance, if you will, is a mix of both core ADRs and the mix that we've had over the last quarter and prior to that as well.  Moving forward, we do expect core ADRs to remain strong. We think this is going to be a strong rebound travel year. We obviously have lots of bookings already going into the summer period where we can see the ADRs are holding up quite well. And -- but I do think you need to look at when you look at the -- take the core into the projection of our business. Presuming some of our other areas of our business come back, it's still going to be a mix. We're going to go into some primary markets that have some higher ADRs. We're also going to mix into Europe a bit more, particularly APAC when it starts rebounding, LatAm, so on and so forth, more in the hotel and presumably Vrbo, not predicting any degradation in Vrbo but just from a mix perspective. And so as you project that ADR for us, I expect that will normalize to a certain extent over time. But again, it's on the back of 4 underlying strong medias. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Justin Post : Great. First question, can you help us at all with summer booking pacings, whether lodging or in total, versus either '19 or last year?  And then second, I don't know if you can help us at all, but just thinking about Vrbo as a percent of the total. I imagine it's grown a lot over the last couple of years. But if you could help us think about where that could be today. Peter Kern : Yes, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question, Justin. So Vrbo continues to perform well overall. We see strength against 2019. We see strength against 2021. Obviously, I'm not going to go into the specific details of those, but the brand and the product category are both doing quite well.  When you asked about summer bookings or pacing, we're seeing ourselves up against both of those time periods that I just mentioned, both 2019 and 2021. So it's not only that the category is slowing up, but I think it continues to win share, if you will, in this market.  Hotel on the other side is recovering. It's not quite at the levels that we would have seen in the past. We suspect if the recovery continues that there'll be a catch-up somewhere along the line, we don't know. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Just a couple of ones. Can you talk about the hiring plans and head count levels for 2022? Do you feel like you're in a good position with respect to head count right now and generally well prepared for demand recovery across various products? Are there also any notable wage inflationary trends that you're seeing currently?  And then second question on variable marketing efficiencies on the direct marketing side, can you help us maybe in a qualitative way to kind of understand how much efficiencies you're seeing on the direct marketing side because of all the brand rationalization efforts and things you have done in the last couple of years? It's kind of easy to see the fixed cost savings. But given the moving pieces of the business, particularly due to geographical mix and product mix, it's a little bit kind of tricky to see the direct marketing efficiencies that you're seeing. So maybe you can qualitative to touch on that, that would be great. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Deepak. I'm glad you find it tricky, too. We also do given everything that's moving around. And as I mentioned, it's one of the challenges in trying to quantify for you or anyone or ourselves exactly how much progress we've made in terms of marketing efficiencies because the traffic patterns are so volatile, mix is so different, et cetera.  I mean you just take something like air as an example, the air market has changed considerably. It's largely domestic, very relatively international. We've historically been strong in international. We've improved how we're approaching it, as you say, across our brands. We've consolidated spend. We've learned a lot about the multi-brand approach, but it hasn't really paid off yet in, for example, international air because there's just not much of it.  So the short answer is, we made a huge amount of progress as I said, in terms of tools, in terms of data, in terms of insights, in terms of being able to test and learn across a much broader swath of our enterprise. But being able to quantify really how much better it is in basis points or something that would give you a projectable marketing efficiency is still very challenging.  We believe it's much better. We believe we are in a much better positioned to capitalize on the future state of normalcy. But there's no question the tools and the capabilities are in a much better place, but we have to pay that off and demonstrate it to the world and ourselves. And it's in process, but it's going. So I think we feel very good, but we acknowledge it's difficult for you all to see it. And we're just going to have to wait for things to normalize, so you can see the benefit. Eric Hart : And I'll take -- thanks for the question, Deepak. I'll take the first part on the hiring plan. And I'm going to expand your question so just more overall from an overhead perspective and just perhaps help a bit on some of the moving parts as you look into next year and to help you model it out. I think first off, in Q4, we were a bit lighter on expected people costs. We do have plans to continue hiring around some of our initiatives as we go into next year we want to if -- do recall that we had 1 month of Egencia in Q4. So that was something that you would want to model out, which I discussed in my remarks.  Our T&E discretionary, et cetera, continues to be lower than once we start getting back into normal business travel in whatever form or shape that takes, et cetera, going forward.  On your question on wage inflation, as I mentioned earlier, I do expect that we will have higher-than-expected compensation increases this year. And again, as a reminder, this will go in on April 1.  And as we talked about on previous calls, there are some investments that we are making in the business. We are excited about a number of different opportunities to accelerate the growth in a number of different areas. Of course, we're being prudent, very positive ROI, going to track those relentlessly along the way, but that could increase to a certain extent as well. Hopefully, that helps you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Okay. So I think it's been some time since we've seen these types of metrics, but anything you can share in terms of what percent of the Vrbo inventory has now been integrated into Brand Expedia and the other outlets? I mean, ultimately, you want to present the traveler with more choice and improve the overall shopping experience. I think the last time we talked about this, you guys are still kind of in the experimental phase and trying to see how much of a better shopping experience you could drive. But sort of any sort of perspective on that would be helpful. Peter Kern : Yes, sure. Thanks, Stephen. I would say we are still building to it. It is a core part of our plan. And by the way, it's not simply so that we can provide it to our own travelers. It's also so that we can provide it to our B2B partners so that they can provide it to their travelers. So it's a quite interesting and substantial opportunity, we believe.  We do have it integrated. It's not a great integration, but we do have it integrated into Expedia and Hotels.com. The issue has been, it only works among other things, not being a great product experience is what -- the main thing we have to fix. But also, it does not have an approach that works for the properties that you have to reserve and then we have to -- they're not instant, the ones where we have to go to the owners and see if they are located for the booking. That is a construct. That is not part of what is currently possible in the Expedia brand or the Hotels.com brand, et cetera.  So it's kind of a 2-part thing. One is we want to improve the product experience for the traveler and make it a better integration, make it easier to book, make the content more usable, easier to understand, so the travelers can make the decisions. And then we want to expand the universe of the type of properties that can be available through those pipes. And that is where the big -- where another big expansion and the idea comes.  Those are both in the works. They will take some time. I would say they're not our highest priority, but they're far from our lowest priority. They're big, important thing. We have teams working on it, and we will -- we expect to continue to see improvement.  We have a lot happening on the front end of the product this year in terms of integrating a number of our brands to the same front-end rails and a lot of opportunity to improve those experiences and roll out a new construct, et cetera. So all of those -- you have to obviously, I don't know, operations question, but as those things roll out, this experience will get better and better, and we believe will become a bigger feature of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Mario Lu from Barclays. Mario Lu : First one on cancellation rates. I believe the lodging numbers you provided earlier was [indiscernible]. So I was just curious, was it much higher in 4Q and early in 1Q due to Omicron? And if so, do you think those that cancel could potentially be a tailwind to future bookings? Eric Hart : On cancellation rates, as you read more in the newspaper, generally, the cancellation rates go up. So yes, we saw cancellation rates go up and particularly in the December time period and the early part of January when Omicron was impacting the business as some people didn't necessarily feel safe and comfortable traveling, and we certainly saw cancellations increase.  If I extend to a longer period of time, obviously, if you go back to 2020, cancellation rates went up exceedingly. They were coming down over time, still elevated relative to historical levels. Just safety concerns people come down with COVID individually and can't travel, whatever else, again, saw it spike up in December and then coming back down again. Following a similar path to what I was just mentioning on the [indiscernible].  On the tail end of future bookings, I think you're asking the level of pent-up demand or how many people would postpone, will they rebook if they cancel. I think that's hard to tell. But I would say, just generally speaking, I think everyone feels in a similar way, which is when people can travel, they are going to travel and they're going to travel quite consistently throughout the year if they're able to do so, maybe more than they have in the past. So rebook, if you will, but only time will tell. But I would say we're certainly optimistic. Mario Lu : Great. And then just second question in terms of remote work and longer duration stay, the lodging side of business. Have you guys seen that kind of drive bookings already at Vrbo or even the core business? And then how long is the opportunity do you think that is in the long term? Peter Kern : Yes. This hasn't been a big theme for us. You've probably noticed on our call. I know some others have a different view of that. It's an interesting thesis and certainly as people have more flexibility to travel, we hope they fill up their flexible time with travel. In terms of Vrbo, we haven't quite seen the distortion. We've heard others talk about in terms of long stays or things like that. It's moved somewhat, but it's not as noticeable for us. And I think it's an interesting and good potential tailwind if people have more time to travel. But we'll see when people get back to work. We'll see when schools back in, et cetera, how much flexibility everybody gets.  We don't think it matters. We think there's tons of pent-up demand, as Eric says. And if there's more days to be away, terrific. That will be good for us. And I think that will be selective, but a good general trend on some portion of society, and we're looking forward to that. Operator : Our next question comes from James Lee from Mizuho. James Lee : Great. So it looks like everybody is expecting normalized travel trends with the mix shift to urban and international markets. And Peter, I was hoping you could comment on this. If home accommodation continues to gain traction in urban markets, how do you feel about your supply in Vrbo? Any plans to increase ahead of demand?  And I guess my second question relating to maybe additional levers in improving efficiency. I know you guys may have talked about this in the past. Will you consider consolidating all your hotel brands under Expedia? Peter Kern : Thanks, James. Appreciate the questions. I think on the first question, which is supply in major cities for Vrbo, it's never been a great strategy of ours. It's never been a huge focus of ours. We do have some in some big international cities. Again, I think much less for the one-night stay kind of thing and much more for the family vacation, that sort of thing. We think there's opportunity there, and we will continue to follow the demand trends. And as I've mentioned, we've been focused on not just sort of buying supply across the universe in everything and really being much more targeted and where the demand is and where we can get return for the homeowner. So we'll continue to do that.  But Vrbo is not in the same way like some of the other choices focused on being a replacement for hotels in cities. We have a lot of great hotel partners in all the major cities of the world, and we see them coming back more strongly, and we think that's where the business is going to be for now. Of course, we want to continue to expand Vrbo wherever it makes sense and that we'll certainly look at cities where it makes sense.  As far as the brands, I would say this, it's on the brand team to figure out the best way to consolidate the brands in a construct that makes sense for the traveler. This isn't a construct that makes sense for us or we think it's cool, it's about what makes sense to travelers and why and how they need different products to do certain things. If over time, we conclude that we need fewer brands. I'm not sure it will be all under one, but we may conclude we need fewer more certainly, that we're going to lean into fewer, if that makes sense, we will do that. But that's what the brand team is working on now.  We've got new brand propositions for all our major brands rolling out soon. And I think over time, we will figure out what is right for the traveler. And certainly, as we integrate our loyalty programs, it is going to bring the brands much closer together and put us in a much more simplified position to decide whether fewer makes sense, et cetera, and have everybody still caught up in our web of loyalty and all the good things and good products we bring to the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer & Co. Jed Kelly : Great. Nice work over the last 20 months. Just 2 questions, if I may. Just how should we view Expedia relative to the Google risk going into '22, which is looking like a nice demand environment relative to 2019?  And then Peter, you talked about you really can see nice margin expansion longer term for Expedia. Do you have like a long-term margin target you guys are kind of shooting for above 25%, 30%? Can you help us there as well? Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Jed. Those numbers sound pretty good. But I would say this, we don't have a number. And that is because, candidly, we are getting smarter about what is possible as we continue to roll out unified technology, unified solutions. We don't yet know the quantum of benefit that you get in conversion and other things that allow you to be more efficient on the marketing side because the product is working better.  There's a lot to learn. I mean I know you all look at the competition and try to reference that. But I think, look, we believe all of these pieces add up to benefits that drive more growth and higher margins. And that's what we're focused on. So as the product improves, as the underlying technology platform improves, as that serves more partners, et cetera, all of those things get better and scale brings efficiency.  So I think we're just going to continue to drive it. It's in our core now to continue to drive it. And I hope those numbers are achievable. And when we get there, we get there. So I don't think it's about putting some random number that we're guessing at what's possible out there. I think we're just driving it as we can.  As far as the Google risk goes, I don't -- maybe I'm saying, but I don't consider it a Google risk. Google is Google. We operate in that market. We do everything we can to optimize that market. And we work closely with them to try to figure out better ways to optimize that market. And we have some interesting ideas percolating at the moment. But ultimately, as I alluded to, when we pull all those people out of the Google market, we have not done a sufficiently good job of retaining those travelers as long-term customers. And that's on us because of the products, because of competitive issues -- because of all kinds of things. And we are literally addressing all of those things at once.  I believe that each of them multiply each other make us collectively stickier between a better product and better loyalty and broader loyalty and better marketing that helps their traveler understand the benefits we provide and getting them to enjoy the benefits we provide more readily, et cetera. So I think we believe that Google can stay Google. I always say Google is a shark. You should expect the shark to be a shark. It will keep doing what it does. We operate in their marketplace, and we have to do our part of optimizing the marketplace. We have a lot of room to do better, and that's what we're focused on. And I'm pretty sure they don't want to be in a business of taking service calls and dealing with travelers and actually being a customer company. They just want to be a search engine. So I think we're in a pretty good spot. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Thomas Champion : Peter and Eric, I was wondering if I could ask a question around the new customer cohorts. And I'm just curious whether they resemble pre-pandemic behavior or if you're seeing any new or divergent trends out of your newer customers. And then maybe Eric, for you to ask question around margins. It looks to me like 4Q margins were up 300 basis points, give or take, over 2019. I'm just wondering if that's a good guidance for thinking about the margin potential for the next couple of quarters, kind of the near-term outlook. Any thoughts around there would be really helpful. Peter Kern : Tom, it's Peter. I'll go first. In terms of cohorts, again, I think it would be a mistake to draw too much from anything that's going on right now. As I mentioned, patterns are much different, the volatilities and ebb and flow of cancellations and other things are much different. What we're more keenly focused on is looking at cohorts in terms of engagement with the app, how that changes as we make improvements in the product, et cetera. I think there, we're seeing the directional things we hope to see. We have a lot, a lot, a lot more to deliver. So it's early days, but our focus is really on that.  I don't think we've seen any new patterns that are either alarmingly good or bad in terms of how travelers act, how many of them go on to the Google and Meta world versus come direct. I mean, direct -- most travel companies benefited from mix to direct, but that was only because there was less demand in the open seas. I think as demand continues to rise, there's not really any reason to imagine that, that will be greatly distorted except for the example, we do a good job of, again, getting travelers to the app, getting them locked into our ecosystem, getting them understanding the benefits. So that's what we're focused on. And I think anything else, frankly, to -- it'd be wrong to draw any conclusions based on the volatile times we've been in. So we'll see as things normalize, but we'll let you know if we see that. Eric Hart : Great. Tom, thanks for the question on the margin side. I'm not going to go into specifics on the number of bps in 1 quarter versus another. But of course, we are pleased to see Q4 2021 standpoint, the margins that we did have relative to the volume where we were down 17% from a revenue standpoint and then from 2019 EBITDA numbers, so pleased from that perspective.  I guess a few things that I would urge you to consider is, one, if there is significant seasonality in the business. So you have to look at Q1 versus Q2, 3 and 4 and if there's a significant different curve from a booked and stayed basis. Booked is obviously driven by marketing and net expense; and then the stayed basis, where the revenue comes from lodging perspective. So just make sure that you're keenly aware of that seasonality. Gave some information earlier around overhead and various components that you can model into the business as well.  And then 2 other quick comments is on the margin, we are going to be aggressive from a marketing spend perspective, as we talked many times in this call already. We are optimistic about this year in the return of travel, presuming nothing else comes out of left field, if you will. And we're going to be aggressive, and we're going to spend into that recovery.  And then lastly, I know we touched on it a little bit earlier. But just from a variable cost perspective, we have -- every time there's one of these disruptions, their long duration of calls with customers with complex issues to sort through and a real cost savings associated with variable costs really can't be seen yet. We are increasingly using technology to solve customer traveler problems, more consistently using that technology. And that's being clouded a bit because of those more challenging call volumes. And so I suspect that we'll see some of those savings come in as we get to a more normal period. So hopefully, that helps you with the modeling. Operator : Our final question today comes from Richard Clarke from Sanford C. Bernstein. Richard Clarke : So just a question running into the summer. I guess coming out of the financial crisis '09, the Expedia and the other players probably benefited from a prolonged recovery, maybe too much supply relative to demand. If this summer is very, very strong and we have a lot of demand relative to supply, do you see any danger the hotels or your private rentals play the platforms off against each other a little bit or look to other channels?  And then second question, a little bit more simple. But in Q3, I think you talked about your marketing costs being quite high because of the Delta variant coming very late in the quarter. You could sort of say the same pattern happened here. Omicron came quite late in the quarter. So does that distorted the marketing spend in the quarter at all with committed spend earlier on? Peter Kern : I'll take the first one, and then Eric can cover the marketing costs. Thanks for the question, Richard. I would say you could have made the same argument during COVID when there was compressed demand in a number of places. We did not see what you're alluding to in terms of suppliers playing off. I think, as I said, we have a common challenge. We're all working together for every hotel in Miami, there's another one in New York that was suffering and many big chains, et cetera, hundreds of hotels across good and bad markets. And I think we're all in it together.  As I said in my beginning remarks, we're in it to try to help them optimize their business as much as optimizing ours. And I think there is definitely a shared sense of we can all build this better together.  So I think there will be a lot of demand if there will be some compressed places. I think there will be enough places to go that the demand will find an outlet. And I think we provide unique services in terms of people being able to find things, discover where they want to go, find alternatives, et cetera, and provide a great value for our supply partners, including the many things we do for them beyond just allowing them to supply on our platform or with the partners in demand generation of other products or technology, et cetera. So I think it's my sincere hope that our supply partnerships or our partnerships more generally are going to get bigger and broader and more beneficial to both sides over time.  And this isn't going to be the classical site for who's got a little leverage for the last nickel on a given day. So I don't think we'll see that. I think we'll see everybody trying to benefit from the upward trend and riding it together. And some of our partners will get their direct traffic. We'll get our direct traffic and everybody will do the best they can with those travelers. So that's what I expect. Eric Hart : And then, Richard, on the second part of your question on marketing costs, we did see a similar dynamic this quarter as well, just given the Omicron impact, towards the latter end of the quarter, end of December perhaps to a lesser extent, but again, a similar dynamic. And I would split it again into 2 components. The first is around performance marketing. Those are fine-tuned machines that ultimately are driven by the underlying search demand and whether that's across Meta channels, Google or wherever else. And so as people stopped searching for traffic and/or booking traffic, then the number of clicks and associated marketing expense naturally comes down with it.  On the brand marketing side, we stated, of course, in Q4 through -- all the way through December, so you are likely aware, brand marketing spend becomes much more fixed as you get closer to the time of being deployed. And then secondly is we had a hypothesis is that for each variant that comes along, the impact is going to be shorter, and it's going to be shallower. And that's ultimately what we have seen with Omicron is that we effectively were impacted for approximately a month, maybe a little bit more than that where it was more like 2, 2.5 months with the Delta variant.  So we felt that we should continue to invest in performance as it was there, we would go after the demand and we stay the course on marketing. Operator : Those are all the questions we have time for today. So I'll now hand back to the management team for any concluding comments. Peter Kern : I guess I'll just say thank you for joining us. I hope you all travel this summer, and you know where to find us if you need to travel, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call. Please disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to our IR Director, Jon Charbonneau. Please go ahead. Sorry about that. Jon Charbonneau : Great. Good afternoon and welcome to Expedia Group\u2019s financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by our CEO, Peter Kern; and our CFO, Eric Hart. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management\u2019s view as of today, May 2, 2022 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today\u2019s call are forward-looking typically preceded by words such as we plan, we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that or similar statements. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and the company\u2019s filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company\u2019s Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to consistently visit our IR website for other important information. Unless otherwise stated, any reference to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you, Jon. Good afternoon, everybody and apologies in advance. Eric and I are both recovering from cold. So, our voices may not be as loud as normal, but we will do our best and please ask for clarification on anything you can\u2019t hear. Let me start by saying we were pleased with the quarter. We continue to see strong demand coming back. We continue to see efficiencies in the business. And in general, it pretty much had the shape we expected, which is to say that we had \u2013 we went into the quarter with Omicron looming. Last quarter, we mentioned that we expected that to have some impact early in the quarter, which it did. But very \u2013 we are very pleased that demand came back post-Omicron and Omicron hasn\u2019t lived up to sort of our expectations, which were \u2013 that it would be the shortest wave. It would be the least impactful. And I think as we now go into BA2 and other things we are seeing, it\u2019s really hard to even detect the blips anymore. So that\u2019s great to see. We also then were hit with the war in Ukraine, which did have some impact on the EMEA markets. But again, the market \u2013 the consumers seem to absorb that information and now EMEA is back to its highest levels since COVID hit. So again, we have seen these impacts. But in each case, a recovery that seems too strong to be held down. So, the recovery has been strong. And nicely, we have seen it beyond just domestic travel, which of course have been the bright spot for a long time during COVID. We are now starting to see city business pickup, business travel pickup, international travel vectors pickup. So \u2013 and I would say, broadly, while some geography lag, all geographies are, in general, growing and returning. So despite the usual caveats for COVID, now a rising inflation to worry about and of course, the geopolitical situation, the pent-up demand that\u2019s out there for travel seems to be outweighing anything the market can throw at it and we continue to be feeling very good about a summer recovery that should be very robust. And as I have said before, we have been spending into that recovery, particularly with an eye towards driving long-term customer engagement, buying the right customers, having the right mix of marketing to attract direct and long-term valuable customers. So, with an eye towards lifetime value, we are investing into that strong recovery and we will continue to do so. As an example, our teams have done a great job of driving Vrbo and app downloads. Vrbo, according to our third-party data from a company called Sensor Tower, was the number one downloaded app in North America in the first quarter of the year and that\u2019s a place where we have had emphasis. Obviously, our emphasis will change through the year and we will push into our other brands as well. But app particularly is a place where we feel like there is a lot of long-term customer value. We are improving that product dramatically and we think that\u2019s a great place to put capital right now. Importantly, our direct-to-consumer business, known part of the business and we have our big EXPLORE event coming up over the next few days in Las Vegas, where I am right now and I am pleased to say it is packed and the business seems to be booming at the hotels. But that event is with our business partners, all our supply partners as well as many partners with whom we drive demand. And I have talked about this a little bit before, but we have a thriving B2B business. I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time on it, but this is the week where we will now come out and display all the work we have done to re-imagine the future of our business and our place in the travel ecosystem and what we have been doing for the last 2 years. So we are going to share that with our partners with general focus on overall traveler experience, how we are rethinking our marketplace and how our platform technology will not only drive our B2C business, but will enable our partners to do much more with their own businesses. And even though I haven\u2019t spent a ton of time talking about, I just want to reframe that our B2B business is a terrific business was before COVID remains a strong business and we have made a lot of progress during the time of COVID to continue to expand that business, including one example, which is optimized distribution, which I think I have touched on before, but this is a product that we started in partnership with Marriott. We now just had IHG joined this year, so two of the largest global hoteliers in the world as well as many others, testing on it. And what it does essentially is it cleans up the wholesale business for these partners. So, wholesale rates have been a huge issue in the meta universe. They get bled out into the world and then find their way back into meta and they end up hurting hotel companies, because there are prices out there that are under the brand.com prices. We created technology to vote this and basically help our partners get the same B2B business and more in the wholesale markets, but do it in a way where their prices would be protected and they have \u2013 and they make sure they weren\u2019t undercut by their own prices out in the world. So, it\u2019s been a hugely successful program for Marriott, now IHG. Again, we hope many more partners will take advantage of the technology. But that\u2019s just one example of the many things we are working on, talked about externalizing our technology before. We have had a white label template in a lot of ways where our partners can sell other products. We have airlines with whom we power packages and hotel packs. We recently added Delta to power their car path. We have expanded our offline travel agent business and our share of wallet with our API partners. So, it\u2019s a great business. We see expansion for it. And as we will talk about a lot more this week at EXPLORE, we have a lot more ways we think to help our partners and expand the addressable market there. So as we move into that, we will continue to accelerate innovation in our platform and that innovation will drive not only our B2C business, but also our B2B business. And that\u2019s why we are so excited about how we are rebuilding our platform. But all-in, we expect \u201822 to show continued recovery. We expect a robust summer. We expect to continue to drive efficiencies through the business. And the real work this year is on delivery, on delivering on the brand work we have done, which looks great so far. We are rolling out new Hotels.com brand work right now and I think the brands teams have done remarkable work. We have got a lot of new product innovation coming this year and we are doing a ton of work on the back-end platform. So, all of those things will be rolling out this year and will have some impact on this year, but really the impact is much longer term and we see great things ahead as those products all get delivered. So with that, I hope all of you to join us at EXPLORE. It\u2019s going to be a great event. Our team has worked their efforts off to put on an amazing event for close to 3,000 partners who are here. And if you can\u2019t make it, I invite you to watch the streaming and it should be really exciting. And it\u2019s a chance for us to really display the work our teams have been working on for the last 2 years and all the pains taking time and effort they have put into changing our direction for the future. So with that, I will leave it to Eric. Eric Hart : Great. Thanks, Peter and thanks, everyone for joining the call as well. While the first quarter did have some volatility, travel demand has proven resilient and I remain optimistic around server travel, as Peter mentioned as well. And with that, I\u2019d like to start by reminding everyone, this is the first quarter without any direct contribution from the Egencia business. As a reminder, we completed the sale of Egencia to AmEx GBT on November 1 and our EPS business entered into a 10-year lodging supply agreement with AmEx GBT. I will provide certain growth rates, excluding Egencia, which also excludes any contribution from the AmEx GBT deal in the first quarter. These pro forma numbers are intended and included to give you more visibility into the recovery or recovery and also our financial performance. Shifting now to bookings, overall, for the first quarter, total bookings for all products net of cancels, were down 17% versus first quarter 2019 or down 11%, excluding Egencia. This was a sequential improvement versus the down 25% we saw last quarter. Vrbo performed well during the quarter and continued above 2019 levels and our hotel business is rebounding with city and international travel coming back. While ARS still lagged lodging in the recovery, we saw improvement throughout the first quarter, which held in April. Again, this quarter, we are going to provide more details into our monthly booking trends. Our total lodging bookings, net of cancels, which includes Hotel and Vrbo, was down 11% in January versus 2019, up 8% in February, up 7% in March, and up approximately 10% in April. Now on to the P&L. Total revenue was down approximately 14% versus first quarter 2019 or down 10%, excluding Egencia, a slight improvement versus the 17% decline we saw last quarter. On sales and marketing, direct spend in the first quarter was roughly $1.2 billion, down 6% versus first quarter 2019 levels compared to the 12% decline last quarter. As we have mentioned and as Peter mentioned a few minutes ago, we will continue to spend into the recovery into Q2. Moving on, overhead costs, excluding Egencia, were up approximately $13 million versus fourth quarter 2021. Looking ahead, we expect a higher than normal annual compensation increases discussed last quarter, which took effect on April 1 will result in a notable sequential step up in the overhead cost in Q2. In total, adjusted EBITDA of $173 million roughly flat versus 2019 levels despite revenue still down 14%. Excluding Egencia, adjusted EBITDA grew by 14%, which suggests we are much more fully recovered than you can see from our reported numbers. On free cash flow \u2013 excuse me, totaled roughly $2.8 billion in the first quarter on a reported basis. Excluding the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by the change in Vrbo\u2019s deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately $1.9 billion. In terms of the balance sheet, we are committed to our investment grade rating, reducing leverage and further reducing our cost of capital. We continue to take important steps toward this and as announced last quarter in March, we completed the early redemption of our $650 million Eurobond. This follows the full repayment of our preferred stock last year. And in total, we have repaid over $1.9 billion in debt since last May. And if current trends continue, we will actively look to further reduce leverage moving forward. Recently, we also entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which was a real positive outcome for the company. When compared to the old credit facility, it added $500 million of liquidity to the balance sheet and removed many of the restrictions we have been operating under during the pandemic. Overall, I am pleased with the financial performance in the first quarter and remain quite optimistic about the recovery heading into the summer travel season. And with that, we are ready with our \u2013 for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. I hope you both feel better from being under the weather. Maybe two on the marketing side of the equation. Longer term, you guys are moving towards trying to align marketing dollars towards more brand, more direct-to-consumer. Can you give us an update on the progression you are making there beyond just the summer travel season in \u201822 and how to align those marketing dollars, where you want for the longer term? That would be number one. And number two, when you see things like the mobile app side of the business continue to take off, how much increased confidence you have in being able to mine the element of activity we are seeing ahead of summer \u201822 to again create higher ROI loops in \u201823 and beyond? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Eric. I will take the first one first, which is, yes, we are \u2013 we believe we can drive over time more efficient return on our marketing dollars. And we do believe that places like brand and app present real opportunities. But the main idea is that we are trying to find and mine the best means of long-term return. I think we and the industry has been very transactionally focused and we haven\u2019t been great historically at measuring lifetime value and the different value of different customers coming in through different channels. We are getting much better at that and finer at that and we will look to build the long-term high value customer base that has the repeat characteristics and the high lifetime value that we want to drive as opposed to just chasing transactions and hoping the rest takes care of itself. So, I think that\u2019s really the change. So, many of these areas offer opportunity, I mean, brand, we have always spent a lot on brand, but I would argue not always with the best creative, not always with the greatest impact, not always with a clear message. We are getting much, much better at that as the people we have added are driving great, great product there. And likewise, we have to improve the product, which goes to your second question, which is the higher ROI is really about not only bringing people in through the right channels, but it\u2019s also having the right engaging products. So, all the work we are putting in to create a new app, which basically will be largely new over the course of this year and a number of other things we are doing to engage travelers. We are announcing a couple of new product features coming out this week at our event. So we are trying to create much higher engagement. Obviously, we would prefer it be through the app, all things being equal and then we can drive all those other channels, we will spend the money where we think we are getting the greatest return and we are driving those people into the right products. So, it\u2019s hard to say where it\u2019s going to balance out. I would say, until we get to more normalized times, it\u2019s really hard to get a perfect read as compared to history in terms of percentages spent on X or Y or Z. But I would say our mindset is that we are looking for those veins, including app and many other things, where we believe we are driving the long-term customer \u2013 the type of customers and acquiring the type of customers that drive long-term value into business. That\u2019s our approach. Eric Hart : Yes. Just to add \u2013 this is Eric speaking, just around Peter mentioned the concept of our \u2013 the improved quality and performance on the brand spend side, there is also that \u2013 with a clear value proposition, a product that delivers against it and then the third prong that I would add to it as well is around our loyalty program. We previously announced that we will be launching that loyalty program. And these components then come together because ultimately we can acquire customers, give them a great experience, reward them for building a relationship with them, and then create an ongoing dialogue with the loyalty program. So that\u2019s obviously some of those components are still in development and relaunch, but that\u2019s another component that we move forward that we are excited about. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thank you for your question. Operator : Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Please proceed. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two, if I can. First, just sticking on the marketing theme, what is the, I guess, the latest update on the effort to consolidate on the marketing data and operations? Are you finished the operational part of that effort? And any further clarity around the opportunity to drive better marketing returns at some point from just a more coordinated effort across brands? And then second one, you talked about the cost step up in overhead, you guys have flagged that last quarter as well. But can you help us understand how to think about that kind of fixed cost inflation rate? What is that on a kind of annualized basis and how does it flow into the P&L in 2Q and for the rest of the year? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Lloyd. I will take the first one and Eric can take a crack at the second one. On the consolidation, we are a long way along in actually bringing together the data ops, algos and everything that goes to drive performance marketing. There is a long tail, obviously, because we are in lots of geos and lots of places that aren\u2019t terribly impactful economically. But over time, we want to get much better in. So I would say we are a long way through that. As I mentioned before, getting that operationally right is great. Now, we have to test a lot of things to get the benefits you are referring to, which is how do we optimize for multi-brand, how do we optimize in different geos, etcetera. But the big heavy risk, I would say on the 80/20 rule, we are probably \u2013 we have gotten the big stuff. And now, it\u2019s really about moving those tests through, as I just mentioned, finding these new veins, testing all these new veins, that\u2019s the critical work. And right now, we are seeing a lot of demand and we want to drive growth, not just to like historic levels with better margins, but higher growing levels with better margins, too. So we want to invest into growth. And if we see the opportunities with the right returns, we will do that. So I think I think we can drive better returns and better growth, and that\u2019s the goal. Again, the shape of the curve may change a little bit as we invest into these high-value lifetime value veins of opportunity. But we have the operational side, I think, a long way along. It\u2019s not perfect yet, but it\u2019s a long way there. And now it\u2019s just about testing everything and getting sharper on the readouts. And of course, these are not exactly normalized times yet. So some of the data is still \u2013 there are places in the world where we can\u2019t test yet because the recovery is not sufficient and so forth. So it will take us some time, but I think the big part of it is behind us. Eric Hart : Well, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll take the second part of it. No worries, Peter. I\u2019ll take the second part of it. Thanks again for the question. So again, we\u2019re not going to get into any specifics on what will necessarily flow through, but hopefully, a couple of framing will help you as we move forward. Just the first one is around the annual wage increase, again, just as a reminder, that is coming into or went into effect on April 1. So that will impact the second quarter. What I would do is I would go back and look at previous increases that you\u2019ve seen us flow through in similar time lines in the past. And as we mentioned, there is a step up wage increases relative to prior years. So in effect, I would go and look at what that step up was, gross it up, if you will, and then take that throughout the year. And then secondly, we talked about this a bit last quarter as well, which is our high was in Q4 slower than we anticipated and would have liked. We did see some positive momentum in hiring in the first quarter and project that on in 2022 as well. So from an overhead perspective, I suspect that there will be some increases as we go through the year as we want to invest in our technology platform products and other areas of the business, as Peter has mentioned. So those are the two primary components that I would call out and the relative timing for [indiscernible]. Hopefully, that\u2019s something we look at [ph]. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay, thanks. Hope you guys feel better. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. Please proceed. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give us some more color on Vrbo and how it\u2019s trending as the year goes on and maybe touch on the supply and Vrbo how that\u2019s growing, if you feel supply constrained? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes, sure. As Eric mentioned, Vrbo remains above \u2013 nicely above 2019 levels. We are somewhat sublicensing. We will certainly sell out of many of our top locations for this summer. We\u2019re already seeing that. That is where our focus on supply has been to add supply in the markets where we know we\u2019re most constrained, and that\u2019s been really good in terms of when we add supply. We know we can move it and our suppliers get great outcomes and everybody wins. We haven\u2019t had as much focus, though we are turning our attention to that now of the broader overall supply gains. And again, we\u2019re going to stick to what we do well, which is whole home vacation areas not compete \u2013 we\u2019re not going to pivot and go after cities, except if they are vacation cities essentially. So we are sticking to our main product line here and what we know works and what we know our travelers want. But I would say the answer is yes we are a little bit supply constrained. We could certainly move more supply in our most high-demand markets, but that is where our focus on supply has been, and we are kind of gearing up the machine more broadly to go after not just that, but more broad supply in places where we think it will now come back more globally. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks Peter. And a quick follow-up, if I could. Looking at the lodging recovery, it\u2019s been pretty stable, improves a little bit February through to April. Underneath that, are we seeing Vrbo seasonality play out in that or is it just that it\u2019s just been pretty stable? Peter Kern : Yes. I would say Vrbo has been relatively stable. There is been some funkiness over COVID with month-to-month where demand has been high and because of where the waves were and other things. But I would say broadly Vrbo\u2019s performance has been strong. We\u2019re seeing lots of new customers coming to the product. I think the first quarter, we\u2019re around 50% of it was new customers. So we\u2019re getting a lot of new customers. We\u2019re getting a lot of repeat, and we\u2019re building that base of customers who have had great experiences with the product. So I think we feel like that will continue. Obviously, as hotel comes back more strongly, that\u2019s another mix factor that will potentially change where the strength is, but we think Vrbo will stay strong, just hotel will get better. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks Peter. Peter Kern : Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe. Please proceed. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So first, just, Peter, I wanted to ask a little bit more about the last question. The cadence of accommodations bookings seems like somewhat flattened out between March and April around like high single digits, low double digits. Curious, any additional color you can add to that maybe geographically or maybe something specific? And then secondly, kind of related to that, I wanted to ask you how you think about the travel demand sensitivity to consumer spending levels and maybe other macro variables? It clearly doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s an issue right now, but how do you think and even plan for second half, if cyclical trends start to become more impactful? Peter Kern : Yes. I mean so far, let me take the second one first, Deepak. I\u2019d say so far, notwithstanding what we all read about or watch on NBC, so far, the macro economic environment has not appeared to have a noticeable impact on the recovery in travel. We could all make our hypotheses about people having \u2013 had lots of savings during the COVID, been underspent in leisure and hospitality. But people are spending into it. And our general assumption right now is that, that will continue and that perhaps as things get \u2013 as people feel the impact, they may downscale what they are trying to do for holiday or go to a cheaper alternative, but not that they won\u2019t travel. So we expect that demand to continue. Obviously, impossible to say long-term, what happens with inflation and everything else. But \u2013 and obviously, that could have an impact on ADRs, but ADRs, particularly in the middle and upper end of the market continue to be really, really strong. So there is no noticeable like, that\u2019s something really pivoted in the last few months. But of course, long-term, it\u2019s hard to say. As far as bookings flattening out in April, again, challenging to say with the ups and downs of the various travel factors and what\u2019s going on in the world, we don\u2019t think there is anything to be much to be read into that. I think we feel good about where April is. It continues to show relative momentum, and we expect that to continue through the summer. So I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 at least, we\u2019re not reading much into that right now. It\u2019s been bumpy all the way along, ups and downs and I think holidays and other things start to impact and back to work is starting to impact things. So we will see in another quarter, but I don\u2019t think that suggests anything that makes us perk our eyes up or get concerned. Eric Hart : Deepak, I\u2019ll just \u2013 you used the word planning, so let me respond to that from a planning perspective. Generally, as you think about our marketing spend, a large percentage of that, of course, is on the performance of variable marketing side. We now have instrumentation, which we\u2019ve talked a lot about that allows us to see on a real-time basis what that demand footprint is looking like, what the CPCs are looking like, where we can allocate capital across the different performance channels, different geographies, etcetera. So ultimately, we have the ability to see it in real time and ultimately make capital allocation decisions based on what we\u2019re seeing. Of course, brand spend is a bit more batching. But at this point, what we\u2019re seeing and everything that Peter just walked through, we continue to be optimistic about the summer and be at this point. And if that changes, then we will address how we think about investment in market if we need to. And I guess maybe the last comment is, we\u2019ve dealt with a lot of volatility before over the last few years and built a lot of this implementation based on that. And so if things get more volatile, we will be in a position to make appropriate decisions in real time. Deepak Mathivanan : Yes. No, makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much. Hope you will feel better. Peter Kern : Thanks. It\u2019s what happens when you start traveling again and shaking people\u2019s hands, you\u2019re bound to get a cold. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Naved Khan with Truist. Please proceed. Naved Khan : Yes. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to dig a little bit into the commentary on the new users on Vrbo. I think Peter you mentioned roughly 50% of the bookings came from the 50% of users will renew. I\u2019m just trying to figure out how are you trying \u2013 how are you getting the \u2013 how are you acquiring the new users? Are these through word of mouth? Or are these primarily through performance channels? Just any kind of color commentary would be helpful. The second question I had is just on the return or the \u2013 at least the improvement in urban and cross-border and business travel. Maybe can you give us some sense of how these bookings in these sub-segments and compare versus 2019 levels? Peter Kern : Yes. Sure. Thanks, Naved. First on Vrbo, I would say, remember that we largely pulled out of performance in North America on Vrbo. We still use it in some other markets. But \u2013 so it\u2019s not generally coming through performance marketing. It\u2019s coming through direct channels. But as you know, we\u2019ve spent up considerably in brand marketing on Vrbo. We were in the pre-game show for the Super Bowl. We\u2019ve been aggressive there. We\u2019ve been aggressive in app marketing and some other vectors. So I think we\u2019ve done really nicely there, and the team has been very effective in that. And again, I think Vrbo is becoming \u2013 as it has grown and grown through COVID, it\u2019s just become more of a known and all the brand has landed finally, which the initial work on that 3 years ago was maybe not as good as it could have been. But over the course of COVID and with the benefit of better, bigger spending, we\u2019ve done really well with it. So I think we\u2019re just riding the momentum of all of that good work. As far as the return of urban and cross-border travel, I would say, it\u2019s all directionally up and to the right in varying degrees. Big cities remain still considerably below where they were, but moving in the right direction, and we\u2019re seeing those recoveries coming back. We\u2019re seeing some of the booking trends for summer in terms of big international city destinations, holiday destinations coming back. Cross-border, certainly domestic out of North America \u2013 sorry, cross-border out of North America has now recovered above 2019 levels. So again, that\u2019s not true for everywhere. It\u2019s not true for EMEA yet. It\u2019s not true for some other places, but certainly for APAC. But all markets are generally up and to the right, and all products are basically up and to the right. So it just depends how far behind kind of they started. So, business, big cities still a ways behind. But coming back, I think international will be the first to break out and come back to historic levels, and then we will see the other two categories follow. Naved Khan : Yes, thank you. Peter Kern : And of course, international is good for us. That\u2019s a market, both in the U.S. and in EMEA where we tend to over index. Naved Khan : Understood. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thanks. Two questions, please. First, just we haven\u2019t mentioned IDFA on this call. So just any quick commentary on whether you \u2013 the efficacy of your app marketing campaigns and whether you think you\u2019re back to parity or wasn\u2019t a major issue for you in the first place? And then I think, Peter, you talked a lot in the beginning about the B2B opportunity. I think click down a little bit more than you typically do. Can you just spend a little bit more time on helping us size that opportunity for Expedia versus the core market that you\u2019ve been in? Just talk about the relative attractiveness of that opportunity. Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks. First off, easy one on the first one, it hasn\u2019t been a major issue for us. We weren\u2019t probably where we wanted to be in app marketing before. Now we\u2019re in a much better place. We\u2019ve been much more effective. And so far, IDFA has not had a material impact on \u2013 we\u2019re ahead of where we were historically. So it hasn\u2019t been an issue for us. On B2B, thanks for the question, because it\u2019s my favorite topic. I think this is an area of our business that\u2019s been underrated by the markets and is an opportunity \u2013 a significant opportunity for us. And we\u2019ve talked about it before, but we power many of the biggest financial institutions in the world and their rewards programs where they have travel and power things like ARP membership travel all kinds of things like that. We have a huge base of offline travel agents, of regional players in regions where we don\u2019t play with our brands, who we power on and on and on. There is a bunch of interesting opportunities in fin-tech and other areas that are coming online. So we have had this traditional business, which has been about templates about giving people the access to our supply, so they can sell and still imagine, an airline sales of package with a hotel, etcetera. We are driving that hotel in that package very often. So there is all kinds of that business that\u2019s been down there. But historically, we\u2019ve only been able to do it for the largest partners because it took a lot of bespoke work to do the \u2013 to get the integrations to work. But what\u2019s really exciting and what we\u2019re all excited about is we\u2019re rebuilding the platform now in a way where it will be much more self-service, much more able to go for the biggest down to the smallest partners so that anybody who wants to be in the travel business or any of our partners who want to sell incremental products or use our technology to drive incremental benefits to their business, we will be able to access it. And we think that\u2019s really going to dramatically enhance the potential size of the market. We have to deliver it. There is a lot of work still to do. But every day, as I talk about optimized distribution, we have more and more partners coming on to products like that. And these constitute really significant opportunities for us broadly. In 2019, our B2B business was very sizable. I don\u2019t think we broke it out, but it was significant and measured in the many, many billions of dollars of GBV and we see the opportunity to grow that significantly over time. And I would say we think our B2C business will accelerate beyond where it was growing historically, but we think the B2B business will accelerate even faster and we will outgrow, on a percentage basis, the B2C business for the next several years. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thank you, Peter. Peter Kern : You bet. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. A couple of questions on your monthly growth rates. If I average the first quarter, it\u2019s around plus 1% or 2% for lodging and I think the total is minus 11%. So let\u2019s call it a gap 12 points or so. I think it\u2019s been somewhat consistent for the last few quarters. Can that gap start to close as air recovers? And what other drivers are at that gap? And then the second question, it looks like growth is pretty stable on a monthly basis for the last 3 months. I guess I would expect a little bit better as international reopens, how did the comps look going forward from here over the summer? Thank you. Eric Hart : Yes. I\u2019ll probably take both of them. So, on the first one yes, the way that you are dealing with illustrates on the CBD line that not all products have recovered at the same rate. Air does continue from a recovery standpoint for us. We have seen an acceleration, however, in air. As Peter went through a lot of the different intersections or vectors, I would add, to that one as well, we have seen that to start to recover as well. But it\u2019s going to \u2013 it does hit a number of the intersections that are still, call it, behind where we\u2019ve been benefiting from in the last few quarters, which of course, are U.S. verbal, etcetera, etcetera. So over the course of the year, we\u2019d expect for that air continue to come back as there are more planes in the air, as there are more international flights, etcetera. But there is some headwinds there as we all have heard from the airlines around staffing and other associated issues. What I would say here is the primary driver, as you pointed out. On the comps for the summer, I would say there is nothing particularly that I would call out. Obviously, there are a few months there where depending on what year you\u2019re comparing against. Vrbo had some particularly strong month. And if you go back to 2020 or maybe to 2019, but from a comp perspective, I think there is nothing over it. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Tom Champion with Piper. Please proceed. Tom Champion : Hi, good afternoon. Just curious if you could talk about international travel a little bit more. Domestic is entirely and exceeded 2019 levels on the revenue side for domestic travel. Just what do you think is kind of an appropriate time line or pace of recovery to get back to pre-pandemic levels on the revenue side? And then Eric, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the balance sheet. It sounds like debt reduction is your focus for now. But just curious if there are any thresholds to keep in mind that you\u2019re looking to achieve before you shift back to buybacks or another use of cash? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Tom. On the international front, as I mentioned, we\u2019re already seeing, for example, out of North America, that international levels have recovered above 2019 levels, at least, on a dollar volume basis. So \u2013 but again, it is driven market by market. So EMEA trails that. APAC is far worse, and LatAm is in between. So the trajectory of when it\u2019s all back and what is that \u2013 what is the \u2013 how does that comp over a normalized pre-COVID year. It\u2019s yes we had to do more with COVID than anything else. But I think as we\u2019ve seen before, the bigger travel markets in the west have buoyed the category and particularly for us since we\u2019ve concentrated more there. I think we could easily get to pre-COVID international levels of volume in dollar volume before the whole world recovers, but it\u2019s a little hard to predict because without the whole world recovering, other areas have to over-index. So right now, we feel good about it. I mean norms our home market, and it\u2019s great that it is leading the charge. But obviously, to really comp to prior periods in totality, we could use the rest of the world coming back a little more. But I expect it\u2019s entirely possible that by the summer, we could be at levels. And again, mix would be different and some of it would have to do with dollar volumes and ADRs, but we could be at levels above where we were in 2019. Eric Hart : And on the second part of your question, thanks for the question, Tom, around the balance sheet. I think you should assume and also have discussed in that we are having that conversation regularly when it comes to our balance sheet, our cash position, our debt position and ultimately, returning cash to shareholders in one form or another. As mentioned in numerous times, the investment grade rating is important to us. We are committed to staying investment grade that does require us to de-lever relative to where we are right now and also from an attractiveness standpoint of reducing our interest expense. And as we do that, we are then also contemplating what other capital returns would look like. I don\u2019t have anything to announce necessarily today. To guide you on the mile posts or whatever the \u2013 we are currently at 4.5x trailing EBITDA from a leverage perspective. It\u2019s a bit different on our current leverage ratio for our revolver, but that\u2019s our sort of headline number. And if you look at our historical level of leverage that was around 2.5x. And so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily state that 2.5, it was is a clear marker, if you will. So, that is certainly the order of magnitude that we are looking at from a get our debt down, get our debt leverage ratio down as that I think opens up the opportunities for capital returns in other forum. And also, remember that there is two primary ways that we can get that ratio down. One is paying down debt, which is something that we are actively thinking about and set growing into it from an EBIT standpoint. We do expect EBITDA to us as we get into this year as we get more fully recovered. And if trends continue, and we are certainly going to look at proving our ratios in this area to open up some more options for us. Tom Champion : Thank you both. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Lee Horowitz : Great. Thanks for the question. Two, if I could. I will kind of strikes that the U.S. hotel business has grown increasingly competitive kind of through COVID and in recent months. I wonder if you can comment at all on what you are seeing from a competitive standpoint in the U.S. specifically, say, now versus the pre-COVID environment? And then maybe on take rates. With take rate this year being a function of both the pace of the overall industry recovery as well as the relative recovery rates of some of the products that we have talked about at this point, how do you think about how take rates may evolve in \u201822, say, relative to the levels we saw in 2019? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Yes. Maybe I could ask you Lee, in your first question, are you asking competitiveness between us and other players or the competitiveness between hotel? I am not sure I understand the question. Lee Horowitz : No. I guess, between you and other players within the U.S. hotel market. Peter Kern : Yes. I mean look, I think as we have talked about before, our main competitor has been highly aggressive. This is obviously a market where we are relatively dominant and they want more of the business. And we have talked about how COVID and the kind of changes in demand patterns were helping them and hurting us in terms of long-tail properties in smaller markets as against our relative strength in big cities and international travelers, etcetera. So, they are certainly focused on it and competitive. We always watch what they do. But I think we feel pretty good about our opportunity to continue to grow in the U.S. and obviously, we expect them to compete hard, but it\u2019s our home market and we are strong here, and we think we have the tools we need to be competitive. And when demand patterns return to more normalcy, I think you will see that they were pretty much where we were. We may each make slightly different choices about where we think the long-term value is in customer base, but I don\u2019t think there is any \u2013 there is not really something to see there from our perspective right now. In terms of take rates, all I can say is that we have renewed a lot of deals throughout COVID. They have been good renewals, not big bites. And our take rates have been pretty consistent and held. So, I think there is no \u2013 the sky is falling. So, we can\u2019t pay anybody. And equally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going the other way, but we are also building in more opportunities in places like air and things like that, where we think there is opportunity to help our partners sell more premium products, sell ancillary products with their air tickets. We historically have not really been able to sell things like seat assignments and bags and other things. And now that increasingly, we are direct connecting with airlines, we are now able to sell those things. And actually at EXPLORE this week, we will have a demo of a new product that we used to help shoppers shop smarter and pick the right product for themselves and it\u2019s helping drive more premium products and attach rates. So, we have a lot of opportunity to do better there. We got to make it happen. But I think \u2013 but in terms of the core deals with our partners, I think we are in fine shape. Lee Horowitz : Thanks so much. Eric Hart : Yes. And just to add a quick comment on just around \u2013 yes. Just a reminder that Q1 take rate tends to be our seasonal low for the year. I think you can see that in Q1 relative to Q4 and some of our historical numbers. And so as you are modeling, we ensure that you are taking a look at the seasonal curve that we have experienced in the past and expect that curve to be similar this year than it has been. Lee Horowitz : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. I have two. I appreciate the color about the monthly bookings trends versus 2019. I was wondering a lot of investor questions about this. Can you just help us understand a little bit where the core hotel business bookings trends are versus \u201819 even versus those 11, 8, 7 numbers you gave us so we have a better \u2013 a rough idea of how that business is doing through Vrbo and all the other pieces that go on in bookings. That\u2019s the first one. And then second one, sort of a big picture question. You have a lot of improvements you have made in the site like there is a lot more improvements to come. Can you just talk to us about progress you have made around traffic conversion and where you still more low-hanging fruit opportunities? However, you look at it, whether it\u2019s searches, conversions, app opens, etcetera? What are you seeing on the conversion front? And where do you see the biggest opportunities to kind of further fix that going forward? Thanks. Peter Kern : Okay. Maybe I will take the second one first, and then Eric can give a little color on the first. But I would say \u2013 thanks, Brian. On the low-hanging fruit side, let me just kind of route everybody on where we have been, which is when you are re-architecting the whole platform and finally consolidating these different tech stacks and everything else, there is a lot of like foundational work that goes into that. And as a result, there is way less feature work and test and learning going on every moment of every day because you have got these big heavy lifts to move on to the same stack. In fact, this quarter, we have made huge progress in moving Hotels.com onto the Expedia stack, and we will be consolidating that over the coming months. And then those things unlock huge opportunities for us from an efficiency standpoint, from the opportunity to innovate across a wider breadth of travelers and we get more benefits to every traveler. So, we have just started to ramp up \u2013 ramp back up our sort of historical AB testing into conversion. And the exciting part is increasingly, we can do that with machine learning and not just with people designing different products. We have had a lot of wins. Some of the products we are rolling out of EXPLORER. We have \u2013 I mentioned the smart shopping idea where we are getting people to buy more premium products. All those things are helping with conversion and helping with, if you will, dollars per transaction and those kinds of issues. So, we are seeing it in a number of places. But I would say we are still like just reigniting that work because we have been so busy on foundational work. So, I think there is probably a lot of low-hanging fruit to be had. We do have some exciting products rolling, features rolling out this week, and we will continue to do that. But that\u2019s a few things. It\u2019s really the day-in, day-out AB test and machine learning, driving better conversion. It\u2019s really impactful when you get it right. And when you are not doing it, it certainly slows it down. So, I think there is a lot of opportunity, but I can\u2019t \u2013 I could give you 1,000. It\u2019s hard to give you two that are going to be the difference makers. It\u2019s a bunch of little things that make a difference. And we are in a much better place if you think about even just the Hotels.com example I gave you, we would have to test things on Hotels.com, test different things on Expedia, test other things on Vrbo, we will get to a place where we will be able to test everything across everything and that\u2019s just a much more impactful way to make change and drive better traveler outcomes and better conversion. So, that\u2019s what we are focused on, on that front. Eric Hart : Yes. Just to add to that, and then I will take the first part of the question just around one of the things that I think Peter and I are so excited about is that we are starting to see some of the power of our data come through the use of machine learning on the site as well. We now have real models live on the site that is starting to drive more personalized experiences to our \u2013 for our travelers or customers. And what that ultimately means is you can imagine the entire site ultimately, as we work through it, we will be the team learning and the more that we know about customers more than we know about travelers. The more they sign up for our loyalty program, interact with our \u2013 interact and book with us that ultimately that we are able to provide more and more personalized service. What\u2019s exciting is that we are seeing those models live and starting to see some good early returns from those. So, that would be one component that I would add to what Peter mentioned. On the core hotel side, I think on these two different components, I think we have talked about them a little bit already. One is ADRs are strong in the core hotel business. We are seeing that in the U.S. and in North America and other places as well. And then secondly, just around core hotel volume. We are not going into specifics necessarily between Vrbo and hotel, but we are seeing that vector of hotel in Peru across nearly or if not whole geographies. So, it had improved in the U.S. that continues to increase over that will continue to improve over the future and other. So, I think that the hotel business is much healthier as it\u2019s been and are excited to continue for you to come. Brian Nowak : Okay. Thank you both. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Jed Kelly : Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just talking \u2013 just going back to some of the gains you made in customer service efficiencies, you have talked about on past calls. Can you give us an update on the progress there in terms of driving more leverage to the business? And then just this week at the EXPLORE conference, any update on providing on putting more Vrbo inventory on Brand Expedia or Hotels.com? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes. So, go ahead Eric. Eric Hart : Yes. One on the \u2013 I will take the first question, and Peter, feel free to add any color and then you can take the second one. I think you will note number on our results this quarter as our cost of sales and \u2013 which was down pretty significantly relative to 2019, and that\u2019s driven by a number of different opportunities that lower headcount within that cost of sales across the revenue. Also, that\u2019s the use of technology as well. So, we just continue to add use case after use case in regards to using our communications, our learning and that type of opportunities with customers. And that results in a better customer experience. We are getting improved NPS scores while also driving more efficiency in the business as well. So, again, good results there. We can start to see those coming through the numbers as well. I do want to point out on the cost of sales side. There are a couple of other moving parts. And again, just for every identification cost of revenue across the sales consists of merchant fees, customer service, cloud fulfillment, which are largely volume driven. In the quarter, this was the first quarter where we did not have Egencia. And we did have Egencia for a month in Q4. So, when you are comparing against Q4, just remember that there was some of that Egencia came out. Another thing that we are seeing on the cost side, which is a great improvement as we have talked a lot about the number of complex calls that we are getting due to the COVID disruption. So, particularly on the air side, which are particularly difficult to manage, and we are starting to see this come down throughout the year and the quarter as well. We are getting \u2013 one is we are just cleaning them up. So, there are a few of them. We are getting better technology and we have some new technology that\u2019s being released around more automation where the traveler can manage their process. So, all good progress on the cost of sales side. And going forward, and of course, is influenced by seasonality, and we will see call center volume increasing in the summer again. At this point, we feel pretty good about the progress we are making. Peter Kern : Yes. And I will just close on that point before I take the other one. As things normalize and we get out of these COVID tons, as Eric mentioned, all these old flight cancellations, there is a high \u2013 much higher propensity of flight cancellations still than there was pre-COVID and major disruptions like when we get to normalized then, we should see more benefit even than we have seen so far in our service economics. So, that\u2019s more to come, but should be good news. As far as the Vrbo on Expedia, etcetera, as I mentioned, we are consolidating the front-end platforms right now. We have come long way on Hotels.com. Vrbo is next to go for us. And when those things come together onto one front-end platform, it\u2019s going to be a much, much, much better experience for all our customers coming through whatever channel they come through to get to book Vrbo content. And this is another place where our B2B business will benefit because we know we have many rewards programs and other places who want our Vrbo content. So, we will have yet again another way to drive demand through our B2B partners with products we haven\u2019t always been able to deliver to them because of the complexity. So, this is a foundational thing we are doing. It\u2019s not so much about the tip of the spear, like can we put more properties on Expedia. It\u2019s really about merging those stacks and get them all on one front-end stack. And when we do that, which is coming this year, but still work to be done. That will free up a lot of opportunity for us to drive that and innovate around how that experience should work in terms of booking Vrbos through our other brands. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Peter Kern : Thank you. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks guys. We want to ask your view on some of the shifts in the regulatory landscape with DMA in the EU and some similar proposals elsewhere? It sounds like these could introduce some friction between Google Search and some of their vertical products like hotels. I am wondering if you could give us a view on how Google Hotel has impacted competition in search options. And if you are seeing lower volumes going to Google, Hotels Meta, if that could be a tailwind for your customer acquisition costs. Peter Kern : Yes. Not so much. We haven\u2019t seen the volumes really decrease. I think directionally, what the EU is trying to do makes sense, but it hasn\u2019t been very impactful. And there is a lot of debate going on with the commissioners about how to wrangle Google Meta and whether the industry has a view on whether it\u2019s fair or not, but how the EU might go about and use generally been more aggressive than the U.S. in terms of regulation, but how they might go about trying to get Google to deliver a fairer marketplace. But so far, we have not seen any real reduction. Google Meta continues to be extremely strong and an important \u2013 obviously, therefore, an important place for all of us to have to deal with. So, I don\u2019t think we are going to see much change there, not yet. Brian Fitzgerald : Great. Awesome. Thanks Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you. And with that, I think that was our last question. I just want to be clear if \u2013 I think some of you might be able to make it or might be making to our EXPLORE conference if you can, I invite you, if you can to make time to watch it streamed or taped. We have been a little \u2013 because we have a lot of rollouts coming in terms of product delivery and some exciting things that are coming out. And I think if you get a chance, you will get a better understanding of what our B2B ambition is. But suffice it to say that we think this is an important time for us to pivot in the industry and really explain to the industry how we are going to be a different player in the market and an enabling player in the market, and we believe it\u2019s going to allow us to expand the marketplace for our partners and ourselves dramatically. So, if you get a chance, please tune in. And otherwise, thank you all for your time, and we will talk to you in a quarter. Take care. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to SVP Corporate Development, Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Good afternoon and welcome to Expedia Group\u2019s earnings call for the first quarter of 2022 that ended June 30. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by our CEO, Peter Kern; and our CFO, Eric Hart. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management\u2019s view as of today, August 4, 2022 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today\u2019s call are forward-looking typically preceded by words such as we plan, we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that or other similar statements. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and the company\u2019s filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company\u2019s Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to consistently visit our IR website for other important information. Unless otherwise stated, any reference to expense exclude stock-based compensation. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thanks, Harshit, and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that we were very pleased with our financial results in the quarter on the back of a continued recovery in all markets and products and our expanding margins. We've seen strong consumer demand for travel this summer and are encouraged that travel remains a top spending area even as other parts of the economy seem to be showing cracks. We posted our highest ever lodging bookings this quarter on the highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA for any second quarter and we continue to further strengthen our liquidity with a strong free cash flow and the early redemption of an additional $1 billion of debt. We delivered these strong results despite the current macroeconomic backdrop and the limitations and disruptions we've seen in air travel around the world. Of particular note, while domestic flight capacities have recovered close to 2019 levels, international flight capacity is lagging with long-haul capacity still down roughly 30%. While these disruptions and shortages don't appear to be abating soon, we do look forward to when these long-haul capacities return as this has always been a relative strength of ours. Now moving on to my main topic of the day. For the last few quarters, we spent a lot of time talking about the transformation of our technology platform and how that will enhance both our B2B and B2C businesses going forward. And last quarter, I took time out to explain in greater depth, how we were pursuing our B2B strategy, driving travel as a service to partners of all sizes. But as investors digested our Q1 results, it became very clear to us that we needed to clarify our B2C strategy and begin to provide incremental data to help you understand what metrics we think are important to measuring our success in pursuit of this strategy. In particular, there's been a lot of interest in the shifts in room night share, as travel has recovered. And whether something has changed in the market, or if it is just a temporary shift, as we put more of our attention into our technical transformation and attracting the right mix of consumers. Today, we hope to answer this more directly and give you a better understanding of our strategy and tactics, as we evolve our consumer business. As for the backdrop, I think by now you all have a decent understanding of how the mix effect domestic versus long-haul international or geo mix for example with the robust recovery of EMEA in Q2 can cover share results. And I also believe you are well acquainted with the fact that we've divested or shut down a number of noncore businesses, shedding certain volume over the last two years, whereas some competitors were buying business and thereby adding volume. So today, I'm going to focus more narrowly on how our long-term consumer strategy is impacting these short-term share issues. To be clear, we have been evolving our consumer approach from being largely transactionally focused, where we and the industry spent virtually all of our time, tuning our products for maximum arbitrage and performance marketing channels and spending more and more money on intermediaries, to a future where we build longer-lasting direct relationships with loyal high-lifetime value customers. This means that we have not chased all traffic available in performance marketing, no matter the cost and instead have focused on the pockets of consumers, we think will drive the highest long-term value and the best future shape of our business. To give you more perspective on why it's so valuable to focus on these types of consumers I'd like to give you a few facts about our biggest OTA brands. Over the last 18 months in our Expedia and Hotels.com brands, loyalty members drove approximately 3x the gross bookings per customer and over twice the gross profit per customer and twice the repeat business as compared to nonmembers. Similarly, app users drove over 2.5x the gross bookings per customer, 2.5x the gross profit per customer and 2.5x the repeat bookings versus non-app users. And of course when we combine the two and have loyalty members who also book through the app, you get the highest production of any customers. Given these core drivers our entire company is focused on getting the right customers in the funnel and then turning them into loyalty members and app users.  And while both will accelerate as we deliver on our platform with better features better personalization and with one overarching loyalty program. I'm pleased to highlight that we are already seeing strong traction. For example in Q2, '22 alone we grew new loyalty members 33% compared to Q2, 2019. Similarly on the app side new app downloads grew 58% in Q2, '22 versus Q2 2019.  Not surprisingly therefore, our direct business continues to grow with almost 2/3 of our B2C gross bookings in Q2 generated from traffic that came to us directly. And really this is just the beginning. With improving products and features including our price tracking product for flights which has been a huge engagement driver in the app and with the rollout of loyalty to all of our customers next year, we will be able to drive much more direct engagement with our customers. That being said it's also important to remember that lifetime value and travel does not come through the numbers instantly because of the frequency of travel for most consumers. While we have been gaining ground building up our base of high lifetime value customers and are confident in their ability to drive future velocity, it is not as quick twitch as buying transactions through Google and other meta channels.  In the coming quarters, we will continue to update you on these important core drivers of our future success and provide any additional disclosures that may help you measure and understand our progress. For example, starting today we have added an incremental disclosure of room nights on a booked basis. This disclosure should not only give you a better sense of our trajectory, but should also help you better understand our marketing spend. But to be clear it is not the complete picture. Ultimately what you need to understand is that we are spending against the profit we derive from the market. And while we may currently look less efficient on even a booked room night basis compared to booked gross profit, we are still spending below historical levels. We have done this while allocating more money to channels that drive direct traffic and the kind of high lifetime value of consumers we seek.  It is early days even for this but we know we have the best creative in the category and a great plot to acquire app customers and believe strongly in these veins of opportunity. Now as anyone forget while we've been making the transition from volume at all costs to the right volume with the right long-term characteristics we have also been going through a massive technical transformation as we move to a single platform. Transitions like this always entail certain short-term versus long-term trade-offs. The perfect example of which is our migration of Hotels.com onto the Expedia stack. We accelerated this over the last two quarters because the benefits of being able to optimize across our largest two OTA brands on the same stack are massive. But to be clear migrations generally disrupt customer patterns and can impact conversion in the short term. And we were no exception. We had to make some choices to prioritize speed over perfection. The really good news is that Hotels.com front end is now nearly fully migrated and we've been freeing up engineers who can now turn their attention to optimizing the full stack.  This is just one example of the many choices we make every day to trade modest short-term disruption for significant long-term growth. And frankly we are more excited every day by our progress the acceleration of the transition and what is still to come. So in summary, we know we are massively improving our technical position. We know we are engaging more customers in our membership programs and our apps and we know both will drive significant improvement in our business. And in general, we are willing to give up short-term unprofitable volume for longer-term sustainable growth. Because we know that at any given moment a large portion of the traveling public is up for grabs searching around for the best travel options. The industry literally serves billions of searches and customers every year and rarely has engendered true loyalty. Traffic has never been an issue in travel. It's always been a question of retention. We mean to once and for all change that dynamic by providing a product and set of services, worthy of customer loyalty and ultimately, we intend to spend much less of our time and money chasing them over and over again in the wild.  Of course, in the meantime, we will look for every opportunity to grab back share where it makes sense and where we are bringing the right kind of traffic at the right value. As fixated as some of you may be on share, I can assure you we are more so. Our competition has been very promotional and highly geared to performance marketing, but we are determined to build our business in a better way. And we fully believe that as we build our base of high lifetime value customers, we will be able to buy the right customers more efficiently and grow revenue and share far more quickly and profitably than we ever have. Let me end by reverting to our core theme. We are evolving all things in the business to a place of better customer-oriented products and capabilities, better service and understanding of our customers, personalization and ultimately, building what we believe will be the best and stickiest product in the industry. And all of these advancements also, benefit our B2B business, which continues to grow at an accelerated rate. Just this quarter we had a variety of wins. We now power Delta Airlines car rental offering along with hotel, which we have powered for some time and we've already seen significant benefit to our partner. We've become the exclusive provider of hotel supply to Avios, the rewards program for all the airlines under the IAG flag. And while we continue to find new ways to add value to classic travel partners, we have also expanded into emerging pools of captive consumers. To wit this quarter, we proudly partnered with Bilt, which has the first ever loyalty program for renters and we now power their travel portal. And as we continue to power old and new partners, we are also looking for new capabilities to externalize to expand our Open World platform product suite. Late last year, we externalized our travel ads platform that allows travel suppliers to advertise to our consumers. With this externalization, we are expanding the reach for our travel advertisers and the scope of what we power for our demand partners. This quarter alone we added travel as to multiple template partners. We continue to see enormous potential for travel as a service and the continued growth of our product lineup will help fuel our ambition to power the whole industry. So in closing, we had a record financial quarter and we added more loyalty members and app customers than ever before all while continuing to make huge progress on our technical transformation. We're grateful to our employees, our customers and our partners, who are helping us change the industry. And with that, I'll pass it on to Eric for financials. Eric Hart : Thanks Peter. The second quarter was strong on multiple fronts, and I am pleased with the financial results that the business continues to generate. Before I dive into the numbers, let me preface that I'll provide our reported numbers and growth rates as well as like-for-like growth rates that exclude Egencia\u2019s AmEx GBT and the non-lodging elements of our Chase relationship. I will go through that last one as that is a new adjustment. Chase is a value B2B partner and our relationship remains strong. But as of February 2022, we stopped powering their non-loss business, which consists of air and car. However, we continue to power their locking business, which has performed well. While the non-locking business was significant on a gross booking basis, it was not material to us on profitability. And as a reminder, we completed the sale of Egencia's AmEx GBT on November 1, 2021 and our EPS business entered into a 10-year lodging supply agreement with AmEx GBT. We believe these like-for-like numbers are more reflective of the actual performance of our business. Moving on to the P&L. Total gross bookings for all products were up 1% on a like-for-like basis and down 8% versus Q2 2019 on a reported basis, which was a sequential improvement as compared to Q1 down 9% on a like-for-like basis and down 17% on a reported basis. Like-for-like gross bookings growth was driven by an improvement in lodging bookings and ADR is well above 2019 levels. We've seen a continued recovery across all our geographies and main product types with particular strength in North America. Total lodging gross bookings, which were the highest we've ever had, were up 9% on a like-for-like basis versus Q2 2019 and up 8% on a reported basis. Now for the monthly walk. On a reported basis, lodging gross bookings were up 9% in April, up 9% in May and up 5% in June. As for July, we saw some choppiness early in the month, likely due to airport and airline disruptions. But in the back half of the month, we have seen strong performance similar to the rest of Q2. All in, we expect July to land in line with 2019 levels. Currently we are seeing a robust summer with Q3 lodging bookings pacing ahead of 2019. The same is true for pacing for the remainder of the year, but it's still early with the majority of bookings for the back half of the year yet to be made. We remain optimistic and as Peter mentioned, we will continue to monitor bookings and other leading indicators closely and adjust our actions accordingly. Total revenue was up 5% versus Q2 2019 on a like-for-like basis. On a reported basis, revenue was $3.2 billion up 1% and a sequential improvement from down 10% on a like-for-like basis and down 14% on a reported basis. Direct sales and marketing expense was $1.5 billion up 12% versus Q2 2019 levels as we continue to spend into the recovery to capture demand. As Peter mentioned, we increased our efficiency on marketing expense as a percent of book to gross profit. As part of our strategic focus to build a direct relationship with travelers, we continue to allocate spend towards higher lifetime value channels such as pay at installs and brand creatives. Moving on to overhead. Costs were $551 million, a sequential increase of $18 million from Q1 2022 and were approximately $170 million or 23% lower than Q2 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $648 million, the highest second quarter in our history and was up 20% versus Q2 2019 on a like-for-like basis and was up 14% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 20% over 230 basis points higher than the 18% adjusted EBITDA margin in Q2 2019. This quarter I also wanted to call out the other expense line which was a loss of $385 million. This was primarily driven by a mark-to-market loss on our minority equity investment in American Express Global Business Travel, which we received in exchange for our equity interest in Egencia. The loss is due to the reduction of GBT share price since the company became public in May 2022 through the end of Q2. We continue to bring long-term believers in AmEx GBT and is the leading corporate travel management company in the world led by a terrific management team. And additionally, corporate travel has been rebounding faster than many anticipated and our supply deal with GBT continues to perform very well. On to free cash flow, which showed a $1.5 billion in Q2 on a reported basis. Excluding the change in restricted cash primarily driven by the change in Vrbo's deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately $1.3 billion. As it relates to our current cash position we have $8 billion in total liquidity, which includes $5.6 billion of unrestricted cash on hand as of quarter end, which provides us ample cash to operate the business. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. And consistent with this in May, we announced the early redemption of our senior notes due 2023 and 2024 totaling approximately $1 billion. Post this redemption we have no notes maturing until 2025. Since May of 2021, we have repaid over $2.9 billion in net debt and preferred equity. Regarding our capital allocation strategy we had a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders and we believe our stock remains undervalued. As we get more clarity on the macro picture we will accordingly reevaluate our options including potential share repurchases. In closing, we are pleased with the results we achieved this quarter. I believe executing on our strategy will yield a stronger direct relationship with travelers and improve our overall financial performance further. Operator, we are ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe coming back to all the disclosure and framing strategy around B2C which I think was really helpful for investors. Can you talk a little bit whether it's either qualitatively or quantitatively about how we should be thinking about longer-term marketing ROI or gross profit per booked room night. I'm thinking about ways in which you could generate additional leverage in the model beyond some of the margin targets or margin framework we've talked about before coming out of the cost-cutting exercises during the pandemic just a bit better framing on what might that do for sort of returns for the business over the long-term? Thanks. Peter Kern : Sure. Thank you for the question. I'll certainly try to put a little more color on it. Ultimately, as we drive towards high lifetime value customers and moving our customers into these high value positions in app in membership et cetera and up the membership ladder. We believe that we'll be able to use our marketing capital more efficiently through a variety of channels, including loyalty, including CRM and a variety of ways to drive more direct relationships. And ultimately, we believe we're going to get better and better at being able to buy the right kinds of customers out of the market. We are trying to do that now. We are doing it, I would say, with fairly remedial tools, but we are getting better and better as we get better at a more granular understanding of each customer and each customer's potential LTV and what channels they come from. So we're on that journey to basically drive lifetime value broadly, but also ultimately understand lifetime value in a very granular way, so that we can then, again, be buying that lifetime value out of the market in the most efficient way as we can. We think we're doing that now. But admittedly our tools are somewhat remedial. As we get all of our customer accounts together. You've heard us talk about consolidating data, consolidating the one loyalty plan across everything. As that loyalty plan reaches everybody, as we have one identity for every customer we are going to get better and better at understanding LTV and understand each customers' performance and that's going to allow us to get a lot sharper on how we acquire traffic and who we acquire. So, ultimately, we are looking to drive more efficient acquisition of the right kinds of customers. And as I've said on a couple of calls, that doesn't mean we're necessarily planning to spend less money, it means we expect to get more value out of the money we spend. And if we get really good at it, we may be spending more money and buying just more and more value out of the marketplace. So that is our ultimate goal. I think, there's lots of tools we have already to drive LTV, but we're going to have many more and a better understanding of how to buy the right kinds of customers out of the market as time passes. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you. Peter Kern : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen. Kevin, your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks a lot. I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more on how you view the current travel booking environment that you're seeing quarter-to-date, given you did see some of that choppiness early in the quarter, but then it sounds like growth has come back quite a bit since then. Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes, sure. Eric can chime in. I'll give you my thoughts. I think we've seen -- as Eric referred to, we saw some choppiness in the early part of July. As you all know there's been a lot of disruption in North America and in Europe in airports. There have been the Heathrow capped how many flights could go in and out. There's been a lot of noise and a lot of cancellations. And we think that's probably responsible for a lot of it, obviously, in a time of weird macro backdrops. We're all looking for ghosts. But with the strong rebound over the last few weeks of July, we feel like it was more temporary than anything and we're seeing better resilience and similar strength, as Eric has said, compared to earlier in Q2. So we're optimistic. Again, the summer period looks strong. There's no real let up that we've seen, other than what we reflected in July. And beyond that, there's still a lot of bookings to be had, but we're optimistic. Kevin Kopelman : Could you -- and also just as a follow-up, could you touch on puts and takes for EBITDA in the third quarter, given it's the -- it's typically the largest profit quarter for the year? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. Maybe, I'll let Eric take that, but I think he may be having some technical difficulties. Eric Hart : Yes. Peter Kern : Eric, you're there? Eric Hart : Over here, you got it. Okay. Kevin can you hear me okay? Okay. Kevin Kopelman : Yes. Eric Hart : As you mentioned, Q3 is our seasonal high from an EBITDA perspective. If I -- if we look at Q2, we feel good about where EBITDA came in, call it, in the aggregate or the quantum and then also seeing the leverage that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we continue to operate the business in a very similar structure, if you will. So we feel good about the quarter. As I also mentioned, our pacing also looks and when I say pacing the forward bookings or whatever language one wants to use on what's on the books already for the coming periods, that's also above 2019. Now, the bulk of the transactions still need to occur over Q3 or Q4 for that matter, but thus far, feeling pretty good about the trends that we're seeing. And then just adding a layer of comments on the \u2013 what Peter went through is, we continue to remain in an environment where there's more volatility in trading that I have necessarily seen in the business historically just given the pandemic and COVID and variants that come along and now disruption. And so there are periods, where you might see more volatility than we've historically seen, but the consumers continue to be resilient and continue to prioritize travel in their spend. And as Peter mentioned, and I mentioned earlier, the back half of July and early part of August, was back to similar levels of Q2. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Peter. Eric Hart : Thanks, Kevin. Peter Kern : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : We now have a question from Naved Khan of Truist Securities. Please go ahead, when you are ready. Your line is now open. Naved Khan : Great. Thank you. Just a quick clarification maybe. So the monthly trends you shared for 2Q and into July. Are they like-for-like, or are they on a reported basis? How should we understand them? And then on the \u2013 maybe Peter so you said that, the Hotels.com tech integration is complete. Are there any early results you can share with us in terms of any kind of benefits you might be able to drive from that? Eric Hart : Hey, Naved, I'll take the first part of that, and perhaps Peter you take the second one. They are on a like-for-like basis. So, that is giving you a sense for what we believe is the more accurate representation of the trajectory of the business. And again, just for everyone clarification, it's essentially taking out Egencia, the Chase non-lodging components and then also the lodging service agreement that we have with Amex GBT, so that it gives you a sense \"for our core business\" and what the trends look like given the puts and takes that we've had given the changes that we've made over the last few years. Peter Kern : And I'll take the H.com question. So the short answer is, we've mostly seen the disruption and not much of the win yet. Obviously, as I mentioned, the engineers we're now freeing up to optimize the stack is are highly valuable to us, and we expect now to get wins not only on the H.com stack, but on the beta the Expedia stack at the same time. So the whole idea is been broken into two different stacks. We've had engineered, we've needed twice as many engineers to work both stacks. And we've been \u2013 any test any wins any improvements are made on one stack or the other and not necessarily carried across, or not necessarily working the same across. So now that, we get more on to the same stack, every time we get a win, it's a win for everybody. And it's a win for much more of our traffic. So the opportunity to now have one consolidated place where we can do that is massive. And we are just getting going now that, we've moved so much of the front end, we can put those engineers on the work and we can start to get lift across not only for commercial, but Expedia the portfolio brands, and everywhere else that runs on that stack. And ultimately, we will all be on the same front-end stack. And then every iteration every test and win every opportunity to make the product better, we'll go to all our customers and we'll get the benefit across the biggest space. So that's what we're driving to Naved and early days in that particular bit. But I will say, the disruption was somewhat less than we expected, which is good and the opportunity is enormous. So, we're putting people on it now and we're starting to get those benefits. But it's very early days. Eric Hart : Yes. Hey, Naved, I want to just clean-up my quick remarks, because we actually have both in there both on a like-for-like, and on a reported basis. So let me just be really clear. We provided both numbers, which is the 9% on a like-for-like basis for total lodging gross bookings, and then the 8% on a reported basis. And then the WACC, itself is on a reported basis just to make that clear. Naved Khan : So, let me just maybe understand that better maybe for July. So you shared the trends and how July started out weak and sort of picked up towards the back end. Is that on a reported basis, or how should we look at that? Peter Kern : Yes. That's reported. Eric Hart : Yes. That's on a reported basis. Peter Kern : All the monthly are on a reported basis. Naved Khan : And that's lodging bookings only, right? Eric Hart : Correct. Just to make sure you heard me. Naved Khan : Great. Thank you. Thanks. Eric Hart : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open Lee. Lee Horowitz : Great. Thanks for the question. Appreciating that long-haul capacity still remains constrained. Can you guys comment at all on what you're seeing in terms of urban travel trends either in the quarter or into 3Q, or are you still seeing kind of robust accelerated recovery there? And is it fair to think that you guys still kind of remain below 2019 levels within this travel quarter? Peter Kern : Yes. I would say to the first part, Lee, yes, cities have been coming back pretty strong. If you've been traveling this summer you've probably seen it particularly in Europe. And the strength is -- it's not as strong as beach and other things that have been, but it is materially coming back. So, as I mentioned in the beginning we've seen improvement kind of everywhere in every product. It's different by geo and it's different by urban and non-urban. But everything has been going up into the right and urban has recovered substantially. I think you can tell from our numbers that in various spots we are not buying bad business. So, I'm not going to go into breaking out which places that is per se but urban has been growing nicely for us and it's been growing nicely for the whole industry. So, I think Cities are back. And certainly this summer there will be plenty of urban travel. Lee Horowitz : Great. And one follow-up if I could. In the past you guys have talked about struggle in terms of bringing on as much headcount as you may have liked. I guess given maybe some of the ground slack in the labor market would you say that that's no longer a problem, or are you still trying to kind of ramp in and having some I guess the word loss in terms of bringing new headcount in media? Eric Hart : Yes, I can take that Peter. Peter Kern : Go ahead. Eric Hart : Yes, I would say we continue to trend below both our forecasted and candidly, what we want to do from a new hire perspective. So, I would say that that continues to persist. Obviously the market is dynamic at the moment. So, it's something that we're watching to see if there's greater accessibility of talent if you will. There's also continues to be some wage inflation challenges as well which I think you're probably hearing across a lot of these calls. So, we haven't seen that necessarily come through at this point, but it's something that we are watching closely. But I will also say from a recruiting standpoint, I do think our strategy and our execution on our story does resonate quite well as we are recruiting. We are excited about what we're trying to accomplish. We're just doing that within a broader context of a challenging environment. And not that I wish ill on any people out there from a layout perspective or whatever else, but I think there could be an opportunity for us to ramp some of that hiring over the coming months. Now, with that said, there is a lot of uncertainty out in the environment. We are like everyone else looking at our head count and making sure that we are prioritizing accordingly putting people on our highest priority items and looking at our open headcount to make sure that we're making the appropriate investment decisions. So, it's dynamic like a lot of the other aspects of the business but we continue to have success in recruiting talent but not necessarily at the levels that we want to relative to our priorities. Peter not sure if you want to add anything to that? Peter Kern : Yes, I would just add Lee that as we continue to make progress on our technical transition. We're constantly solving problems and freeing up people to work on new things. So, it's kind of we're solving it two ways, which is we're looking for talent in the market to help fill open roles where we need people and every day we're also kind of freeing up capacity that can work on the next thing. So, we're moderating it that way. And ultimately as I've said before we're going to get more efficiency out of the machine over time. So, balancing that trajectory is something we're always looking at. Lee Horowitz : Okay. Thank you, both. Peter Kern : Thank you. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Lee. Our next question comes from Tom Champion of Piper. Please go ahead when you are ready, Tom. Tom Champion : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about Vrbo and the alternative space and whether or not you encountered any supply constraints in the summer with inventory? And then second maybe you could just talk a little bit more about new partnerships in the B2B business and very strong revenue and EBITDA in the segment. Just your thoughts on that sustainability. Thank you. Peter Kern : Sure. Thanks, Tom. So a couple of highlights I guess on Vrbo. I mean, first of all, the business continues to be strong well above 2019 levels. We've seen some demand -- sorry, supply constraints in our best markets. I think Southeast beaches in the US and such, but we have been adding supply at an accelerating level and actually in our strongest markets like US beach, et cetera. We've been adding supply faster than our main competition. So we feel pretty good about that trajectory and we're getting better at that kind of all the time. So in our strongest markets again we're adding supply, but there were constraints. There were markets sold out this summer for sure, and we'd love to have more supply in those places. As far as new partnerships go, I'd love to name a bunch of names. Unfortunately, in some cases we are constrained by our agreements with our partners, but we've seen really good growth in our B2B business and our B2B pipeline. We think there's a lot of products that we can help our partners with. And as our products get better all the things, I was talking about even with the Hotels.com, Orbitz front-end change that's not just getting on to one stack. It's also componentizing all the front-end modules, so that we can more easily use them and we use them for our partners to create their travel products on the front end. So there's a lot of opportunity in all the work we're doing to make the products better for our partners, and to externalize new things that we haven't externalized before, like our service capabilities, or our machine learning capabilities, or our fraud capabilities. So we're working kind of two tracks, which is we want to drive more value into our partnerships that we already have with the products already available, and we want to externalize lots of new products that we think will be valuable to the partners we already have and to a much wider base of partners. So, both of those things are going. There's lots of exciting things happening on both fronts. And most excitingly when we deliver things like we did with our new car deal with Delta or many others, they deliver more value for our partners. And that means, it's a good product, that makes our partners more successful, and us more successful. So I think it's one of those places that's really a great symbiotic situation, where we can use our technology and our supply to drive better outcomes for all our travel partners. And it really sort of turns those into partnerships instead of just the classic supply deals and other things we've always had. So we're excited. We think the growth -- there's plenty of growth there. I don't think it's like linear and just accelerates. I think we'll have new products that roll out, new exciting things that come. We'll have some big new partnerships that come over time. And each of those will add to it. And ultimately, the more products we can externalize, I think, the more partners will have and that's what we're most excited about. Tom Champion : Thank you. Peter Kern : You bet. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead when you are ready. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to jump on the monthly trends again. Given that it's kind of staying near sort of 10% about 2019 levels, is it sort of fair to assume that the volume recovery from kind of the pent-up demand that we saw over the last few quarters is somewhat now behind us, and it's a more normalized growth environment driven by more marketing and sort of like the product and some other partnership efforts that you mentioned just now? Are there any markets geographically maybe where recovery could still be significant? How do you kind of think about the growth from here to take it much higher about 2019 levels? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Yes, I'll take a stab Eric, and maybe you can follow. I would say, Deepak that there are still plenty of markets that have not fully recovered. APAC for one, Latin America for another. And then within certain geographies there's still -- there are still places that are not as robust. But -- so there's plenty of opportunity. I think there's no sign that what we've seen as the robust recovery now won't continue for the foreseeable future. As Eric alluded to there's -- no one knows quite what's happening with the macro environment and when and if that will impact travel. But so far everything looks pretty strong. So I think there is still opportunity for growth from our perspective. The pie is enormous, right? I mean, we and the other big OTAs eat about I don't know 15% maybe of the global travel market, maybe a bit more of the big ones our main big competitors. So there's a lot of pie out there. And I think we have lots of opportunity in the strategy I was trying to describe to continue to grab high-value travelers that we can add to the pot and drive our business and stack them up. So we think there's plenty of recovery to be had. I don't know macro global travel is definitely still way under 2019 levels, because so many geos are not caught up yet and that long-haul air et cetera but ADRs have been very high. So we've seen escalated numbers driven by that. But there's definitely a fair amount of consumption in the world that's not back in the market. Eric, I don't know if you want to add anything? Eric Hart : No. Peter Kern : Okay. Thank you, Deepak. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thank you so much. Peter Kern : You bet. Operator : We now have Lloyd Walmsley of UBS. Please go ahead when you're ready. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two questions if I can. First on the marketing side, it looks like there was a bit of deleverage in the quarter and just looking at direct marketing per booked room night. It's up by my math, I think 28% year-over-year. Is that just a function of bidding up because of the higher ADRs or something going on a brand campaign? You guys mentioned efficiency improvements on like a gross profit basis. So if you can just explain that a little more? And then just second one on the product side, you guys talk a lot about improving the product and doing driving more direct from product improvements. Wondering how does adding hotel supply and localizing that supply fit in as a priority in the product strategy? Are you guys rebuilding supply acquisition team like where does that fit in? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yeah. Maybe I'll take that in reverse order, Lloyd. So on the supply side, yes, supply plays an important role both in terms of breadth, in terms of pricing competitiveness and in terms of transaction if you will. Different kinds of discounts, different kind of our member discounts, package discounts other things. So supply plays an important role. We are, yes, we have been ramping our acquisitions, but we've also been ramping something we've been trying to do for a long time, which is our self-service capabilities so that suppliers can more easily sign on. I don't know if you remember in the past, but it always took us a lot longer to sign up partners partly because we had the merchant model but also it was just harder and more cumbersome. And we are working tirelessly to try to change that and try to bring more people on board and self-serve. So that of course gives us scale beyond just hiring back up market management and people to acquire properties. So that's one line of work that we are absolutely focused on and driving. On the deleverage side, I would say yeah you have to look at all the cost of marketing all up, which includes other things besides what you see in the marketing line, including loyalty and pricing moves et cetera. And then we look at our booked GP, our GP we're deriving from the bookings, we're booking and we are getting -- when you compare those two things, we are getting leverage in that number. You can't really look at room nights because you're missing other mix issues and you're missing some of these other components with loyalty et cetera, which is why some of our competitors appear to be getting leverage but they're really getting deleveraged because they're discounting more and being more merchandise and aggressive on the promotional side. So we're getting leverage out of that collective and others are not. Eric Hart : Yeah. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. Peter, if I can a thumbs up. Peter Kern : Yeah. Yeah. You're back on. Go for it. Eric Hart : Thank you. Yeah. And so Peter spent a fair amount of time and I did well just around the gross profit and looking at it from a holistic perspective. But I do want to just make sure that I reflect and we reflect that we have said that we are going to be a couple of things. One is aggressive in marketing spend and the recovery. So to the extent that we see opportunities to acquire the types of travelers or customers that Peter mentioned, we are going to push into that and are seeing nice returns from that perspective. And then two is, the profile of the travelers and customers that we're acquiring because of a mix shift of marketing into longer-term relationships such as brand marketing or creative, as I mentioned and then also app downloads that we're essentially building cohorts over time that have a higher lifetime value, but also can take longer to hit the P&L if you will. So there's a timing aspect to it. So again, gross -- both gross profit, we feel good and we feel that that is healthy. Two is, we do want to be aggressive in marketing given the rebound from the pandemic. And then three is longer spend profiles from a mix standpoint in our marketing spend. Lloyd Walmsley : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Eric Hart : Thanks, Lloyd. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question, Brian. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks. Maybe a bit of a follow-on to Lloyd's question. As you look ahead into 2023 and the implementation of the Digital Markets Act in the EU, just wondering if you could offer any thoughts in terms of how that could change the marketing environment for you potentially benefit the business from a marketing perspective? Thanks. Eric Hart : Yeah. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it, Brian. It's a very dynamic environment. As you can imagine, there's international tax treaters that are being negotiated. They're DST taxes that are ebbing and flowing if you will. That ultimately, it is something that we're watching. We're building it in of course where we need to. Don't necessarily have a crystal ball on it. But ultimately, I believe that we won't be the only ones that are impacted if you will on a per geography basis. And it will impact pricing and ultimately what the consumer may end up paying in the end. And so, I don't foresee at this time any detrimental impact to our ability to acquire the types of customer relationships that Peter and I have both spoken to, but it is a very dynamic environment and something that we're spending time on in Washington. Operator : Thank you. We now have Justin Post of Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Justin Post : Great. I appreciate the other booked night disclosure and I think that has been the overhang last quarter. A couple of questions around that. So as you're presumably trying to get better customers, what have you seen on return rates so far, since you've changed your strategy? And are those higher? And second, what time frame is the Board or the management team holding the marketing group to start showing better leverage on that line? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yeah. I would just say -- so a couple of things. We don't really disclose repeat rate, but I'll state the obvious which is you heard what I said about the repeat rates of members of app users and how much direct business we have. So I think it's safe to assume that you can follow the trend lines of where that's headed as we continue to build these higher value higher repeat rate customers into our base. As for the time frame, we want to drive leverage in marketing broadly and long term, but it's not just up to marketing, the effectiveness of the product I think Lloyd asked about supply, the effectiveness of supply. All of those pieces play a part in marketing efficiency having the right product on the shelves, the right high converting product for the customer. And again, all the things we've talked about and moving them into the right products into membership into app et cetera. So there's a lot of pieces that fall together. Right now, we're interested in investing in the right types of customers that build that base of high lifetime value customers. And as long as we can do that in an efficient way, and again, as we look at all our spend, all up, we are doing that more efficiently right now as against book value. So we're very happy to keep investing in that. Over time, we will get better and better at finding those pockets, as I said on a more granular level. But right now with the blunt instruments we have, we are driving app membership all of it and the right kinds of customers into the funnel as best we can and we will get sharper and sharper on that over time. So I don't think there's a \u2013 we're not saying okay by the end of 2023 we have to pull x many basis points out of marketing. We're saying that as long marketing can drive the right base of customer \u2013 high-value customers into the machine. And as long as the machine is getting better at converting them into the types of customers we want, we're winning and we want to keep driving that. Eric Hart : And just \u2013 sorry I can just add to that as well quickly. Just around we've announced and launched some new products at our EXPLORE conference and then subsequently are ramping those. And just a couple of examples on how we can drive engagements with our travelers and customers and the relationships that one example of that is our price tracking product that we rolled out relatively recently. And early days, it's quite positive what we're seeing. We're seeing good uptake and people signing up for it. We're seeing great open rates when we send notifications and then seeing very strong return rates as well. So again, it is of course about our ability to generate transactions from customers so that we can deepen our relationship but we now have new tools that we have developed that we are rolling out that are showing great promise and engaging those customers along the way in their journey. And then subsequently you can imagine after that first transaction that just gives us more and more opportunities with an increasing number of customers using the app which is the multiplier as Peter talked about and being a member which is the multiplier on the amount of \u2013 the depth of the relationship and a number of transactions. So that all of those are adding up for us to increase our number of customers or share of wallet and ultimately drive the business in a profitable way. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Maybe one follow-up. You do see take rates up from 2019. And I was wondering if the strategy is driving higher value customers that maybe spend on different types of hotels, or is that just more timing related? Thank you. Eric Hart : You have the typical seasonal component on take rates. But what I would say is there a number of different moving parts. We've got a higher mixed North America the Vrbo to Hotel relative to some of our historical numbers, which I think we've talked about in previous quarters. We also have a slightly higher margins on Vrbo itself just given some of the take rate decisions that we've made over the last few quarters. And so that revenue margin has benefited from mix so more lodging or less air. So I would expect that to come down just to revert somewhat back to the mean. But there are promotional activities as Peter talked about that we're not necessarily as aggressive or making different choices along the way and balancing that with marketing spend. That will continue to be dynamic. So feel good about the take rates. They are higher. They have \u2013 some of that is because of mix. We should expect some of that to come back down but we feel good about the absolute level where we landed. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Peter Kern : And I think \u2013 sorry I was just going to add in if you look at our ADRs, we've driven quite strong ADR growth and I think stronger than some of our competitors at any rate. And part of that is driving the right customers, driving the right products. And as Eric says, being less promotional. And we think that's evidence of that as compared to what's going on in other places. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Justin. We now have Ron Josey of Citi. Please go ahead as soon you\u2019re ready, Ron. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Peter I just wanted to follow up on your comments around grabbing back share and the mix shift to direct. Can you just help us understand over time or talk to us how this has just evolved over time and maybe the mix of direct between mobile web and app and I think I've heard you use the term we've got blunter instrument several times today, I think as we talk about moving upstream to LTV. Just talk to us about how these instruments could become sharper? What are you looking for? What needs to happen to be more efficient as we attract these LTV customers? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes. So to be specific, and I don't want to underwrite our instruments, but our goal is true granular understanding of every customer's lifetime value, and the difference of where those customers emanate from and what actions they take that indicate and drive, higher lifetime value. That is the holy grail of understanding customer value, and trying -- and getting super sharp and efficient on buying, as best you can all the right customers. Right now, we've given you some basic ideas, which is we know members perform much better. We know app users perform much better. We know, if they have both they performed much better. But that obviously, is a broad brush, not the finest brush you can have. And we ultimately want to have a very fine brush, so that we can know, if we find people in a certain performance channel, they're more likely to perform a certain way, maybe by geo, maybe by product that they come in on et cetera. So we want to have all that scope of information, and that involves understanding all our customers in a common way. As we've talked about many times, we have data on our customers that were in silos, because they were Hotels.com customers, or Expedia customers or Vrbo customers or Orbitz customers, or you name it. And as we continue to consolidate the data, as we continue to consolidate those customer files and as we get everybody essentially into one broad loyalty program, we will be able to understand customers at a much more granular level and that will give us more tools. I'm not saying our blunt tools, aren't good tools. They're just not as fine, as we can someday hope to get to. And then, as we add personalization on top of that, we will have a bunch more drivers that allow us to trigger more high LTV events. So, there's a lot of opportunity in that still to come. We're doing lots of good stuff now, but it will get better and better over time. And as far as grabbing back share, and mix shift to direct, we basically said, as I alluded to in general, we're willing to give up unprofitable short-term traffic for longer-term gains. That involves buying somewhat different kinds of traffic. As Eric alluded to, we've been much more leaned into a cap acquisition and other opportunities where we know there's more value. And that involves again, making short-term trade-offs whether it's in technical transitions where we have to give up something in the short-term, to move faster. So we've been willing to do that, and give up some of the historically highly unprofitable, the last incremental performance marketing customer purchase. So that's kind of what we've been going through. But we're getting better at understanding and being able to drive member sign-up. We were never that great, at getting sort of the owned sign-ups as honed as we wanted to do, getting the owned app downloads going faster. So every time we make that better, we see more opportunity then to drive into okay, now we can acquire this set of customers and they'll perform better, because we can get them into these high lifetime value activities and then we get more value -- drive more value out of them long term. So that's what I'm talking about, in terms of grabbing back share, where we can grabbing back opportunities. And these things are not perfect. And as we see veins to drive, we are looking for more and more veins to drive, that will drive growth and ultimately drive share. Q \u2013 Ron Josey : Very, helpful. Thank you, Peter. A \u2013 Peter Kern : You, bet. Thanks, Ron Operator : Thank you. I would like to hand back to -- our final question will be from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Jed Kelly : Hi. Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. Just two if I may. One, can you talk about how the stronger US dollar, could benefit your long-haul international business potentially into next year? And are you developing any strategies around that given your higher North American base? And then two, just Peter you mentioned, you're seeing stronger Vrbo supply gains over your largest competitor. Can you talk about where that's coming? Is that coming more from the property managers or individual homes? Thank you. A \u2013 Peter Kern : Sure. I'll take the last one first. So those gains have been sort of broad. We have a very good presence with the property managers. We always have. I think we're probably the \u2013 certainly, in North America, we're the preferred partner, for most of them or many of them. But I think what we've been focused on is really driving a systemic approach, to adding supply in the places where we have the highest demand, where we know we can drive performance for our supply partners the homeowner or the management company. Certainly, successful management companies that acquire more properties, become managers of more properties is a great vein for us because they're already working with us. They know how to work with us, and they can put those properties into the system. But we are also adding direct homeowners, at a pretty strong basis. So it's kind of both veins. There's no, we're all in on one or the other. We're trying to find the right supply and the right markets, whoever happens to be managing that or owning that. And then as far as the US dollar goes, I would say, long haul again remains -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks remains considerably down still. Those planes are -- there's 30% -- less airlift. And I think in U.S. to EMEA and EMEA to U.S. it's about down 20%. And if any of you have traveled you've seen that prices are through the roof. So the airlines have been fairly content to run with less capacity and higher RevPAR which makes sense revenue per air mile. But I think over time as that comes back there will be demand. I think the U.S. dollar being strong given our strength in the U.S. and continued demand patterns which seem to want to travel considerably still augurs well for international travel and long-haul travel. I think the only constraint is just what's pricing going to be and how much airlift is there really in those channels. But strong U.S. dollar definitely is a good sign for U.S. international travel. So -- and that's always been a strong suit of ours. So we hope that continues to be a strong opportunity. And into 2023, we'll see what happens with the dollar and with the recessions or not around the world, but we're optimistic about how that trade is working right now for us. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Eric Hart : One quick thing to add as well which is not necessarily your question but I think it might be helpful to you all which is just around -- we didn't spend a lot of time in this call on constant currencies or FX impacts to our P&L just given our weighting to the U.S. market to your question, but if we did adjust on a constant currency basis as compared to 2021 our EBITDA would have been 4% higher in Q2. Yeah. So there we've got a slight detriment or knockdown in our EBITDA. So we would have had slightly higher EBITDA margins and would have had 4% higher EBITDA on the quantum of dollars as well. So again not your question, I do think we've got an opportunity from a marketing perspective all else equal with a strong dollar sending U.S. residents or Americans into Europe, but there's also some adjustments or some impacts to this quarter as well. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Eric Hart : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines. And have a nice day.",

My name is Nadia, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to SVP, Corporate Development, Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group\u2019s earnings call for the third quarter of 2022 that ended September 30.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you, Harshit. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before we get started with the update on the quarter, I\u2019d like to formally welcome our new CFO, Julie Whalen to her first earnings call. I\u2019m excited to add Julie to our leadership team during 10 years as CFO at Williams-Sonoma, she helped drive significant growth in the business and in shareholder returns. I\u2019ve also worked alongside Julie on our board since 2019 and she has chaired our audit committee since 2020. So she comes with a great sense of our strategic priorities and what we\u2019re trying to achieve. I look forward to the expertise she can bring to our finance org and across our entire company. Now moving into the quarter. We were very pleased with our record breaking performance in the third quarter. We delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue and adjusted EBITDA, the ladder exceeding $1 billion for the first time in our history. We also delivered record third quarter lodging gross bookings. Despite some macroeconomic uncertainty and some short-term impact from Hurricane Ian, travel demand does remain strong and ADRs remain substantially elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. This quarter, we also further delevered our balance sheet, which put us in a position to resume buying back our stock, which we continue to believe is highly undervalued. Going forward, we expect to continue to reduce leverage and return capital to our shareholders. Now moving to the B2C side of our business. As we\u2019ve discussed before, our goal is to use great product innovation and unmatched membership benefits to drive more engagement with our customers and ultimately higher lifetime value from those customers. And the two biggest drivers of lifetime value are improving loyalty, membership and app usage. I\u2019m proud to announce that in Q3 we reached an all-time high and active loyalty members surpassing 2019 levels in August. New Expedia customers that became loyalty members in the quarter group by nearly 50% versus third quarter 2019. And the rollout of our unified loyalty program, one key is on track for next year, which will be a big catalyst for continued membership growth. Our app downloads continue to be strong as well. But even more important than downloads app usages at an all-time high with quarterly active app users increasing nearly 40% versus 2019. And in the quarter we continue to see almost two-thirds of all gross bookings result from direct traffic. We are also continuing to see leverage versus 2019 when we compare our all up marketing spend against booked gross profit. And as a reminder, this spend includes direct marketing, but also discounting and loyalty spend, which are recorded as contra-revenues. In terms of our marketing mix, we have been shifting towards longer term channels including app downloads and other methods to capture traveler intent outside of classic performance channels. These longer term marketing investments, including loyalty and brand, are helping us build a larger base of long-term high value customers. But as important as marketing is, we are ultimately marketing a product and the product has to be great. So most of our energy is going into product innovation to build the best customer experience we can with the most customer benefits to drive loyalty and consumer love. Among our recent successes, we have introduced exciting new products features including price tracking, trip boards, and smart shopping, all of which are designed to engage customers, to inform customers and to ensure they\u2019re finding the right product at the right time, at the right price. So just to remind you, our flight \u2013 excuse me, our flight price tracking feature, which we launched earlier this year, has been a great engagement tool. Since launch, we have seen exceptionally high notification open rates, which demonstrate the value that our customers see in this tool. This feature\u2019s currently live on our app in the U.S. and is on track for global rollout in the first quarter of 2023. In Q3, we launch Trip Boards on brand Expedia where users can save their favorite lodging and activities and share and collaborate on trip details. This feature not only increased conversion, but has helped us expand our base of customers through sharing with family and friends. In the first two months, since its broader launch, we saw trip board users have twice the repeat visit rate, they were twice as likely to purchase multiple products, and most importantly, they transacted at four times the conversion rate versus non-users. And as for smart shopping, which is a tool that really helps travelers comparing and choosing between available rooms for a given property. We began leveraging machine learning recommendations to better match our customers with the right product and options. This has led to better consumer outcomes, more premium product sales for our partners, and ultimately higher value transactions for us. In addition to these new features during Q3, we finished the migration of the Hotels.com front end onto the Expedia platform, which allowed us to accelerate our optimization programs across our entire conventional lodging portfolio. While we are just getting started, the ability to test and deploy faster across one platform is already driving higher customer conversion, better customer experience, and improved signups to our loyalty program. So overall, we\u2019ve seen a great reception from customers on these new features and benefits. And for us it has led to increased engagement, better conversion, and higher revenue per customer. I\u2019m really excited about the success we have seen so far and we have a bunch of new features in the pipeline and a terrific opportunity to roll out all of these features worldwide. Moving on to the B2B front. We remain bullish on this massive opportunity and excited about our expanding role in the travel ecosystem. Everything we are doing on the main technology stack for our B2C products will have benefits that inure to the B2B business, as well as a ton of work we are doing specific to the B2B business that will lead to new products, new partners, and new revenue streams. In the third quarter B2B continue to demonstrate success with growth across our key product lines as we want wallet share with many of our existing partners driven by our expanded capabilities and improved product offerings. As excited as we are about the momentum in our existing business, we continue to build, pilot, and deploy new products and services for our open world platform. This quarter we signed the first pilot partner for our best-in-class fraud prevention product, and next year we plan to continue to deliver more new commercial products and services. I\u2019m really excited about what\u2019s on our roadmap for B2B and the reception we\u2019ve been getting from the industry. So to sum it all up, we delivered another record quarter of results, rolled out more products, features and member benefits, and continue to add significantly to our member base and our app usage. All of which, will be great for our future performance and builds the base that we are looking for to grow in the future. So all in all, we\u2019re feeling really good about our progress, not least of all because of the phenomenal team of people we\u2019ve assembled to drive all of our acceleration. And with that, I will pass it off to one of our newest, Julie. Julie Whalen : Thanks, Peter and hello everyone. I\u2019m excited to be here and to be a part of the team. As you may or may not know, I\u2019ve been on the board here since 2019. So, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to develop a great deal of respect and admiration for the leadership team and the growth strategy that the company is executing against. And I know there is significant opportunity for growth and profitability ahead of us. And I look forward to helping the company to deliver against these growth initiatives and to maximize shareholder returns. As it relates specifically to the third quarter, we are pleased to see the continued momentum in our business. Resulting in revenue and profitability to levels we haven\u2019t seen before, which clearly speaks to the early success we are seeing with our initiatives to drive long-term profitable growth. As far as the details regarding our financial performance for the quarter, similar to previous earnings calls, I will discuss our revenue related and adjusted EBITDA growth metrics, both on a reported and like-for-like basis. The like-for-like growth rates excludes contribution from a Egencia, Amex GBT and the non-lodging elements of our Chase relationship. And as a reminder, on November 1, 2021, we completed the sale of a Egencia and our EPS business entered into a 10-year lodging supply agreement with Amex GBT. We believe these like-for-like numbers are helpful in assessing the performance of our business. It is also important to note that our third quarter growth rates as compared to 2019 were negatively impacted by FX headwinds of approximately 200 basis points to gross bookings and revenue and 300 basis points to adjusted EBITDA. Moving on to the gross booking trends in the quarter. Total gross bookings were down 11% on a reported basis and down 2% on a like-for-like basis versus the third quarter of 2019. Total gross bookings for the quarter were impacted primarily by the industry-wide slowdown we saw in early July. However, since early July, we saw trends meaningfully improved, primarily driven by lodging bookings growth, our largest line of business with continued ADR strength. Total lodging gross bookings, which were the highest Q3 on record grew 5% on a reported basis and grew 7% on a like-for-like basis versus Q3 2019. The cadence throughout the quarter was consistent with the trends in total gross bookings. Lodging gross bookings on a reported basis was down 1% in July and the rest of the quarter rebound it\u2019s up 9% in August and up 6% in September, which was impacted by Hurricane Ian. October was also impacted by the hurricane, but was still up approximately 5%. If not for the hurricane, both September and October would\u2019ve been relatively in line with August. Overall, we are pleased to see strong demand extended to the fourth quarter as consumers continue to prioritize travel spend over other discretionary spending. And while it is still early in the quarter, we are seeing total lodging bookings for stays expected to occur in the balance of the year and into 2023 continuing to outage 2019 levels. Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&L, starting with total revenue. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 2% on a reported basis and up 5% on a like-for-like basis versus Q3 2019. It was great to see another quarter positive and sequentially improving revenue growth. Our revenue margin also improved to 15% for the quarter or up approximately 190 basis points versus Q3 2019. This revenue strength resulted from a mixed shift towards our lodging business, including our higher ADR Vrbo business. Cost of sales in the third quarter was $451 million, which was down 17% versus 2019, driven by cost reductions, primarily resulting from our investiture of Egencia and from ongoing efficiency across our customer support operations resulting from the automation initiatives we have been implementing over the past couple of years. Direct sales and marketing expense in the third quarter was $1.5 billion, which was up 8% versus 2019, which includes spend with a longer term return profile to drive more profitable future growth. As a reminder, we are focused on acquiring high lifetime value customers. As a result, we are allocating more marketing dollars on channels that have a longer term return profile, such as brand awareness, loyalty and paid app installs, which as Peter mentioned, are already beginning to drive growth in loyalty members and app usage. Our sales and marketing expense is also impacted by an increase in commissions paid to our partners, which is a direct reflection of the accelerating growth we continue to see in our core B2B business. Overhead expenses were $569 million, down $144 million or 20% versus the third quarter 2019. We continue to remain disciplined on our cost structure and are always looking for ways to drive more efficiency. Overhead expenses slightly increased from the second quarter, approximately $19 million or 3%, primarily associated with our ongoing focus on investing in top talent across our product and technology teams to help accelerate our various platform initiatives, which we believe will ultimately drive future top-line growth and margin expansion. These results with another quarter of strong revenue and expense discipline allowed us to deliver our highest quarter profitability on record. Adjusted EBITDA grew 18% versus third quarter 2019 and grew 20% on a like-for-like basis to $1.1 billion. The adjusted EBITDA margin was nearly 30% in expansion of approximately 420 basis points over the third quarter in 2019 on a reported basis. Free cash flow, with negative $1.2 billion in the third quarter and over $200 million improvement over prior year due to higher EBITDA levels. As a reminder, the third quarter is a negative free cash flow quarter due to the seasonality of the business. Year-to-date, our free cash flow remains strong and a positive $3.1 billion more than double where we were year-to-date in 2019. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity, a $7.1 billion from both our unrestricted cash and our undrawn revolving line of credit, which provides us with ample access to cash to operate the business. This quarter, we continue to focus on delevering our balance sheet, improving our leverage ratios, and solidifying our investment grade rating. As a result in September, we redeemed an additional $500 million of our senior notes as part of a tender offer resulting in a total repayment of debt and preferred equity of $3.4 billion over the last 18 months. These balance sheet actions, along with our significant growth in adjusted EBITDA has enabled us the additional flexibility to begin returning capital to shareholders again. As such, we were purchased approximately $200 million or 2 million shares through October and have approximately 21 million shares remaining under our existing authorization for future repurchases. As we move forward, given our strong liquidity, our confidence in the business, and the fact our stock continues to be highly undervalued, we expect to further delever the balance sheet and continue returning capital shareholders the form of share buybacks. In summary, our third quarter results demonstrate some of the early wins we are starting to see from the transformation of the business and the success of our strategic growth initiatives. These early wins give us confidence that there\u2019s a huge opportunity in front of us to drive long-term profitable growth and to maximize shareholder value. And I could be more thrilled to be a part of this company and this leadership team as we unlock this significant opportunity for growth together. And I look forward to getting to know all of you in the travel investment community soon. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today goes to Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Eric, please go ahead. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question, maybe two, if I can. First, in terms of the broader end demand environment, I think there continues to be a lot of investor questions about levels of ADRs as you look out through the December quarter and into next year, or elements of how you\u2019re thinking about the booking windows more broadly. And any sense you can give us of the way you\u2019re thinking about what you see in the business today against elements of potentially more volatile macroeconomic environment as we moved into next year, that\u2019d be number one. And appreciate all the color on the capital return. Are there any guardrails we should be keeping in mind around levels of gross debt or net debt that you want to sort of keep front of mind for investors in terms of what might balance prudence versus capital return over the over the next couple years? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Thanks, Eric. I\u2019ll take the first part first. I think this is consistent with a lot of what you\u2019ve heard from the travel industry over the last couple weeks based on what we\u2019ve seen. But there really haven\u2019t been any material signs of fall off in demand for ADR for that matter in the world. There is a little bit of geographical mix change, APAC sort of coming back now with the opening of Japan and a few other markets. So there\u2019s a little balanced shift issues and there could be ADR change because of mix for certain players including us. But there has been no real let up in ADR and there has been no real let up in demand. We still see pacing\u2019s for the rest of this year and next year, considerably above where we were in 2019. So, I think, there\u2019s a lot we all think about and watch the NBC or whatever, but so far there\u2019s really no evidence to suggest there\u2019s some bigger macroeconomic thing happening. Julie Whalen : And as far as capital allocation, I would just say that first of all we\u2019re, pleased that we\u2019re in a much stronger position that we\u2019ve been in the past. We\u2019ve seen improving profitability, obviously I mentioned that we, at record levels of EBITDA, this has enabled us to generate strong cash flow, strong free cash flow. It\u2019s enabled us to delever more in the balance sheet and resume our share buyback program, which we\u2019ve stopped for a little bit. And so going forward, given the strength in our position certainly this enables us to continue to delever and buy back more stock, which we think is the right thing to do, certainly by, delevering on the balance sheet, it in four, fives our investment grade rating and gives us more flexibility to be able to return more to shareholders, which we think is the right thing to do. Certainly given the fact that we are very confident in the future growth of our business, that our stock is highly undervalued, that we have strong liquidity and we have 21 million shares remaining on our existing share purchase authorization to do buyback. So obviously with that in mind, we think it\u2019s the right thing to do going forward. Eric Sheridan : Great, thank you. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question Naved Khan of Truist. Naved, please go ahead. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yes, thanks a lot. Two questions, so first maybe just on the expense side of things, given the uncertain macro, how are you thinking about growing the fixed expense over the next 12 months or so? And then maybe just on the another sort of macro question. Are you seeing any kind of sort of consumer demand shift in terms of either trade downs or maybe consumer sort of looking to book maybe drive to versus fly to kind of destinations? Peter Kern : Yes, thanks, Naved. So on the expense side; I would say, Julie mentioned we\u2019ve been trying to hold the line pretty clearly. Obviously there\u2019s been inflation over the last few years, particularly in people. And we\u2019ve certainly invested in people to build all the technology that we want, et cetera. But as I\u2019ve also mentioned before, we see plenty of opportunity ahead to become more efficient. So, we will keep a pretty tight hand on fixed expenses going into next year. And again, as technology delivers, we think there\u2019s lots of opportunity to continue to become more efficient. We think we can drive growth certainly without much more fixed investment and there\u2019s more opportunities for efficiency than there are for increased investment. So, we are pushing hard to get across the line on a number of technology fronts. We have, we\u2019ve built up in some cases capacity, human capacity to do some of that work. But overall we think that\u2019s a general directional move towards greater efficiency. So, we\u2019ll hold the line, but we expect longer term, more efficiency coming out of the business. And then as far as the often asked question about consumer demand, the answer is no. We have not seen trade downs. We have not seen any major moves, shifts in demand patterns. Obviously putting hurricane aside, which this lodges people and things like that, it\u2019s really been a very steady, very strong demand picture. As you know, we\u2019ve been differently selective about the traffic and the consumers we\u2019re looking to get and how we\u2019re building them up into long-term valuable customers. But overall, the macro demand seems quite strong still. And as I said that the pacing\u2019s for next year are strong, so a lot to still be filled in next year, but so far we haven\u2019t seen any of it. Naved Khan : Thank you, Peter. Peter Kern : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And the next question goes to Lee Horowitz of Deutsche Bank. Lee, please go ahead. Your line is open. Lee Horowitz : Great, thanks. Maybe just one on sales and marketing. We continue to see that deleverage a little bit, say quarter-on-quarter and versus 2019 as a percentage of bookings, getting your investments in longer dated ROI initiatives. I guess my question here is, what sort of timeframe should we be thinking about it in order to see the ROI and these investments flow through the P&L and begin to see some of the sales of marketing leverage and some of the initiatives that you\u2019ve taken across the sales and marketing organization to drive leverage longer term, play themselves through? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Yes, thanks, Lee. So, I think the answer to that is, we are already seeing benefit, but we are also investing more benefit back into long-term ROI. So, you\u2019re sort of not seeing the net benefit, if you will. But as we believe that as we build that base of customers, as I mentioned, our membership base is now high \u2013 our active membership base is now higher than it\u2019s ever been and growing faster than it ever has. Our app usage, likewise and that all gives us the ability to build more direct traffic, which gives us the ability to invest in driving more direct traffic. Now, those lines will start to separate over time, and we will get, we believe the margin expansion and the incremental leverage. But right now we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019ve still been refilling the bucket to drive in essence use this base of high LTV customers to drive as much or more demand that we used to get just by buying traffic out of the marketplace and having them be non-members and anonymous customers. So it\u2019s really a transition we\u2019re going through and we think that separation will come, but we are continuing and we\u2019ll continue in the fourth quarter to invest in these longer dated return opportunities like apps, et cetera. So, we think we\u2019ll continue to see that. We think we\u2019re already seeing it, but it\u2019s hard to see from the outside. You\u2019ll see the separation overtime as we continue to build that base of members higher and higher and higher. And then as to your question on more broadly, how that affects us, I guess going forward, I think we will watch that, we will put the money back in, but we expect to see expanding leverage in this as we go forward. I would just add that we have the loyalty program, one key rolling out next year that would expand loyalty to many customers who weren\u2019t in the program before. We think that\u2019s going to drive a lot of business, but it will again, drive a little bit of noise as you \u2013 as we try to help you figure out where the leverage is. So just fair warning like, it\u2019s a great opportunity, but in terms of like this linear road, it\u2019s going to be a little bumpy as we roll some of these things out and we\u2019ll help you understand those as we go. Lee Horowitz : Understood. Helpful. Thank you. Peter Kern : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And the next question goes to Kevin Kopelman of Cowen. Kevin, please go ahead. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Yes. Thanks. Appreciate it. A couple of quick follow ups there. Could you give a little bit more color on how you\u2019re thinking about the, the one key launch and the type of investment that will be needed in that launch for next year? And also as you\u2019re thinking about app downloads and longer term or longer dated returns on those channels, how long is that when you are acquiring new customers through that channel? Is it six months? Is it a year? How are you thinking about that? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes, I\u2019ll maybe take those in reverse, Kevin. On the, when we think about LTV, it\u2019s over a longer horizon. It\u2019s usually 18 months to 24 months. So we\u2019re not, and, as you all know, travel for many people\u2019s not a, five times a year kind of thing. It can be a twice a year, once a year kind of thing. So it does take a little longer, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, for some of these LTV investments to return. But that\u2019s how we think about that timeline is, we\u2019re sort of normalizing it over more like an 18 month to 24 month period as opposed to six months or something like that. And that\u2019s really the tradeoffs you\u2019re making in many cases, is buying that very short term intent, perhaps unprofitably versus buying long-term intent and long-term LTV, but it takes longer to pay out. So that\u2019s the trade we\u2019ve making with a portion of our investment. It\u2019s not everything, obviously, but we have directed money that used to be in that short-term intent bucket into these longer term buckets. So that\u2019s why it takes time. It\u2019s why we didn\u2019t pivot at all at once, because it takes time to build those customer bases that are those high LTV customer, customer bases that are then paying out at higher levels than the short term intent that we used to buy. So that\u2019s how we think about that. It\u2019s a balance and we\u2019re constantly balancing it. As far as one key goes, we will launch next year. We will incorporate Vrbo customers among others into the plan. We will try to move customers who are in other brands, into the brands that have loyalty. So everything, we want everybody in the loyalty bucket. The value, as you know, we\u2019ve had many different plans of many different values. We will normalize around one single value for everything for the currency. And we think, we\u2019ve settled in a place that will be, very good for the customers. They\u2019re gaining flexibility, they\u2019re gaining the opportunity to use the value on all our products, which is highly valuable and we know they want it. And yes, we will have more customers in that base, so we would expect that base to grow over time. But the short-term movements will be sort of the movement between putting Vrbo customers into the pace, changing the some of the platforms like the Hotels.com platform, the stamps platform into a points platform and so forth. And so there\u2019ll be some short-term puts and takes, but over time it\u2019s something we think will grow at a rational level. It\u2019s not going to spike to some crazy number. It\u2019s not going to shrink. But it\u2019s going to, we\u2019re going to retake that capital, deploy it better across our entire customer base, and then hopefully if it\u2019s successful, which we believe it will be, it will continue to build on itself and more people will join and we think the economics of that are very attractive. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks Peter. Peter Kern : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And the next question, goes to Deepak Mathivanan of Wolfe Research. Deepak, please go ahead. Your line is open. Jack Matten : Hey guys, this is Jack on for Deepak. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted talk about Vrbo real quick. Just providing any maybe high level trends here, I just seeing there, how it came out of the summer travel season and maybe expectations into the holiday season, and then sort of related there as well any trends in ADR as you\u2019re sitting for Vrbo? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes, thanks Jack. I think, our broad comments hold for Vrbo as well. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of ADR pressure or anything that\u2019s really noticeable. ADRs have held up very strongly and holiday demand has, is strong and facing well. We did see disruption. We are \u2013 we have a pretty good base of business in South Florida, and hurricane did some damage, which [indiscernible] with our, September and October report results. But and we think by now most of that, it\u2019s never a 100% will get replaced into other properties and other spots so that, there\u2019s a little bit of overhang from losing that supply for a little bit of time. But in general, we\u2019re pushing much harder into growing supply. Now, again we are seeing ADRs hold up and so far, the business broadly remains strong. Again, you will see pockets of change as the world evolves as certain, as APAC opens up versus, maybe we all worry about EMEA\u2019s economy or something like. There may be shifts slightly. But broadly, we have not seen anything that is affecting the overall business. Jack Matten : Great. Thank you. Peter Kern : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And the next question goes to Lloyd Wamsley of UBS. Lloyd, please go ahead. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Great. Thanks. I wanted to go back to kind of the rollout of the integrated loyalty program and just understand the short-term trade-offs versus the long-term payback to the extent you feel like you have visibility on it. Just thinking back to the last time we saw this in 2011 and 2012, scaling up Expedia\u2019s loyalty program and globally expanding the Hotels.com program, it did seem to drive a headwind to revenue take rate. And so with Vrbo not having a program prior to this, it would seem like it could be a take rate headwind in 2023. So what kind of magnitude should we think about on that side? And then how long will it take to get that to a state where you can sort of wind back the marketing spend and reap the benefits of the rewards of that loyalty program on the positive side? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Lloyd. I think the way we think about it is we\u2019re going to balance \u2013 we think of our portfolio of tools, including loyalty, regular way marketing, this discounting and other tools we use to drive sales. We think of that as one pool of capital that we\u2019re investing to drive as award next year\u2019s results.  And so there are some things happening, including the ramp-up of loyalty that we are balancing against other types of investments. So there is a little noise potentially, as you point out, between take rate, which is the contra revenue stuff above the line versus conventional sales and marketing below the line. But from our perspective, we look at it as one pool of capital, and we are trying to balance the investment and driving that long term. We think that loyalty hook of getting all of those Vrbo members been attached to our other brands and attached to our other products is going to drive a very nice result. Now it\u2019s not instantaneous as you point out, it\u2019s not like spending on Meta. It takes time. They rack up points; they wait for their next trip, whatever. But we think that\u2019s a big benefit in terms of expanding our base of customers, expanding our direct traffic, et cetera. So yes, there will be some \u2013 there may be some, I guess, I would say, across the P&L., there may be some movement top to bottom is a little more moves into loyalty perhaps when something gets taken out in some of the perhaps direct S&M spend, but we are looking to balance that whole thing. And as we get closer to it, we will give you insight into how to think about looking at the P&L going forward. But in general, we think we will balance it out. It\u2019s just that there could be some small movements as we light up the programs and certain programs get changed from one brand to another. There may be some balance sheet adjustments for accruals and other things, noise like that. But in terms of driving the real P&L and real cash flow, we think we\u2019ve got enough things to offset it and some other opportunities to expand margins at Vrbo that we can pretty much absorb it and chew it up in other places and again, manage that balance as we go forward of driving these long-term investments as against the short-term loans. Lloyd Walmsley : Yes. Yes, that makes sense. It seems like your take rate is below the kind of competitive environment for shorter. So that seems like one area and you could pick up for it. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s one of the ideas, but curious anything you could share there. Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. I think, look, we are under our competitors. We are thoughtful about how we want to deal with that with \u2013 for our host partners and for our consumers, there\u2019s volume trade-offs for cost when you increase take rates as well. So there\u2019s a bunch of things to balance, but we are looking at all of those things and have opportunity. Lloyd Walmsley : All right, thanks. Peter Kern : Yep, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question go to Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions please. First, could you just address the issue of whether there are material share shifts going on in North America in the lodging market? And then secondly, I think you just touched briefly in the last question or two on Asia Pacific. To what extent have you \u2013 just any color commentary on \u2013 I think that\u2019s sort of the last not shoe to drop, but shoe to rise. So just what that recovery path looks like for that region? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes, sure. Thanks, Mark. I would say to address your first question, some of what we saw in, let\u2019s call it, the middle of the summer, and I talked about some of this on our last quarterly numbers, we had \u2013 we were moving platforms. We were doing a variety of things. We were \u2013 and pulled back on some discounting and some other things where the competition have been very heavy. We\u2019ve seen that normalize and we are \u2013 we don\u2019t see, if anything, we think we\u2019re gaining ground, but there hasn\u2019t been a continued erosion. And I think you can see that in the relative growth rates, although again, we are still being more selective about the business we buy and everything else, we are stable and others have seen growth rates decline. But \u2013 so we think the U.S. is pretty stable to slightly in our favor. And again, we believe that as we continue to build this base of business and base of members, which is largely U.S.-driven given our relative strength in the U.S. that starts to be a repeating underpinning of our business, that drives us up as just buying in meta, the old-fashioned way that the \u2013 the ground board took place. So we think we\u2019re setting up quite well for that, and we like our position there. Obviously, we would have liked to not give up some free room nights, but not all room nights are valuable and not all room nights are profitable and we don\u2019t view it as strictly a room night game. So \u2013 but we\u2019re setting up well, and we like our position, and that noise has definitely stabilized from when we were doing all the platform transitions. As far as APAC goes, I wish it were a bigger part of our business. It\u2019s not a huge part of our business. We have a very nice B2B business there that\u2019s been largely stifled by the closed APAC market, so as our B2B \u2013 B2C business. And our B2C business, like many parts of the world, is much more internationally driven. So even though there has been some opening; Japan has opened up; somewhat Korea; China, not yet; it\u2019s been more domestic travel than international. International airlift, Asia is still much more reduced than the rest of the world. So I think we\u2019ll see that come back. I think you\u2019ll probably see some shift if Europe slows down, you\u2019ll see airlift move to APAC, if APAC is opening up and you\u2019ll see opportunities. Obviously, currency will play a role in where people are willing to go and how far their money goes in different regions. Again, we think that\u2019s probably net good for us being relatively heavy in North America where the dollar is strong. But again, we expect that to open up sequentially. Hopefully, China will open at some point this coming year, and we have a very good relationship with Ctrip and power a lot of their outbound international travel. So I think there\u2019s opportunity for us, but that is the next shoe to drop. We agree with that. That will be the next rising tide as it were we reversed our stories and the rest of the world, we\u2019ll see. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Peter. Peter Kern : Yep, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question goes to Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks. Vrbo recently came with its known tech stack and there are different value propositions from the front end versus HCOM and Expedia. But is there more leverage to be gained there? Can we get an update on the progress of back in front of unification work? And then it just seems, Peter you mentioned Trip Boards and smart shopping and airfare tracker just this may be stating the obvious. The rate of iteration or testing or innovation is accelerating. Is that true now that you have a more homogenized base of technology and tools and should we expect more of the same? Peter Kern : Yes. I mean we\u2019re pushing in heavily into that. I would segment the last part to say there\u2019s testing and optimization work, which is ramping up significantly right now and was what was sort of on hiatus in the middle of the year as we were moving Hotels.com. That\u2019s now allowed us to be in a new position to roll out innovation winners, et cetera, across a much wider base and to test across a much wider base of our consumers. Your first question, Vrbo, that\u2019s still on its own stack. It is next up. It is literally going to start testing traffic on the single platform by the end of this year, before the end of this year. But it will be a gentle \u2013 we mean to disrupt it as little as possible. But that, again, will give us potential future innovation. Now the Vrbo stack and the Vrbo shopping experience is a quite different thing than conventional lodging and shopping, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar. So the ability to test the same types of winners across conventional lodging and Vrbo may not be quite as dramatic. But there are a lot of cross-cutting benefits like trip planning potentially or checkout or other things that will work for multiple products. So it\u2019s all on a journey there. Vrbo\u2019s the next to go. But I\u2019d say the big benefit on the conventional lodging side, we\u2019ve gotten across and now we are starting to iterate significantly on. And then the future part whether it\u2019s trip planning or flight tracking or other things, that\u2019s really another category that\u2019s like innovating into new ways of shopping, new ways of sharing and collaborating, and we think that\u2019s the future of the business. We think there hasn\u2019t been much innovation in the space. We want to lead in this space. We \u2013 the consumer adoption has been very good. But of course, we\u2019ve got to get it everywhere on everything. And we\u2019ve got to keep going. So we really want to differentiate on the product, on the benefits of being a member, including loyalty, but also pricing and packaging and other capabilities. All of that, we think is what makes the product sticky. We\u2019re doing a much better job of it now, but we will do a much, much better job of going into next year. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks Peter. Appreciate it. Peter Kern : Yes, you bet. Operator : Thank you. And the next question goes to Anthony Post [ph] of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Antony, please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. A couple of questions for you. First, Peter, you look at \u2013 traditionally, we look at marketing to bookings, and I think you\u2019re kind of arguing we should look at gross profit, which is up since 2019. So can you just kind of help people understand how you\u2019re looking at your marketing spend maybe differently than the old management team? And then Julie, welcome aboard. I think the stock has been under pressure. There\u2019s been a little disappointment that some of the margin improvement that was kind of speculated on after the cost cuts in 2000 hasn\u2019t been as evident. Is there an opportunity to kind of \u2013 and maybe not on this call, of course, but in the future, give some guideposts for long-term margins for the company to help the Street? Thank you. Peter Kern : Thanks, Anthony. I\u2019ll take the marketing point first. I can\u2019t speak to prior management. I think it is slightly different, though. The point I mentioned about thinking of the whole pool of spend on customers, be it loyalty, direct marketing brand, et cetera. That\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it now, which was not entirely held and looked at before. These are all from our perspective, ways to drive transactions, drive value and we\u2019re looking at that as a complete pool of spend. So that\u2019s different. And then yes, we think you have to look at it relative to GP because volume by room nights is not relevant, right? It has to be a question of how much GP you\u2019re deriving on a given transaction because ultimately, GP is what turns into real margin into a real contribution. So we are \u2013 if you use that room was $100 and now $200 or our take was $100 on transaction and now it\u2019s $200, you\u2019re not going to bid the same thing you would bid or invest the same thing you would invest to get a $100 transaction, you\u2019d be willing to invest more to get a $200 transaction. So you have to look at it at as GP. We recognize it\u2019s challenging for the outside world to know what our booked GP is but we\u2019re trying to express to everybody that, that is the \u2013 from our perspective, the right way to look at it. You are investing a portion of your profits back into keeping the machine growing. And that is how we look at it. So I\u2019d say the big differences are we\u2019re looking at it at the entire pool, not discrete, like loyalty can be X, but marketing should be Y or it\u2019s all about direct marketing as a percentage of revenue, right? That\u2019s not the right math from our perspective. But we recognize that it makes it more complex to understand from the outside because booked GP is obviously correlated to booked room nights is correlated to other things. But there\u2019s noise in it because most of us have here and other things floating through the gross booking lines, and it gets a little confusing. So \u2013 but that is how we look at it. That is how we think it\u2019s the right way to look at it. And as I\u2019ve said a couple of times, it\u2019s all for us about balancing this journey into this long-term investment pool without over-indexing to it and giving up too much short-term business but getting there over time because we believe it\u2019s absolutely the right answer to long-term profitable growth with higher margins, et cetera. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing into, and that\u2019s that we totally believe in that model. Julie Whalen : Hi Anthony, nice to meet you. Regarding your margin comment, obviously, that is something we\u2019re very focused on. I mean, certainly, in 2021, we took $1 billion of cost out and that certainly was the start of our hampering improvement. And if you look even through the third quarter today, we\u2019re at 30% margin, which is over 400 basis points over 2019 levels. So, we\u2019re still holding those cost savings from where they were with some slight movements here and there. But certainly, even as Peter mentioned earlier, we\u2019re all about still maintaining efficiency, maintaining a culture of strong financial discipline. And certainly, that\u2019s something that I look forward to bringing to the table as well. It\u2019s something that\u2019s in my track record. And so there\u2019ll be things that we\u2019re going to continue to look for and drive that margin even higher. And certainly, all the things that we\u2019re doing from a strategic growth initiative perspective is all about driving profitable revenue and not just driving revenue at any cost. And so therefore, we do expect to have margin expansion over time. I mean setting a target is always difficult, because then you set a target we want to be even higher. So, I think at this moment, we\u2019re just focused on growing that margin as fast as we can as a result of all of our strategic initiatives. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question go to Tom Champion of Piper Sandler. Tom, please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Champion : Hi, good afternoon. Peter, I don\u2019t know if you could add any comments on the B2B business and the opportunity there. Revenue in the quarter was obviously very strong. But just any highlights from your perspective? And then Julie, likewise, it\u2019s great to speak with you this afternoon. I\u2019m curious if you could just talk a little bit about what attracted you to the role and the opportunity? You\u2019re obviously familiar with the company, but just curious if you could elaborate on that and maybe your areas of focus into 2023? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Tom. I\u2019ll go first. I think B2B has been doing extremely well for us. We view it as a tactical way to play in some parts of the world. Where we don\u2019t play a B2C business, we view it as an opportunity to grow, grow our number of partners, grow our wallet share, as I referenced, and of course, grow our product offerings. And we\u2019ve had incremental improvement over the years as we\u2019ve added things like our wholesale business optimized distribution, which is expanding quite well. I mentioned we grew wallet share. We have many new partners in the pipeline, and we\u2019ve acquired new partners. We don\u2019t announce every one, but it\u2019s a continuing expanding base. So, we see a lot of really attractive opportunity. We think there are lots of pockets of demand out there that we have not yet reached and that are challenging to reach without going to those partners directly and those partners view us as an extremely good and safe partner in the travel space to go to because we can do everything. We do it well, and they get all the benefits of all our technological advances as we make them. So, we think there\u2019s a lot of benefits in that core business. And then as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been pushing into this idea of externalizing more of our capabilities as micro services. That\u2019s what our fraud test is about. We will test many other things this coming year, and we\u2019re piloting them with different partners. But it\u2019s a real opportunity for us to take our technological advances and bring them to the industry and help create greater efficiency in our partners running their businesses and then ultimately expand the universe of partners who can sell travel. So that goes to social commerce and other things that have been talked about in other industries, but we\u2019re really in a pretty unique position to do that at scale as we roll out these technical capabilities. So, we\u2019re extremely bullish there. We\u2019ve expanded and improved our partnerships with many of our biggest supply partners through these kind of technological relationships, and we\u2019re feeling quite good about it. Some of this stuff is very early. Those new products are quite early days, and they\u2019ve got to get perfected and rolled out and then scaled. But that\u2019s the pipeline of the future. And in the meantime, our core business and some of the more recent additions like our wholesale business, et cetera, are expanding quite nicely, and we continue to win business across the globe. So feeling really great about that business. Julie Whalen : Hi, Tom, Tom, it\u2019s Julie, ice to meet you as well. As far as what attracted me to come here, quite honestly, I have the benefit of being on the Board since 2019. And so because of that, I was able to certainly be involved with the management team is here and also to be sort of under the covers, if you will, with the strategic opportunities that they were executing against and certainly, of course, like some of the financials and all of the capital allocation policy and things like that. But really, the strategic initiatives that I was able to see that they were transforming the business. And some of the things they were doing are just game changers. And some of this have happened actually at my previous company. And once we have finished some of that really enables the business to take off in a big way. So, I knew they were at the pivotal point as the company to launch these changes. And so I just thought there\u2019s tremendous opportunity for growth and profitability of this company, and I wanted to be a part of it. As far as changes that could be coming down the way, I mean, first and foremost, I\u2019m just trying to learn as fast as I can, the details of the company, certainly, as I said, I knew the bigger picture. And so there\u2019s not \u2013 no plans for any major changes shorter term. But certainly, if you look back at my track record, which I mentioned earlier, certainly all about strong financial discipline, driving efficiencies, making sure we\u2019re generating investments with high returns and that we have a capital allocation policy that really favors our shareholders. And so that\u2019s something that is certainly going to be behind as we move forward and as this business continues to outperform. Tom Champion : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question go to John Colantuoni of Jefferies. John, please go ahead. Your line is open. John Colantuoni : Thanks for taking my questions. So, you\u2019ve been pretty clear about prioritizing customer LTV in your marketing approach. But I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about the opportunity cost of losing out potential customers to competitors as they remain aggressive in driving share gains in your core market? And at some point, does their aggressiveness necessitate a shift in marketing strategy towards some of those lower ROI channels in case it\u2019s reducing your opportunity to attract higher-value travelers and also to avoid the unintended impact of your pullback in those channels, helping competitors realize higher ROI because inadvertently reduced the competitiveness in the keyword bidding environment? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Peter Kern : Okay. Thanks, John. A lot to talk about there. But I would say, at a high level, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve said a couple of times now, which is it\u2019s all \u2013 you\u2019re right, it\u2019s all about balancing that, right? You\u2019re making a transition of trying to build a base of customers that actually left your product, have found benefit in your product and will drive longer-term returns. There is a lot of traffic out there every day. I think the industry has proven for decades really that there\u2019s a mass of people that are up for grabs every day. The challenge hasn\u2019t been buying them. That\u2019s just a question of how big a check you\u2019re willing to write. The challenge has been keeping them. And I think that\u2019s been true for everybody in the industry. We\u2019re really invested, as you can probably tell in making the product better, making the benefits better, making people stick and making sure they get the benefit of being with us. But of course, there\u2019s a balance to be struck. And we\u2019re not suggesting we found a perfect balance, but we\u2019re moving across a journey where we think we can get to a place where the core base of long-term valuable customers becomes a new threshold level that you\u2019re building on top of. And we also believe as the product improves and as we\u2019re better at getting people into membership and into experiencing the benefits that those otherwise cheap, less valuable pieces of business that we\u2019ve sort of assure during this period become more valuable to us over time. In other words, we\u2019ll be able to buy let\u2019s say, meta traffic or other kinds of traffic more efficiently because we\u2019re better at keeping them and turning them into long-term customers. So those things are in flux all of the time, and we are looking to optimize it all at the time. We\u2019re not looking to throw business to the wild and let somebody else get it, but we\u2019re also not willing to just be upside down at any price to buy traffic and pray. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re balancing literally every day, and we\u2019re continuing to balance. And as we plan for next year, we\u2019ll continue to balance. But we think we\u2019re directionally right. We won\u2019t be perfect, but we\u2019re directionally right. And as we continue to build up this huge base of members and reduce churn and include more of them through the broader loyalty plan, we think that\u2019s going to be incredibly valuable to us. So, we feel good about that trade. But your question is fair, and we look at it every day. And so that\u2019s \u2013 we will keep looking at it every day. John Colantuoni : Thanks. Appreciate that. And you mentioned some more opportunities to drive efficiency over time. Can you just outline some of the more impactful buckets you have for incremental efficiency gains on the fixed cost side? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. Well, I think it\u2019s twofold, right? It\u2019s both driving faster growth, which is getting some of the benefit of the members, et cetera, that we\u2019ve been stacking up low these many months and into next year and having that expansion come to more direct business that we don\u2019t have to pay to get regained. So that\u2019s where we pay through loyalty, but that\u2019s a much smaller cost to us. So that\u2019s a big area of separation, where I think the margin dollars will expand because we won\u2019t be paying incrementally all the time for the same business. And then I think on the fixed cost side, there\u2019s all kinds of efforts going on. We haven\u2019t fully optimized the cloud. But we\u2019ve moved a lot of technology into the cloud, but we have a lot of work to do. We\u2019re still synthesizing our data pools to be more efficient around data, all of those things have knock-on effects and costs in compute time and cloud. So there\u2019s a bunch of work going on there. There\u2019s a bunch of opportunity as we move to this one platform to optimize better, and every optimization is essentially a chance of efficiency, right? It\u2019s more conversion, more dollars per transaction, but it\u2019s not more people, it\u2019s not more anything. It\u2019s just better technology, more use of machine learning, et cetera. So there\u2019s a bunch of big pockets. There\u2019s no like, oh, by the way, there\u2019s \u2013 I can tell you where $1 billion is hiring, but we spent a ton of money on cloud. We spend a ton of money on adding capabilities. And over time, as you do it on one platform, it all becomes more efficient. So, I think it\u2019s a lot of little things, but it adds up with our base of people and fixed cost, it adds up significantly over time. We\u2019ve been able to maintain our headcount at a level we feel good about, and we think we can grow massively on top of that without having to add lots of bodies to be able to do it. John Colantuoni : Thanks. Appreciate the details. Operator : Thank you. And the final question goes to Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Jed, please go ahead. Your line is open. Jed Kelly : Hey, great. And thanks for sneaking me in. Just two, if I may. Peter, I think you mentioned earlier this year, you had pulled back marketing in some of the European countries because you weren\u2019t happy with the ROI. Can you talk about where the product is for you to lean back into those countries? And then just on Vrbo, just on the supply, can you talk about any benefit you\u2019re seeing from higher interest rates and getting potentially getting more Vrbo supply? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. I wish we had a quick enough twitch muscle to tell you that interest rates are driving homeowners to us. What I can tell you is Vrbo all through COVID and still produces more for homeowner and more for house than any of our competitors. So, I think we\u2019re in a great place for homeowners who want to monetize their assets to come, assuming it\u2019s in places that are interesting to us and where we can drive business. So, I think we set up quite nicely if you believe in that construct that people need to monetize their homes, their assets, their second homes, et cetera. Again, we do \u2013 we\u2019re not doing a lot of primary home where people move out of their house and rent it for two days or whatever. That\u2019s not really our business model. But there is lots of opportunity. And presumably, people are maybe a little less flush with the cost of capital and may want to monetize that. So, I think directionally, it\u2019s positive, but it\u2019s not that quick switch thing, that we see a massive uplift just because rates increase. But we\u2019re pushing into it, and we expect supply to grow meaningfully next year. As far as the marketing question, it goes back really beyond this past year. I mean we saw a lot of pockets where we were overinvested, weren\u2019t getting the return, weren\u2019t getting the long-term return that even made sense of what we were investing to buy traffic in some parts of Europe and other places and we ratcheted that back. We found this, as I mentioned, as we keep rebalancing, sometimes we\u2019re finding opportunity to push back in some of those places. So it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a line [ph] in the sand, and we got to it and we\u2019re staying there, like we pulled back and then we saw opportunity. In some cases, we pushed in a little bit more. But I think broadly, at the heart of your question, which is right, we want to be lined up with all the right product capabilities to go after a market fully. And right now, we\u2019re sort of perfecting our product in North America in terms of how everything works? How loyalty rolls out? How people get signed up? How we engage them with CRM, and everything? And that\u2019s a model we then want to repeat. Now many big markets across the globe, we have many of those things. But we have a very focused idea of we\u2019re going to get the product set up end-to-end then we\u2019re going to go hard after markets and then we believe we can win with the strategy that we think is winning right now here. So, we\u2019ll keep pushing on it. And we\u2019re not there yet. But I think as we get into next year, we will have a much clearer idea of where you\u2019ll see us take some more aggressive action in certain markets where they think there\u2019s opportunity. Of course, there\u2019s some macroeconomic noise to watch out for there because there may be markets we want to get aggressive in that may have economic challenges. So, we\u2019ll have to balance all of those things. But that is our approach to it. We want the end-to-end product to be great. We want the loyalty and all pieces to be there. And when we have like our full suite of weapons, we\u2019re going to go at these markets one by one and try to win. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Peter Kern : Thank you everybody. I think that\u2019s it. So, go ahead, operator. Sorry. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a nice day. Peter Kern : Thank you everyone. Take care.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2022 that ended December 31. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by our CEO, Peter Kern, and our CFO, Julie Whalen.  The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's view as of today, February 9, 2023 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.  As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we plan, we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic or confident that or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And I encourage you to consistently visit our IR website for other important information. Unless otherwise stated, any reference to expenses excludes stock-based compensation. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you, Harshit. And good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us today. This past year was an important one in our company's journey. We did a ton of work and made great progress on many transformational initiatives, all while delivering record EBITDA.  Q4 was yet another step in that journey, despite the impact to our P&L from the severe weather. Hurricane Ian in early October and the winter storms in late December drove up cancellations, causing bookings and revenue for the quarter to come in behind our expectations, despite demand otherwise accelerating through the quarter.  The good news is that we have seen those booking trends come back much stronger in January post the disruptions. So, 2023 is off to a great start.  And we were really pleased that our investment over the last several years in service technology and capabilities allowed us to deliver best-in-class service through these difficult travel circumstance. As I've said many times before, when your strategy is centered around long term retention of valuable customers, every element of the work must deliver for the traveler. So big thanks to our service team for all their hard work, especially over the holidays.  Now, as we launch into 2023, I'm particularly pleased with how our strategy of investing in and retaining high lifetime value members is showing accelerating improvement across our business.  For the fourth quarter of 2022 versus 2019, our new customers that became loyalty members grew over 60%. And we entered 2020 with a record number of active loyalty members, which is 10% higher than any prior year. And just as importantly, our quarterly active app users increased by approximately 40%. For us, these are the most important metrics to gauge the progress of our strategy. Just to remind you, our loyalty members each drive two times the gross profit on repeat business over an 18-month period as compared to non-members. And our app users each drive 2.5 times the gross profit on repeat business over the same period.  When you combine these two and have a loyalty member who also uses the app, this drives the highest production of all, and that group represented the fastest growing customer cohort for us in 2022.  But as strong as those numbers are, for our overall business, they're even better in our Expedia brand in the US. This is extremely important because Expedia US is the business where we've been able to make our fastest product and marketing improvements, and where we have the most complete set of capabilities to support our strategy.  And the evidence is clear. In the fourth quarter of 22 versus 2019, Expedia US grew new customers that became loyalty members by over 300% and entered 2023 with nearly 70% more active loyalty members than any prior year, and almost 60% more active app users. Expedia US was able to deliver almost 20% revenue growth in 2022 as compared to 2019, and there's still plenty of improvements yet to come.  Of course, when you look at our all-up B2C numbers, the accelerating performance of Expedia US has been largely offset by our intentional deemphasis of some smaller non-core brands, our pullback in certain geographies where we did not have the right model, and of course, our much discussed technical migration, which required significant work, and like all migrations resulted in some short term friction. But what I'm really excited about is that with the proof now very clear that our strategy is working, we will begin more aggressively rolling it out to our other brands and our non-US markets. After years of democratizing travel, we are now taking a leap forward to use cutting edge technology, a better marketplace, a broader rewards program, and best-in-class service to drive true customer benefit and loyalty. Because when you take care of customers and give them great experiences, they keep coming back. And that's how you win.  In support of this long term strategy, you will see us maintain a higher mix of marketing spend to channels that attract desirable long term customers, rather than just chasing short term transactions. Therefore, the parameters of when and who is worth marketing to and winning as a customer will be different. We have clearly proven the value of attracting and retaining the right customers, and increasingly, our P&L will reflect that.  We're starting 2023 with the highest number of active loyalty members and app users for any year. And we will see further momentum in the business this year thanks to a much larger base of loyal customers.  Of course, our confidence in our strategy is ultimately only possible because of the underlying technology that we have invested so much in over the last several years. This is what has enabled Expedia US to grow faster. And all of our brands and geographies begin to ride on that same tech stack, we will expand our ability to compete and win in more places. Work that created a drag on our business in 2022 like the migration of hotels.com to our core platform become big on lots for us in 2023.  As one example of this, we expect our test velocity around optimizing our sites to grow roughly fourfold with the same resources this year and more engineers and product team members are freed up post migration and our tests can be run across our entire base of core OTA traffic. In other words, we will have many more tests where the winners get deployed across a much larger base. And as we continue to invest further in product and technology and new features and capabilities to take online travel to the next level, these improvements increasingly impact more and more of our customers more rapidly worldwide. No travel player in the world has done more over the last few years to innovate around the shopping and service experience to improve the travel journey for the consumer.  And just to emphasize the point, all of our advances in technology, in product and in customer service not only benefit our direct customers, but continue to benefit our expanding base of B2B partners as well.  Our B2B business is one of the largest in the world and continues to grow rapidly. The breadth and depth of our products are expanding as is our partner base, reinforcing the importance of our supply and our technology as the core operating system of the travel market. To that end, we added many new partners and grew significantly in 2022, despite agents still being greatly constrained. With the return of travel into and out of China in 2023 and a robust pipeline of new partners around the world, we anticipate significant growth and a great year for our B2B business.  So as we wrap up what was the most profitable year in our history, we begin what will be another exciting year of growth and the last in our major technical overhaul. This coming year, we will finish moving all of our brands on to one front-end stack. Vrbo, the last major brands to come across, has already been testing traffic on the new front end, and will make the final migration in the coming months. This last step will then allow us to launch our new One Key loyalty program, which will span all of our main brands. It will be the broadest, most flexible loyalty program in the world. And for the first time, give vacation home renters the benefits of a loyalty program. And importantly, it will complement our many partners loyalty programs as well.  So overall, I'm confident that with more technical tailwinds and headwinds this year, and with a proven strategy that we will be expanding on, we will once again drive strong financial growth while completing the last of our major changes. It has taken several years and a lot of hard work, investment and patience. But we're extremely gratified about where we are and what we know we can deliver going forward. And I'm even more excited about moving the last big boulders of our plan across the line and driving greater acceleration in the future.  And with that, let me hand it over to Julie. Julie Whalen : Thanks, Peter. And hello, everyone. 2022 was a year of significant progress on our strategic growth initiatives. And our financial results are evidence that we are on the right path to deliver long term profitable growth.  The accelerating success of our lodging business, particularly in our brand Expedia business in the US, which is the first of our brands to benefit from our transformative tech and marketing initiatives, enabled us to deliver total company record lodging bookings and revenue. And we did this while at the same time driving significant profitability with record EBITDA levels at over $2.3 billion and an EBITDA margin of over 20%. Our fourth quarter also benefited from continued strong lodging demand, but unfortunately was heavily impacted by Hurricane Ian in October, and the storms in the US during December. Absent these weather related events, as well as FX headwinds, our results on both the top and bottom line would have been at record fourth quarter levels.  As far as the details regarding our financial performance for the fourth quarter, similar to previous earnings calls, I will discuss our revenue related and adjusted EBITDA growth metrics this quarter both on a recorded and like-for-like basis.  The like-for-like growth rates excludes the contribution from Egencia, Amex GBT and the non-lodging elements of our Chase relationship. As a reminder, on November 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Egencia and our EPS business entered into a 10 year lodging supply agreement with Amex GBT. It is also important to note that our fourth quarter 2022 growth rates as compared to 2019 were negatively impacted by FX headwinds of approximately 250 basis points to gross bookings, 400 basis points to revenue, and 800 basis points to adjusted EBITDA or 70 basis points to our adjusted EBITDA margin. We believe these like-for-like numbers and the disclosure of the negative impact from FX headwinds are helpful in assessing the operational performance of our business.  Please note that we will discontinue disclosing these like-for-like numbers next quarter, the first quarter of 2023, as we move away from comparing our financial performance to 2019 levels and move towards standard year-over-year comparisons.  Now let's move back to our performance this quarter, starting with our gross booking trends. Total gross bookings were down 12% on a reported basis and down 2% on a like-for-like basis versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Total gross bookings were impacted by a spike in cancellations and lost transactions related to the hurricane and the winter storms in the US, as previously mentioned. If we further adjust for the approximately 250 basis points negative impact from FX during the quarter, our gross bookings would have been above 2019 levels.  Growth was driven by total lodging gross bookings, which were the highest Q4 on record at plus 4% on a reported basis and plus 6% on a like-for-like basis versus Q4 2019. By month, lodging gross bookings on a reported basis were up 3% in October which was impacted by the hurricane, up 7% in November and up 2% In December, which was impacted by the winter storms in the US.  Excluding the weather-related events, growth versus 2019 for each month in Q4 reached high-single digits that accelerated through the quarter. And in January, we saw a step change where our lodging gross bookings accelerated even further, growing over 20% versus 2019.  While it is still early in the quarter and 2023, we are pleased to see strong lodging demand continue, including total lodging bookings for stays expected to occur in the first half of 2023, continuing to meaningfully outpace 2019 and 2022 levels.  Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&L, starting with total revenue. Revenue of $2.6 billion was down 5% on a reported basis and down 1% on a like-for-like basis versus Q4 2019, and includes the 400 basis point negative impact from FX, as well as the financial impact from the weather related events. Excluding these factors, our reported revenue would have been above 2019 levels. Total revenue margin also improved to 13% for the quarter, or up approximately 90 basis points versus Q4 2019 as we continue to benefit from a mix shift towards our higher margin lodging business, which as a percentage of the total has grown approximately 1,000 basis points over the same period.  Cost of sales was $408 million for the quarter, which is a cost reduction of $125 million or 24% and 380 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus 2019, driven by our divestitures and ongoing efficiencies primarily across our customer support operations. Our customer support operations continue to benefit from the various automation initiatives we have implemented over the past couple of years. And we expect that, going forward, with the further consolidation of our tech stack onto a single platform, we should be able to continue to drive efficiencies across our cloud and licensing and maintenance costs as we eliminate systems that are no longer necessary to support.  Direct sales and marketing expense in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, which was up 20% versus 2019. The primary drivers of this increase over 2019 were associated with both our B2B and B2C businesses.  Our accelerating growth in our B2B business is driving an increase in commissions paid to our partners. And these commissions fall into our direct sales and marketing line.  In our B2C business, we had increased marketing spend to support our accelerating growth during the quarter. Unfortunately, given the storm related cancellations and lost transactions and their impact to the top line at the end of the quarter, we did not fully realize the anticipated return of our marketing spend. In addition, we also have been strategically mixing towards longer term investments in our marketing spend, which, given the longer term return profile of the spend, is less closely correlated to demand within any given quarter. As a result of these two factors, we saw this marketing spend deleverage versus Q4 2019. However, on the full year, we saw leverage in our total B2C spend versus 2019, inclusive of loyalty and discounting, that are contra revenue. And we expect to maintain this leverage for improvement going forward.  Overhead expenses were $590 million, a cost reduction of $157 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 or 21% and 470 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus 2019. We continue to remain disciplined on our cost structure. And with the expected improvement from the consolidation of our tech stack and general growth initiatives, we believe we can continue to maintain this lower cost structure and drive long term leverage as we deliver accelerating top line growth.  Overhead expenses slightly increased from the third quarter, approximately $23 million, as we continue to invest in top talent across our product and technology teams to help accelerate our various platform initiatives in support of our growth strategies that will drive long term financial returns.  Adjusted EBITDA was $449 million or down 6% versus for fourth quarter 2019 and was down 2% on a like-for-like basis, which includes the negative impact from the weather related events and FX headwinds.  On a margin basis, we were relatively in line with 2019 despite absorbing these negative impacts. And absent these factors, our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew in the mid-teens as compared to 2019.  Free cash flow for the full year was strong at positive $2.8 billion, up approximately $1.2 billion, over 70% versus 2019. The strength was driven by our record EBITDA levels on the year and an improved benefit from working capital as well as lower overall capital expenditures, as our spend is now primarily focused on our technology and product transformation.  On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $6.6 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $4.1 billion and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion, which provides us with ample access to cash to operate the business. This liquidity, combined with our strong free cash flow levels, enabled us to maximize our return of capital to shareholders during the quarter by further accelerating our share buybacks to approximately $350 million or 3.7 million shares in the fourth quarter. This resulted in approximately $500 million and 5.2 million shares being repurchased since the end of September 2022. Even after these buybacks, we enter 2023 with ample levels of shares remaining under our existing authorization for future repurchases at approximately 18 million shares.  And given our ongoing strong liquidity, our confidence in the business, and the fact that our stock remains undervalued and does not reflect our accelerating business performance, we plan to continue to buy back our stock opportunistically in 2023.  In closing, I couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead in 2023 and beyond. With accelerating demand trends and the proof points that our growth initiatives are working, combined with our strong financial position as we enter 2023 with ample liquidity and a higher margin profile business, all of this gives us the confidence in our ability to deliver double digit growth and expanding margins, as well as long term shareholder returns. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two, if I could. In terms of thinking about moving all of your brands and all of your geographies on to the technology stack as we go through 2023, are there some elements of either costs that still have to be absorbed by the business model that we should be keeping in mind in 2023? And once that transition is over, how should we be thinking about possible lift from a business momentum standpoint on the other side of that transition?  And maybe one quick follow-up on B2B. I know, obviously, we're not going to guide to the full year, but can you talk a little bit to some of the variables you're seeing in the B2B business that are building momentum or things that we should be keeping front of mind as we think about what growth and volume you might build in the B2B business through 2023? Peter Kern : I'll start at the top. In terms of moving the businesses on to a single technology stack and front end stack, I think hotels.com is an instructive example, in the sense that last year we talked about this a few times. As we're moving hcom across, we obviously did less to improve Hcom as a standalone entity, because all the engineers were working on moving it. So, you lose a little momentum as you're moving something. And then there is typically an uplift period where you've got to optimize the new stack and the new product on the new stack to get back to where you were, and then get all the benefits beyond that. So there is typically, if you will, a lull that takes place as you move things and some friction that you have to absorb in the numbers. So we did that with Hcom, as I mentioned. We're now getting the benefit of much faster testing between all the OTA brands.  Vrbo is the next one to move. It will suffer a little bit of the same things. But we think we can absorb that, as Julie said, and still show the growth we are planning for this year. And that unlocks, then, of course, being able to do One Key and other things. So there's a lot of unlocks on the other side, but you do have to sort of weather a little friction to get across and we've weathered it in the last year's numbers. We have a little left to weather this year. Again, we think will drive very good growth despite that. And, of course, when it's behind us grow even faster. So, that's what we're really looking at.  And then, on the other side of it, you get the benefit of testing faster, improving the products faster across everybody. You get the benefit of One Key. And you also get the benefit of being able to then deprecate older stacks that have costs associated with them, engineers associated with them, etc. You can put all your resources on the most valuable thing. So, that's the big thing we've got left to do. Those are the two big hitters we're launching this year, but there's lots of other work going on under the covers constantly, both in optimization and in cleaning up and consolidating other back end things in the stack.  And then, on the B2B front, there's a lot that's gone into what's growing, as I mentioned. We think Asia opening up will be good for us. We've had some big relationships there, including China where we haven't gotten much output during COVID. That will help. But really, we've been growing across many vectors. We've talked in the past about our optimized distribution product that we used to help hoteliers with their wholesale businesses. That's been growing very well. We've invested in our travel agent product, which has driven a lot of growth. And we've expanded, as I said, the breadth of our partnerships, the number of our partnerships. We continue to power a lot of the biggest supply partners, like airlines and others. So we continue to grow kind of in every dimension, sort of more partners, more depth with each partner, and new products coming all the time. So that continues to be an exciting area for us. And as we innovate faster with technology, with AI and other capabilities, those underlying capabilities become more and more valuable to our partners. Operator : Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Lee Horowitz : Just thinking about the investment plans for 2023 and how that impacts margins. So on the one hand, you obviously have investments in One Key, driving some incremental marketing investments. What are the areas that you see potentially offset some of those incremental investments from perhaps fixed cost growth, maybe underlying marketing efficiency via bringing that function under a unified stack? Or perhaps other areas of cost efficiency that you see across the P&L? Peter Kern : We will be investing somewhat more in the loyalty program, but we expect, as we've talked about many times, we think about our investment in acquiring and retaining customers as everything from loyalty to discounting to direct marketing spend and performance brand, et cetera. And we expect to balance those things. So we don't expect the all up cost of that, if you will, to be expanding over the course of the year. It might shift between buckets. And we believe we can underwrite that with the total spend we already have. So there may be some noise. And when we get there, we'll explain it to you in terms of how the loyalty program will roll out. But we expect to absorb that all in all those line items, just trading them off, one against another. Lee Horowitz : One follow-up, if I could. Obviously, you're seeing really strong underlying demand for the industry with growth into January that looks really healthy. Obviously, this is maybe somewhat counterintuitive, given the state of the consumer savings rates and inflation. To what do you owe sort of this strong underlying demand for the overall travel industry, given the macro backdrop? Peter Kern : I think you've heard [indiscernible] talk about it for a while, and maybe it was hopeful. But we continue to see that people are prioritizing travel over just about everything. If any of you have been traveling, I'm sure you've seen it. Rates are still very high. Demand is high. Planes are full. So I think maybe it's still the effect of COVID and people realizing there's more valuable things to do with their lives. And it's not just like revenge travel, but it's beyond that. Like, I want to keep traveling, I want to keep enriching my life. But I think we're seeing high demand. We obviously think we're doing a good job of capturing that demand, relatively speaking, but the markets are strong. We still haven't seen really Asia come back fully.  I'm sure we'll see pockets. We're all worried about it. But so far, demand continues to be quite robust. And we're really pleased with how 2023 is starting. So, with any luck, there'll be soft landings all over the world. And Asia will come back and the industry will remain robust through this year. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : I had a follow-up on that. Could you help us think about or help us better understand the growth that you're seeing year-to-date? Should we think of that as kind of getting back to that high-single digit number? Or have you been able to surpass that? Peter Kern : I think as Julie pointed out, January was north of 20% up in lodging, GBV, gross bookings. So we're definitely running ahead of high single digits so far. We'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out, rest of the quarter, rest of the year plays out. But it's really been driven by pretty much all quadrants. It's our brands. It's our B2B business. It's geographically dispersed. APAC is coming back a little stronger, but that's a relatively small base for us. So, it's been pretty broad. And right now, it's definitely running well ahead of where we were in the fourth quarter. Julie Whalen : Yeah. And I think just to remember, even when you go back to the third quarter, we also had high single digits. So really the fact that we're holding that ex all the storms and the noise that we've been talking to you guys about, and it's been accelerated in the fourth quarter, and we're seeing a step change as we enter into 2023, as well as with our Bex US business, we think that's a really good sign that we've got some strength ahead for this year. Peter Kern : And I'd add, Kevin. I talked a little bit on the first question about friction. We spent a lot of last year doing some heavy lifting on things like hotels.com, having reduced testing, etc. We really spooled that up in the fourth quarter, and it's accelerating further now. So just the ability to be back and really innovating on the product in the day to day and the product is really valuable and it's increment by increment. It's small pieces. But when you add them up, it really can drive a lot. So conversions improving, lots of things are improving. So I think we're just starting to multiply those effects of all the work we've done along with the marketing and everything else. And hopefully, also, we're working in a good demand environment, which helps. But I think those things are just more tailwinds than headwinds again, and that's just helping to drive us a little faster. Kevin Kopelman : Just one quick follow-up on that. Can you touch on ADR trends? The kind of slower number in Q4, was that just related to the weather incident? Julie Whalen : Yeah. That was I think called out in our remarks. But that was pretty much solely due to the weather-related incidents. ADRs have been holding pretty strong, but still elevated. I don't think we've heard anyone else speak of any issues with ADRs. We've seen a little bit of movement in Vrbo. But again, it's coming of off really high levels, and it's not that significant. Slight movement. But ADRs are really holding strong for us across the board. Operator : The next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Lloyd Walmsley : Two, if I can. First just on the \u2013 I think on the marketing, the all-in the marketing side, loyalty, discounting and marketing and the plan for that to kind of be balanced through the year, is there a point where you get to the other side of kind of some of this longer dated spend and feel like you're going to see leverage as this bears fruit? And then sort of related to that, it sounds like the stats around loyalty and app users show a compelling uplift. How convinced are you guys that those boosts are incremental and kind of causal rather than just coincident with your heaviest users just gravitate towards those things? Anything you can share there would be great. Julie Whalen : So on the marketing side, from a leverage perspective, we actually are leveraging with our all-up spend with, obviously, loyalty and discounting which are contra revenues. When you look at totality on the year, we are leveraging and we expect to hold that, if not improve it, next year. I think we're just wanting to make sure we make the point that on any particular quarter, you can see movement, right? Because we're shifting our spend and have started to do that now for a couple of quarters where we're putting more of our spends into long term investments. And so, you could make that investment today and get the benefit two or three quarters out. And so, it's not about any one particular 90 days that we should be judging per se, the total bucket of our spends. So, we're really focused on leveraging it in total on the year across the entire spend profile. So, I think that's how you should think about it. I think it's great that we've seen it leverage. We're shooting for that again here. And I think when you look at things like the types of customers, the high lifetime value customers that we are getting and are getting significantly more in brand Expedia US business and we're seeing that translate into really strong revenue, it's a pretty exciting time to see this all come to fruition. Peter Kern : I would just add on your question of causal or not. What we've seen, Lloyd, is that we've been able to greatly expand the numbers at a pretty rapid pace and bring more and more people into the loyalty plans and into app usage. And our historical \u2013 those trends I gave about 2x and 2.5x with even higher multiple for app loyalty members, those have held even as we've expanded the pool. So, it's not just the devotee who's becoming a loyalty member. It's really everybody that we can get into loyalty, that we can get into app usage starts to see all the member benefits, starts to get the pricing benefits and points and other things. And that's consistently sticky at bringing them back. And as Julie says, over time, we'll create more leverage in the model because once we have this bigger and bigger base of loyal customers, then the marketing beyond that, beyond loyalty, et cetera, becomes, again, trying to buy the right customers in given places and add them to the pool. And that we think we can do more effectively once we have a bigger base and more efficiently. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Anthony Post : Maybe one big picture question about the shape of the year. Your marketing spend is over 50% of revenues. I know you're working on a lot of projects to build a better customer base. Can you help us think about how you think about that long term? And when you said leverage this year, does that mean on that line? Are you thinking about as a percentage of bookings for 2023?  Secondly, just a comp question. I know there's some tough virus comps \u2013 easy virus comes right now. Ton of bookings float in kind of in the spring. How are you thinking about the shape of the year, for our models? Peter Kern : I'll let Julie deal with the second one. But to your first one, I think the way to think about is you've got to break it up a little bit. First of all, we've got expanding B2B business, where commissions are part of our marketing spend. So as that business grows and has been growing currently faster than our B2C business, you've got some movement into that mix, where the commissions are higher than this 50% level. So, it's pulling the number higher.  At the same time, we're trying to use marketing to build this base of customers, leverage the model. And as the base of direct gets bigger, right, you're driving more business from direct and you start to get leverage in what you're spending to add new people to the funnel because the new people become a somewhat smaller piece of the overall pie of business. And so, that is where I think you will start to see us gain leverage, is as the big base of loyalty and app members grows and grows and grows, and we're very focused on retaining them, lowering churn, all the pieces that go into that. That is how we get a bigger direct business that we're driving on top of adding new people to the funnel. But that spend is now on top of just a bigger and bigger base of customers that keep coming back. So that's where we believe long term we get that leverage from. And the better we get at it, who knows how we will balance growth and profitability, but that is the base on which we build.  Can you repeat the second question? I'm sorry, Anthony. Anthony Post : We have easy comps now with virus first couple of months. And then you saw a big flood of bookings into the industry in April and May. Just want to make sure people are thinking about the models right and how you how you think about that. Julie Whalen : So for top line comps is what your suggesting? Peter Kern : Comps to last year. Justin Post : And bookings, yeah. Julie Whalen : Obviously, [Technical Difficulty] that we believe on the year that we can drive double-digit comps year-over-year. We're obviously not speaking how it plays out by quarter. But I think what's super exciting is how we started 2023 at these levels with greater than 20 on our [Technical Difficulty] gross bookings and really coming out of the year strong. That gives us a lot of confidence. That plus Bex US and how it's performing under the covers gives us a lot of confidence for the momentum as we move throughout the year. But I wouldn't get ahead of us right now, still early in the year, early in the quarter, but we are committing to the double-digit growth on the year. Operator : Next question comes from Bryan Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Brian Fitzgerald : A couple of questions, guys. Could you give us an update on China outbound, your partnerships there and how those work in relation to other players in the market and any early thoughts on how you would pursue that opportunity as they reopen?  The second one was just really quickly on the test velocity that it can grow 4x, Vrbo cuts over in the first couple of quarters, if I got that right. If you had to put a bow around the amount of testing across all your properties, are we in the ninth inning in terms of \u2013 or eighth inning in terms of [indiscernible] and then we're homing in on that 4X test velocity. Peter Kern : China first. Our biggest relationship there is outbound with trip.com in China, and then we have some smaller relationships and some offline travel relationships. It's early days, there's tons of interest. I'm sure you'll hear this from other players, but there's a lot of shopping going on. But it's still fairly challenging for outbound travel between the political issues, between airlift which is challenging, and there's still a lot of unique rules now getting in and out of China that the airlines are dealing with, making it hard to fly direct and so forth. And then, of course, you've got the issues of Russian airspace, with great issues with European airlift to China. So it's going to take a little while to work itself out. But interest is very high. We are seeing uplift, but we expect a big uplift to be still a little ways out. But it's very exciting, obviously, and hopefully, some of the things that are going on will quiet down, and we'll continue to see more robust cooperation between various governments to make it more possible. Certainly, the US travel industry is doing a lot to lobby to get rid of various restrictions.  The second piece, we are already planned at 4x velocity. So that has a lot to do with bringing sort of the core classic OTA brands together. So Hotels, Expedia, and then some of the smaller brands that ride the same rails already.  Vrbo is the next thing to come across. And it will benefit from a lot of similar testing. But it will also be a somewhat unique product in its own right. So, the 4x has nothing to do with Vrbo coming across or not. It's really around core OTA. When Vrbo comes across, it will get the knock on effect of some of these winners and some of these benefits that can go across everything, whether it's in checkout or payments or other things. But on the front end, the Vrbo front end will still be a little different, and it will get some of those benefits, but the 4x is already baked, going to happen. And I think in terms of what we're capable of as a company, I would say that's less than halfway home because as we get more and more of the whole back end of the stack aligned, as we get our test environment all aligned, we have lots of opportunity to go faster. And a lot of our tests are now really more than what used to be a single test because they're AI driven with multi variables. And so, one test might be the equivalent of 10 tests. So it's really starting to amp up considerably.  And there's a lot of opportunity that we haven't gotten to during all our big transitions because we're just so focused on shifting things and moving them into one platform. And we're finally getting back to the bread and butter of doing that. And there's a lot of upside there. Operator : The next question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. John Colantuoni : I wanted to start with the comment you made about the Expedia brand performing well, and that some of your smaller brands and geographies have been sort of dragging down the overall business because of sort of intentional decisions to deemphasize them. So, I'm just curious if there's going to be an inflection point when those smaller brands and geographies become less material, so that the overall growth improves as it starts to mirror the Expedia and Vrbo brands?  The second question is there's been a big uptick in conversations about AI. And I'm curious if you could unpack where you see the biggest opportunities to leverage AI capabilities across the business and how that could alter your trajectory in the travel ecosystem. Customer service is obviously one that immediately comes to mind, but curious to get your perspective on that as well. Peter Kern : I think we could probably talk about your second question for a couple hours. But I'll take your first one first, which is, yes, we precisely believe that with brand Expedia \u2013 again, we talked about Expedia in the US. Expedia is obviously in a lot of countries. And the issue has been not everything we've developed was immediately available in all languages and all geographies. Likewise, not on all brands. So as we start to be able now with hotels.com on the same stack, with each benefiting from the same goodness that comes from tests and other things, we're going to be able to roll out that playbook to more and more places.  Now, there's still some work to do. Hcom's loyalty programs still different than Expedia. Once we have One Key, that will simplify that whole ecosystem as well. But we believe that those big brands, inclusive of Expedia, hotels.com, now on the same stack, and Vrbo and our B2B business, they will inflect past the slower growth of some of the smaller things. But to be clear, we want to move back into geographies, we want to play this playbook out in more places, this is not about, like, keeping the good and slowing down the bad. And then there's no bad, but slowing down the slower growing. This is about keeping the focus on the winning strategy and deploying it in as many places in as rigorous and controlled way as we can. And you're winning in more places and driving the business that way. So, it's a bit of, you're right, the big, good stuff overtaking the slower growth stuff. It's also about deploying the strategy to some of the slower growth items where we think we can still drive, whether it's a geography or a certain brand in a certain market where we believe we can play this playbook out and have the same success. So it's a combination of those things.  As far as AI goes, the big conversation, we already use a fair amount of AI and machine learning in all kinds of products. There's opportunities, for sure, in some of the newer things we're all talking about, like voice et cetera. In customer service, we're already experimenting with that there. In creating content and answering queries for customers. But we're using machine learning across the board in terms of personalization, in terms of how we sort for you, what we serve up to you. We'll use it in direct consumer communications over time, et cetera. So, we're using that. And as I mentioned, we're using it in testing as well as we develop more sophisticated algorithms to test multivariable tests. Do multivariable tests, that expedites all our testing. So we're using it.  I'd say probably its biggest, highest value is ultimately in personalization. But you can think about that really broadly in terms of how you get service, taking care of how you search even for properties, natural voice search, which we already have a voice search capability, but that will get better with the benefit of the new AI capability. So all of those things become big opportunities to advance it. And I think we are by far at the forefront in our category in terms of how to use it and how we can use it to best improve the customer experience. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Tom Champion : Maybe two quick ones for Julie. Julie, can you just quickly restate and clarify the guidance and expectations for the year? I think it was double digit growth. Is that in bookings? Is that versus 2019 or year-over-year? Can you just restate that for us? And I was also curious, your comments around headcount. It seems like a little bit of a different comment than we've been hearing this earnings season. How are you thinking about headcount through the year? Julie Whalen : From a guidance perspective, we said double-digit growth. That's on both top and bottom line, and it's relevant to \u2013 year-over-year. So, as I mentioned at the beginning that we're going to be switching next year to no longer be, per se, to tracking against a four year old metric. We're going to move to year-over-year. And so, that guidance is relevant to that.  Regarding headcount, yes, that is different than probably what you've heard in other places. I think what's important to remember is that the team here did an incredible job, taking out $1 billion worth of cost over the last couple of years. And so, we're coming at this from a different spot than many other tech companies and so forth. And so, we've taken out a lot of that cost already. And heads, I think we're down \u2013 at some point, down 30% or so. And so, again, coming from a different spot.  We're really being thoughtful about what we invest back into, for obvious reasons. We're watching the economy just like everybody else. Obviously, we're seeing incredibly strong business, but we're being thoughtful about who we invest back into. And really, our investments are primarily in product and tech to support our growth initiatives and to get us over this line. Peter has been talking about getting this tech stack completed. And so, we feel like we're in a great spot to be able to do that with limited levels of headcount growth and maintaining our strong financial discipline, keeping our cost structure below our sales growth. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan Chase. Dae Lee : This is Dae Lee on for Doug. I have two. So, revisiting the demand comments, is this something that you're seeing across deals and accommodation types? Or are there any particular deals or maybe property types that might be driving some of that strength that you're seeing?  With obviously your January comment, what's changed from 4Q to January that might be driving strong lodging growth in January and how sustainable do you think those vectors are going forward? Peter Kern : I think, to your first question, we're not seeing anything \u2013 I'm sure we could dissect every variable and find some difference, but there's not anything, when you look at it broadly, that says luxury is doing well, but the bottom is doing poorly or vice versa. We are generally a little more biased towards the middle and upper end of the market. And we are seeing fairly consistent strength.  As I mentioned, APAC, measured against itself, is coming back faster, but it had a longer way to come back. Obviously, the West has been back for a while. But it's also seeing nice growth. So APAC for us is not big enough to drive our overall number. So it really is kind of everything. And by and large, it's every class of product and class of \u2013 every type within a class of product. So there's nothing we've really seen that's driving like, wow, luxury is off the board and everything else is making up for other things. So we haven't seen much movement between products or trade downs or any of that. It's been pretty consistent.  January, as I mentioned, we believe it's a combination of a lot of work we've put in in terms of improving the product, getting through some of the hardest transitions, getting back to testing, getting our marketing machine refined, and that's constantly improving. And we've been talking for a long time \u2013 Julie mentioned that we've been investing for a while in some of these long term vectors. And as we've all talked about, we gave up some short term business to focus on app downloads, to focus on getting the right kinds of customers. And we knew it would take some time for this to start to multiply on itself and get the benefit because people don't always book travel 20 times a year.  So I think this is the benefit of time of catching up and stacking up the base of members, this base of app users, improving the product. As we've gone, we've launched a bunch of great features around flight tracking and comparison shopping and smart shopping and collaborative shopping and a bunch of new products, all of which have been very engaging in their own right. We're rolling those out to more places all the time. We just recently rolled out flight tracking to the rest of the world outside the US. So we're seeing great benefits in those things. And I think they're just starting to stack up now. There's no magic to January 1. So I can't tell you exactly why January. But post all the disruptions of the storms, we've seen really strong, robust demand and rebound. And I think it's a combination of a ton of hard work across our entire company. Operator : Our final question today comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Deepak Mathivanan : Maybe a couple of ones for Julie. So, first, the guidance on margin expansion was helpful, but curious if you can put any more specificity to it. Understand that, obviously, macro creates a lot of uncertainties. But is there a level that we can expect should macro trends kind of remain consistent with what you've seen in January and maybe recovery holds up through the year?  Also another financial question, maybe on buybacks. What is the philosophy in terms of maintaining the velocity of buybacks? Is 4Q kind of a good proxy for us to think about, given the business is very cash flow generative and you have plenty of capacity? Julie Whalen : On margin expansion, I think, first of all, it's important to remember that we're ending this year with record EBITDA levels and margins that are expanding 200 basis points, and we're committed to expanding on top of that. So, we're really proud of where our margins are.  Certainly, we would love to give a target, but I think at that point \u2013 I think I even said this last time that when you give the target, then they want the higher target. So, we're really pushing towards driving efficient growth and driving profitable growth. And we think as we're starting to demonstrate when we're getting these lifetime value customers that we can get more efficient, as we have started to do on the year with our marketing spend, and we're deriving the top line to levels that we're seeing has accelerated through the Q4 and coming in even stronger in 2023, all of that should be bode well for us to be able to drive profitability and EBITDA. And so, that's about where we're going to commit to at this point, is margin expansion. But over time, we can update you on as we move through.  From a buyback perspective, as I said earlier, we're really committed to buying back our stock. We believe it's the best use of capital to maximize shareholder returns at this time. Certainly, with that momentum we're seeing in the business, our stock is still undervalued, we believe, and so therefore, we believe buying back our own stock is the best return. So we're going to continue with that. We're going to buy back opportunistically. Obviously, as you mentioned, and as we said earlier, we did buy it back on an accelerated basis, $350 million approximately in the fourth quarter. And that was on top of another $150 million that we had started sort of the end of September. And so, we're going to be continuing with these elevated levels and buying back opportunistically as we go throughout 2023. Peter Kern : I think that was it. So thank you all for joining us. Appreciate your time and look forward to our next update. Take care. Thank you, operator. Operator : That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Lee Horowitz : I think that's our queue. So thanks so much for joining us. We're delighted to be closing out our 2024 Deutsche Bank Technology Conference today with Ariane Gorin, the new CEO of Expedia Group. Prior to her role as CEO, Ariane has held multiple executive leadership roles at Expedia over 11 years, most recently serving as the President of the highly successful Expedia for Business Unit, which we will learn more about today. Prior to '21, Ms. Gorin served a number of senior positions, including President of Expedia Business Services, Expedia Partner Solutions, amongst others. Ariane will do a brief presentation and then we'll open it up for Q&A. So Ariane, the floor is yours. Thank you so much. Ariane Gorin : Okay. Thank you so much, Lee. So as we said, I'm going to start out by just sharing a bit more about our B2B business. As I've gotten spoke some time with our investors over the last few months in my new role. I get a lot of questions about B2B. And so what I wanted to do ahead of our conversation with Lee is just share a bit more about the business. I won't go through the normal safe harbor disclosure. But just, again, for those of you who may be less familiar with Expedia Group, as a reminder, we are a travel and technology company. We've got a number of big consumer brands Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo. And we have a big B2B business where we power partners, and that's what I'll talk about for the next few minutes. We also have a large media and advertising business. It's a business that was growing 28% in the second quarter. It sort of flows into both our consumer and our B2B businesses, and we think there's a big opportunity still in advertising. And of course, all of this is powered by our platform, our AI and machine learning platform. The last few years, we've gone through a big replatforming, especially on the consumer side of our business, and we're really happy with where we are. Great AI and machine learning capabilities, great ability to cross shop, to attach, cross-sell, fintech capabilities. I mean just, I would say, a very powerful platform. And of course, beneath all of this, excellent travel supply because in our business, it's important to have really great hotel relationships, airline, with everyone across the industry to have great access to rates and availability. Now let me just spend a few minutes on B2B. This is a business I know quite well. I was running it for about 10 years at Expedia Group before taking on this role. Even as Lee said, there were a lot of different acronyms and names in there over the years. It's a business that last year in 2023, did about $25 billion of bookings, over $100 million room nights, and we work with over 60,000 partners. And it wasn't just big last year. Over the last 5 years, we've had consistent growth in the business. And remember, some of this is during the time of COVID. Our gross bookings over 5 years, so from 2018 to 2023 grew at a 16% CAGR. Same thing for revenue our room nights were up 14% during that period on a CAGR and our adjusted EBITDA up 28%. So really fantastic growth over the last few years. I often get the question of, but is this -- how does this work with your B2C business? Is it cannibalizing or not? And I think it's really important to understand that a lot of these B2B bookings are on different use cases than what our consumer business goes after. So about 30% of the bookings in B2B come from use cases linked to loyalty. So either it's I have a credit card, and I'm using my loyalty points that I earn on the credit card for travel or maybe I'm a member of an airline loyalty program, and I want to use those airline points to burn on hotel. So those are people spending their loyalty currency or in a loyalty environment where they're using our inventory to redeem. So things that our brands wouldn't do themselves. 60% of those bookings come in geographies outside of the U.S. For those of you who know our U.S. -- our consumer business, you know that we have quite a big business in North America. Well, in B2B, 60% of our partners are doing business outside of the U.S. And then about 15% of our business comes from corporate travel. So this is where we have partnerships with travel management companies who themselves have relationships with end corporates, and we're powering them with our hotel supply. So all of those are really incremental to our consumer business. And when you think about what's the sort of target addressable market for us, the way I think of it is the travel industry is over $3 trillion. There's about $400 billion that comes from Expedia Group, Airbnb and Booking Holdings. There's another $1.4 trillion that is bookings from direct suppliers, so from hotel companies, from airlines and the like. And we do play a bit there. So as I said, for airlines, we can power their hotel programs. We power Marriott vacation packages, which is the package travel for them. But the biggest opportunity for us is in that other $1.2 trillion of bookings that happen in travel around the world, whether it's with corporate travel, off-line retail, loyalty companies and the like. And today, even if our business is big, we're only at 3% of the addressable market. So you might ask, okay, what are the differentiators and what gives you confidence in the business? And there are really 4 things that I talk about. The first is our strong hotel supply with great rates, margins and content. And I'll talk a bit more about that in a minute. The second is having great distribution products and technology. Our partners are always expecting us to have excellent technology, and that can be a differentiator. We've got a large growing and diversified partner base. And finally, we have a team that is expert and is laser-focused on this part of the business, both commercial and in technology. And we've had this stand-alone team just focused on B2B for quite a while now and it makes a difference, I believe, to have such focus. If I just talk about supply for a minute, we all know that in marketplace models, the more demand you bring the better your supply is because your supply partners want access to the demand that you're bringing. So our consumer business, obviously, is attractive to our supply partners, and that allows us to have great supply. When you bring the B2B demand into the equation, it just reinforces the value we're bringing to our supply partners and it, therefore, reinforces the quality of supply, we're able to bring our B2B partners. In terms of what our products are, let me just spend a minute explaining what are the 3 major products in our B2B business. The first is something we call Rapid. It's a hotel API. And think of it as a partner who wants to build their own travel experience, their own front end and they want to use us to get hotel content. They don't want to have direct hotel relationships themselves. They want to use us for rates, availability and content. And so they use our Rapid hotel API. The second is our white label template. So imagine you're an airline and you have your own sort of e-commerce stack, and you want to be able to sell hotels as well. But you want someone who's going to have a turnkey solution and is going to have the front end all the way to the back end. That's our white label template. And then finally, we have the travel agent affiliate program, and that's our solution for travel agents. And think of it as Expedia with a wrapper around it for a travel agency to log in to get access to our inventory and to see what kind of commissions they can make from it and to have the support that a travel agent would expect. So those are our 3 products. As I mentioned, we have a large growing and diversified partner base. Just on the slide, put a few examples of the partners we work with, but you can see that they're across financial institutions, other online travel agencies, offline travel agents, corporate travel management company, airlines, retailers and more, and they're all over the world. So just to summarize and before we get into the conversation with Lee, we believe that we're the leader in B2B and it's a business we scaled quite rapidly over the last few years. That B2B is incremental and has synergies to our B2C business. I believe that having these 2 stools makes us more successful as a company, it makes us more valuable to our supply partners and that they reinforce each other. Our business is differentiated and diversified across geographies and partner types. I didn't talk about it much. Maybe we'll get to it with Lee. We've said on recent earnings calls that we believe that the business will decelerate. It's been growing at over 20% a year for a number of quarters in a row. And as some of the global travel demand normalizes a bit. This business will slow some, but we believe it will continue to be a double-digit growing business. And finally, we'll continue to invest in the things that differentiate us in supply, in technology and in our team. And with that, Lee, I guess we'll have our conversation. Lee Horowitz : Great. Excellent. Thank you. A lot of great detail there. Q - Lee Horowitz : So let's dive into the B2B business, so a little bit more. So you talked about the double-digit growth, it's flowing but double digits. Of the, I guess, 3 drivers, maybe we would see it be sort of new customer acquisition, it's maybe volume through your partner portals and perhaps ARPU or spend per customer where they take on more services. Of those 3, how do you see sort of that sustainability of that double-digit growth, which of those 3 is sort of the biggest driver to that outcome? Ariane Gorin : So let me start with new business. So every year, we have a target for how much new business we're going to find. But the reality is that's a small portion of the overall number. But we keep a close eye on it because what is small this year, is going to be more important next year and the year after. So when we sign a deal, typically, by the second year, it produces 2 to 3x more than it did in the first year and then it just grows from there. So it's a -- most of our growth in year will come from the existing partner base growing within the existing partners or, for example, what we call the sophomores, so the second year of the things we signed in the previous year. And new business this year will have less impact on the in-year numbers. We have to keep an eye on it for the future. Lee Horowitz : Understood. And then this is a question we get a lot from investors who don't quite understand it, haven't had so much detail. They ask why wouldn't competitors move in, you have other B2C competitors that have similar call it, supply density, like amongst the things you highlight here in your B2B business, which you see as the most defensible. What is the hardest for someone to replicate if they wanted to move into, say, the B2B business more aggressively? Ariane Gorin : So first of all, I will say when we started to report B2B as a separate segment, it becomes obvious to people how that business is performing. And so if I were a competitor in the space and saw how Expedia is doing here, I would want to move into it as well. And so the sort of the competitive landscape. On your question of what's defensible. I sort of think of it as it's a combination of a lot of things, right? It's not just we have good supply or we have great technology with great uptime. It's also what are the tools that we give our partners for servicing, right? If a partner is using our API, they want to be able to build self-service into their front end and how good is our technology and allowing them to build that out. What are we doing on our commercials, how is our account manager interacting with them. So I would say it's sort of -- it's not just one thing. I always talk to the team that it's the wrapper of things that bring the value to our partners. Lee Horowitz : Understood. And you should presume we have a pretty strong feedback loop amongst those customers telling you what they want, what they need, how they need to -- how you can help them grow their business. I guess what do you get most commonly asked? Like what are your partners looking for? Where do they want you to invest the next dollar to help them grow their travel portals over time? Ariane Gorin : Yes. So the first thing is they want a reliable partner who's going to continue to invest in the B2B business. Years ago, as we were starting to grow this business, a question I kept on getting was how serious are you about this? Like B2B isn't that big in the overall Expedia Group ecosystem. So at some point, are you going to not invest. I think we're beyond that now. They know we're a trusted and reliable partner. It really depends on the partner and what they're looking for. Corporate partners will say, \"Hey, we want more supply that has late checkout or we want more supply that fits our segment.\" Some partners might say, \"Actually, we want you to build out some technology that allows us to have better servicing.\" I would say it's really partner segment dependent. And our team does a nice job of listening to partners hearing what it is that they want and then evolving our offer. Of course, as in any business, every partner always wants better economics. Lee Horowitz : Fair enough. And then you highlighted a large international part of your B2B business. But we'll dive in a little bit more on B2C. But on your B2C side, you're looking to expand more internationally. I guess when you think about perhaps the push and pull between those 2, how do you make that decision? How do you look at, say, an international market and decide, okay, maybe we move in a bit more with B2C versus trying to grow the partner ecosystem in that market to try to get some of the demand from that region via B2B? Ariane Gorin : Yes. Well, first, I would just say that we want both of our businesses, our consumer business and our B2B business to be growing well, and they should be -- and they can be in the same geographies or they can be in different geographies, but they both need to grow. The stories I love the most about B2B is a partner like Traveloka, who is an online travel agency in Indonesia, and when we started working with them years ago, we didn't have points of sale than Indonesia. This was a partner who -- they knew the local market. They had all the payment types. They knew the customer, and when they started looking at, okay, we have our local hotel supply for our local market, but people who are coming to Traveloka want to be able to travel to the U.S. We need a partner to provide that supply. And so that's where we come in. And I think for a lot of these, especially OTAs in some of the emerging markets, we're a great fit for them because we allow them to have a more full store without having to invest there. And then for our consumer brands, I believe there's a big opportunity for us to grow internationally. During COVID and the years after that as we were going through our replatforming, we focused much more in North America. And we now have brands that still have strong brand awareness in certain countries outside of North America, whereas we start to reinvest marketing, we're seeing good results. Lee Horowitz : Got it. So maybe that's a nice segue, right? So you highlighted some great B2B growth metrics there, but if we back out and look at the B2C business, right, since '18, now with the disclosures we have here, the B2C business is sort of flat to down. There's been a lot of moving pieces at Expedia. I guess what is it that -- can you just explain that a little bit more? Help us understand it? Is it some of the deprecated brands that you guys have moved away from over that period of time? You mentioned perhaps stepping away from international markets. Just any more color as it relates to what happened from your -- in your B2C business from '18 to today? Ariane Gorin : So as you said, first of all, we have, over the last few years, been going through a lot of replatforming activities. And during that time, we've been okay giving up some room nights as we were doing that. In addition, coming out of COVID, we invested less internationally. We migrated the hotel -- and I've talked about this before, we migrated the Hotels.com brand to the new platform. We changed the loyalty program. And so we gave up some room nights there. The good news is if you look at Brand Expedia and Vrbo between 2018 and 2023, bookings were growing. And then I would just say, finally, as you cited, we've got some smaller brands, Orbitz, Travelocity and the like that we've invested less in as we focused on our big 3 brands of Expedia, Vrbo and Hotels.com. Lee Horowitz : Got it. Okay. So then maybe focusing a little bit more on those big 3 B2C brands. Brand Expedia started to show, I think, 20% nights growth in the last quarter, makes you guys a very clear share winner in this part of the business. I guess what has gone so well for this part of the business? What has changed so dramatically over the last several years as it relates to maybe the velocity, the shape of traffic that you're driving to the platform. What's gone so right for Brand Expedia? Ariane Gorin : So of all the tech migrations we were going through the last few years, Expedia was the least disrupted brand. And in fact, it benefited from so much of our innovation. So it benefited from the new testing platform we put in place. We can test so much faster and therefore, innovate faster. It benefited from the work we did on one identity and having a loyalty program across all of our brands. It benefited from a lot of work we were doing to drive more direct traffic to get more in app. And finally, I would say, Expedia as a brand has an incredible value proposition. The fact that you can buy dynamic packages and you get better rates when you do that, that you can cross-sell with attach. With our new loyalty program, if you're a silver or gold member, you're getting better discounts. So I just think Expedia as a brand, it's a fantastic product. We -- as i said, we continue to work on attach, on planning capabilities. We've got this trip board that as part of our replatforming, which capability that was on Vrbo, and we rebuilt it in a way that it could be used on Expedia. And we know that when people use trip board for planning, they're more likely to repeat. So it's just -- it's a wonderful example of the benefits of the innovation we've been doing and also the brand building. Lee Horowitz : Understood. And then maybe just thinking of some of the other brands, I guess, how do you think about maybe the synergies that exist between, say, Brand Expedia and Hotels.com at this point? How do you position these 2 brands within the geography such that they complement one another and the improvements that you hope to get out of Hotels.com in the next couple of months and years, don't end up cannibalizing Brand Expedia in the process? Ariane Gorin : So I've distinguished between markets in which we've got all of our brands and markets in which maybe we don't. In a country like the U.S., where we've got Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo, part of the thinking behind launching One Key was that you would have a common currency across all of them. So if you have someone who is a loyal Hotels.com user, they would benefit from getting One Key cash. But then if they wanted to book a flight or a car, they could actually go and use that on Expedia, and you could drive that kind of cross-sell. There are other countries in which maybe the Hotels.com brand is stronger than Expedia, and we may lean into it. I would just say that as much as we would all love everyone to come to only one of our brands or -- people shop around. And by the way, the B2B business proves this because sometimes people look for corporate travel, sometimes people book with one loyalty currency. And if you look at the stats in the U.S., people who are booking multiple trips a year often book in multiple places. So what I'm focused with the team on is how do you have a great value proposition for people who want to come to Hotels.com, how do you have a great value proposition for people who want to come to Expedia and to Vrbo and you can tie them all together with One Key in the U.S. Lee Horowitz : Understood. And then maybe shifting to Vrbo. I guess what have you learned at Brand Expedia over the last 12 months that you believe is leverageable at Vrbo? How do you go about replicating the success you've had at Brand Expedia to drive Vrbo back to a point where it's a share winner within the broader alternative accommodations industry. Ariane Gorin : As I sort of talked about, I think the Expedia success has come from a lot of the innovation we've done, a lot of the testing and optimizing. We're really pleased with where we are on our hotel path and the conversion there. And we're doing the same thing on Vrbo. We've run more tests on Vrbo and on the Vrbo app this year already than we did all of last year. The teams are constantly looking at what more can we bring to our travelers. The other thing that's been great on Brand Expedia is the strength of our supply. And Vrbo historically has had strong supply. We've continued to grow at double digits. But more recently, we've done work on getting rid of hosts that weren't providing the level of experience that we wanted for our travelers, raising the bar in our sort of host programs. But I think truly, it's being clear on what are we bringing to people with Vrbo, whole homes, no host, a loyalty program, being very clear on those things, communicating them well, having a great app experience, driving more direct and driving repeat. And I think the loyalty program will also help us with that. Lee Horowitz : Understood. And then maybe a similar question, right? You've obviously done very well recently in sort of your U.S. hotel business. We talked about it briefly before. Some of your goals internationally. Again, what have you learned over the last year or so in sort of U.S. hotel that you plan to take the international markets to reinvigorate share gains in the next couple of months? Ariane Gorin : Like everything, it's focused, Lee. If you have a focused team something -- and we were very focused on improving our hotel path and driving value there. It is the same thing internationally. You start by saying, okay, what are the assets I have? In some of the countries, we have a really good brand awareness. We have great supply in part because of our B2B business. And so go back in with the marketing teams in a surgical way and test things, see where we're getting traction and then go from there. And we're pretty pleased with the results we're already seeing. Lee Horowitz : You highlighted some, I guess, large market opportunities. Maybe just talk perhaps a bit more specifically how the B2B and B2C businesses complement each other. There's obviously a big pie for you guys to go after. Do you think about them strategically separately? Or is it when you go after the overall market, these are our 2 big horses and we're going to go take share that way. Ariane Gorin : So at a company level, obviously, we look at how are we growing across the board. But then my expectations as the leaders of B2C and B2B are they're each trying to grow their businesses, and they have to have their strategies for growing their business. As I said before, I believe that they are complementary. They're not only complementary because when you go talk to a supply partner, now we're saying to them, look, by working with us, you're going to be able to tap into our loyalty members. Our silver and gold members who spend more, who stay on property longer, you're going to be able to -- if you want to participate in the package path, get these incremental travelers you couldn't get yourself. And with that same technology connection, we can help you go get the corporate travel business you want. We can help you tap into the demand from credit cards loyalty program. So it not only for us, strengthens our business to have both of them, but for our relationships with our supply partners and strengthening. And sorry, I would just add. For our B2B partners, the fact that we have a B2C business means that our technology is better, our content is better because it's constantly optimized for a consumer business. And so that's incredibly important to our B2B partners. Lee Horowitz : Understood. You've obviously done an incredible job shepherding that B2B business. The dynamics in B2B versus B2C are a bit different. What do you think is unique about your perspective of seeing all the success at B2B that you can bring to the sort of the B2C side of the house in order to continue the success in Expedia, reinvigorate growth at Hotels.com and Vrbo. How does your perspective of... Ariane Gorin : Well, I will start by saying I've maybe been a good shepherd, but I had a great team. The B2B team is a super team. In terms of what learnings that I take away from that for B2C, I think it's like any business. You have to look at the market and figure out where is the opportunity in the market? How do the assets that we have fit with customers out there want and then be clear on it, make bets, be great in marketing the messages, build great technology and then continue to iterate. And that's why I keep on going back to what is the brand value proposition for our 3 brands, right? Expedia is a brand that is a one-stop shop with flights, cars, hotels, activities, and you can book this multi-item trip and package in a really dynamic way and save. Hotels.com is a hotel pure player, it's very fast. You can book quickly. It may end up being a different use case than Expedia. And then Vrbo is whole homes, families, groups. So I think working with the teams to be really clear on those, and then to leverage all of the technology investments we've made the last couple of years and configure it in a way that makes sense for the brand and communicate it well through marketing. Lee Horowitz : Makes sense. Maybe stepping back a little bit. If we can perhaps discuss the macro environment a little bit. Things slowed for you and the rest of the industry in July in a manner that seemed to take some by surprise. I guess what specifically were you seeing in your business as it relates to that sort of weakening demand environment? And then how do you get confidence that this sort of surprise slowdown that we saw in July won't be the first of, say, many instances over the next year or so? Ariane Gorin : So I'd start by saying Q2 was healthy travel demand. And we were pleased we grew our bookings by 6%. It's true that July, and we had peers in the industry who are reporting the same thing, was a slowdown. Even in Q2, we've already seen declining air ticket prices and car rental price stays. In July, we started to see pressure on ADRs for hotels and some early signs of trade downs. I focus less on like what are the short-term trends and more on, one, the fact that the travel industry is huge. What we learned coming out of COVID is people really want to travel no matter what. And then two, just focusing our teams on the things that are within our control. We have a lot of execution opportunities ahead of us. And so I really talked to the team about let's on our own destiny and focus on executing what we know can work. Lee Horowitz : Understood. So you're now 4 months into the new role, I guess, maybe a catch all here, what has surprised you most to date from your new vantage point, where have you been either positively or perhaps even negatively surprised about the things you're seeing from the new seat? Ariane Gorin : Well, one thing is I don't -- I had appreciated how little some of our investors understood the B2B business. And so that's why I was very happy to -- thank you for the invitation, to come here today. What I -- what's been great to see is just how powerful the technology investments we've made over the last few years have been to allow us to move faster. So last quarter, we launched flexible deep search across all 3 of our big brands at the same time. So this is just the ability to search for, for example, a hotel with plus/minus 1, 2, 3 multiple days. It may sound sort of relatively simple. But in the past, we would have had to rebuild that 3x over. Same thing, the testing platform now that we've got it across all of our brands, we can get results of tests much faster. So I think it was one thing to be part of the management team and to hear about it, and it's another thing to really see the way it's helping us move faster. Lee Horowitz : Got it. And maybe one of the things that perhaps has changed a little bit in those first 4 months was the pause for the One Key global rollout. I guess, can you maybe just help us better understand the reasoning behind that pause? And maybe how you sort of came to that decision as one of maybe the larger strategic decisions in your early goings at Expedia? Ariane Gorin : So One Key we launched last summer in the U.S. And the idea is we've got 3 big brands, Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo in the U.S. And as I said, we know as much as we'd like people to be loyal to just one brand, they shop across multiple brands. And by creating a common currency across all of them, where you had a simple program where you could earn and redeem One Key cash across all of the brands where we had what we call tiered member deals, which were supplier-funded. So if you were a blue, silver or gold member, you get access to depot discounts, and that's rewarding you for your loyalty. Having those value propositions and then also encouraging cross-shopping across the brands, was really the thought around one key, and that's worked well in the U.S., and we've been pleased in that. We also just launched it in the U.K., which is another country where we have all 3 big brands operating. But when we look at it, we realized it hurt them to a certain extent, the Hotels.com brand because Hotels.com had a 10-for-1 value position. And I step back with the team and said, okay, we've rolled it out now in 2 countries look at the rest of the world. And I believe everything is local. And so you need to think what is going to work for that country. You want a tech platform that works globally, but then what's the value proposition that's going to work locally. And in a number of countries around the world, we don't have all 3 big brands. So what the team is now looking at is what is the value proposition that makes sense around loyalty in those other countries. And it's one of the tasks I've just been pushing the team on is what is going to drive growth for us in the few months to come. And just because we were on a path, it's okay to revisit things. Lee Horowitz : That makes sense. I think people appreciate it. And maybe sort of one final one to sort of wrap up the conference. I guess, from the new seat, from your new vantage point, what do you think is most misunderstood? Perhaps it's the B2B business, and we covered a lot of it, but anything else that you think investors misunderstand about your business at this point? Ariane Gorin : I think we've probably covered it. What I would also say is we're -- we've disclosed a little bit more. I mean obviously, we shared the B2B numbers here. Last quarter, we shared gross bookings for B2C and B2B. So hopefully, there are fewer things that are misunderstood. And maybe I would do the last, but I sort of have the -- for the past [indiscernible] our brands are really loved by travelers. Like I have been -- obviously, I grew up in the B2B side of the business. But see the passion people have for our brands is really overwhelming. And it gives you a great sense of responsibility to make sure that we're being good stewards of them. Lee Horowitz : Fair enough. Well, Ariane, thank you so much for your time. Thanks so much for joining us. Thank you, everyone, for coming to the conference. Ariane Gorin : Thank you, Lee.",

[Operator Instructions]  For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to SVP Corporate Development Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Welcome to Expedia Group Q2 2023 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to be joined on today's call by our CEO Peter Kern and our CFO Julie Whalan. As a reminder, our commentary today will include references to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, and unless otherwise stated, any reference to expenses excludes stock-based compensation. We will also be making forward-looking statements during the call, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Actual results could materially differ due to factors discussed during this call, and in our most recent forms, 10-K, 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. Our earnings release, SEC filings, and the replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com and with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thanks, Harshit, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Our travel demands remain robust, and we are pleased to see our continued execution result in solid performance for the second quarter. As gratifying as those results are, I am even more excited with the progress on our platform transformation journey, having just launched one key in the U.S., and continuing to be on schedule of our verbal migration. We are particularly pleased that we were able to meet our second quarter financial goals while electing to move some marketing spend from Q2 to Q3, where we believe it can be better spent in support of the launch of one key and our accelerated growth in the back half of the year. Industry trends have remained broadly consistent with the first quarter. And North America and Europe has remained stable with stronger growth in APAC and Latin America. Travelers worldwide continue to favor shorter stays in urban locations versus longer trips in sun and ski destinations. As far as pricing, both hotel and vacation rental ADRs are holding up year-over-year, while international cross-border airfares are stable. U.S. domestic airfares have seen some declines as capacity increases. Rental car rates continue to decline as inventories normalized from compressed levels last year, resulting in more attractive prices for consumers and more transactions. Overall the data continues to show that travel remains a top priority for consumers. As I explained before, our B2C strategy is to build products, features, and customer propositions that attract and help us retain valuable customers, and to move those customers into loyalty membership and app usage to amplify their value. These travelers drive higher profits per transaction and higher repeat rates, ultimately leading to higher lifetime value. In addition, as these customers have a higher propensity to come to us through direct channels, this helps us drive future leverage in sales and marketing. As a combination of all these factors, these travelers have a much higher return on investment and ultimately drive more profitable and faster growth as they stack up over time. As we continue to move from a purely transaction, room-night-focused world to one in which we focus on customers and lifetime value, we have been able to build a bigger, more valuable base of these high ROI travelers. Our focus on acquiring and retaining loyalty members and app users to drive this strategy continues to show good results. This quarter active loyalty members continue to hit new highs and were up 15% year-over-year in our core brands, and the percentage of bookings coming through our apps was up 300 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter. We know that members with the app have the best economics, which is why we have been so focused on growing this segment of customers. In our Expedia brand in the U.S., I am pleased to say that we have seen this cohort of customers increase roughly 135% versus 2019. As we roll out our strategy across all our brands and all our markets, there remains a significant opportunity to accelerate further. A couple of weeks ago, we took another major step forward with the launch of One Key in the U.S. This is the most flexible travel rewards program in the industry, with our core brands unified under one loyalty program offering our customers the ability to earn and use One Key Cash, a simple common currency, across our vast breadth of flights, hotels, vacation rentals, car rentals, cruises, and activities. In addition to the breadth of this program, this marks the first time any major vacation rental marketplace will have loyalty, which is a significant differentiator against our competition. It's early days, but as we have seen historically, our loyalty members are much more productive, and with this now best-in-class program spanning our biggest brands, we expect to drive many more customers into the program and substantially increase our base of loyal travelers. Overall, our B2C business is finally nearing the end of its major changes, and piece by piece getting the benefit of new capabilities and greater agility that comes from a unified stack. With One Key out the door, our last major tech lift is the verbal migration to our main platform. We have already moved 100% of our verbal U.S. web traffic to the platform and our on-track to complete the migration during the fourth quarter. As we've explained before, we expect some modest headwinds to conversion as we transition, but ultimately the payoff is well worth it with better conversion, increased feature velocity, and ultimately better performance from verbal overall. Our single-tech strategy is designed to give all of our brands the benefit of our entire suite of product features, including our latest advancements in AI and machine learning, to personalize and enhance the customer experience. On the topic of AI, earlier this year, we launched conversational trip planning, powered by ChatGPT and the Expedia iOS app. And last month, we launched it on the Expedia Android app. We have been learning from consumer interactions and are adding a number of new features to help consumers on their journey of discovery. Travelers can now start a new conversation by choosing from suggested prompts, and soon they will be able to return to a conversation at any time and even respond throughout a conversation by simply choosing a suggested response, all of which is designed to bring them one step closer to booking their desired trip. Along the growth and progress we've seen with our brands, we continue to see tremendous momentum in our B2B business, which grew revenue 32% year-over-year in the second quarter. Our B2B business has greater exposure outside the U.S. and has benefited by continued opening of markets around the world. The engine for our B2B business is fueled by the same technology, supply, and service that serve our own brands. And as we have advanced in all areas over the last several years, this has only added to the velocity of our B2B business. We believe we have the most successful and differentiated B business in the travel world with a large addressable segment still available to penetrate further. And our wins in the marketplace continue to demonstrate that point. In the second quarter, we announced a new partnership with MasterCard, where our tech will power MasterCard's global network of issuers so that their customers can spend their loyalty points on great travel experiences. And in another huge development for this segment, we've teamed up with Wal-Mart, where we are now powering their first-ever travel benefit for Wal-Mart Plus members through our white-label template solution. We also continue to expand our tech delivery to our existing partners, not only through our core TravelOS products, but through our expanding offering of solutions. After recently commercializing our fraud prevention capability, I am happy to announce that our Revenue Performance API is now in pilot with one of the largest hotel management companies. As our tech continues to advance, driven by our industry-leading AI capabilities and the acceleration of our single-and-platform strategy, there is much more opportunity to gain [lot of share] with our existing partners and to scale further with new partners. So overall, I'm very pleased with the momentum we now have in our accelerating product improvements as we move towards the second half of '23 and beyond. Over the last few years, we have taken on many difficult challenges in order to transform not only our tech, but our entire strategy. As we begin to emerge from this period of massive change, it is clear that we are building the best offerings for travelers, a better marketplace for our partners, and overall a better company. It is great to see so much finally come into fruition, and our entire organization is excited about the future. And with that, let me hand it over to Julie. Julie Whalen : Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter results with record revenue and EBITDA demonstrate that our strategic initiatives are working and that we have a significant opportunity for long-term growth and profitability. And it is this ongoing strength in the business that enabled us to deliver another quarter of accelerated levels of share repurchases, resulting in approximately $1.2 billion repurchased year-to-date, our largest buyback to date. Before I jump into more of the details, I wanted to remind you that going forward, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis. It is also important to note that our second quarter 2023 growth rates, as compared to 2022, were impacted by FX headwinds of approximately 40 basis points to gross bookings, 170 basis points to revenue, and 530 basis points to EBITDA. We also saw an approximate 80 basis point headwind to the EBITDA margin. Now, as far as our performance this quarter, let's begin with our gross booking trends. Global gross bookings of $27.3 billion were up 5% versus last year, and in line with our mid-single-digit top-line guide. Growth was driven by lodging gross bookings, which were up 7%, and were the highest second quarter on record. The strength continues to be driven by our hotel business, which achieved record gross bookings primarily from strength in our B2B business, as well as in brand Expedia, which saw a 15% increase year-over-year. This was partially offset by our Vrbo business, which was impacted by the shift in consumer demand toward urban markets and shorter lengths of stays, as well as the impact from Vrbo's tech platform migration that we mentioned on last quarter's earnings call. However, given the size and strong growth of our hotel business, we were pleased that we were able to deliver record lodging bookings in total. Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&L, starting with total revenue. Revenue of $3.4 billion was up 6% versus last year, in line with our mid-single-digit top-line guide, and was the highest second quarter on record. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued strength across our lodging business, which grew 12%. This was partially offset by softness we have been seeing in insurance and car, two categories that have been impacted by some industry-wide changes post-pandemic. For insurance, we are seeing lower attach rates as consumers appetite for insurance normalizes. And for car, we are continuing to see rates decline as supply has increased. Total revenue margin increased 10 basis points to approximately 12.3%, versus last year primarily due to an increased mix shift to lodging revenue, which has higher revenue margins. Cost of sales was $403 million for the quarter, which is lower than last year by $13 million, or 3%, with approximately 110 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus the second quarter of 2022, driven by ongoing efficiencies across our customer support and other operations. Our customer support operations continue to benefit from the various automation initiatives we have implemented over the past couple of years, and we will continue to find more efficiencies in such areas as the cloud and license and maintenance costs when we finalize our migration to one platform and eliminate redundant systems accordingly. Direct sales and marketing expense in the second quarter was $1.6 billion, which was up 2% versus the second quarter of 2022. The primary driver of this year-over-year increase was related to an increase in commissions in our B2B business to support its strong growth of over 32%. As we've noted in the past, commissions paid to our B2B partners fall into our direct sales and marketing line, and overall are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business. Whereas they are generally paid on a state basis and to a contractually agreed upon percentage, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate. This increase in B2B direct marketing costs was mostly offset by marketing efficiencies in our B2C business this quarter, and resulted in marketing leverage as a percentage of gross bookings as compared to the second quarter of 2022. These B2C marketing efficiencies resulted from the benefits we are seeing from our continued investments in loyalty and app members, as well as our decision to move some of our planned spend from the second quarter to the third quarter to tie it more closely with the one key launch and to support our accelerated growth in the back half. While marketing will fluctuate quarter to quarter, we were pleased to see this marketing leverage. Overhead expenses were $627 million, an increase of $77 million versus last year, or 14%. While we remain disciplined on our overall cost structure, as we have said, over the past year we have continued to invest in talent across our product and technology teams to support our strategic initiatives, and we are pleased we were able to more readily fill these positions given the surplus of top tier tech talent in the market. We also saw higher salary expense associated with our annual compensation increases this year, which went into effect during the second quarter, and was the primary driver of the overhead increase from the first quarter. As we finish our technology work in the coming quarters and look to redeploy resources and to deprecate systems next year, we expect to realize cost efficiencies going forward. Despite this overhead pressure, we were pleased to see that with another quarter of strong revenue and overall expense disciplines, including our decision to shift some marketing spend, we delivered record second quarter EBITDA of $747 million, which was up 15% with an EBITDA margin of 22.2%, expanding approximately 190 basis points versus the second quarter of 2022. Our free cash flow remains strong at $3.8 billion year-to-date. The year-to-year decline is primarily associated with changes in working capital from the timing of payments. Last year, as the business emerged from Omicron, we saw meaningful increases in some of the working capital drivers like payables, which has since normalized this year. We remain pleased with an ongoing robust cash flow levels, and we expect them to remain strong on the year. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $8.8 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $6.3 billion, and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion, which provides us with ample access to cash to operate the business. From a debt perspective, our debt level remains at approximately $6.3 billion, but with our expanding EBITDA, our gross leverage ratio has come down from the first quarter to 2.6 times. We have started to make progress towards our target gross leverage ratio two times, and expect to make continued progress in the coming quarters through EBITDA growth and potentially some debt repayments. As far as capital allocation, given our strong free cash flow levels and a stock price that we believe remains undervalued, we have been buying back our stock on an accelerated basis to maximize our return of capital shareholders. As a result, we bought back approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date, or nearly 12 million shares, our largest level of repurchases to date. We continue to believe that our stock price remains undervalued and does not reflect our confidence in the expected long-term performance of the business. Therefore, considering our ongoing strong liquidity and free cash flow, we expect to continue buying back our stock opportunistically throughout the remainder of 2023. Looking ahead, we are reiterating our full-year outlook of double-digit top-line growth with margin expansion. As it relates to the third quarter, we expect year-to-year gross bookings growth to accelerate to high single digits. This acceleration is driven by Brand Expedia and Hcom, partially offset by Vrbo, which continues to face short-term headwinds from its migration. While we expect revenue growth to be lower than gross bookings growth, driven by the prior quarters reduced Vrbo bookings converting to stays, and therefore revenue in the third quarter, which is historically our highest revenue quarter for Vrbo, we expect revenue growth to see modest sequential acceleration. We expect EBITDA margins to stay relatively in line with last year. While we expect to see continued cost of sales leverage, as previously mentioned, we will be investing in marketing to support the One Key launch and to set us up for a strong back half. Overall, we expect fourth quarter will see a more meaningful acceleration in both top line and bottom line growth as Vrbo finishes its migration, the One Key impact starts to kick in, and the growing base of app members drives more production, all of which gives us confidence to reiterate our full year outlook. In closing, we finish the front half of 2023 on a strong note with record second quarter revenue and EBITDA. We are pleased to see the continued momentum, even while we continue to transform the business and navigate associated headwinds. Our accelerating product improvements give us confidence that we are on the right path and that there is a huge opportunity in front of us to drive long-term profitable growth and to maximize shareholder returns. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Two if I could. In terms of forward booking trends, I understood on the commentary broadly about the summer, but the industries obviously had some tailwinds from elements of longer booking dynamics as we've come out of the pandemic. Are we seeing more normalized behavior with respect to forward booking, or is there anything to call out either in consumer behavioral geography in the forward booking trend that you'd want to highlight? And then in terms of thinking about the exit philosophy for Vrbo, is there a way to quantify elements of what One Key mix and easier comps might mean in terms of reacceleration at Vrbo at the end of the year? Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Sure. Thanks, Eric. I'll take a crack at both of those. I'd say broadly, yes, I mean, what we're seeing is a relative, what I would call a relative normalization of seasonal trends and booking trends. There's obviously some dynamics around what is opening or more newly opened, and what has been open for a while, as we've seen, for example, this summer with lots of travelers going to Europe, where maybe they didn't go last summer, Asia opening up, and more travelers going there. Of course, parts of Asia like China still don't have full airlift out of China. So there's still differences. But I think broadly in terms of the effect of like COVID, last year we had COVID first quarter, and then the second quarter was a huge quarter because things opened up after Omicron. That's kind of normalized out, and I think in terms of booking windows, booking trends, they're moving around a little bit, but by and large, they're normalizing to what I would call generally pre-pandemic patterns. So I think that's the main thing. In terms of geo, again Asia will open up more. There will be more travel there. We're seeing APAC and LATAM growing faster because of those things opening more recently. So that's certainly a trend. But again, I think that normalizes once it's been opened, call it a year or so. And then as far as Vrbo goes, very hard to quantify. And obviously, the switch, the sort of consumer switch from Vrbo or vacation rentals generally to more hotel started happening in the back half of last year and earlier this year. So that's sort of a macro trend as far, so we'll be lapping some of that now as we get into the back half of the year. But as far as our journey goes, yes, One Key we think is a big opportunity for us it's the first time that Vrbo customers will have loyalty. It's a chance to get them involved in our whole universe of products so we can bring them into the other products. Obviously now, Expedia members, hotels.com members can use their points on Vrbo. So we think that becomes a very attractive reason to use Vrbo. So we definitely think One Key will drive a lot of cross shopping between the products. Hard to quantify yet, but that's a core belief in what we are trying to do with One Key. And then as far as the migration goes, as we've talked about, you're changing the product, you're moving it across, the last piece will be moving the app, which is very binary, so you tend to do it at the end. That's still coming, but we're excited about what the product will be able to do. We're excited about having all the products on one stack and being able to innovate across all of it together. And as we've talked about for a long time, that will eventually lead us to be able to sell much more easily Vrbo products across all brands, across our B2B products, etc. So we don't have a number for you, but I think broadly, I think we're going to lap the macro trends of shift from vacation rental to hotels later this year, and then, the migration stuff will still be around for a few more months, bu we're excited about being past it and the opportunities that presents. Eric Sheridan : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lee Horowitz : Great, thanks. So you talked about some of your marketing spend getting pushed from the second quarter to the third quarter in order to support the One Key loss. Can you maybe help us better understand how this may have impacted the bookings and nights in the second quarter relative to your expectations, and then maybe relatedly, can you talk a bit about how you think lodging share pays throughout the second quarter and what your expectations are for share as you move through the balance of the year and you drive that extended growth across a number of your properties? Julie Whalen : Hi, it's Julie. I'll take the first one. Yes, I mean, obviously, I'm sure there was some impact to the second quarter as a result of our decision to shift the marketing. At the end of the day, our top line was hitting our expectations and obviously what we had told the street about mid-single digits, and so we thought the right choice of action was to take that spend and to get the best return to tie it nicely with our One Key launch and also to set us up for the back cap. So we made the decision to take that money and push it into the third quarter. But sure, could we have spent more and maybe gotten some incremental nights and bookings in the second quarter? Sure, but we thought this was a better path to take. Peter Kern : And then I think the share point plays into that. We feel like we've been holding share in our core markets. We've been gaining some of our outside North American markets, outside U.S. markets in a number of places. So again, as Julie said, it's all sort of placed in together, which is we're trying to, of course, drive the best return on our investments. We thought there was better return when we had the extra hook of One Key. We felt like we were holding in places and we could have spent the money to drive some more bookings into Q2, but we felt like the return was better, literally waiting weeks, many weeks to push it into July when we were launching with One Key. So it's a small movement in the scheme of things. Of course, it moves around margins a little bit and it moves around. Yes, it moves some bookings from maybe Q2 into Q3. And yes, it moves some even though maybe into Q2 instead of Q3. But in the scheme of things, we're trying to spend that money as efficiently as we can. We launched One Key as soon as we could basically and it would have been nice to obviously launch it sooner, but this is when we could get it out the door and we think that there's better returns attached to that hook and getting customers in, getting them engaged in One Key, getting those return dynamics and direct dynamics where we want them. So that's why in the scheme of things, not huge dollars or anything, but we moved a little money and sure, that cost us a little bit of [GBV] and revenue in Q2 and will mean a little bit of extra spend in Q3. Lee Horowitz : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thank you. As you think about the acceleration that you're looking for in the third quarter, the issue is being focused in U.S. and B2C given the One Key launch or is it going to be more broad-based? Peter Kern : I think it's a number of things. As I mentioned, Kevin, we are seeing good growth as we push back into some of our foreign markets where we saw opportunity and that's been going reasonably well. In the scheme of things, obviously, U.S. being so big for us to accelerate broadly, we also need the U.S. to accelerate, so that's a combination of a number of things which are, yes, One Key starting to kick in, but Q3 is early days, right? One Key is a loyalty program designed to incent return, certainly attractive in terms of make your first purchase and get value, but I don't think we're not expecting massive impact in Q3 from One Key. We're just seeing good acceleration in the market. Q2 comps were tough because of last year, and as Julie alluded to, some of the strange insurance dynamics and other things normalize out in the Q3 as we lap that and Q4. The acceleration is really just a continuation of, we see strong demand. We built this base of consumers that we continue to build on that are repeating more and having behaviors we like a lot more, and that just keeps building, and One Key enhances it, and that's really the core of it, but it's not just in the U.S. The growth is also outside the U.S., but I will say a lot of the acceleration certainly is coming from B2C as opposed to more acceleration in B2C. Kevin Kopelman : Great, thank you. And then could you just touch on the CapEx expectations for the rest of the year and drivers there? Thanks. Julie Whalen : Yes, I mean, we've seen CapEx come up even in the last quarter, and we had expected this. We are putting more into capitalized labor in order to hit our strategic initiatives this year. Obviously, there's a lot of transformation that we have still been pushing through this year, i.e., One Key launch and the verbal migration and things like that, and so literally this is just a function of higher capitalized labor to complete out these projects, and as we go forward, we don't expect it to be as much in these elevated levels as we will, and we'll start to get the return from these projects that we're putting in place. Kevin Kopelman : Great, thanks, Julie. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from BOA. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Okay, let's see, I want to ask two questions. One, the travel bot or the ChatGPT experience that you have on the site, what have you seen so far in terms of, I think there's enormous potential here. I just don't know how long that takes and whether there's just a ton of tweaking that needs to happen in order to really get it right. How do you feel? What have you seen so far in terms of engagement? Has it kind of led to increased conversion rates, and if not, maybe it's way too early, what's a reasonable expectation for when you could actually see that. And then the other thing is on One Key, now that you're rolling it out, can you set up an expectation for when you think we'll see kind of the impact that has, I know it's just recently launched, but is that something you take one quarter or is it one full year before you really can tell how successful that's been in terms of a deeper engagement and maybe attracting newer users? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes, thanks Mark. So on ChatGPT, I agree with you. It's interesting. It has a ton of promise. It is early days. We've been studying it. I won't say it's moved the numbers in any way that you could see. And the customers who like to engage with it like to engage with it, lots of customers don't need it or don't choose to. I think the future though lies much more in a better integration, which will come as more large language models come out. And we figure out how to embrace them with our own data. Right now they kind of live separately and you can do a bunch of discovery with the tool and then save things and come investigate with us. Over time, there will be ways, I think, where we're not sharing your personal data with chatGPT, but where we can combine their capabilities with our data and use that to serve you better. So this is going to be an evolution of experience. That's why I mentioned we've been learning, we've been studying where customers get stuck, what they can't seem to do. Some of them don't exactly know how to engage or start a conversation. So there's a lot of work, not just by us, but by the industry around the large language models on prompts and other ways to get customers through it more easily. And I think all of those pieces will add up to more impact, but the impact now is basically the minimum, since you wouldn't see it in the numbers. As for One Key, I think that's more of a gradual build. Obviously, there's a couple of different things you're looking for. There's the appeal of having a strong, broad, flexible, best-in-class rewards program to attract customers and make them choose us over other people. And then there's the back-end part of, then do they come back directly once you've got them in their One Key program and hopefully once you've got them to download the app and now do they exhibit the behaviors of coming back? So that second part takes longer because as we all know, some people don't travel all that often, so it takes time for them to come back and book again, etc., even though many booked a lot. And then the first piece, we should start to see, as we literally just launched it, you may have seen the ads, the campaigns are out there, starting to put the messaging into all our performance marketing and anything that's out there digitally, etc., into our out-of-home. So it will continue to build, and you'll start to see it show up in all our marketing for all our brands. And we believe that's a hope that will continue to make intelligent consumers choose us because it will be a better value that gives them more back for their travel. So that part we should begin to see sooner, and that's why we think that will start to have a bigger impact into the back-end of this year. But the longer-range part of return and direct and driving those things, that will take a little longer to play out in the numbers. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you very much, Peter. Peter Kern : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes in a line from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Sorry about the drop-off. Could you talk about the customer and the B2C customers? It seems like you're trying to improve that quality base, and maybe the street doesn't see it in the numbers yet. What gives you confidence there? Are you seeing higher repeat rates? You said you had some leverage in the quarter. Was that timing, or is there some real improvement you're seeing on the B2C side on marketing leverage? And then one question on One Key. Starting to see some discounts on the site, do you think that allows you to better compete against booking? And who's funding those? Thanks a lot. Peter Kern : Maybe I'll take those in reverse order. Take the sort of factual ones first. So yes, one of the pieces, not that relevant necessarily for the investment community, but that is important for the consumers, because we've expanded our member discounts as part of this One Key launch, so that where we used to have one level, basically, of member discounts, we now have, blue, silver, gold levels, and there are more discounts for higher tiered members, and that is part of the value proposition that we give to our consumers. Those are funded by our supply partners. It's a way for them to get to better and better higher value travelers, and that is an important added feature that we launched with, and we will be expanding over time. So that is certainly, booking has had tiered discounting from some of their supply partners, and that is a feature we have not had before, so I think, yes, that is a good competitive way. I will say that we also think we have those discounts on more valuable hotels that are worth more value to our customers who are more valuable. So, which goes to your first question, which is, yes, we have confidence that we are building a pool of more valuable customers, in the large part because we are getting them into more valuable states, so as we get them into membership, as we get them into app, and we follow how those cohorts perform, we know those cohorts perform for lots of good and thoughtful reasons, much better. So a member, of course, sees the member discounts, the loyalty rewards, and so forth, and app member does even more typically and comes back more directly, all good things. So as we build up those pools, and our blend of total consumers and total transacting consumers is blended towards these pools that have higher peak rates, higher LTV, et cetera, we are essentially building a bank of more value that is left to play out in the future. So that is why we do have confidence in what we are doing there. Obviously, we have done it particularly well as I talked about before in Expedia US, now we are doing it in more countries, now we are working on doing it with Hcom, and then expanding that to more countries, now we will be able to do it in Vrbo as well. So that is why we say we have a lot of runway left here, but we can see it happening where we have intent, where we have spent according to that, where we have driven the product, moved more customers into membership, and signed up into the app. Every step in that journey creates more value for us. Justin Post : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Anything you can share in terms of just early feedback, going back to One Key on maybe cross shopping, and then, changes in conversion rates at Vrbo, now that you have loyalty, anything interesting there, and then as part of that, anything in terms of cross currents from Hcom customers, given they are getting eluded there as part of One Key, would love some help understanding that. Peter Kern : Sure. I think the first one, the short answer is, it is too early. I mean, we have converted more than $70 million, don't have today's count, but over 70 million consumers into the One Key program. These are existing members, and also new members that have joined in the last few weeks. We've had lots of new members join in Vrbo. We've been able to activate, a customer who may be using Vrbo and may have been a customer of one of the other brands a long time ago, but now they're in a program where they'll see the benefit in the other brands. So we've done a lot of, sort of, the core work of getting customers aligned, getting their accounts right, getting their accounts consolidated if they had reports in different places, which was complicated. So we've made huge progress. It's too early to say that, there's not enough signal yet to say, well, people are, doing acting, behaving differently and doing lots of different things. And even in Vrbo, there's a lot of cross currents and a lot of the time is launching One Key. And a lot of our Vrbo customers, even though they're getting a great benefit, they're, they're having to understand, like, wait a minute, there's a membership program. What is it? Do I sign up to it? So there's the usual issues of launching something new and a product experience that people are accustomed to, but we've seen a lot of great response and, millions of sign-ups and I wouldn't say necessarily massively incremental in terms of the velocity, but just a lot of people engaging with it and signing up. And then as far as HGMP goes, yes, we have, there is a little bit of noise from our heaviest users about what does it mean for them. But I will say we've taken care of them. We've made sure that the value they had did not get diluted. And our view of the new program is that they get much more value through flexibility. They get value through the deeper discounts. We just talked about a member discount. So while it might not be constructed exactly the same, our heaviest users will get massive benefit and in our opinion, more benefit than they can get anywhere else in travel. So it's not like we went from, we love you and we give you all this and now we're going to devalue your program and not give you a lot. We're actually carrying over their value and we're giving them huge incremental flexibility, ways to spend their value on flights, on verbal, all kinds of things they couldn't do before and far more member discounts and other high-end benefits for our heaviest users, gold and platinum, et cetera. So they're going to get a ton of value and they just have to make, I think the industry has trained people to think they're going to lose out every time, loyalty program changes. This is not one of those circumstances. I won't say there's not a single customer who won't find that, they don't like this one as well as the last one. But this is a great program with a lot of value for the heaviest users and I think they will all come to understand it and love it. And appreciate the benefits. What they got, even though, it might be slightly different than it was. All right, thank you. Lloyd Walmsley : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley Securities. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yes, hi. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Peter, I think you, I heard you say you might have gained share in some of the international markets and I'm a little intrigued what may be driving that. Any kind of commentary there would be helpful. And then I will follow up. Peter Kern : Yes, I think it's really just intent on our part, as we reacted to COVID and we started rebuilding things, in a number of markets in the rest of the world, we back down spend a little bit and we got a little more conservative as we wanted to build our new mousetrap, as it were. And I think now that we have greater confidence in all the things I've talked about, be it membership, the value of app downloads, and so forth, we've been driving back into a number of international markets where we think there are good returns and we've been seeing nice returns. Now, these are modest changes in the scheme of things. There's nothing dramatic happening, but we're just seeing, what I call low hanging fruit and opportunity for us to move back into some of these markets in a smarter way. So, again, not a huge story there, just that, we feel good about share in the U.S., we feel good about what we're seeing, early signs as we push back into these international markets. So, on share , we're feeling reasonably good with more on this. Naved Khan : Understood. Yes. The follow up I had is just around advertising and we are hearing some commentary from other players about maybe some increased competition, maybe in Europe or other markets. I'm curious if you're seeing anything there or anything to say about Google's new ad format. I think they recently introduced proper understanding of their main search. Peter Kern : Yes. I think on the last part, you're talking about vacation rentals. Is that what you're talking about? Naved Khan : No, it's still, there's hotels, but I think this introduced a new format into the main search. Peter Kern : Yes. I mean, I would say, look, we're working with them and working in the auctions around the world all the time. I don't think we've seen anything particularly different in terms of inflation or not in the auctions. I mean, the auctions have been inflating over the last several years. And of course, they're highly competitive, particularly amongst the biggest of us. But no, I don't think we've seen anything that's of any concern, et cetera, over what's happening in terms of pricing in those markets. And of course, we are trying every day to find better opportunities, higher long-term return opportunities to invest our advertising dollars, be it in app downloads or other kinds of environments, shall I say, that encourage those behaviors, as opposed to just Google auctions. So I think we're probably not alone in that, but that's been a core part of our strategy as we've tried to get away from simply trying to buy transactions and getting much more focused on what consumers we buy, getting them into the right state in the app, and so forth. So that's an ongoing journey for us, but that's the direction that journey will keep going on forever. Naved Khan : Got it. Thank you, Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jeffries. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open. Jed Kelly : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just two, if I may. Just one, just the airlines that recently called out weaker domestic trends. Is there anything where there's just softening underlying demand or is that the pattern shifts that you kind of mentioned earlier? And then just thinking about your back half brand spend. Can you just talk about the efficiencies you plan to get on being able to market all your brands under one loyalty program versus marketing them all separately? And are you going to continue to market each of your key brands separately? Thanks. Peter Kern : Sure. So I think, yes, as far as the airlines go, I mean, we have seen, you've never heard that pricing is softened a little bit in domestic air in North America. There's a little bit more supply. And yes, there's been high demand for international. So I think it's been mostly a shifting of patterns. It's not total consumable dollars. Obviously, in every industry, not everybody participates the same way. Some are more domestically focused. Others have bigger international exposure. But in terms of consumer demand, I'd say it's broadly been steady and good, and there hasn't been -- there are places that fall and other places that rise. But overall, the consumer has been acting healthy and strong. So I don't think there's anything to see there other than moving, moving geographical trends and consumer trends in terms of what they're looking for. As far as brand spend, and again this isn't, I wouldn't get focused on the word brand spend, as we conventionally think about it, it is spend against our business, which could be brand spend, it could be performance marketing, it could be a lot of things. When we say we wanted it to support the One Key launch, it's not in the sense of like we needed money to buy TV spots, it's in the sense of we thought our money with the hook of One Key out the door would be more efficient as we drove consumption, be it through Google auctions or be it through digital advertising of various kinds or television. So that's what we were talking about. As far as how we're going to spend, we have a campaign out now that's very focused on One Key as a concept and the three of them coming together. But our intent is, at least for now, to keep marketing each brand, they will then, they will all have a touch point to One Key and make clear that they are, sibling brands and part of one big umbrella loyalty program, but they will each have their own brand identity in terms of what their consumer proposition is and how they deliver it to the consumer. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Your line is open. John Colantuoni : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry about the drop earlier. I want to talk a little bit about the One Key rollout. Can you help us understand what's changing from a loyalty perspective across each of the individual brands and how we should think about the sort of collective impact to take rate from these loyalty changes and perhaps some sort of other potential merchandising changes related to the rollout. And can you also help sort of talk a little bit more about the puts and takes of the acceleration in bookings growth? Next quarter, there's, the bites or slowdown in the system marketing spend and maybe some pull forward in the last quarter into Q1 from Q2. But I'm also curious if you've started to see an inflection point in some of the smaller brands where, they've gotten small enough to not have as material an impact on the overall business. Thanks. Peter Kern : A lot of good questions there. I would say starting with One Key, basically I think the simplest way to think about it is One Key is closest in what it offers to what the Expedia program was, the brand Expedia program was historically in that you earn points, the points are worth money, you can spend the money. Some things have changed. I mentioned the member discounts. You now have silver and gold member discounts. There's added benefits for those silver, gold, platinum members that they get. But it's most similar, so that's, I would say, the least change in the sense that you could already use that currency across many products and things. You couldn't really use, you couldn't use it in Vrbo, but that was the one missing piece. So maybe the way to think about that is you've added Vrbo to the pot and those consumers can now benefit when they want to rent a vacation rental. Hotel.com, many of you are familiar, had a very rich program for the super user. If you book 10 rooms, you get a night free, and that was a very valuable benefit for a super user, but the vast majority of users didn't get a benefit because they never stayed enough nights. So we're trying to make that program much more attractive to all users while still keeping it very attractive to the super user for all the points I went into a moment ago as to why they would find incremental value there. And again, you could only use that on hotel product. Now you can use it on anything. And that's a lot more flexible, a lot more vast, and you can do a lot more with it. And then, of course, Vrbo had nothing. Now Vrbo will have rewards, which Airbnb doesn't have, etc. And you'll be able to use it for your next Vrbo stay, but you can also use it to go to a hotel or a resort or take your family on a flight or whatever. So again, it just gives all of our customers a lot more ways to use it for a lot different occasions and for a lot different products. And ultimately, we're trying to build a base of loyal customers that use us for all their travel needs that can go across whatever they need and spend more with us, buy more products from us, etc. So that's the game. We have all these brands, all these capabilities. We wanted the customers to benefit from all of that. So the patterns we're looking for is cross shopping, more items per customer, higher LTVs, more direct, more app-direct, etc. So that's what we think One Key really helps drive. As far as the puts and takes in the back half of bookings, your point about the smaller brands, as part of it, yes, the smaller brands that we have to emphasize for some time now are getting smaller and that drag is getting lighter all the time. We mentioned some of the things going on with insurance normalizing post-COVID and a few strange effects there. That's normalizing in the back half of the year. And lodging continues to grow, B2C lodging continues to grow, for instance most through [indiscernible] but both brands are getting stronger in the back half after the tough comp. And so you're basically getting the strong pulling more weight and getting bigger, the sort of noisy stuff making less noise. And overall we see good velocity in the business right now and we're seeing it continue and we feel good about all the product improvements. I mean this has also been a journey of improving product, improving conversion, improving sign-in, improving app-down, like all of those things are part of that journey. So every day they're literally getting better and stacking up on themselves. So I think that's a long journey and there's no magic to why it's going to hit next Tuesday, but with Vrbo's migration done, with One Key, which is a huge amount of resource for us out the door, these things, the velocity of other innovation gets faster and faster. And that's what we're focused on. Unidentified Analyst : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from a line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolf Research. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Julie, can you help us with the full year guide on margin expansion? We're almost into the peak travel season and you said that for 3Q, margin should be flat here on here. But anyway, you can frame for us what the full year margins can reach to. And then kind of related to that, how should we think about the headwind from fixed cost growth? You obviously have a little bit of a duplicative cost right now with all the replatforming efforts. Is there a timeline when we can expect this to somewhat sort of start to show leverage and maybe you can deploy them for other projects? Thanks so much. Julie Whalen : Sure. On the margin side, the EBITDA side, obviously this quarter's leverage certainly helps on the full year. We did guide to next quarter being more in line with last year. And that is, as you mentioned, the shift from the marketing spend that we have. But for all the things that Peter just alluded to, the strength of the business in the back half, particularly in the fourth quarter, we expect to see strong margin expansion in the fourth quarter that will help us on the year. So we're going to be operating top line, which will leverage the entire P&L, including marketing leverage in the fourth quarter that we think will drive that expansion. From a headwind from a fixed cost perspective, certainly we are going to be aggressive as we move out of this year and come out of the transformation phase to finding efficiencies across the P&L. As we've said, we have got redundant systems for very good reasons and migration, but it's time that we'll be starting to deprecate those systems and pulling costs out of the P&L, and whether that's cloud costs, licensing and maintenance, repurposing some of the product and tech staff to now go on the offense and go after optimization and innovation instead of migration. There's a lot of opportunity to really dig through the cost and pull that out as we move forward, but that's probably more of a 2024 going forward focus. But certainly with all that optimization as well, we should be able to leverage the P&L next year. So super excited about that. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes, I think that was the final question. So thank you all. Have a good Thursday. Appreciate your time. Take care. Operator : That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to SVP, Corporate Development Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to be joined on today's call by our CEO, Peter Kern, and our CFO, Julie Whalen. As a reminder, our commentary today will include references to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. And unless otherwise stated, any reference expenses exclude stock-based compensation. We will also be making forward-looking statements during the call, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Actual results could materially differ due to factors discussed during this call and in our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. Our earnings release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you, Harshit, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. Our third quarter results came in ahead of our expectations with record revenue and EBITDA. This was particularly gratifying considering the fires in Maui, which had a disproportionate impact on our Vrbo business and put pressure on the top line overall. Travel demand otherwise remained solid with broad trends consistent over the last few months. North America and Europe demand remained stable with more pronounced growth in APAC and Latin America. Prices also remained stable by and large. Hotel and Vrbo ADRs are holding up in each region, but mix effects are leading to a slight year-over-year decline in overall lodging ADRs. Conversely, we have seen some modest price pressure in air and car. We are also keeping a close eye on the escalating violence in the Middle East, which appeared to have some impact on global travel in early October. More relevant to our specific performance, I'm happy to share that we've just completed the final leg of our verbal migration onto our single front-end stack with the conclusion of our global launch of the new Vrbo app this past Monday in the U.S. This marks the last of our major migrations associated with our multiyear transformation. It has been a long, complex journey, but well worth the effort as we are now in a position to accelerate into the future without the drag of transformation work that forced us to go backwards in order to go forward. We are now in a position to dramatically increase our test and learn capacity and feature release velocity while also providing a scalable and efficient base to operate upon. We continue to utilize our industry-leading AI and ML capabilities to radically improve all aspects of our traveler experience. And with the launch of One Key and our increasing ability to understand the long-term value of our travelers, we can now begin to drive faster, more profitable growth. Moving on to the key pillars of our performance, starting with our category-leading B2B business, which remains on track for a strong year with Q3 revenue growing 26% versus last year. We're winning new deals, increasing wallet share with existing partners and launching new products and features to support our growth. Demand from China, in particular, continues to pick up with Q3 bookings from China Partners up over 150% year-on-year. We anticipate continued strength from B2B going forward, driven by our continuing push into the addressable market along with the advantages that our platform improvements will bring to the B2B business, whether in core technology, the application of AI and machine learning or in service and payments. As we unify stacks, this will also further enhance the capabilities on offer for our B2B partners. But as pleased as I am with the continued growth of our B2B business, I'm even happier to see our B2C business picking up momentum with year-over-year revenue growth in Q3, accelerating over 400 basis points sequentially. This is what we've all been working so hard for us. So it's very gratifying to see these results beginning to improve. Another major milestone for us was the U.S. launch in July of One Key, our new loyalty program. One Key unifies our major brands, expediahotels.com and Vrbo, allowing our members to earn and burn one simple currency, One Key cash across our vast marketplace. As I've mentioned before, getting dividends from a program like this will take some time given the frequency with which most consumers travel. That said, we are very happy with the early results and traction One Key had with our members. We have already migrated over 82 million members to the program. And with the addition of Vrbo to the mix, we have seen 34% growth in new members over last year. We have already seen many members using One Key cash across brands, including on Vrbo and have been pleased that Hotels.com members have not been unduly impacted and have already been using One Key cash to shop for other products on Expedia. Overall, these promising results have given us solid learnings that will be useful as we launch One Key in other countries next year. And with the Vrbo migration complete, we can now more fully lean into the core differentiation that One Key gives Vrbo in the vacation rental space. One Key, along with our ongoing efforts to more generally attract higher lifetime value customers, is accelerating our mix of loyalty members, app users and app members. And the percentage of bookings coming through our apps continues to grow and was up approximately 300 basis points sequentially in the third quarter, which ultimately contributed to our year-over-year marketing leverage in our B2C business for the third quarter. We have also been releasing exciting products and features that remove more and more friction from the planning and booking process. In September, we announced our fall release showcasing a series of new features and products squarely aimed at solving complex traveler problems and enhancing engagement. In case you missed it, I'll give you a few of the highlights. We have simplified group travel planning, providing for the first time one place for friends and family to collaborate on a group trip to see one another selections and add saved options across air lodging, car rentals and activities, significantly using the group planning process and creating a better, more successful trip for everyone. Products like these not only enhance the consumer experience but allow us to utilize a consumer's own network of friends and family to expand our reach. We've also launched tools to aid research into a given destination. Hotel prices, weather, best times to visit, crowd levels and even generative AI-powered tools to determine the best neighborhoods to stay, given the traveler one place to research where and when to stay in their dream location. We now also leverage generative AI to scrape reviews to answer traveler questions about amenities and property details. So no more sorting through hundreds of reviews to find out how strong the WiFi is, quality of the pool or whether you're going to like the breakfast. We also launched the first project of its kind, EG Labs, which allows interested customers to test our AI-powered beta products, allowing them to play a hand in how we shape the future of travel. I could literally go on and on, but the takeaway is no one in travel is innovating faster than us. And with so much important platform work behind us and with our leading capabilities and machine learning and AI, we will out innovate in the space for many years to come. We have literally worked for years and given up many short-term opportunities to get to this place, and I don't believe anyone is in a better spot technologically, which is not only exciting for our existing business but sets us up to go back on offense in many more markets next year. In closing, I'm pleased to see our solid execution in Q3 and through 2023 so far. While the geographic mix of business distorts global growth rates, we believe that we have held or grown hotel gross booking share in virtually all of our key markets and with Vrbo finally completing its migration and the key differentiator of One Key, we expect our vacation rental share to improve going forward. In addition, we are finalizing our plans for '24, where we expect to drive faster and more profitable growth. Our high-level strategy is not going to change, best product, best loyalty program, best marketplace and best service. But instead of spending most of the year doing surgery on our own business, we will be focused on growth, innovation and efficiency. I'm excited for 2024 and beyond and for what we will bring to our travelers, partners and shareholders. And with that, let me hand it over to Julie. Julie Whalen : Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect a meaningful acceleration in the business with revenue reaching a record $3.9 billion with year-over-year growth accelerating approximately 300 basis points sequentially from the second quarter to 9% and with earnings accelerating even further to an almost 31% EBITDA margin, over 110 basis points of expansion versus last year, both of which beat expectations. It is clear our transformation strategy and growth initiatives are playing out. and we anticipate this momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. This is why we have continued buying back our stock at an accelerated level, have announced a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization and are confident to reiterate our full year guidance of double-digit top line growth with margin expansion. Now on to our results for the quarter. Total gross bookings of $25.7 billion were up 7% versus last year, a sequential acceleration in growth from last quarter. Overall, lodging gross bookings grew 8% and were the highest third quarter on record. And this acceleration would have been even higher, but for our Vrbo business given our hotel business grew at a much higher pace at 14%. Our Vrbo business was particularly impacted by the recent Maui fires as well as the brand's short-term migration to our single front-end stack and the continued softness from the demand shift towards more urban areas. Despite this impact, we saw our B2C business accelerate from the second quarter, primarily from continued strength in hotel. And our B2B business saw continued strength and outperformance consistent with what we have been seeing all year. Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&L, starting with total revenue. Revenue of $3.9 billion was the highest on record and grew 9% versus last year. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued performance of lodging, which grew 12%, driven by our hotel business. We also saw our B2C year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate over 400 basis points sequentially versus the second quarter. This growth was partially offset by the softness we have been seeing in our insurance and car businesses, which, as we discussed last quarter, have been impacted by some industry-wide changes post the pandemic. Both insurance and car have become less of a drag to growth this quarter, and we expect that trajectory to continue for the rest of the year as we start to comp these declines in the fourth quarter. Total revenue margin increased by approximately 20 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by the continued mix to higher lodging revenue, which have higher margins. Cost of sales was $409 million for the quarter, which is lower than last year by $42 million or 10%, with approximately 210 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus the third quarter of 2022, driven by the ongoing efficiencies we have seen all year. And while we will start to comp some of these benefits during 2024, we expect to continue to drive efficiencies as we eliminate redundant systems and reduce key costs in such areas as cloud, licenses and maintenance. Direct sales and marketing expense in the third quarter was $1.7 billion, which was up 11% versus the third quarter of 2022 due to an increase in commissions in our B2B business to support strong revenue growth of 26%. Again, commissions paid to our B2B partners are in our direct sales and marketing line and overall are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business. But as they are generally paid on a stated basis and to a contractually agreed-upon percentage, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate. Our B2C business saw marketing leverage again this quarter as a percentage of gross bookings. These B2C marketing efficiencies resulted from the incremental benefits we are seeing from our continued investments in loyalty and app members, and we expect this positive trend to continue as higher loyalty and app members result in higher direct and repeat traffic that is more efficient. Overhead expenses were $617 million, an increase of $48 million versus last year or 9% and in line with revenue growth. As we have said, this increase is a result of our year-over-year investment in talent across our product and technology teams to support our strategic initiatives. And as we finish our technology work this year and look to deprecate systems and redeploy resources in 2024, we expect to realize cost efficiencies going forward. With this strong revenue performance and expense control, with expenses overall growing lower than revenue, we delivered record EBITDA of $1.2 billion, which was up 13% with an EBITDA margin of almost 31%, expanding over 110 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow remains strong at $2.3 billion year-to-date. Similar to the last quarter, the year-over-year decline is primarily associated with timing changes within working capital. Last year, as the business emerged from the pandemic, we saw meaningful year-over-year increases in our deferred merchant bookings balances, which has since normalized this year. We remain pleased with our ongoing robust cash flow levels from record EBITDA levels, and we expect them to remain strong going forward. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $7.6 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $5.1 billion and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion, which provides us with plenty of cash to operate the business. From a debt perspective, our debt level remains at approximately $6.3 billion with an average cost of capital at only 3.7%. And with our expanding EBITDA, our gross leverage ratio has come down to 2.4x. As a result, we have continued to make progress towards our target gross leverage ratio of 2x and expect to make further progress in the coming quarters through EBITDA growth and potentially some early debt repayment. From a capital allocation perspective, we have been buying back our stock at record levels. We continue to believe that our stock price remains undervalued and does not reflect our expected long-term performance of the business. And given our liquidity and strong free cash flow levels, we believe buying back our stock on an accelerated basis is the best use of our capital to maximize shareholder returns. As a result, we bought back approximately $1.8 billion year-to-date or approximately 17 million shares, our largest level of repurchases to-date, offsetting not only our COVID era dilution, but in fact, getting us to our lowest share count since 2015. And given our confidence in the long-term outlook of our company and the cash-generating power of our business, as well as our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders, we have announced a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, and we expect to continue buying back our stock opportunistically going forward. So in closing, we are pleased to see the continued momentum in the business, delivering our best ever quarter. We have been able to deliver upon what we said we were going to do amid a significant period of transformation and corresponding uncertainty. Looking ahead, we are reiterating our full year outlook of double-digit top-line growth with margin expansion. As for the fourth quarter, based on the uncertain geopolitical environment and its potential impact on travel, we expect gross bookings growth to be relatively in line with third quarter levels, with modest sequential acceleration in year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth versus the third quarter. Overall, our execution and results this year give us the confidence that we are on the right path and that there is a huge opportunity in front of us to drive long-term profitable growth and to maximize shareholder returns. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our plans for 2024. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Eric, please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two, if I can. In terms of Vrbo and the migration, how should we be thinking about post-migration and elements of growth and how Vrbo will be tied deeper into One Key as a stimulant for growth on that brand as we look out beyond 2023 and into 2024. And with respect to the new buyback authorization, any guardrails either aligned against annualized free cash flow or targets around liquidity about how you might deploy that $5 billion in the years ahead. Thanks so much. Peter Kern : Thanks, Eric. I'll take the first one and maybe let Julie answer the question on buybacks. As far as Vrbo goes, obviously, as I said, we just literally finished the app migration, and people haven't even updated all their apps yet. So it will take a little time for us to be fully across, but we're talking about weeks. And then I think it's a build from there. You have to remember that going through the migration was actually a negative process. It was conversion negative for us to come across, switch the stacks then optimize the stacks and improve them. So we're in the process now of having everything across and working on the improvement part and inflecting past where we were previously. So one, the product will improve from here. We won't have the drag of the conversion drags we've had during this past year, while we were migrating. And then, there are many things to drive growth in the future, we believe, obviously, we believe greatly in One Key. It's a key differentiator in the VR space. It allows all our members across Expedia and HCOM, which are many more in number of humans to have the option of using their One Key cash on Vrbo instead of on a different VR platform or for other products. It's a way to pull out more customers into Vrbo. It's a way to make Vrbo decidedly better as a value proposition than its competition. And I think there's a number of other things we are doing. I mentioned on our last call, we will work to incorporate much more of the multiunit vacation rental properties, we actually have on our OTA brands that don't live on Vrbo yet that we will be moving. So there's many parts to our growth plan in Vrbo, but I think we're excited now. We had to get across this work so that we could again start optimizing, really push One Key fully and take advantage of some of these other pieces we've been waiting on to finish the migration so that we could then move this inventory and do other the things that open up growth opportunities. So we feel good about how Vrbo's positioned. Obviously, this was a tough year of migration, but a lot of optimism for what we can do in the coming years with it. Julie Whalen : And then as far as the $5 billion buyback authorization, we don't per se have any set guardrails, although I would say that generally speaking, we look to what our free cash flow levels are in the year. and obviously make a decision then where our stock price is and where we believe the valuation of the company is and what our long-term outlook is, make a call as to how much then pivots to buybacks. But at the same time, we've also got excess cash and so if we wanted to be even more aggressive on what is per se, the free cash flow plan for the year, we could do that as well. So the short answer is it really depends, but we have a lot of flexibility there and we intend to buy back our stock opportunistically. Operator : Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Lee, please go ahead. Lee Horowitz : Peter, you talked about your business next year driving faster and more profitable growth yet, which presumably underwrite some top-line reacceleration yet you're a bit more cautious on the fourth quarter given some geopolitical concerns. I guess what gives you the confidence in sort of that accelerated outlook into 2024 despite the geopolitical concerns you guys highlighted as well as others in the market perhaps going out some incremental macro headwinds building for the travel industry. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Lee. Look, I'm not opining as a world leader on the likelihood of geopolitical acceleration potentially in '24. I certainly hope not for all our sakes. What we're seeing now, as we referred to, there was some short-term movement in early October that appeared to be from what was going on in the Middle East. That doesn't appear to be an ongoing thing, but there was some noise. So we are mindful of the potential volatility from that. But I would say we're more ambitious and more excited because, frankly, even the fourth quarter is just barely beginning to get the benefit like when I talk about Vrbo being past the migration like it was like 2 days ago. So fourth quarter, we're in the middle of the fourth quarter. So getting a lot out of that now in the next 8 weeks is a lot harder than what we have ambition for next year. And if you take that across everything and you take that across One Key still being in relatively early days, and so forth. We're still like this is a big snowball we're pushing and it's starting to turn, but it's going to turn faster and faster. So we have more ambition about our own ability to drive it next year and our own opportunity there. Obviously, there could be macro things that make it harder or easier on all of us. But we think relative to our competition, relative to where we've been, we're just going to be in a much better place. So that is what gives us ambition, it's not that we think the world will all come down and all wars will go away and everyone will have piece. It's that we think we're just going to be in a materially better spot as we're further along this journey. Lee Horowitz : Got it. And then maybe one follow-up on that. You talked about sort of leading into some international markets perhaps next year. I guess now with all of the tech migration behind you, are there any gating factors as it relates to the timing of when you may put some investment dollars to work there, or how should we just sort of think about the phasing of sort of those broader global ambitions that you guys have into 2024? Peter Kern : Yes. I think technologically, there aren't a lot of gating items. I mentioned that we've only rolled One Key to the U.S. So rolling One Key along with leaning in more energy into certain places will be part of the strategy. But again, not a gating issue, but that has to happen and there is some technical work to getting that launched in other countries. It's not a big lift, it's just something that will come as we roll out. But more importantly, I'd say it's a balance. We believe we're equipped now. We believe we have the tools to compete better than we ever have. We believe we have a winning product. And as we all know, you've got to market back into these countries. I mentioned the better understanding of customers, which customers we want, how we get the right customers, how we find the highest lifetime value customers, things like that. It's really just about doing it in an orderly process. We're not going to just carpet bond in the world. We're going to go selectively after the most valuable markets to us where we have the most right to win, and we're going to keep chipping away at it. But we're excited to go back on offense in the rest of the world. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Kevin, please go ahead. Jacob Hendricks : Hi. This is Jacob in for Kevin. So wondering if you can provide color on regional performance quarter-to-date? And also, what are the cost levers that you expect to see from the tech market ratio as we look at points before. Peter Kern : Yes. Sorry, you broke up a little bit, but I'll take a stab at it. I think in terms of the regional, what we've seen is, as I mentioned, APAC and Latin America have been faster-growing markets for everybody. Basically, it's a function of where different regions are in terms of their rebound post-COVID. North America and Europe and APAC, excuse me, EMEA are more stable. They've been kind of saw the rebound earlier and have been on a more consistent state. We've seen the same in our business, but our business is less exposed to APAC than it is to, obviously, North America, somewhat less exposed to Europe. So there's differences there. But what we've seen and I referred to is what we're seeing is pretty much around the globe, we've been able to hold or grow share even in markets where we have relatively small share. Again, we're eating into the pie and different of those markets, we have different aggression for but remember, we've done this basically with four arms tied behind our back. We're trying to do what we could with the levers we had. And increasingly, we have more and more levers and better and better product and all of that will make us more competitive, we believe, as we go forward. As far as the efficiencies go, I think we've been saying this for a while, but we've had these huge tasks that we've undertaken to get across the transformation, do these migrations, et cetera. Everything gets faster and easier. So think of it as either more output with the same amount of energy or opportunities, whether it be in cloud, as Julie referred to or other licensing and maintenance other opportunities in which work we choose to do, that there's this opportunity now to stop. We've grown for quite a bit of time now in our, particularly in product and tech. We no longer need to grow our base of overhead in order to grow our business much faster. So as those lines diverge, we become more efficient, and that's what we're talking about. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan from B. Riley Securities. Naved, please go ahead. Naved Khan : A couple of questions here. So just on the consumer, are you seeing any sign of the consumer weakening or maybe trading down or just taking longer to book anything there? And then on the Vrbo migration, Peter, I think you had earlier talked about how the website piece was done and the app was the one that was remaining. And that, I think, has been completed just in the last week or so. But anything you can share on the website migration and how that might be yielding results, any early signs on that? Thank you. Peter Kern : Sure. So the first part of your question, we haven't seen really anything on the consumer side. We keep looking. But there's definitely nothing obvious and you'd have to squint it really hard and look by sub, sub, subregion to try to foray and cut it by price point and a lot of things to really see anything noticeable. Interestingly and anecdotally, we've seen that customers who have gotten One Key cash where they didn't have it before, et cetera, or in some cases, as part of One Key, we introduced higher discounts for our silver and gold members at certain properties that customers are typically using it to get a better room type as opposed to take the money to the bottom line. So they're actually using the available capital they had in mind just for more rather than saving the money. So again, that's just an anecdote, but there does not appear to be any major shift going on. Of course, we have historically and still are strongest in the mid and upper parts of the market as opposed to the lowest end of the market. And that, again, may be moving slightly, but we have not seen any broad consumer change in habit. As far as your second question goes, as I mentioned, the first part of moving the website was going backwards to go forwards, was consolidating it. Vrbo is now getting the benefit of a lot of successful winners that we had rolled out on our OTA brands across Expedia and Hotels.com, and now it will benefit from many of the things that have won there. So we're in the middle of testing in all the things that have won historically on the OTA brands, getting the best-in-class of maps and other things search and store and so forth. I'd say we're still in that journey. I'd say we're still behind in terms of conversion, in terms of pre versus post migration on the website, but we are on the rise and catching up, and we expect to inflect past where we were [indiscernible]. And the app so far has appeared to have done better, and our hopes are that we'll see less of -- less going backwards and more going forward faster. So we're directionally going up from here, but we did have to take a little bit of a step back as we migrate. Operator : Our next question comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Jed, please go ahead. Jed Kelly : Two, if I may, can you just talk about some of the marketing efficiencies you plan, you think you'll get around brand now being able to use One Key and highlight your three brands. And then just going in now that the tech migration is complete, how do you view growing EBITDA dollars versus EBITDA margin? Thank you. Peter Kern : I'll take the first part and thanks, Jed and have Julie take the second. I would say that from a marketing efficiency standpoint, you've seen us just begin to market more with the launch of One Key sort of the brands together. And that is a journey that we will continue to learn on and grow on in terms of how to optimize our brand spend and all of our performance marketing spend to optimize the best place to bring a customer in. And then the best way to bring them around our universe of products. But I would say what we're most excited about is the ability to get customers to cross shop and to get them to use, stay in our group of brands and spend their money there, and that gives us a lot more opportunity to drive direct business because we already have a big base of customers in each of those brands that we can now bring to other brands, whether it's an HCOM customer who needs a flight or a car or whether it's an Expedia customer who needs a Vrbo, that ability to keep everything in the universe, get people to use that currency across. As we all know, the more direct business we have, the more margin it drives and then we have the latitude to invest or not as much as we want into performance marketing, driving new customer acquisition. And again, we're getting smarter and smarter about who we go after, how we go after them and how we optimize for the lifetime value of that customer base. So I think that's how we think about it. In terms of the practical like have we figured out all the nuts and bolts of the best way to promote the brands together. The best way to promote One Key, I think we're still on a learning journey there, but we're excited about it. And the One Key work was awesome and you're going to start to see the brands more present in other brands as time goes on. But I think the big opportunity, as I mentioned about new members, we took a group that didn't have membership basically, and turn them into new members in a big pool of membership where they can get a lot of benefit across a bunch of different products that they couldn't get before from Vrbo. So that's what's exciting to us. Our goal is to drive much more direct business through that. And as I think we've said before, we look at spend for loyalty, for marketing, for any kind of pricing and discounting things we do, all as one pool of capital that's focused on the best way to acquire and retain customers, and that's really -- so we're happy to trade those dollars off to the most efficient way to drive the overall business. And that's what you're going to see us do over time more and more. Julie Whalen : And I think the short answer on the EBITDA question post tech migration is, we expect to drive obviously both. We want to have strong EBITDA dollar growth and we want to have margin expansion. We're not going to need to invest as much as we have in the past. As Peter said earlier, now the protect migration is complete. We should be starting to get more efficiencies out of machine here by deprecating systems, redeploying resources, cutting all the incremental costs associated with that and just getting more output, getting more leverage from all of the goodness that we've been investing in the past. Now we are also wanting to be on the offensive as we said. So there may be times in areas that we think we need to invest, still driving EBITDA growth and maybe not as much EBITDA margin in certain situations. But for the most part, we're committed to both, but this is a year of offense and so we want to have that flexibility. Operator : Our next question comes from John Colantuoni from Jefferies. John, please go ahead. Chris Roop : This is Chris on for John. Thanks for taking the question. So there have been some questions around the trajectory of alternative accommodation nights growth across the industry broadly. Could you elaborate on kind of how recent demand trends as far to Vrbo and beyond the onetime impacts from things like the tech migration in Maui fires, have you seen any changes in customer preference for vacation rentals? Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Chris. I think for us, and we're a little differently situated than our competition. But for us, we saw a huge COVID era boom when everyone was trying to be in their own house and rent their own space and whatever. We definitely saw a little bit of pressure on that this past year as that kind of came off. But in terms of how things are progressing, once you kind of reset for that, we think demand is pretty stable, and there's lots of opportunity for growth. In the other parts of the business, our friends across the way, they play in urban much more in shared accommodations. We do think there's opportunity in urban and we are building supply in many areas, but we are sticking to our knitting of the whole home whole apartment experience as opposed to shared spaces, et cetera. We think there's lots of runway there, and there will be probably more supply coming on as homeowners struggle with mortgage rates and other things. There's a good opportunity for supply there. So we still see plenty of opportunity in compressed places and compressed time, banded time periods in different areas. So I think we feel good about going back on offense. We've been playing, this is one of the areas we've been playing a little bit with the hand tied behind our back. But macro in the whole home space, we expect there to be growth again, barring geo political, who knows. And I can't speak for the other shared accommodation spaces and other things, that's not where we're focused. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Post from Bank of America. Anthony, please go ahead. Justin Post : With bookings growing 7% this quarter and you're suggesting similar growth next quarter, how do you think that positions you for top-line growth next year? You mentioned maybe accelerating off of this year. So just thinking about the bookings growth rate and implications. And then second, I know there's been a lot of effort to increase app users versus maybe using search marketing. Are you seeing anything in the customer metrics, and I apologize if it's already been asked, but anything in the customer metrics that show better repeat rates or better return on that ad spend than you were getting, say, a few years ago. Julie Whalen : I'll take the first one. I mean as far as the bookings, I think this past quarter and the subsequent Q4 guidance that we gave those are both indicative of some shorter-term things that have occurred. So as we mentioned, we were unfortunately impacted by the Maui fires that brought down gross bookings lower than we had expected in Q3, and we're being thoughtful in our Q4 guidance of what could potentially be an impact associated with the uncertainty in the geopolitical environment. So we'll see how that plays out for the quarter. So early in the quarter, we've seen very little noise at this point, but that doesn't necessarily provide an indication of what's going to happen in 2024. And for all the things that Peter mentioned that we have completed and all the momentum we have in the underlying health of the business and coming out of the tech migration and all the goodness that's coming from the One Key launch and the growing base of app and loyalty members and all of that kind of adding on top of each other as we incrementally roll through the year should drive that gross bookings up. Peter Kern : And I'll just add, and I'll take the second part. But I wish I could tell you that this migration is like we flip a switch when it's over and everything goes 2x. But it is, you're growing out of a period of lots of change with all the tools you need to go faster, but they built on each other over time. So our first week out of the gate is not going to be like our 52nd week out of the gate. And so this is something where there's some noise in the numbers as we alluded to from geopolitics and other things, we'll see where it ends up landing, but our enthusiasm for what next year can bring is built on the underlying building blocks, not on the what is the trend line today or what is the macro. So that's where our enthusiasm comes from. As for the metrics you're asking about, yes, absolutely. I mean it was the understanding and knowing that app members, in particular, our highest producing customers have the highest return rates, the highest CLV et cetera, was the reason we lean so heavily into app. It may not be that surprising that's the case. Obviously, they have a propensity to come direct more, which saves us money is remarketing them. So there's lots of elements that make those members better for us. We have invested both directly and acquiring them through marketing as well as doing much, much more in the product. to move customers into the app for all of those reasons. And we're still seeing that those cohorts still perform better even as we pushed more and more people they still perform better than a guest or a member who's not in the app, et cetera. So those statistics have held up. We keep pushing it. You're going to see us keep pushing it. We are going to be app first in terms of product, in terms of where you see the most innovation coming and coming fastest. So we are fully leaned into getting customers into our best product, making our app our best product and experience and making sure all of that innovation I talked about is happening first and foremost in the app, so we get more people in it. More people into the state we like and then, of course, hopefully, working between our apps as they enjoy the benefits of our loyalty program. So that's, yes, to all of that. The numbers hold up. We've seen the benefit, and that's why we keep pushing it. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Tom, please go ahead. Tom Champion : Peter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the growth you're seeing out of China. Maybe it was on the B2B side. It sounded quite strong. And then, Julie, question for you, going back to the buyback, the size is kind of eye-popping. How did you arrive at that amount being appropriate? And what's the total in the plan as of today, including the existing plus new? Peter Kern : Yes. I'll knock off the first. Yes. I mean our B2B business, we have a nice business in China. China, as you know, is a tough place to compete on a B2C basis and really none of the Western companies do anymore. So we don't have that benefit. On the B2B side, we're seeing a nice pickup. But I'll remind you that airlift out of China is still well below pre-Covid levels. There were some recent announcements in the last week increasing flights between China and the U.S., which is a good story, but it's still not a massive story. So you still have substantially less airlift out of China into most of the west. So it's not going to be again, it's not going to be a snap your finger and it's back to 2019 levels, but I think it's going to be a nice tailwind for a long time as hopefully, relations improve and more travel opens up, there's visa issues in China and other things. So we're seeing some good progress there. We power some of the local players in our B2B business, off-line travel agents and online. And there's definitely a pickup of travel. Some of that is intra-Asia. Some is even intra China, but for the big pick up, there is a piece that we really haven't gotten to yet, which is getting China back to real international travel at pre-COVID levels, which will take some time. But it's a nice tailwind, obviously, mainly for our B2B business, and that business has a lot of tailwinds. So it's just another one for us. Julie Whalen : As far as the $5 billion buyback, I mean, if you look at how much we've bought back just year-to-date, it's what, a little over 2x that. So this is meant to be a multiyear, but we feel definitely very comfortable with this level and with the fact that we know we're going to be having growing free cash flow. And so we thought this was the right amount to go out with. So we're not doing an annual review, if you will, but not also making it so far out. So we thought it was a good healthy balance. As far as what's left in the plan today, there's very, very, very little. So this is really I would see this as sort of a new and existing launch. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Deepak, please go ahead. Zachary Morrissey : This is Zach on for Deepak. I just wanted to ask about how Hotels.com, like consumer behavior has been performing given the change in incentives from the 1Q launch? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. Thanks, Zach. As I mentioned in my comments, we were prepared for some dislocation and some people being upset. Obviously, there have been a few, but actually, it's been considerably less than we expected and the behavior of the customer base has been frankly better than we anticipated. Hardly, we had a number of ways we were going to make that right with our customers and continue to do. But in general, we've seen less unhappiness and generally behavior that's consistent with their prior buying behaviors by and large. There are some exceptions, and we've had some programs to help with our most valued customers there. But again, we think we're moving into a really good state with being a gold or even platinum member of One Key and ton of benefits that come with that. And as I alluded to, we're starting to see them use their One Key cash on Expedia to buy other things. So it's the beginnings of what we are trying to ferment, which is this idea that while it may not be quite as rich, it's much more flexible. You can use it for many more things and with the improved member discounts and other added benefits we've added to the program. you can get just as much benefit out of the program, just built slightly different way and now way more flexible. So in general, we were pleased. I'd say if we took the over-under, it was definitely better than we had hoped and knock wood it remains that way, and we feel pretty good about how it's trending. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Richard, please go ahead. Richard Clarke : Just the first one, thinking about your growth into 2024 and beyond and the ability to keep B2B revenues growing in the double-digit level. What visibility do you have of future deals or upside within your current deals to keep delivering that level of growth? Peter Kern : Yes. I'd say we feel quite good about our continued growth of the B2B business. As I mentioned, we're still finalizing our plans for next year. So not committing to any numbers or anything. But in terms of double-digit growth, we feel confident that the B2B business can continue to grow based on a number of reasons. One, we are constantly adding new partners. And like same-store sales, first year new partner doesn't perform like a second-year partner, and so people mature into performance. So we've got a runway of that. We have an expectation of what we continue to sell into in the marketplace, whether it's offline travel agents, new partners on our APIs or on our platform. We've got a number of initiatives designed to make our products even more appealing, whether it's new flexibility and how our technology works for our partners, how they can choose the best price, how they can put the best pieces together. So we have a number of initiatives that all build up to what we think is good visibility into continued strong growth in that business. Richard Clarke : Thanks. And maybe if I can just ask one follow-up to a question someone asked earlier. Just on the One Key launch, I guess there's been some questions around what's the cost to you of rolling that out? And maybe could you quantify what's been the level of contra revenue you've had to include to fulfill the decent growth you've seen there? Peter Kern : Yes. Well, I would say that in principle, when we were rolling it out, the idea was that between our collective loyalty programs, it would not be net additive to the cost. It would be allocated differently among our customers and the benefits would be spread more evenly across our base of customers. So you can think of it as kind of a zero-sum game in terms of total expected dollars expended in contra revenue. Now there were other benefits, as I mentioned, more member discounts, other things built into our platinum level and other. So there are some other pieces that added other value outside of just what you see in kind of the contra revenue space. But that was designed to kind of be a zero sum-ish game. And as I alluded to, we held some back to help bring along our Hotels.com customers, et cetera. some of which we've expended. But all in all, it's basically been as good or better than we you thought in terms of a cost exercise. We still have a long way to go to get all the benefit on the growth side of it. That's something we continue to work on. And as I mentioned, it takes some time to come through the numbers. But in terms of the cost side, I think we've made that transition we are incurring roughly a similar -- think of it as a similar overall cost against the revenue margin across the whole business. And now we just have a lot more people engaged in the program. So we think the net positive on the growth side and shouldn't really cost us in terms of, think of it as revenue margin shouldn't really cost us any more than we were expending before. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : The feature that you've had on the app for quite some time, I think, maybe on the website, too, with ChatGPT, can you just talk about what kind of traction that feature is getting and what you'd like to get out of that in the future.? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes. Sure, Mark. Well, so first of all, we were the first to launch it. We've been learning a lot as we've gone. We've talked at a few conferences about how we've learned to help customers engage with it. Sometimes they don't know what to ask. There's a lot of discovery going on in the world of generative AI around prompts and how to get people into the right questions, et cetera. So we're doing a bunch of work on that. We've recently, frankly, just highlighted it more, so people could find it. We weren't necessarily certain it was a net conversion winner or not anything winner. We just knew customers were curious. We wanted to see if we could help them with planning, et cetera. Since we've highlighted it more, we've gotten much more engagement. But again, it's early days, and it's not really I wouldn't think of it as impacting the business materially other than keeping us on the forefront of technology for our customers and the customers who want to experience it and discover through it. Now as I mentioned, we are using generative AI in many other ways besides just that, hey, I want to go to Paris, when is a good time to go to Paris question, but we're using it in our reviews to help customers sift through reviews and ask a simple question. We're using it in service. We're using it in a lot of places. So generative AI is a bigger story for us long-term and for everybody. But I think in terms of that one feature on the home page, it's still pretty small. People who like it really like it. I wouldn't say it's moving the business one way or the other, but it's a feature we want to have up there, and it's a feature we want to enhance. And ultimately, we want to use AI broadly and generative AI to take you more easily through the collective journey. Whatever part of it you can use it best for, whether that's home page, discovery, kind of greenfields trying to figure out a trip or anywhere through search, sort, purchase comparison, all of those places that are complicated areas for customers. We want to help use AI, use generative AI where appropriate to just take friction out of that journey end-to-end. And that's a journey we're on, and homepage is just one part of it. Operator : Our final question is from Ken Gabreski from Wells Fargo. Ken, please go ahead. Alec Brondolo : Hey. This is Alec on for Ken. Appreciate the question. It seems like the business journey over the last couple of years has been focused on centralization, centralization of the tech platform, centralization of the loyalty program. How do you think about centralization of brands? Specifically, it feels like Orbitz, Hotwire Travelocity, the legacy brands have been a drag on nights growth over the last few years. Could it make sense to clean that up in '24? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes. Thank you, Ken (sic) [Alec]. I would say, again, we are happy to have customers on any brands they enjoy. But if you look at how we've invested capital, we have not been really investing in those smaller brands for the last few years. There are still customers who enjoy those brands. We're not planning to turn them off or make them go somewhere else. We obviously think they'd be better off in our main brands with the best-in-class loyalty program and everything else. But at this point, and really, to your point, as we've centralized the technology, the lift of maintaining those things has gone away. So as we get rid of having multiple stacks and old stacks to keep up and other things like that, we get to an efficient state where 1 or 21 doesn't really matter. Now it's a matter of brand marketing, as a matter of consumer experience, we are focused on the big 3 and we will keep doing that. And in different parts of the world, that may look slightly different. We may have fewer than three. We may have one or two that's under a different name. But in general, we are going to be focused on a small group of brands where all the spending goes and then to the extent we have these other brands, we don't want to run customers off. As you say, that's been a drag. It's increasingly small drag, if I can say that, like it's getting smaller and so the drag is getting smaller, which is helping us, honestly, as we start to accelerate the bigger pieces and they outrun the drags. But we're also not trying to accelerate their drag on us, and we will maintain those as long as customers like using them, but you should expect those to continue to shrink and for virtually all our energy certainly are spending energy to go into the core brands. Thank you. Peter Kern : I think that's it. So thank you, operator. That's the last question. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you after the end of the year. Take care. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining, everyone. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to SVP, Corporate Development Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to be joined on today's call by our CEO, Peter Kern, and our CFO, Julie Whalen. As a reminder, our commentary today will include references to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. And unless otherwise stated, any reference to expenses exclude stock-based compensation. We will also be making forward-looking statements during the call, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Actual results could materially differ due to factors discussed during this call and in our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. Our earnings release, SEC filings, and the replay of today's call can be found on our investor relations website at ir.xpediagroup.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you, Harshit, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. First of all, I just want to acknowledge the news that I will be stepping down in May as CEO after my contract ends, and will be passing the baton to Ariane Gorin, who currently heads our Expedia for Business. As many of you know, when I started this unexpected journey during COVID, travel was at a standstill. Money was flowing out of the company faster than we could replace it. And our people, our shareholders, and most of the world were unsure how and when we would ever come back. Strangely, those days never really worried me. Maybe I'm an optimist, but I always believed we'd get back to life and travel would follow. While you might assume that COVID was the defining part of my tenure, in reality, we quickly saw an opportunity to use our COVID time to embark on one of the most audacious and ambitious transformations I think a company of our size has ever attempted. It was always my hope that we would finish this massive task by now, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that was sometimes in doubt. We had many fits and starts as we took on this massive overhaul. But when you do something as bold as we were attempting, you have to be prepared to deal with some mess. And as much as anything, I'm proud that we were not afraid of the mess, and we pushed through. And as the work began to accelerate in the back half of last year, I could finally see that we would, in fact, meet my timetable. Over the last four years, we built a tremendous team who in turn accomplished amazing things. I have to say that what started in an unlikely and difficult way turned out to be one of the most compelling and challenging opportunities of my career. Now I'm not going anywhere yet, and I intend to sprint through the finish line on the way out. Among my important tasks between now and then is ensuring an absolutely seamless transition to Arianne and making sure none of our team misses a beat. I just want to say that I've had the pleasure of working with Arianne closely for the last four years, and I believe she is a terrific choice to take the company forward and build on what we have created. She is a seasoned leader with a very successful track record at Expedia Group, including most recently as head of our market-leading B2B business. I look forward to working with Arianne over the next few months, and I will not be going far as I return to my perch as Vice Chairman. Now that I've addressed that, let's move on to our results. I was generally very pleased with our performance in 2023. We met our guidance despite what was a year of tremendous change. It is really difficult to fully appreciate the breadth of change and the volatility that such change can create. We've discussed this many times, but when you have to willingly take steps backward to go forward, you create a lot of inherent unpredictability. And yet despite that, we delivered and landed the year. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong revenue and EBITDA performance, but we did see some softness in gross bookings, driven primarily by AIR, which in turn was largely driven by a reduction in average ticket prices. As you all know, AIR does not impact revenue or profitability very much, but it does have an outsized impact on our overall gross bookings. While AIR has been showing some signs of macro softening, we continue to improve our AIR product with new AI-driven features and pricing capabilities. And like many areas of our business, we see significant opportunity to grow, regardless of any macro headwinds. Our lodging business held up very well and had yet another record quarter, with our hotel gross bookings growing 13% year-over-year. Vrbo finished its planned front-end migration in Q4 and suffered expected conversion, degradation. But it now has more tests running than ever in its history, and we are clawing back conversion at a breakneck pace. We also cut back last year on Vrbo marketing in concert with the expected conversion degradation, but are now really excited about our new brand work that is designed to punch our main competitors squarely in the nose, and we are leaning back into spend. There's a bit of lag effect as we ramp back up, but we are excited to get Vrbo back on offense with the product improving every day, the impact from improved and increased marketing, and of course, our secret weapon in One Key, whose effect we'll only continue to build. We did an awful lot in 2023, from the launch of One Key to the completion of the Vrbo migration, from the plumbing of machine learning and AI into more and more of our customer experience, to the launch of chat GPT-assisted trip planning. But more important than any win in2023 is the sheer magnitude of change we have driven since we embarked on our transformation journey at the beginning of 2020. Over this period, we rationalized investments in over 20 brands to three or fewer in every region. We eliminated dependency on 76 different agencies around the globe and instead built an entire full-service marketing, creative, and media buying team internally. We consolidated all performance marketing into one group, with unified data and tools, allowing us to optimize across brands and bring programmatic approaches to everything we do in meta-search, social, SEO, and everywhere else. And we fundamentally shifted the business from transactional web arbitrage to app-first, focused on acquiring and retaining the customers with the highest LTV and return on investment. On the tech side, we decommissioned 17 CRM systems and built one universal messaging platform linking all brands. We went from seven different loyalty stacks to one key. We consolidated from 13 machine learning platforms and four experimentation platforms to one. We converged 300 million customer data profiles into one common identity platform. We have meaningfully reduced the number of developer tools and optimized our IT footprint. And most importantly, all our brands are now on a single front-end stack with a unified test-to-learn platform that gives us the ability to rapidly launch tests and features across brands, platforms, and geos. It is hard to fully conceptualize how much we have changed, but perhaps one simple way is to double-click on how all these elements allow us to massively accelerate our test-and-learn capability and drive faster feature deployment and better performance in the product. Our unified front-end now allows us to deploy features around the globe and on any brand at a pace we could not contemplate just a couple years ago. What used to take months, even years, now takes weeks and sometimes just days? Our recent launch of cars on Hotels.com in the U.S. is a perfect example of something that never made the cut list because of the massive engineering lift. But post-unifying the front-end stacks, it took literally weeks to deploy. That same unified front-end allows us to massively increase the breadth and impact of our test-and-learns, while our single test environment, along with ML and AI woven throughout the customer experience, now allow us to run many multiples of the tests we used to and call them much faster, the combination of which will allow us to effectively 8X our test-and-learn impact in 2024. It cannot be stated strongly enough. We are just at a completely different place technologically, and the effects we have seen so far are only just scratching the surface of what is possible. And while there are endless achievements to be proud of in our transformation, it is equally remarkable that even while swapping out our engine mid-flight, we were able to deliver consistently solid financial performance. We grew our business throughout our transformation, notably reaching record levels of lodging gross bookings and revenue, despite having sold off and shuttered a number of businesses along the way. Our continued operating discipline has driven EBITDA margins to the highest levels in over a decade. We have used our strong free cash flow to aggressively buy back our stock at attractive prices, and as a result, our share count today is down to 2015 levels. We have closed over 100 office locations, and we have 30% fewer heads than our 2019 peak. And meaningfully, we have gone from approximately 30% of people working in product and tech in 2019 to 50% today. Again, we are at a truly different place as a company as we launch into 2024, which does not mean that it's all just linear improvement from here, that learn and test-and-learn is a big part of our journey, and we will still get things wrong in our tireless effort to improve the customer experience. But we can afford to get a lot more wrong as we, in fact, get a lot more right. Ultimately, more at-bats, the sheer power of going fast and simplifying our ability to innovate is what puts us in a position to once again lead our industry technologically for the next decade. So what does all that mean for 2024? On a macro level, we expect travel demand to remain relatively healthy, but we expect growth rates across the world to decelerate, especially early in the year as we lap the post-Omicron tailwinds we saw last year. We are still expecting much faster growth internationally outside North America and Western Europe, though we expect the gap to continue closing. We may also see some softness in prices across categories. This past quarter, both hotel and vacation rental ADRs grew very slightly, but the mixed effects led to overall lodging ADRs declining year-over-year. And as I mentioned earlier, air ticket prices have declined, particularly in the U.S., and we are seeing some continued pressure on car rental rates. Against this backdrop, though, we are well-positioned to go back on offense, gain share against competition, and ultimately grow our top and bottom line meaningfully this year. Our strategy will remain largely unchanged, but we can finally stop doing surgery on ourselves and instead execute without the numerous distractions we have faced in recent years. We will be laser-focused on five strategic priorities, which broadly translate to all parts of our business. First, we will continue our focus on acquiring and retaining high ROI travelers. We've become much sharper about measuring customer lifetime value and targeting who to go after and which channels. With a greatly improved product driven by the latest ML and AI capabilities, and One Key, which now has over 100 million members, we will continue to drive greater retention, repeat, and direct business, all of which underpins our shift towards more loyalty in app members. In fact, we ended the year with our highest-ever percentage of business coming from the app, up nearly 600 basis points year-over-year. We will be scaling One Key internationally this year and expect to see our mix of app members continue to increase in those markets, With better customer targeting, constantly improving a stickier AI-driven products, and One Key, we feel really good about continuing to build momentum and value in our member roles. Our second priority will be to increase our share of wallet with our travelers and partners. Again, with a product that uses AI and ML to predict a consumer's best next action in order to sell complimentary items, be it in the booking flow, post-booking, and in CRM communications, our core experience will continue to drive more items and more dollars into the consumer's basket. We will also drive more cross-brand and cross-product engagement through One Key, which enables cross-earn and redemption across all our key brands and encourages consumers to stay in our ecosystem for all their travel needs. We are already seeing early signs of this with an increasing number of customers who cross-shop our brands in the U.S. since the launch of One Key. And as we continue to roll out One Key outside the U.S. and now have the ability to roll out new lines of business on different brands, we expect all of these moves to allow us to capture more wallet share from our consumers. Our third priority will be to accelerate our global market expansion. We've talked before about how we retrenched back to the U.S. during the pandemic while we were overhauling our tech platform and marketing model. We pulled back in certain countries where we did not have the right product market fit and had been spending more but losing share. Now, after changing virtually everything from how we market to how we retain customers to our entire product experience, we have what it takes to go back on offense. In the back half of 2023, we were able to hold or build share in most of our core markets, and now we have the opportunity to be more aggressive. In 2024, you will see us spend up in a number of markets to reclaim real share where we believe we have the right to win. Our fourth priority will be to continue cementing our leadership in the B2B segment. Revenue in this segment grew a stellar 33% in 2023 versus 2022. While it benefited from the APAC reopening, and we expect those geo tailwinds to moderate somewhat this year, we are still expecting very strong growth given our differentiated capabilities and a huge TAM to still penetrate. As I have explained before, our B2B business benefits from all the work we have done in product and technology to win in B2C, along with all the B2B specific innovations we have rolled out over the last few years. We are seeing a strong pipeline of new customers globally, and we continue to find ways to gain wallet share in our accounts. And beyond just offering supply, we have achieved good early results in externalizing components of our technology to our partners as well. Overall, I'm very enthusiastic about reinforcing our leadership in powering the travel industry. Our fifth strategic priority will be to drive efficiency and effectiveness across our business. As I mentioned, we have grown our EBITDA margins to their highest levels in a decade, growing over 300 basis points since 2019. But we are capable of much more. All of our transformation work was not only to enhance our consumer experience, but also to allow us to do more with less. We have significant opportunity to run more efficiently across the company, to eliminate redundant systems, to keep optimizing in the cloud, and utilize the latest productivity capabilities from AI. In addition, we will keep leveraging our technology leadership to find opportunities for decreasing costs while increasing customer experience. The work we have done in improving our customer service operations is a great case study. By building better technology and self-service tools, we have both improved our NPS and created massive efficiencies, all while maintaining our best-in-class service. And generative AI will only accelerate this trend. So in closing, I'm incredibly pleased and proud of everything we have accomplished over the last few years, and I'm really excited about our path forward. Thanks to our massive transformation, we are now a very different company than we were four years ago. We are set up to out-innovate our competition for the next decade and efficiently deliver the best experiences for our customers and partners. And if we do that, the business and shareholder returns will take care of themselves. While you have to kick me around for one more earning cycle, let me just say that in addition to the gratitude I feel for the team and all that we have done to foster our collective interests, I'm also grateful to our chairman, our board, and our shareholders for supporting the ambition we had and helping us get to this point. And with that, I will hand it over to Julie. Julie Whalen : Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. Before I get into our financials, I do want to take a moment to thank Peter and to express my confidence in Ariane as our new CEO come May. I've had the pleasure of knowing Peter since I joined Expedia Group's board in 2019, and of course, in a more detailed manner since assuming my role as CFO in 2022. Throughout this journey, Peter has done an amazing job navigating us through the pandemic, driving our massive business transformation, and setting us up for a very successful future. I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to work for Peter. He will be missed, but I am glad he'll continue to support Expedia Group through his ongoing role on our board as Vice Chairman. At the same time, I look forward to working alongside Ariane as she assumes her new role as CEO this May. Ariane and I have partnered closely together since I first came to Expedia Group. She's an accomplished operator who has been in our leadership team for many years, and it will be great to have someone so familiar with our business and our ecosystem lead us into this next exciting phase for our company. And now let's turn to the financials. Our fourth quarter results once again reflect another quarter of accelerating performance on the top and bottom line, with revenue and EBITDA growing double digits to record levels. This continued strong quarterly performance resulted in full year results at the highest levels we have ever seen across lodging bookings and overall revenue in EBITDA. For full year 2023, we delivered over $104 billion in total gross bookings, growing 10% versus last year, including almost $74 billion in lodging bookings, growing 11%, with the hotel business growing even faster at 18%. We drove $12.8 billion of revenue, growing 10%, and we also generated $2.7 billion of EBITDA, with EBITDA margin of 21%, which grew faster than revenue at 14%, and resulted in year-over-year margin expansion of almost 75 basis points. In addition, our B2C business saw meaningful sequential acceleration in year-over-year revenue growth in the back half of the year, and generated marketing leverage for the full year. And our B2B business went from strength to strength, having its most successful year in our history, with both top and bottom line growth of over 33%. And this overall strong financial performance resulted in us meeting our full year guidance of double digit top line growth with margin expansion. Now I will discuss more of the details regarding our fourth quarter results. Total gross bookings of $21.7 billion were up 6% versus last year. Gross bookings were impacted by some pressure in our air bookings in the quarter, primarily driven by lower average ticket prices as more capacity came online, as well as overall gross bookings pressure at the beginning of the quarter from the crisis in the Middle East, as we called out on our last quarter's earnings call. Gross bookings for lodging, our largest business, had another record quarter growing 8%, relatively in line with our third quarter growth rate. And we saw even faster growth in our hotel business at 13%. We also continued to gain or maintain share in our hotel business across our key markets around the world, consistent with last quarter. Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&L, starting with total revenue. Revenue of $2.9 billion was the highest on record and grew 10% versus last year. This was an approximate 160 basis point acceleration from the third quarter, driven by both our B2C and B2B segments. Revenue growth is primarily driven by the continued performance of lodging, which grew 14%. Total revenue margin also increased by approximately 55 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by the continued mix to lodging, which has higher margins. Cost of sales was $336 million for the quarter and $72 million or 17% lower than last year, which combined with our strong top line growth drove approximately 390 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus last year. We were pleased to see that our ongoing initiatives to deliver an improved customer experience and increased automation are resulting in continued operating efficiencies, resulting in lower costs year-over-year, despite higher top line growth. Direct sales and marketing expense in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, which was up 14% versus last year, largely due to an increase in commissions in our B2B business to support its ongoing strong revenue growth of 28% year-over-year. As we have stated previously, commissions paid to our B2B partners are in our direct sales and marketing line and are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business. However, because they are generally paid on a state basis to contractually agreed upon percentages, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate. In our B2C business, our marketing spend as a percentage of gross bookings was flat. Overhead expenses were $654 million, an increase of $64 million versus last year or 11%. As we have stated previously, this increase is a result of our investment and talent across our product and technology teams to support our strategic initiatives. With our strong revenue performance and expense discipline, with expenses overall growing slower than revenue, we delivered record EBITDA of $532 million, which was up 19% year-over-year, with an EBITDA margin of 18.5%, expanding over 130 basis points year-over-year. Both EBITDA growth and margin expansion accelerated sequentially from the third quarter. This strong earnings growth enabled us to generate another year of robust free cash flow at $1.8 billion. Free cash flow year-over-year would have been even higher, but was impacted by timing changes within working capital. Last year as the business emerged from the pandemic, we saw meaningful year-over-year increases in our deferred merchant bookings balance, which has since normalized this year. These strong free cash flow levels enabled us to complete our largest ever level of share repurchases at $2 billion, or over 19 million shares. Moving on to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity of 6.8 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $4.2 billion, and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion, which provides us with plenty of cash to operate the business. Our debt level remains at approximately $6.3 billion, with an average cost at only 3.7%. Our gross leverage ratio, at a further reduced 2.3 times, continues to make progress towards our target gross leverage ratio of 2 times, driven by our ongoing strong EBITDA growth. As we look ahead towards 2024, we anticipate that market growth rates will moderate in 2024, given the absence of COVID-driven tailwinds that were prominent last year. But despite this backdrop, given the operational changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years, we expect to have another strong year with top line year-over-year growth, relatively in line with what we saw in 2023. On the bottom line, we believe we have further room to optimize our cost structure, and therefore improve margins. We expect to continue to drive operating efficiencies and cost of sales across our customer support and other operations. And with overhead expenses, as we have said, we expect to drive savings this year as we deprecate systems and redeploy resources, now that the bulk of our replatforming is in the rearview mirror. These efficiencies and overhead will also translate over to reduced CapEx levels. Overall, we are taking a very close look at streamlining our cost structure to align with the next phase of our journey. And based on our initial estimates, these actions are expected to result in approximately $80 million to $100 million in one-time GAAP expenses on the year, heavily weighted towards the first quarter. We are still finalizing the details, but we expect to have more to share this quarter. As far as marketing, we are investing behind our global expansion efforts to reignite our international growth and drive further market share gains. This will naturally drive some shorter-term pressure on marketing efficiency for our B2C business. But despite this incremental investment, we expect to still drive overall B2C marketing leverage on the year as a percentage of gross bookings, as we continue to improve direct transactions, retention, and conversion with more scale. Putting this all together, we expect to deliver another record year of EBITDA with EBITDA margin expansion at levels relatively similar to what we saw in 2023. This EBITDA growth and some possible early repayment of debt should enable us to hit our target leverage ratio of approximately two times this year. We also expect this EBITDA growth, combined with the benefit we expect to see from the CapEx efficiencies I mentioned earlier, to drive strong free cash flow growth. And we aim to leverage the strong free cash flow to further maximize shareholder returns. While our stock prices increased in recent months, we continue to believe that it remains undervalued and does not reflect our expected long-term performance of the business. As such, we will utilize the strong cash-generating power of our business and our new $5 billion share repurchase authorization announced last quarter to continue buying back our stock opportunistically. As it pertains to our first quarter outlook, last year our first quarter was very strong, and we therefore are facing some tough comps in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, to start the year, we have seen continued pressure in air due to reduced pricing levels from increased capacity and the grounding of the Boeing fleet, as well as some pressure in our Vrbo brand, as Peter alluded to earlier. As a result, we expect our gross bookings growth in the first quarter to be in the low to mid-single digits, and our revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. In addition, we expect some EBITDA margin compression consistent with the levels we saw in Q1 last year. As we move throughout the year, we expect our growth rates will increase due to conversion gains from product improvements, the continued stacking of high ROI customers accelerated further by momentum building in our One Key Loyalty Program, and higher traction in our faster growing global markets. So in closing, I am really proud of what our team has been able to accomplish to the successful execution of our multi-year initiatives, which enabled us to deliver one of the strongest financial years on record here at Expedia Group. Yet it feels like we're just getting started. With most of the heavy lifting behind us, we are now better positioned than ever to go on the offense, and this combined with our strong financial position should enable us to continue to deliver long-term profitable growth and shareholder returns. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead. Naved Khan : Yes, thanks a lot. And Peter, we'll miss you on these calls after the Q1 call. But I have a few questions, one on Vrbo, with the migration complete. I think you talked about sort of, the app update kind of taking some time. And I'm a little surprised that it's still been seeing some weakness in January. Just give us some color on what exactly is the reason for that. And you talked about some sort of green shoots. So give us some commentary there. And then maybe on One Key, can you talk about maybe where maybe the learnings are? Are you satisfied with the retention and the convergence so far? And how much room do you see for improvement from here on? And also in terms of international rollout, I think previously you talked about first half for that. Is that still on the cards? Peter Kern : Yes. So three good questions. Lots of material there. Thanks, Naved. And you can call me anytime if you miss my voice. The first on Vrbo, I would say, if you think about what we were doing at the tail end of last year, we were pushing to 100% migration, the app, everything moved over. And I think as we told you, everybody, these steps come with expected conversion degradation because you can't get everything to par. It takes forever. You have to move everything and start working on the new product. So we did that. I'd say that degradation was broadly in line or slightly better than what we hoped, but it was still there. And when you're doing that, you obviously are not investing as heavily in terms of marketing because you're marketing people into a less converting product. So you kind of tend to back off on that spend because the spend becomes less efficient. As you now get to a place where the product is ramping back up very quickly and we've clawed back much of the conversion, which is I think the green shoots you're referring to. So we're actually gaining much faster than at least in my tenure I've ever seen us gain back in terms of one of these transitions. And the product is basically virtually back to the same levels of conversion. Now we can push back in and spend again. There is a little bit of a lag there because you've been underspending, if you will, for a bit waiting for the product to get to where it's converting as strongly. Now we are spending back up. So it will take a little time to get the engines fully operational, if you will, but it's more or less a sequence we expected to happen. It's just you're seeing it on our numbers now. As far as One Key goes, I think you said, am I satisfied with what we're seeing? I'd say I'm satisfied. It's still early days. I mean, we're seeing a lot of the indicators we want to see, as I alluded to, cross shopping is good. We're seeing one of the things we hope to achieve was getting Hotels.com customers who had fewer than 10 stamps, people who hadn't gotten to earn anything yet, to be more engaged with the product. And we're seeing their repeat rates improve and their business improve. We're starting to see Vrbo customers earn and now burn their one key rewards not only on Vrbo, but other places. But again, those cycles are a bit long. So it will take longer for the millions of people who have now earned One Key cash on Vrbo who didn't used to, to come back and spend it because they may not rent a house for six months or a year. But that is where we're laying in that opportunity with our customer base, and then we're crossing that opportunity across the brands, and we're seeing good signs across shopping and people starting to use more brands. So that's all consistent with what we hoped, but this isn't, it's not a switch you flip. When you talk about travel timing, many people only travel once or twice a year, so it takes a little time, and we're building that in. So all good so far, but looking forward to it being even much more impactful over time. And then international expansion. We're not detailing which countries we're doing exactly when for competitive reasons, but One Key will roll out, we will push back into a number of markets that were historically pretty strong for us, and have stayed reasonably strong, but we just think we have a lot of opportunity. And then we will have some tests into some markets that we haven't been as invested in historically, where we think there's opportunity with the new product, new marketing approaches, etcetera. So a lot of exciting opportunity on the international front. It's not all dependent on One Key. We think there's opportunity regardless, but in the markets where it's relevant, where we have multiple brands that have high brand awareness, we will be launching One Key there, and we think it will only enhance that. Naved Khan : Great, thank you, Peter. Peter Kern : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Kevin, please go ahead. Kevin Kopelman : Thank you very much. Yes, first of all, Peter, congrats on your tenure. We'll definitely miss you on working with you on the calls. I did want to ask a question on that. Could you let us into your thought process a little bit, or any color on your decision to step away in the timing? Peter Kern : Yes, sure. I mean, I think I tried to capture it in my comments, but when this started, the idea was for me to come in for a period of time and sort of ride the ship, put us where we wanted to be, and then build the team and make sure we had the people to take it forward for the next generation, as it were. And the transformation turned into a bigger, I bit off more than I thought I was going to, and it was a bigger job than I thought it was, and I had my doubts a year ago, but we've made so much progress, and as I stared at, and the board and I stared at, should I go further, etcetera? I love this company, I love the category, I love my team. We've built an amazing group here, but I built it so that they could take it forward, and there's never a right time, but hopefully this is a good time to transition. We're fortunate to have Ariane, we're fortunate to have all the people around her that we've brought in or have been here many years, and I just think the company's ready, and I'll be here till May, I'll be busting my butt till then. I don't know how to do it a different way, but, and look, we still, transformations are never done, the work is never done, there isn't like an end date, and it's like, good, we did number 100 on our list of 100 things to do, but we've just made so much progress that I think the company's in a good place for it, and it felt like the right time for everybody. Kevin Kopelman : Understood, and thanks for that, and if I could just ask a quick follow-up on Naved's question on Vrbo. Could you walk us through what that looks like as you pass through Q2? Is it fair to think about that as an easier comp once you anniversary the initial platform upgrade, and what the timeframe could be to get that back to flat and then growth? Peter Kern : Yes, I think basically you can assume we anticipate growing out of this consistently across the year. Fourth quarter will be higher than third quarter, higher than second quarter, higher than first quarter. So we expect to continue growing. I think as I alluded to, conversion is now basically back to where it was before we did all this, but we didn't do it to get to even. We did it to get to materially better, and now Vrbo can benefit, and the reason it's going as quickly as it is we have lots of winning tests, if you will, that we used on the broader OTA platform that are also winners for Vrbo. So we're able to take a lot of our winning experiments, move them over to Vrbo, and get that humming again, but we continue to go further, and as I alluded to, our ability to multiply our test and learn capacity in a material way, both in speed and in breadth, is really changing how we do things. So now when we have tests many of our tests we launch across all our brands across all our platforms all devices And we just couldn't do that before so the speed of improvement we expect to continue to accelerate that will enhance all the brands, but Vrbo is the one that has a hole to dig out of, that were the most recent hole to dig out of and so we expect that to continue to grow we expect the investment back into the brand to continue to have impact. We expect the cross shopping effect of having the H com and Expedia customers being able to use their One Key cash number about to have an effect. So all of that we expect to continue to build throughout the year, but we shot our own foot off on purpose Late last year we pulled back on spend because we thought that was the rational thing to do given the conversion situation and now we're leaning back in and it's really as simple as that except we expect to improve faster in product and I still think we have the best-in-class marketing full stop in our category And when we go back on offense it will take hold and both of those things will work together. Kevin Kopelman : Great, thanks Peter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Golden Sachs. Eric, please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question I'd love to ask more of a big picture one now with One Key in the market and elements of the Replatforming behind you, how should we think about some of the things you talked about in the prepared remarks about unified product offerings and being more innovative in the way you go to market and retain customers and drive direct traffic And how we should be thinking about some of the product roadmap that you're most excited about and the mixture of both growth that could come from those initiatives versus investments that still need to be made. Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes, I mean I'd say broadly working backwards I don't think their investments of time calories to be made. But in terms of investments of money and capital, I think we're on the other side of that hill and we expect to be able to do things more efficiently going forward. But if you talk about One Key and the product itself as I say like, One Key is a great way to create stickiness within our environment, but you might have heard me mention that we've we finally migrated all our CRM virtually 100% of our CRM and the brands to our new unified messaging platform that platform allows us to do things much faster to communicate with customers. So whether we have One Key benefits whether we have new, new offerings in One Key whether there are One Key bonuses, all the things we can use to merchandise and keep people and use One Key to be the glue that keeps members sticky. And remember, member members get more than just One Key They get member discounts in the product and in many of the products were expanding that every day We now have deeper discounts for silver and gold. And so there's just a lot of things to keep them in, but it's important to be able obviously to communicate with them in the most modern ways and that's what our new single messaging platform allows us to do. And then you add on to that, this kind of goes to the broader point as we've woven, we've improved the products, we've added new features, but I say you said what am I most excited about? It's really machine learning and AI plumbed into essentially the entire product experience, because what that gets you is effectively a personalized experience for every customer and that's from the front end basic shopping flows as I mentioned to post-booking to CRM and everything else and the more we can connect and now that we have a single identity for our customers, and now that we can use that data to give them the best experience we're seeing some of our best wins now just as algorithms improve and learn and new versions come out whether it's to optimize pictures or content or what you see in what order what filters are applied like those kinds of things that we can now do at scale That is what I'm most excited about. I mean, we have lots of cool features. we have all kinds of things going on to improve the air shopping experience the package shopping experience. You name it, but really at its core. I think having plumbed in the AI and ML we can now do so much more, so much more quickly and it will feel to the consumer like a much more customized experience that's relevant to them. And I think that's inherently sticky in a way that frankly travel products have not historically been in our space. So that's what I'm most excited about. Eric Sheridan : Thank you, Peter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Lee please go ahead. Lee Horowitz : Great. Thanks for the question. First Peter, congrats on your tenure. Thanks again It's been a crazy couple years and congratulations on all that you've accomplished over that time period. Maybe just sticking with Vrbo as we think about it in 2024. I guess one, how do you feel about the overall health of the alternative accommodations industry? Do you think there may be some continued pricing headwinds in say core vacation rental destinations as travel patterns continue to normalize and perhaps some macro weakness plays through? And then secondly, can you provide any thoughts on how the competitive set for Vrbo has evolved over the past couple of years, maybe as you've taken your foot off the gas and how maybe this shifting competitive landscape, if it is happening, is informing your strategies to get this business back to humming again? Thanks. Peter Kern : Yes, sure, Lee, and thanks for your thoughts. It has been a couple of crazy years. I would say a few things. Sort of working backwards, I think, obviously we've seen VR continue to be healthy even post pandemic as habits have shifted. However, there's like VR within VR. So Urban has done better. We are not heavily weighted to Urban. Some of our competitors are. I think that's what you mean by the evolving landscape. Obviously Airbnb has always been there. Booking has been doing more with that product. Again, largely, as best we can tell, focused and benefiting from the Urban side of VR or alternative accommodations. We're still squarely situated in our core markets. We haven't made a big decision to pivot to Urban, but one of the things that's enabled by all the migrations we're doing that will come this year, we have a bunch of multi-unit VR inventory on our OTA brands that is not on Vrbo. And we still have some Vrbo content that is not on our OTA brand. So there's still opportunity to do more in sharing the inventory we already possess. We've had no shortage of finding inventory, and I think housing market issues and other things probably make that macro easier now. It's really just changing habits. Now, our hedge against renting a mountain house or a beach house is, of course, renting a hotel or resort room as the alternative, and we've participated very well in that, and we feel good about our position there. But I think we feel very good about Vrbo. We needed to get the product to a new place. We are now firmly on that journey. I don't think we gave space to anybody. I think we have a good brand. We have an improving product that I have no doubt will be best-in-class. And we just have to get back on offense. And again, this is one of those places where you had to take a pause, go slow to go fast. And the slow part always hurts a little, but if you don't do it, you can never go fast. So we're in a good spot now, and I think we just have to accelerate out of it. And I don't worry about the supply situation, and I don't really think we're losing ground to other competitors who have some super sticky product. And over time, we should have the stickiest product because our product comes with loyalty, and our loyalty is usable across any travel product. So I think that's a winning combination. We just got to keep pounding it home now, and now that we have the product to get behind, we will do that. Lee Horowitz : Helpful, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Post from Bank of America. Anthony, please go ahead. Anthony Post : Great, thank you. I guess a couple for Julie. You gave us the 11% growth for lodging and 18% for hotels. So we can kind of solve for Vrbo, but can you give us any range of what percent your alternative accommodation nights are or bookings just so we can not have too big of a range there? And then second, last year you were very clear, double digit top and bottom line. I think you said similar growth on the top line and then margin improvement. I mean, is that kind of saying double digit for both, or do you want to clarify kind of the growth rates at all? Thank you. Julie Whalen : Sure. On the first one, we haven't, and I think recently we haven't given out what percent is our Vrbo piece of the business, but I think once we bought the company, there was some, obviously numbers that were provided at that time. You can do some extrapolation on the growth rate and get pretty close probably. So I don't think there's anything else that we would give out today from a disclosure perspective on that front. On the guidance perspective, we basically have said, as you alluded to, that we are planning to grow relatively in line with our growth rates from this year, which is about, call it 9.5%, 10% in GBV [ph] and 10% on revenue. And then we said with margin expansion relatively in line, which we're calling about 75 basis points for expansion this year. So that's how I would take it. I mean, relatively in line to us, plus or minus 100 or so basis points. But that's how I'd think about it, that it's both for GBV and revenue. Anthony Post : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Jed, please go ahead. Jed Kelly : Yes. Hey, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just going on to your overall marketing strategy, just by watching TV, I still see you're still marketing to a lot of the brands, Hotels.com, Expedia. And do you start to pivot those brands more into One Key? Can you talk about that? And then can you just talk about your comments on streamlining expenses sort of what's the strategy behind that move? Thank you. Peter Kern : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jed. So on the marketing front, yes. In the U.S., you will see all the brands advertised used to be far more brands. We're down to those core three and we believe in those three. I think, we're still trying to find the balance between, can they be advertised as one or do they need to be advertised as three? And what is the best way to penetrate? So I would think of that as sort of a we're on our own learning journey about what we can do, how we can help people see them as a family of products that work together. And we continue to try to optimize, be it on television, which is what you're seeing or in programmatic, or frankly, even in meta search and so forth. So we're constantly working to see what the optimum way to drive those are. But I will say in the rest of the world, we have made very conscious decisions of where we will maintain one brand or if we think it's worth it, two or three brands and what we will do there. And we will lean heavily into a high bar for there to be more than one. There has to be real brand affinity and other things that are driving that continuation of the second brand. So especially now that conceivably any of our brands could have all or any lines of business and that's not that hard for us to do. So the opportunity to take, for example, a market that is a predominant Hotel.com market and potentially add car and air and other packages and other things is within our gift now. And so we can make quite different decisions about do we need to be in with Expedia just to have air or something else? So that's really a big opportunity for us and allows us to simplify how we think about those decisions and in some ways not replicate some of the complexity we've made for ourselves over the years. So that's a work in progress. But, all those things are effective and we're working to optimize all the time on the best way to communicate that. Maybe Julie can say something about the\u2026 Julie Whalen : Yes. So on the streamlining of expenses, I think we've been saying all last year that, obviously during the transformation phase, we've ramped up in expenses. We've had duplicate systems, legacy systems while we're still building out the new system and all the costs that are associated with that across the board from cloud and licensing and maintenance and things like that. And so we have said as we come out of this transformation phase that we think there's opportunity to deprecate systems and redeploy resources and find cost savings throughout the P&L. So this is our first sort of stab, if you will, at that. And so you'll see things across the board coming out as we move throughout the year in cost of sales, in overhead. And to the extent that obviously crosses over into capital expenditures, you'll see some of the pressure coming off at least the growth rates there. And if not, it also in absolute dollars. But that's simply what that represents. We're obviously not going to go into a lot of details today, but we did purposely say that we will give you more information later this quarter. And as we move throughout the year on that, as we give you more of the details associated with it. Peter Kern : And I would just add. That's always been the plot that we wanted. This wasn't just to build cool new things. This was also to build them the right way and be efficient in how we did it. And that's the opportunity that the transformation has also provided for us. And we're excited to be on that side of it, too, not just from an experience standpoint, but from an efficiency standpoint. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thanks. I'm sure these questions have been covered, but if I could ask again, please. Of these two initiatives, the replatforming of the brands, particularly the Vrbo brand, and then the One Key strategy, I assume these are more like snowball events. Have you already seen an impact on the business or on demand cross-selling retention acquisition from these so far? Or would you, if not, could you let us have expectations of when we would? Thank you very much. Peter Kern : Yes, Mark, I'll give you a quick answer. I think we sort of addressed some of it already. But basically, the Vrbo transition to the unified stack is more of just a, an execution thing. I think what it gives us is the opportunity now to accelerate Vrbo in terms of feature and test and learn and grow faster, as I mentioned to the rest of the group. We dug a hole, we knew we would. When we moved it to the new stack, the conversion would go down. We have been digging out of that hole. We're about back to par. But we didn't do it to get to par. We did it to accelerate far past that. And now we have the opportunity in Vrbo riding on the same rail as the other brands, gets the benefit of all the testing, shared testing opportunities, winners that we found other places and so forth. So we're excited about the progression of that product, but it had to go through the bad to get to the good. As far as One Key goes, I also mentioned, we feel very good about the early indicators. Yes, there is more cross shopping. Yes, we're seeing more repeat from certain pools of customers that we thought would benefit from this, like hotels.com customers who had less than 10 stamps in our old system and people, if you will, who hadn't earned any benefit. Now they have benefit and they're coming back more. And that's what we want to see. But as I also mentioned, while millions of people have earned One Key cash on Vrbo, a small percentage of them have re-spent it. And that just has to do with the cycles of the booking windows for Vrbo and that people rarely book more than once or twice a year. So we've got to get those, we expect to see those people back in. That's why I've said we've built up this value and now that value needs to be realized as they come back direct later, as they use that One Key cash across other brands with more cross shopping, like that's the dream. And of course getting Expedia and hotels.com members to use their One Key cash on Vrbo, which we've also seen. But again, those cycles aren't every month. People do that once, twice a year. So we're seeing good early signals, but it's all building. And that's why I'm excited. Like it's going to be a slow build, but it's going to be a great sticky thing for us over time. And again, we'll keep more and more people as we get more of the right people in, as we keep more of them, and as they get to use all of our products. And again, we capture more wallet share from them. That's what we're pushing for. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Peter. Peter Kern : Thanks. And thank you everybody. I think that was the last question, operator. Is that right? Operator : That's correct. Peter Kern : Okay, thank you everybody. Appreciate your questions and we'll see you in May. Take care. Operator : That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to SVP, Corporate Development, Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to be joined on today's call by our CEO, Peter Kern; our CFO, Julie Whalen; and our incoming CEO, Ariane Gorin.  As a reminder, our commentary today will include references to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. And unless otherwise stated, any reference to expenses exclude stock-based compensation. We will also be making forward-looking statements during the call, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.  Actual results could materially differ due to factors discussed during this call, and in our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. Our earnings release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern : Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. As you all know by now, this will be my last earnings call. I'm excited to be handing the reins over to Ariane, and we have reserved time for her to share some thoughts after Julie, so you can get a sense of her ambition for the company going forward.  Ariane and I have been working closely these last few months to make sure she can take over without a hitch, and I just want to say I'm truly excited to see how she and our team bring this company forward and accelerate on top of everything we have built over these last several years.  As for the quarter, we saw a healthy but more normalized market environment for travel globally. North America remains the slowest growing geography relative to major international markets, but the gap is closing now that we are largely past the pandemic-driven recovery. Adjusting for geo and product mix, prices held up in general for lodging, but were under continued pressure in the air and car business.  Against this backdrop, our results for the first quarter of '24 met our guidance with a revenue and EBITDA beat but less robust gross bookings. Julie will get into the details, but revenue and EBITDA performance benefited from our mix of business, a strong performance in our advertising business, and our decision to invest more in pricing actions as opposed to direct marketing.  As for gross bookings, our B2B business continued its strong performance, and our B2C business, excluding Vrbo, was in line with our expectations. Unfortunately, that only partly made up for a slower-than-expected ramp-up for Vrbo post its technical migration. As we discussed last quarter, we had pulled back on Vrbo marketing in the second half of last year while we went through our migration. And while we have been ramping that spend and the product has been improving, we have seen a slower-than-expected recovery.  Based on this and the overall trends in our B2C business so far in Q2, we expect growth to be lower than what we had initially anticipated for '24. We are, therefore, lowering our full year guidance to a range of mid- to high single-digit top line growth, with margins relatively in line with last year. We still expect to see broad improvement across '24 in our B2C business, with the best early indicator being the conversion gains we have seen driven by higher test velocity and future rollouts. Behind that, we will continue to invest in Vrbo and our international growth markets to reignite those flywheels to set us up for continued growth in the years to come.  All in all, I'm pleased to say that while momentum is not yet back consistently in all the business lines, we are improving every day, wanting to optimize all of our new capabilities, and I have tremendous faith in our team's ability to extract the full potential of what we have built.  With that, I will just close by expressing my profound appreciation to all our teams at Expedia for their dedication throughout our multiyear, often painful, transformation journey. When the returns from this work are fully realized, we will owe this determined bunch of people a great debt of gratitude. I also want to thank all of you, our existing shareholders, the analysts covering us, and the broader investor community who have been with us along this sometimes bumpy journey. There's a reason most companies don't undertake transformation on this scale, and it takes patience and a commitment to understanding to come along for this journey. I'm very appreciative of all the constructive engagement over the years, and it has been a pleasure working with all of you. So with that, over to Julie. Julie Whalen : Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the key metrics for the first quarter. Total gross bookings of $30.2 billion were up 3% versus last year. Growth was driven primarily by total lodging gross bookings, which grew 4%, led by our hotel business growing 12%. This strong hotel growth was partially offset by the ongoing softness in our Vrbo business that, while improving, is taking longer than expected to fully recover.  Revenue of $2.9 billion grew 8% versus last year, led by B2B, Brand Expedia and our advertising businesses. The revenue strength was driven by higher revenue margins, which increased over 50 basis points from a product and geo mix during the quarter, increased advertising revenue, which contributes to revenue but not gross bookings, and the pull-in of stays in Q1 driven by the Easter shift.  Cost of sales was $356 million for the quarter and $55 million or 13% lower versus last year, which, combined with our strong revenue growth, drove approximately 310 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue year-over-year. We are pleased to see our ongoing initiatives delivering transactional efficiencies.  Direct sales and marketing expense in the first quarter was $1.7 billion, which was up 11% versus last year. Sales and marketing deleveraged this quarter as a percentage of gross bookings primarily due to the commissions to our partners as a result of our strong growth in our B2B business with growth of 25%. As we have stated previously, commissions paid to our B2B partners are in our direct sales and marketing line and are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business. However, because they are generally paid on a [ stayed ] basis to contractually agreed upon percentages, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate.  In our B2C business, we also saw some marketing deleverage this quarter as we reinvested back into our Vrbo business to drive improving growth and our increased investments to drive our global market expansion, one of our key strategic growth initiatives this year. Overhead expenses were $611 million, an increase of $23 million versus last year or 4%, leveraging 95 basis points.  We were able to drive our costs below our revenue growth, particularly in our product and tech operations, and now that we are done with the major boulders of platform migration, we remain committed to driving further efficiencies across our P&L. To that end, in February, we announced cost actions that will impact approximately 1,500 employees through this year. We expect that these actions will unlock substantial savings on an annualized basis across capitalized labor, cost of sales and overhead costs.  And as a result of all of these factors, we delivered strong first quarter EBITDA of $255 million, which was up 38% year-over-year, with an EBITDA margin of 8.8%, expanding over 190 basis points year-over-year. This was higher than expected given the higher revenue we delivered and the leverage to the P&L that provides, along with lower cost of sales, both of which more than offset our marketing investments to drive future growth.  It is also important to note that EBITDA also benefited from a decision we made to invest more in pricing actions as opposed to additional direct marketing. These pricing actions are reflected in the P&L when the stay occurs. As a result, these investments will instead impact future quarters as contra revenue when the stays come in.  Starting this quarter, in addition to EBITDA, we are providing additional disclosure around our EBIT performance, which includes the impact of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. In the first quarter, EBIT was negative $59 million with a margin of negative 2.1%, an improvement of $51 million or 205 basis points versus last year. The additional approximately 15 basis points of expansion as compared to EBITDA is driven by leverage from stock-based compensation. Our first quarter EBITDA growth enabled us to generate another quarter of robust free cash flow at $2.7 billion. The year-over-year decline in free cash flow is associated with timing changes within working capital, which includes lower deferred merchant bookings, primarily driven by the softness in Vrbo bookings this quarter.  Moving on to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $8.2 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $5.7 billion and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion. Our debt level remains at approximately $6.3 billion with an average cost at only 3.7%. Our gross leverage ratio at a further reduced 2.3x continues to make progress towards our target gross leverage ratio of 2x, driven by our ongoing strong EBITDA growth.  Our strong cash position enabled us to continue repurchasing shares with over $780 million or approximately 5.7 million shares repurchased year-to-date, and we continue to believe that our stock remains undervalued and does not reflect our expected long-term performance of the business. As such, we will utilize the strong cash-generating power of our business and our remaining $4.1 billion share repurchase authorization to continue to buy back our stock opportunistically.  As far as our financial outlook, given the lower-than-expected growth in gross bookings in the first quarter and the trends we are seeing so far in the second quarter in our B2C business, in particular in Vrbo, we are lowering our full year guidance to reflect the range of possible outcomes on the top line while we continue to invest in marketing to drive growth for Vrbo and international markets. As such, we believe our top line growth will now be in the range of mid- to high single-digit growth with EBITDA and EBIT margins relatively in line with last year. In the shorter term, we expect our second quarter to deliver top line growth in the mid-single digits, which reflects a sequential acceleration in gross bookings from the first quarter as we expect Vrbo to continue to improve from our marketing investments. We expect revenue growth to be lower than the first quarter growth rate given the lower gross bookings in the first quarter, the pull forward of Easter stays into the first quarter, and the contra revenue arising from pricing actions.  And with this revenue growth, along with our continued investments in marketing to drive growth, we expect some pressure in our second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margins versus last year. However, when combined with our first quarter outperformance, we expect EBITDA and EBIT margins to be relatively in line with last year to slightly above in the first half.  In closing, despite the lower guidance, we remain committed to the long-term opportunity that our transformation has given us to deliver profitable growth and shareholder returns. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ariane. Ariane Gorin : Thanks, Julie, and thank you, Peter, for your leadership over the last 4 years and for all I've learned working closely with you. I joined our company 11 years ago and most recently led Expedia for Business. This includes our B2B and advertising businesses, both of which have consistently delivered double-digit growth. I also led our global supply teams that source inventory for our whole company, so I know our industry very well. And having lived in Europe for the last 23 years, I've seen firsthand opportunity for us in international markets.  My immediate priority as CEO is to work with our teams to accelerate our growth and to sharpen the longer-term strategy for our consumer business. Since our leadership announcement in February, I've spent time getting to know our consumer business in more detail. It's undergone extreme transformation over the last few years, from technical migrations and changes in our loyalty program to changes in how our teams operate the business. So we've dealt with a lot of turbulence. While we built new capabilities like our common front end, we have less development capacity to build new features, and this, in turn, impacted the competitiveness of some of our brands and products. Expedia, which was our least disrupted brand, benefited a lot from our investments and has grown very well, while Hotels.com and Vrbo, which were the most impacted by our migrations, aren't where we'd like them to be.  To get the acceleration we want from our consumer business, we need to focus on the basics : driving traffic, increasing conversion and expanding our margins through higher attach, take rates and more efficient marketing. Ultimately, this is going to come down to having great products and great brand value propositions.  Our platform now allows us to innovate at scale, and we're running more tests and seeing the benefits of AI across all of our brands, which is great. But we're still learning to use all of this most effectively. For example, a recommendation algorithm gets smarter faster because of our scale, but it has to be trained on the differences between a traveler shopping on Vrbo compared to one on Expedia. And tests that work on one brand may behave differently on another. While we still have some work to fully complete our tech platform, moving forward, we'll dedicate more of our development capacity to building great traveler experiences and making up for lost time.  Looking ahead, while it's going to take somewhat longer than we'd anticipated to see the benefits come through in our numbers, the investments we've made rebuilding our consumer business will pay off. Our new tech platform gives us a solid foundation to grow our business, and we also have other real strengths to build on. We're leaders in the B2B segment and just posted another fantastic quarter, and there's still a big opportunity to win share.  Our advertising business is big, differentiated and growing, and I equally see lots of opportunity ahead here. We have strong relationships with our supply partners and great supply for our travelers. And of course, our consumer business is the market leader in the U.S., with well-recognized and loved brands, and we're starting to get traction as we move back into international markets. As you know, we're also focused on driving efficiencies, and we'll continue to look carefully at every dollar we invest.  So in closing, we have great consumer brands, a leading B2B business, a powerful platform, and what I think is the best team in travel. We have lots of work to do to realize our potential, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity ahead. And with that, let me open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Wishing you the best going forward, Peter, and congrats on the new role, Ariane. Peter, maybe can we come back to Vrbo for a minute and just how do you think about that asset compared to where the competitive landscape is across travel and shared accommodation specifically? And when you think about leaning into investments to potentially accelerate Vrbo and improve its positioning, what kind of signals are you guys as a team looking for to know it's the moment to sort of lean in behind some of those investments to get it back to more normalized growth? Peter Kern : Sure. Thanks, Eric. And for everyone's benefit, I've asked Ariane to chip in where she'd like along with these questions, in addition to whatever you have specifically for her.  But specifically to Vrbo, the way we see it is we are very strong in our core business of Vrbo, which does not compete with shared accommodations, it does not compete directly with some of our competitors in some geographies and some cities, and we are really focused on just being excellent in our space, which is the whole home space in certain markets where we have the right to win and a strong brand and strong supply, et cetera. So that is our core focus for now. We could always -- Ariane may expand that remit at some point, but that's where we're focused now. As far as what we're seeing, as we talked about before, our spend down in the back half of last year, the migration we've been through obviously had a lingering impact on the product, and first quarter is an important quarter for Vrbo, so it's unfortunate that it wasn't as strong as we wanted there. But we are seeing real improvement in the products and we're leaning into investment to sort of spin up the flywheel to just get it going again.  So it's not so much that we see any flaws in it. It's just got to be re-spent into. And because VR is not as performance marketing-driven, we don't have that ability to just go into Meta and other places and ramp everything up. We've got to spend on brand and build it, and that's taking some time to lean back into. But we feel very good about the progress. We're hopeful that it continues, obviously. And we feel really good about the product improvement.  So we will continue to invest behind that, but what we're really looking for is we know the spend is working, we know we're driving improvement, and it's just a question of how far, how fast and what's the timing and the seasonality differences, et cetera. But that's what we're spending into this year to get it back on a growth trajectory. Ariane Gorin : And I would just add, again, yes, we have deep belief and conviction in Vrbo and also our other brands of Expedia and Hotels.com. We do sell some alternative accommodations on those brands, so we also have an opportunity to go after that market with those brands as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Lee Horowitz : Great. I guess previously, your guidance for the full year seemingly expected share gains across your largest business lines. Is there any change to that view, given sort of the more cautious outlook for the full year? Or is this really all Vrbo-centric? And then relatedly, when you think about the acceleration you're seeing in your non-Vrbo B2C business, what's ultimately going on there? Is it the market? Is it just the stacking of the things that you're doing? And how do you get comfortable that, that acceleration can sustain through the balance of the year? Peter Kern : Yes. So let me take a crack. Thank you, Lee, and then Ariane and Julie can jump in. But I would say that what we see in Vrbo and -- sorry -- so there were 2 questions, the non-Vrbo piece and the Vrbo piece. On the non-Vrbo piece, we've been making improvements in the product consistently. HCOM went through a migration a while ago, but still, we are making improvements and getting it back to -- on the best footing we can.  So we are seeing continuous improvement in the product. We are seeing big wins across the platform, whether it's coming from machine learning or other areas that are -- that we can deploy much faster across the entire slate of apps and products. So we're getting wins. We're getting product wins. We're getting conversion wins.  So that's what gives us confidence. And all of that ultimately leads to better conversion, more efficient marketing and everything else. So we would like everything to go faster, but we are feeling good that we are making progress on the non-Vrbo business.  On the first question -- sorry, Lee, the first part about Vrbo again? Can you repeat it? Oh, share gains. I'm sorry. I got it. I came back to it. On the share gain front, we're actually, other than Vrbo, seeing good share gains in our core hotel business across North America and all our major focus markets, or virtually all our major focus markets.  So in the hotel business, we're seeing really good product gains, and we feel quite good about that. Vrbo is its own thing. So when you look at lodging all up, Vrbo has obviously given up share, and both Airbnb and Booking are both in the VR space, particularly in those city-centric other kinds of accommodations, some much of which we don't compete in. But if you just look at hotel lodging, we're making really strong gains there. And in all our other product lines, again, we continue to improve on product, we continue to believe those products will pay off, and we feel good about where they're going. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Clarke from Bernstein Societe Generale Group. Richard Clarke : Just you mentioned you're deciding now to pivot towards more price investment. Just wondering, is that backing up One Key? Is that going into the loyalty? And maybe overall, what's just leading to that decision to do that rather than more marketing? Peter Kern : I'll take a piece and Ariane can jump in. I would just say, we've said it before, but we look at all our marketing, all our things to drive consumer behavior as one big bucket of capital. So that's direct sales and marketing, it's the pricing work we do, merchandising work, and it's our loyalty spend.  So what we saw was an opportunity, what we've been seeing is an opportunity to drive more into the pricing vein, where there have been good returns. We've seen good opportunity there. And this is basically just a way to modify prices, taking value out of our margins to drive more velocity, acquire more customers and do it more efficiently. So it's really just a rebalancing, a little bit, towards pricing, and that's what we've done. Ariane Gorin : And I would just add, as Peter said, we think about those buckets of pricing, of loyalty and of marketing sort of as all buckets that we can use to invest where we see opportunities. And going forward, we'll continue to do that. So which of those 3 will drive the most growth, whether it's in international, regardless of what brand it is, I think the teams have a very dialed-in view of where they can invest in order to get the best return. Richard Clarke : Maybe just a follow-up on whether this is going into One Key program disproportionately, maybe matching one of your peers which has a more, I guess, price-oriented loyalty program rather than points loyalty program. Ariane Gorin : Well, what I would say is part of our One Key program does include tiered member discounts. So if you're a silver member or a gold member, you'll get better discounts. And those are actually supplier-funded discounts. Those are when our hotels, for example, want to get access to the more valuable members who travel more, who spend more. So I don't know if that's what you're referring to, but that program is a supplier-funded program, and it's one of the benefits of One Key. Peter Kern : Yes. I think, Richard, just to think about it as clearly as we can give it to you, there's 3 opportunities. There's what Ariane just described, which is we've been able to get our customers more benefit, more tiered benefits, all of that provided by our suppliers akin to some of what you've seen from some of our competition. We also have discounting we do specifically that I mentioned to win on price and acquire customers efficiently.  And then in One Key itself, we have the opportunity now, which is awesome, to allow us to give benefit to One Key customers to create activity, create shopping, to give them incentives and other things. So there is a bit of that, that goes through that as well. But the big buckets are really the pricing and the core loyalty that are still strong, and those are the largest buckets of spend. Julie Whalen : And just to put a pin on it, obviously, we made the decision based on what is the best return. I mean at the end of the day, that's what we do. We look at everything and what are we going to get the best return for our spend, and at this moment, we saw that the pricing actions were going better than any other options. And so obviously, it creates some noise in the P&L that you're seeing, but because it doesn't get impacted to the P&L until you actually have stay, so it's a little bit of a timing situation, but at the end of the day, that's what we're focused on, is driving the best return. Operator : Our next question comes from Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor Young : Great. Ariane, I think you commented that Hotels.com isn't where you'd like it to be. Can you expand on that a little bit and what you hope to achieve with that brand? And then bigger picture, what are the areas or opportunities you get most excited about beyond the next few years? Is it something like experiences in a more holistic interconnected trip? Is it AI driving a better consumer experience? Or something else altogether? Ariane Gorin : Okay. Trevor, thank you for the question. Look, let me just start by reminding you that we run our consumer business as a whole portfolio. And so we invest behind where we see the best return. And so in some cases, that may mean some brands versus others. And Hotels.com was the most impacted by our migrations. And as I said, it's not where we want it to be. It's not growing.  And again, it was impacted by a number of things. So the first was the product migration, which, when we went through it, obviously had an impact on its performance. The second was we made a big change in the loyalty program. We're very excited about what One Key can and will deliver, but it's true that for Hotels.com, it is a bigger change in the loyalty program with less earn.  Also Hotels.com was the most international of our brands, so over the last few years as we've leaned less into international, Hotels.com has been impacted. And then as I said, when you have the change in the product, we were getting better returns, for example, on Expedia, so leaning in there.  The good news is that, one, we're seeing really great conversion gains on the lodging path, which, of course, benefits Hotels.com. Two, as we go back into international, because Hotels.com is our lead brand in a number of those countries, we're going to see good growth there. So I think the ambition is to get Hotels.com obviously benefiting from the platform and international growth.  And just in terms of what I get excited about, look, there are a lot of things. I think probably AI and opportunity with AI, and especially now with our platform, given that we have one platform across all of our brands so we can move faster in the way that we're learning, I think, is going to have a bigger opportunity than ever to deliver personalized experiences for travelers.  So of course, I can tell you I'm excited about advertising, I'm excited about B2B. There are a lot of parts of our business. But I think fundamentally, it's how is technology going to allow us to deliver traveler experiences that are truly personalized. And when we do that and as we're doing that, I think that will really differentiate us. Operator : Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : Just back to One Key for a second. Can you just level-set with how that's performing today? I realize it's still really early, but the -- with the slower than expected results in Vrbo and in Hotels.com, is there any implications on the potential slower ramp on international as you look to do that this year, maybe into next year as well? Ariane Gorin : So I'm happy to -- look, on One Key, as you know, we launched it last summer, and the goal was to get more members, have them repeat more and see them shopping across our brands. In terms of member growth on our loyalty programs, new membership is up 40% year-on-year, and we're really pleased with that. And we're seeing good repeat rates.  And when it comes to cross-shopping, what we've actually seen is that 25% of people who have redeemed their One Key cash on Vrbo, who had earned that cash on either Hotels.com or Expedia, are completely new to Vrbo. So I think that really sort of reassures us in this idea of being able to capture more trips from travelers because of the One Key program. And we will be -- we are looking to roll it out internationally later this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved Khan : So 2 questions. Maybe just on Vrbo. Can you maybe talk a little bit about if the issues you are kind of trying to solve for more of a top line -- sorry, top of the funnel traffic? Or is it conversion? What exactly are you kind of trying to refine? And what gives you the confidence that the rebound can ultimately come through on Vrbo? And the second question I had is around international market. So I think you talked about kind of going into some new markets this year, and you were spending ad dollars in those markets. Wondering when we can start to see sort of the P&L contribution from those new markets. Peter Kern : Sure. Let me take that. So first of all, it's -- for Vrbo, it's largely a traffic issue. So as I mentioned, we spent down last year while the product was going through migration. That has 2 effects, which is, while it's migrating, it's not converting as well, and we're not spending as much to build awareness through that time.  As we're now rebuilding awareness, we're seeing benefit. The product itself is actually converting very well and improving very quickly because it is getting the benefits, as Ariane mentioned, of the single stack, right? All the -- many of those things that have won on our other products,are winners for Vrbo, and so we're getting more benefit more quickly.  So conversion continues to improve and is in good shape. We've got to rebuild back the traffic. And as Ariane said, One Key is helping with that. But One Key for itself in Vrbo, Vrbo customers don't travel 10 times a year typically. They travel once, if once, a year, sometimes once every 18 months or 2 years.  So the benefits of the One Key program, which we think is a key differentiator for Vrbo, take even longer to accumulate and create that flywheel over time. So we're building into those things. We're focused on traffic and building just general awareness back and general traffic back, and we're making solid strides. It's just not as fast as we had expected.  On the international side, we've seen quite good returns in all the places we've pushed into. We've tried a number of different ways in, now that we have the product improved, leaning more into performance marketing in some places, leaning more into brand in other places. But we're seeing broadly good response. We think it's contributing. It's just that North America is so large that it's hard to see in the numbers.  But that's why, as Ariane said, we started building into it this year. We're pushing back into international, and it's meant to drive long-term growth for many years to come. And as these markets succeed, we will continue to invest in more markets where we think we have the right to win, and win back share. Julie Whalen : We have seen some short-term wins. And Peter is right, it's going to take a while to really see it in the P&L from your perspective because there's an investment time period, you have to build it up to get the return. But in international markets, in small ones like Brazil and Scandinavia, where we launched new campaigns, we did see double-digit growth on our brands there. So that's already reflected in our numbers, but they're not all in the total, we are seeing the benefits flow through. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from TD Securities. Jacob Seed : This is Jacob on for Kevin. For Ariane, on the B2B side, can you comment on concentration within B2B, how large your top few customers and how many customers do you have? And also I wanted to know if there's [indiscernible] impact for regulatory changes from Google, any positive benefits there? Ariane Gorin : Okay. I think -- it was a little bit hard to hear, but I think the first question was about the B2B business and customer concentration. So let me take that one first. Look, we don't disclose information, obviously, about sort of the concentration of our customers, but what I will say is the B2B business is quite a mix of some very large partners, think of banks, think of some airlines, and also a very long tail of travel agencies, for example. So I would say it's a well-balanced business.  One of the things that's really nice about the B2B business is it's not only balanced in terms of customers, but it's very balanced geographically and in terms of what types of partners we work with. I think this -- what was -- oh, the second part was about changes to... Peter Kern : Sorry, say that again? Jacob Seed : Yes. Any benefits you're seeing from the regulatory changes from Google in Europe? Peter Kern : In terms of our core B2C business? Not really, no. I think -- yes. I think Google is still trying to push back. They've introduced some new things in the hotel funnel with Carousels and other things. So as much as we're hoping for help from regulators where we operate within the balance of what they're doing, and they continue to operate pretty much how they have in terms of looking for new ways to monetize and push SEO traffic down, et cetera. So no, no real noticeable impact. Jacob Seed : One more on traffic on how big the [indiscernible]? Ariane Gorin : Sorry, it's really hard to hear. Jacob Seed : On direct traffic, is there any -- can you provide any commentary on that? Peter Kern : I don't think we provide commentary on that. I'd say about 2/3 of our business remains coming from direct traffic, and we've seen strong improvement in the app, which we -- as you probably recall, we've been pushing into for several years, I think, 600 basis points improvement in how much of our business came through the app.  So that continues to be a vein we're pushing into and obviously something we're focused on for the future in terms of just driving more and more direct traffic. Obviously, One Key, we expect to help with that over time. So there's a lot of things going into driving that over time, but so far, the improvement's been good. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Josey from Citigroup. Unknown Analyst : This is Robert on for Ron. One question for you on GenAI. Can you guys share some of the learnings maybe following the launch of EG Labs last year? What are some of the products you guys are most excited about? I guess at what point do you expect these products to come to market and start to change the way users search for travel? Peter Kern : Yes. We've done a lot of experimentation in GenAI, obviously, user-facing as well as within the company from an efficiency standpoint, from customer service, all kinds of places. And I won't steal any thunder, but Ariane and the team will be announcing a lot of really cool new things at our EXPLORE Conference in 10 days or 2 weeks.  But basically, it is early days as far as the search approach goes. It's still pretty modest in terms of how many people use it, certainly in terms of its impact on conversion or anything else. But early is good in the GenAI space because it gives you time to experiment and learn, and we've learned a lot, and that's going to guide to a bunch of new things that our customers are going to see in the coming year.  So there's a lot of new impact from it. There's also a lot of impact, as we've talked about before, from old-fashioned machine learning driving all kinds of wins across the product. And as I mentioned, much more at scale because they can be deployed much more readily across all brands and across different lines of business.  So we're having really good wins, I would say, from ML and AI, but the coolest, newest things we really think will impact consumer behavior and experience are still coming and Ariane and the team will get to tell the world about those in a week or so. Ariane Gorin : Yes. I would just add, as Peter said, we're excited to share some things in a couple of weeks at our partner conference. And again, in addition to what we're doing for travelers, there's a lot of work that we're experimenting with for partners.  How do we help partners use GenAI to better show their inventory in our apps or in our brands? How do we allow them to use GenAI to improve their advertising with us? There's work, as Peter said, with our customer support organization. How do they use it to be more effective? Our development teams, even our commercial teams are looking at, are there pilots for how we can use those to be more effective as well, so I think it's really going to touch every part of the internal organization as well as how travelers search and book. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Can I ask 2 questions? First is, any new thoughts on further managing or paring down costs? Where are you in terms of kind of rethinking reengineering the cost structure? It may well be that you finished all that sort of work, but just asking.  And then secondly, I think it's been a while since you've talked about what percentage of your products that are sold, units, services that are sold, are bundled? Do you have an update on that? And what I'm particularly interested in is whether things like AI, particularly mobile apps, have really led to a greater ability to cross-sell travel products, to bundle travel products, in a way that wasn't the case in the past. Julie Whalen : Mark, thanks for the question. I'll take the cost question. I would say that literally, we are just getting started. So I mean, we did have an announcement back in February where we had impacted about 1,500 associates. We're still on the journey of that. We haven't done all of that yet.  You can see some of the savings already coming through in the P&L within cost of sales and within overhead and also within capitalized labor. And there's more of that to come. It should be substantial savings on an annualized basis. again, hitting all 3 of those lines, of course, cap labor, you won't see in the P&L, even in EBIT because the capitalized software is amortized over 3 years, but you'll see it billed as we continue to move forward.  But I think even as Ariane said, we're looking at every single line to drive efficiencies. And so we have kicked off a few projects to go through and really sort of push on the P&L. So we think there's an incredible opportunity to drive cost efficiencies, and obviously, as we deprecate more systems, we come out of this other side of the migration side of it, there's going to be a lot of opportunity to bring the cost down going forward. Ariane Gorin : And I'm happy to take the second part about products that we bundle. Look, we don't disclose what percentage of our business comes from packages or from cross-sell. But what I would tell you is, one, a unique value proposition of the Brand Expedia is our package path and this ability to dynamically bundle an air ticket with a hotel and the like. And we're seeing really good results as we continue to lean into the package path, and we think it's a great value proposition. And then when you think about sort of the cross-sell and attach, which again has always been one of our strategies, I mean, for as long as I've been at Expedia Group, it has been. It is true that with machine learning, you can get a lot smarter in understanding what is the next best thing to propose to a traveler. What are they most likely to attach, given what we know about them, given what we know about what they're doing in that trip plan? So I think we have lots of ambitions around cross-sell and attach and what machine learning can do to help us there. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo. Unknown Analyst : This is Alec on for Ken. I appreciate the question. B2B has grown faster than the overall corporate growth rate for a while now. A question we get from investors a lot is how to think about the long-term growth rate.  It seems like there's been some transient benefits to the business, whether it's been the recovery of corporate travel or exposure to Asia Pacific. And so when we normalize for those factors, I guess, how do you think about B2B growth over the medium to long term? Ariane Gorin : Yes. Look, we're not sharing projections of how we see things long term. I guess I would just remind everyone that there's a huge market out there for travel. And our B2B business serves a lot of different types of partners, whether they're airlines, whether they're banks. Last year, we launched a partnership with Walmart. We work with off-line travel agencies. We work all over the world.  So I would just say even if it has certainly been growing at a very fast clip for the last few years, we continue to have big ambitions for that business. And as we think about our investments in technology, in our supply, and in our teams and our partner relationships, I think we've got really great assets to continue being leaders in B2B. Operator : Our next question comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Great. Can you just sort of dive into some of the mechanics around the recent head count reduction? How much of that is coming out of capitalized software versus how much can be reinvested into marketing? And then in your hotel segment, great to see double-digit growth. Can you talk about how that's trending in North America relative to international? Julie Whalen : Sure. I'll take the cost actions question. We have not broken out in detail how much is impacting each line. As I mentioned, you can see it within cost of sales improvements, you could see it in the overhead improvements, you can kind of deduce how much of that is due to that. But you can also see it in our cap labor, in our capital expenditures, at least this quarter, how they've come down. A significant portion of that is associated with capital labor.  I think the reason why we didn't want to unpack it all, especially this year, is there's a lot of moving parts. Like I said, hitting across 3 lines, cost of sales, overhead and capital labor. Most of it or a significant piece of it is capital labor, and it is a partial year for the savings. And as you asked, we are going to be taking some of that savings, which is implied within our guidance, and reinvesting it back into marketing. But on an annualized basis, on a go-forward basis, it's substantial and will hit across those 3 lines. Peter Kern : Yes. And I'll just jump in on the hotel segment. I mean, obviously, a couple of things to keep in mind. It's all our businesses. As Ariane mentioned, our B2B business has more exposure to international, so that has some of the better tailwinds, has been in international. Our international investments have been doing well, but that's a fairly small part of our B2C business and all.  So the short answer is yes, hotel segment is growing more outside the U.S. just because of tailwinds. But we are growing it in the U.S. and we are taking share in the U.S. So both are good. We'd obviously love it if the U.S. had tailwinds of 10% macro growth, but it doesn't. But we are growing and we are growing share in the U.S., and as I mentioned, growing share in most of our focus markets. And then B2B benefits from a little more geographical diversity into Asia and LatAm and other places that are growing a bit faster. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Post from Bank of America. Justin Post : I just want to dive in a little bit more on Vrbo. Obviously, huge customer surge during the pandemic. And then it looked like your app strategy of getting apps distributed was working. So just kind of what's not meeting your expectations? Is it the paid channel or is it reactivating customers that -- to kind of higher repeat rates? And what's the plan to fix that? And then second, can you provide any detail on the mix of Vrbo versus core, how that's trending? I think people are coming up with their own estimates whether it's down or not, but we would love some commentary to help us with that. Peter Kern : Yes. Well, I'll do the bad news first. We can't help you with the splits. We don't break out the business that way. But I'll talk about the beginning part, which is, yes, we saw a huge pandemic surge. That was great for customer acquisition. It was great for the Vrbo business. And to be clear, we are still well above 2019 levels even as we sit today. So the category has seen a boost. It has sustained the boost. I think what -- when you get to what we're not happy with now is just we went through, as we've said many times, we have to go backwards to go forward. On Vrbo, that meant changing the product, going through the migration. And for us, it meant that we didn't think we could spend our money efficiently on Vrbo while we were going through that. So we are winning back customer -- we're winning back new customers with new marketing as we push in with investment. We have to get customers back who may have gone through the bumpy period of migration. But also VR is fairly flat in North America right now in terms of demand. So again, we don't have the tailwinds of just a growth driver that was there.  Now we do believe we have the best product. We do believe One Key makes it the most valuable. We do believe we have great supply. And so it's really getting the customers back in. And One Key, on that point, gives us a really good tool to attract not only Vrbo customers back, but as Ariane mentioned, customers from Expedia and Hotels.com, where we have a much bigger base of total humans and customers in those pools, to bring them into Vrbo and see the benefits of staying within our universe of products.  So we have a lot of tools to use. We're just really putting them to use now again, now that we're past the migration, now that we know the product experience is what we want it to be. And we will keep making it better. But it's at a place where we're happy with it, and we can invest behind it, and we know the returns will come through and the product will be sticky when customers get to us.  So that's really what we're -- that's the backdrop, and we're just investing into that backdrop, and we've got to keep driving it. We gave up some ground, clearly, and now we have to win it back. Operator : Our last question comes from Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Thomas Champion : Ariane, the business remains in transition, and it seems to be maybe a difficult period. I'm just curious how you think about your priorities over the next quarter or 2. Tactically, where are you going to allocate your time and really focus first? And then for Julie, I'm wondering if you can just elaborate a little bit on the margin commentary for full year and your expectations. There's a head count reduction. The tech stack being migrated would seem to be a cost savings. Where are you going to be investing such that margins will be more similar to last year versus maybe improving? Ariane Gorin : Thanks, Tom. Look, on the next quarter or 2 -- like let me say, even if I've been in this business for 11 years, stepping into the CEO role is a new perspective. And so I will listen and learn with our teams over the months to come. I think we have set really solid foundations. And as I said in my prepared remarks, one thing is helping the teams get back to the basics of traffic and conversion and delivering the acceleration that's implied in our guidance.  So there's going to be a part of it which is helping the team focus on execution in the short term to deliver our acceleration, and then also sort of listening and learning and figuring out if there are places that we may need to adapt or adjust anything to really deliver on our long-term growth.  So I would say lots of time with our teams internally. Obviously, lots of time with partners and the like, and again, I think I'm fortunate that we have a really great team here that's all motivated to want to win. So I'm looking forward to spending time with them in a couple of months to come. Julie Whalen : And then on the margins question, now going to relatively in line with last year as opposed to margin expansion, it's really a function of where we end up in the range of possible outcomes on the top line. Because we're still generating cost of sales leverage, we're still generating overhead leverage, we're still motivated, obviously, to get back to marketing leverage.  It's just a function of where we see the ramp-up in the back half and what spot on the top line we end up being at. And so we want to make sure we give ourselves enough room to be able to make the investments that we need to make in Vrbo to reinvigorate that brand, and in our international markets to obviously support our growth initiative to expand outside the U.S. And so that gives us that opportunity. Peter Kern : Thank you, everybody. I think that's our last call. Thank you, operator. I think we're finished. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Good afternoon and welcome to Expedia Group's second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to be joined on today's call by our CEO, Ariane Gorin; and our CFO, Julie Whalen. As a reminder, our commentary today will include references to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. And unless otherwise stated, any reference to expenses excludes stock-based compensation. We will also be making forward-looking statements during the call which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Actual results could materially differ due to factors discussed during this call and in our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. Our earnings release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found at our Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ariane. Ariane Gorin : Thanks, Harshit and thank you all for joining us today. I've been CEO for about a quarter now and have spent most of my time in 3 areas : First, refocusing our team on the basics and execution to accelerate growth in our consumer business; second, sharpening our long-term strategy; and third, making sure we have the right leadership team in place. All with the goal of delivering better experiences to travelers and more value to our partners. I'm really pleased to already see some signs of progress as demonstrated by our second quarter results. We grew room nights by 10% and grew gross bookings and revenue by 6% versus last year. This was at the high end of our expectations and was driven by substantial improvement of Vrbo as well as continued strength in Brand Expedia in our advertising business and in our B2B segment. We also executed well in controlling our costs with cost of sales and overheads both declining year-over-year. The travel environment was healthy in the second quarter. And like the last few quarters, we saw stronger demand internationally relative to the U.S. Compared to last year, we grew room nights mid-single digits in the U.S. low double digits in Europe and in the high teens in the rest of the world. Prices held up for both hotel and vacation rentals but we saw continued pricing pressure for air and car. In terms of trends so far in the third quarter, we've seen some softness in demand and Julie will provide more details on this in a few minutes. But regardless of the market environment, we're focused on executing what's in our control and what we know will drive long-term value. Now, let me talk a little bit about the second quarter results themselves. In our Consumer business, we grew gross bookings by 1% which was an improvement of nearly 400 basis points in the first quarter. Our focus on the basics, traffic, conversion, attach rates and marketing efficiency is showing solid early results. The traffic growth across our 3 core brands which are Expedia Hotels.com and Vrbo accelerated sequentially by roughly 500 basis points and conversion rates continue to improve. The percent of bookings through our apps also increased, up over 500 basis points year-on-year. And in terms of attach, multi-item trips grew by 9% compared to last year. And this is important because when travelers buy more than one product from us, they're getting more value, so they're more likely to repeat. On marketing, excluding our investments in Vrbo and international markets, our consumer business showed some year-on-year marketing leverage in the second quarter. Brand Expedia continued its strong performance with booked room nights up nearly 20%, while Vrbo improved meaningfully from its Q1 low point and exited the quarter back to modest growth. Vrbo's recovery continued from higher marketing spend, better supply and Vrbo specific product releases. Look, we certainly have more product work to do on Vrbo, in particular, on our app but we're encouraged with our progress and the sequential improvement in the business. Vrbo also benefited from more cross shoppers from our One Key loyalty program. Nearly 30% of travelers that earned One Key Cash on either Brand Expedia or Hotels.com and then redeemed it on Vrbo were completely new to Vrbo. So One Key is a great source of new travelers for the brand. Also, One Key hit its first year anniversary in the U.S. this summer. We're super pleased to see our large growing member base enjoy the flexibility to earn and burn One Key Cash across our 3 core brands and get great tiered member discounts. Customers who redeem One Key Cash or use member discounts repeat more often. So this gives us a lot of confidence that the benefits of One Key will build further over time. This summer, we're hitting 2 more milestones in the program. In July, we launched a co-branded credit card with Wells Fargo and MasterCard in the U.S. and expect this to reinforce the value proposition of One Key. We're also launching One Key in the U.K. in the third quarter. Like the U.S., the U.K. is a market where all 3 of our big consumer brands are present. Beyond the U.K., though, we're pausing further international rollout of One Key. Most international markets have only either Brand Expedia or Hotels.com operating at scale with limited Vrbo presence. So we're going to take the time to tailor our value proposition for these markets. In addition, this should minimize further near-term disruption to Hotels.com which was the brand most impacted by One Key's U.S. rollout. More importantly and as a reminder, all our loyalty members worldwide on our legacy Expedia and Hotels.com programs continue to benefit from the improved member discounts that we launched last summer. Finally, we made good progress on our international expansion. As an example, in May, we launched Expedia point of sale in UAE and Saudi Arabia. Though it's early days, we've been pleased with the results so far. Turning to B2B. We had another strong quarter with bookings growing 20%, though like last quarter, this was a 200 basis point deceleration. All of our partner segments grew well. And always, while we on-boarded new partners, a significant portion of the quarter's growth came from existing partners. A couple of highlights from the quarter were the renewal of our lodging deal with Trip.com and a new partnership with Cathay Pacific using our White Label Template. Moving on to supply which powers both our consumer and B2B segments, we continue to improve our offerings. For flights, we just signed a partnership with Ryanair and will soon add their supply to our marketplace. In Vacation Rentals, we grew our supply double digits while removing properties that weren't providing acceptable guest experiences and we source more listings with flexible cancellation policies and discounts. All of this reinforces the Vrbo value proposition. We're also investing in more powerful tools, what we call our visibility boosters to help our supply partners attract the travelers they want. More hotels are using these tools to fill hotel rooms and our revenue from these products grew over 40% in the first half of this year and that's a great win-win. Before I turn the call over to Julie to talk about our financial results and guidance, I want to touch on our path forward and where I'm focusing our teams. Improving the performance of our consumer business remains our biggest priority. We're capitalizing on our tech investments for the last few years, while at the same time, digging into what product capabilities and configurations, we need to strengthen Vrbo and the Hotel.com brand. We're getting surgical in identifying drivers of repeat behavior in addition to loyalty and app usage, whether it's burning One Key Cash or adopting AI-enabled products like price predictions. We want all of our core brands, Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo to have clear value propositions and drive healthy growth and we're making adjustments to ensure we have the right focus. In B2B, after 12 quarters and over 20% booking growth, we expect continued normalization and we'll continue to invest in our technology, supply and partnerships to extend our lead in the segment. Finally, we continue to execute with cost discipline everywhere. On cost of sales, we've reduced spend and improved gross margins substantially over the last several quarters. We're exploring additional opportunities to rationalize our marketing spend and on overhead, we're using technology and AI to further boost productivity. In closing, I'm encouraged by our second quarter results and I'm incredibly proud of and thankful to our employees who rallied together and are working tirelessly to deliver on our ambition, to help travelers around the world experience great trips and create lifelong memories. And with that, let me hand it over to Julie. Julie Whalen : Thank you, Ariane and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter results including double-digit room night growth, a sequential acceleration in our B2C business, driving gross bookings to 6% and EBITDA margins expanding approximately 70 basis points in the first half. As far as the financial details for the second quarter, total gross bookings of $28.8 billion were up 6% versus last year, driven by total lodging gross bookings which grew 8%, led by our hotel business growing 11% and the improvement in our Vrbo business. We were happy to see that we have held or grown hotel gross booking share in virtually all of our key markets. In our Vrbo business, we saw a significant acceleration as we moved through the quarter which drove our total gross bookings sequential acceleration of approximately 300 basis points from the first quarter. Revenue of $3.6 billion grew 6% versus last year, led by our B2B business, Brand Expedia and our advertising business. Total revenue margin was flat year-over-year as the uplift from advertising growth was offset by fewer stays given the lower gross bookings in the first quarter, the shift of Easter stays into the first quarter and the contra revenue arising from pricing actions. As a reminder, pricing actions from prior periods negatively impacted both revenue and revenue margins this quarter as it is recorded as contra revenue at the time of the stay. Cost of sales was $358 million for the quarter and $45 million or 11% lower versus last year which combined with our strong revenue growth, drove approximately 190 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue year-over-year. We continue to see our ongoing initiatives are delivering transactional efficiencies. Direct sales and marketing expense in the second quarter was $1.8 billion which was up 14% versus last year. Sales and marketing deleverage this quarter as a percentage of gross bookings primarily due to higher commissions to our partners from the strong growth in our B2B business which grew over 20% as well as the planned ramp in marketing spend in Vrbo and international markets to drive incremental growth. As we have stated previously, commissions paid to our B2B partners are in our direct sales and marketing line and are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business. However, because they are generally paid on a stayed basis to contractually agreed upon percentages, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate. In our B2C business, we saw some deleverage this quarter as we reinvested back into our Vrbo business and our international markets to drive improving growth in global market expansion. Excluding these investments, we saw some marketing leverage in our B2C business in the second quarter. Overhead expenses were $606 million, a decrease of $21 million versus last year or 3%. This resulted in approximately 165 basis points of leverage, primarily driven by lower people costs in products and tech from our actions to rationalize our headcount as well as the timing of both new hires and other salary-related costs across our key growth areas of the business. We remain committed to driving efficiencies across our P&L and we're pleased to see that the cost actions we have taken, as previously announced, continue to drive savings across capitalized labor, cost of sales and overhead costs. On the bottom line, we delivered strong second quarter EBITDA of $786 million which was up 5% year-over-year with an EBITDA margin of 22.1%, deleveraging slightly for approximately 15 basis points year-over-year. Our first half EBITDA margins, however, expanded by approximately 70 basis points year-over-year which exceeded our expectations due to strong expense management despite the impact from our pricing actions and our investments in marketing. As far as our EBIT performance which includes the impact of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, we delivered $475 million of EBIT with a margin of 13.3%, delivering approximately 20 basis points of expansion year-over-year in the second quarter and 95 basis points of expansion in the first half. The additional 25 basis points of expansion as compared to EBITDA is driven by leverage from stock-based compensation from flat year-over-year cost as well as leverage from depreciation that grew slower than revenue. Our year-to-date free cash flow remained robust at $4 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by our strong first half EBITDA growth and lower capital expenditures. Moving on to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $8.7 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $6.2 billion and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion. Our debt level remains at approximately $6.3 billion with an average cost of 3.7%. Our gross leverage ratio had further reduced 2.3x, continue to make progress towards our target gross leverage ratio of 2x driven by our ongoing strong EBITDA growth. In addition, our strong cash position enabled us to repurchase $1.2 billion or 9.2 million shares year-to-date. We continue to believe that our stock remains undervalued and does not reflect our expected long-term performance of the business. As such, we expect to utilize the strong cash-generating power of our business and our remaining $3.6 billion share repurchase authorization to continue to buy back our stock opportunistically. Moving now to our outlook for the rest of the year. While we accelerated our gross bookings throughout Q2, entering the third quarter, we have seen a more challenging macro environment and a slowdown in travel demand, consistent with recent commentary from others in the travel industry. And while we saw flat ADRs on a like-for-like basis in Q2, we saw a decline in July stemming from FX headwinds and from consumers trading down to lower-priced properties. And we've also seen more continued softness in air ticket prices. In addition, we have seen some headwinds from new pricing display regulations that kicked off on July 1st in California and we are monitoring it closely. These factors collectively drove weaker-than-expected growth across both our consumer and B2B businesses in July and are influencing our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Given this backdrop, we expect third quarter gross bookings and revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 5% versus last year. And as a result of the range of possible top line growth and our marketing investments in Vrbo and our international markets, we expect approximately 100 basis points of deleverage to our third quarter EBITDA and EBIT margins versus last year. As for the full year, we expect gross bookings to be at the low end of our previously communicated range of mid- to high single digits at approximately 4% and revenue growth to be 2 points higher at approximately 6% with our earnings outlook holding at EBITDA and EBIT margins relatively in line with last year. In closing, we are pleased with our performance and the acceleration we saw in our Vrbo business during the second quarter. And while the more recent market environment is challenging, it is this ongoing execution against our growth initiatives, combined with our strong financial position to give us confidence in our long-term opportunity to deliver profitable growth. And with that, let me open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Mark Mahaney : Two questions, please. First on Vrbo. It sounds like that's started to recover to growth exiting the quarter. Any thoughts on what that trajectory is like? And I know you've got headwinds going into the back half of the year but if you can isolate out the headwinds, just talk about what that growth recovery path looks like. And then real quick hit on advertising revenue, expectations for how that's trending? Are you able to kind of maintain the growth you've had there. And I think that was sort of solid 20%. Julie Whalen : Yes. I mean, for Vrbo, obviously, it's hard to make that call right now because we're staring at this July trends. But certainly, our expectation is to drive that business to growth and get it back to where it used to be. And so as we said, we saw substantial acceleration as they move from the beginning of the year. So basically, as we ended the quarter with some modest growth but now we're in this moment in July, where it's a little bit hard to read the business. But certainly, long term, that is our expectation. As far as the advertising business, I mean, that business is on fire. We have got a lot of opportunity with that business to continue to drive its growth. I mean, if I think if you look back, it's been at least in the high 20s for a while now and we don't have any reason to believe that that's going to significantly change going forward. Ariane Gorin : And I would just add that on the advertising business, when the market gets soft, actually, you could imagine that some of our supply partners will want to spend more in advertising where they know that the travel demand is going to be. So as we're looking at how the market evolves, obviously, I think our teams will be looking at how can we help our supply partners in getting the volume. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe 2 questions, if I could, a bit more of a bigger picture in nature. In terms of the role of CEO that you've now had for a couple of months, wanted to know if you could just reflect on some of the key learnings you've had and go a little bit deeper on the turnaround of some of the brands like Vrbo and Hotels.com. And what you've learned about the ability to possibly speed up some of that recovery or some of the aspects that might take longer pieces of time to sort of implement leaving the side or isolating some of the macro variables from your insights there. And then the second, you come out of the B2B business. As you continue to move out of B2B and into this broader CEO role, what do you think remains relatively underappreciated or misunderstood about the B2B business, now it sits inside Expedia? Ariane Gorin : Thanks for the question, Eric. In terms of the consumer business, as I stepped in, I think I had always appreciated the work that we had done on the platform that was going to allow us to accelerate innovation across the Board. So for example, in the second quarter, we were able to release flexible date search in all 3 of our big brands at the same time. And we wouldn't have been able to do that, had we not done the platform work. That being said, when we did the work to move Vrbo and Hotels.com onto our common front end, we did give up some of the things that made those brands a bit more unique. On Vrbo, collaboration was a big -- it was sort of something that was used a lot in Vrbo. And when we migrated it, the good thing was we got the trip planning collaboration onto Brand Expedia but we lost some of the functionality in Vrbo. Now the good news is, we've added a bunch of it back and there's still work to be done. But it just meant that we went through a period of time in the migration where we moved back. Similarly with Hotels.com, when we move to One Key, we sort of downplayed an advantage that Hotels.com had. It had a really big differentiator and its loyalty program. So the good news is that both of those brands have great brand awareness, have people who love to come back to them. But I've just realized it's going to take work to get them back to where we want. And so as I think about sort of the months and the quarters ahead, it's how do we take all the capabilities that we've built in the platform across the board on a horizontal basis and sort of figure out what needs to be configured or built differently for Vrbo and Hotel.com. But overall, I feel good about that. It's just -- it's going to take some time to get there. And I would also add for Hotels.com, it will benefit as we go back into international. Hotels.com is a brand that's got great brand recognition in places like the Nordics and elsewhere. And what we've seen in these early days of leaning back into some of those international markets is that we're seeing good results. In terms of the B2B business and what's maybe misunderstood or underappreciated. Funny, when I took on the business about 10 years ago, I remember thinking, what are the moats around it, what's differentiated around it. And what I sort of have concluded over the years is it's a combination of things. You have to have really great supply and we have great lodging supply. We're doing a lot of work to get B2B-specific lodging supply. You have to have great technology, an excellent sales team, super partner relationships and be very hungry and aggressive and be open to a lot of partnerships. So I just -- I guess the way I think of it is, there is a massive travel industry. What is at $2.3 trillion. Our own brands have a small part of it. And so with the B2B business, we could really look to what is all the innovation we have in our company that can help power all of the other travel players out there. Operator : Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Lee Horowitz : Two, if I could. So you clearly have a number of marketing priorities ahead of you as you look to take share in Vrbo, lean back into international markets, while also facing some building ADR pressures, as you called out which have their own margin impact. I guess with that in mind, how do you think about the levers that you have at your disposal to drive margin expansion sort of on a go-forward basis given those investment priorities? And then maybe, Ariane, another one on the B2B business. I guess, how do you think about sort of the interplay between B2B and B2C? Is there a world where the success of your B2B business can actually prove cannibalistic to your B2C business? If you help partners create super compelling travel rewards programs, presumably that's a piece of the pie that core Expedia doesn't have access to any more. How do you think about managing those 2 in that sort of environment? Ariane Gorin : Okay. Thanks for the question, Lee. Julie, do you want to take the first one and I'll take the second. Julie Whalen : Sure. So from a leverage perspective, obviously, we have been able to do a really great job with cost of sales, where costs have actually been down year-over-year, much less leveraging. And while over time, that will start to moderate because obviously, that can't go on in perpetuity. We still expect to drive incredible leverage on that line. We've got a lot of opportunities to continue to drive efficiencies there across our merchant fees and our operations, whether it's on AI and technology and all sorts of things that we're looking at to further drive efficiencies there. At the same time, you can see, although this quarter is a little bit of anomaly, we did have overhead that was down to last year as well. And so we're still -- we did several cost actions as we announced earlier in the year and so we're benefiting from those. That's helping that line drive leverage to help the total P&L. And certainly, we are very focused on looking at every line in the P&L to see what the opportunity is and how we can go after it. So we can take that money either deliver it to the body [ph] or to reinvest it in the business. We did say this year, however, that as you alluded to, we are making the investments in marketing, in Vrbo and international markets because we want to reinvigorate those businesses. And clearly, by what we saw in the second quarter, it works. So it's important that we continue to do that and keep that momentum going. So as we've guided to and as we said, this year, we don't expect much leverage. But longer term, we're certainly not guiding to '25 at this time. But longer term, we absolutely expect to have margin leverage going forward because all of the things that we're investing and driving towards to bring in more direct traffic should enable us to get more leverage on the marketing line in addition to all the good work we're doing on cost of sales and overhead. And if I think I've said before, if you could see the Brand Expedia P&L, who is the least disrupted brand, it's doing just that. And we've got strong top of line growth and we've got strong marketing leverage. And so it's something that we're working towards with the other brands to get there over time. And then on the second question on B2B and B2C. So I would say, in the geography, there are certain geographies in which our B2C brands aren't very present. And so it's obvious that anything we're doing in B2B there is going to be incremental. But it's true that there are many geographies in which we have both businesses and consumers go to many different places for travel. Of course, I think any travel company would love to have consumers only come to them. But consumers sometimes will shop for personal travel on their favorite OTA, hopefully, one of ours, they might have business travel where they're using their corporate travel bookings rule. They may be in an airline program and have loyalty points and want to spend those points. And so we see the opportunity to power the technology and inventory in every one of those cases. And it's actually a big value driver that we bring to our supply partners because we make it easier for them to reach demand not only through us but also through our B2B partners. And fundamentally, I think that it just forces our own B2C brands to be even more competitive and to up our game. Operator : Our next question comes from Trevor Young with Barclays. Trevor Young : First question, can you just expand a bit on the cadence of growth throughout the quarter? Was it steady and then July saw the step down? And was there any nuance around that step down in July across geos? And then second question, more of a bigger picture one. We're now a few quarters in from the completion of the tech platform migration. What gives you confidence that all the transformation work that you've done in the past few years is working and will pay off? Ariane Gorin : Julie, do you want to take the first one? I'll take the second. Julie Whalen : Yes, sure. In the second quarter, we basically saw comps accelerating and that's because, as we've said, the main accelerating driver was Vrbo. And so we basically came from a low, so to speak, at the beginning of the year and accelerated by quarter and was the main driver to drive the full acceleration of the business. So we saw accelerating comps in Q2 and then like I said, in July, there's just a lot going on that's hard to understand with precision. And so we saw sort of this noise in the P&L in our business. And really, when you look at it from a geo perspective, to answer your question, it's a lot in U.S. that we're seeing. We're seeing a couple of other areas but mostly it's U.S. focused. Ariane Gorin : In terms of the replatforming, as I said earlier, it's really unlocked a lot of capabilities that we didn't have before. One of them, for example, is our testing platform. Already this year, we've done more tests on Vrbo than we did all of platform migrations, we've been able to put something like One Key in place where we have a view of a customer across all of our brands. We -- as I said, we're able to release the ability to do flexible date shopping in the second quarter across all of our brands. So there are a number of, I would say, e-commerce basics that we're able to roll out across all of our brands without having to do the work multiple times. Now going forward, what we're digging into is where are their configurations or maybe even some brand-specific features that we need to build on top because it's true that the last few years, so much of our capacity went to sort of rebuilding some of the foundations and to migrations. Operator : Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : Just on B2B, I think your growth in the quarter was over 20%, a pretty tough comp sort of in process. But I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned a deceleration. Just curious if you could unpack that a little bit, what's driving the slowdown. And then just on the implied guide for fourth quarter, I realize that you don't have a lot of visibility but can you just talk about how you see the booking window kind of evolving from here? Julie Whalen : Yes. So on B2B, yes, we've seen a little bit of deceleration. And as you alluded to, of course, we're still at 20%. So it's still really a strong business. And we alluded to the fact that as global demand normalizes, that, that business would see some of that growth come down as it also normalizes. So that's not too unusual for us to see. Obviously, in the July period that we've alluded to, they also are impacted by a lot of the dynamics that I mentioned as far as what's going on in July. And so they can have a little bit more of an impact than what was sort of just the global normalization but we're really excited about that business. Ariane spoke about it. There's just so much opportunity there. And given our leadership position and all the opportunities we see going forward, it should continue to drive strong growth. It's just that we've got this moment right now, where we're seeing some of this macro impacting it. But the underlying health of the business is incredibly strong. As far as the booking windows, it's interesting, we have been seeing for a while now in our B2C hotel business that the windows have actually been expanding slightly year-over-year. But as we entered July, they actually or during the month of July, they actually shortened just a little, not a lot but just a little bit in that month. And that's the first time we've seen that in a while. On the Vrbo side, they've been shortening for a while and they're kind of just doing a similar thing. So there wasn't anything material that changed in July but we did see a little bit of that in the hotel side of things. Ariane Gorin : And maybe I'll just add a little bit on the first part on B2B. As Julie said, B2B is a much more geographically diverse business than our consumer business. And so over the last few quarters, it's really benefited from a lot of the travel demand, in particular, in Asia. And so the deceleration we've seen a couple -- for the last couple of quarters which still was a very strong growth, was coming from the normalization of that growth, in particular, in Asia. Now as Julie said, as we headed into July, we saw some slowdown and that was more with the U.S. part of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan with B. Riley. Naved Khan : Yes. I just wanted to double click on the annual guide, Julie a little bit. So I think the prior guidance was mid- to high single digits for both bookings and revenue and now you're guiding to revenue of 6% and bookings were 4%. So -- and you also noted some weakening in the airfare. So I'm just trying to figure out how I should think about the lodging business, you talked about ADR weakening. So room night is going to grow faster than maybe the 6% or just give us some goal post there or just your thoughts on how to think about the lodging business and room nights and ADRs. Julie Whalen : Yes. I mean, fortunately, we haven't -- we don't guide to that level by the line item. And obviously, all of that has been assumed in the numbers that we have presented here for the full year. But certainly, everything I mentioned impacts the lodging business. So there will be an impact to that on all those metrics for the lodging business but we're not providing guidance on those right now. Naved Khan : Okay. And then I have a follow-up on the cost side of things. So of the restructuring that you announced earlier this year, how much of that has been action and how much has yet to follow in the second half? Julie Whalen : Yes. The majority of that has been action. There were some that we took action on in Q1, some that we took action on Q2 and so that's why you're seeing the favorability in overhead because you're getting the full quarter of the Q1 action and then you're getting the additional Q2 action that's coming through. There's a little bit that's left on that but not significant. But of course, it doesn't mean we're stopped looking at every single line and where we can find efficiencies elsewhere. It's just on that particular cost action that we mentioned, we're almost through it. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with TD Securities. Kevin Kopelman : Just one, so quickly on the macro. You called out ADR softness. Are you seeing any softness in nights? And then could you just give more color on how you're managing the B2C advertising expenses in the second half given the backdrop? Julie Whalen : Sorry, you said -- can you repeat the first part of the question? Kevin Kopelman : The first part was on the macro softness that you're seeing quarter-to-date, you called out the ADR softness but are you also seeing a slowdown in kind of underlying nights activity, particularly with stays. Julie Whalen : Yes, we are. In particular, stage, you said? Kevin Kopelman : Well, just kind of separating out the window versus how much we actually look like they're going to be traveling. Julie Whalen : Yes. No, we're definitely seeing a reduction in nights. I mean it's not just a booking window play, if that's what you're talking about or just an ADR play. There's definitely, as we said, there's been some softening in travel demand which is impacting the transactions side of it. But it's a combo of all, right? I mean there's certainly -- all those other factors are also true. As far as your B2C advertising expense question, I mean, obviously, that's what our plans are been assumed that's from the guidance that we gave and we said that we are guiding to on the year EBITDA margins to be relatively in line with last year. So we're managing to that, while still investing in Vrbo international markets. And so certainly, we will be looking at advertising, seeing what makes sense relative to the top line and any other variable costs associated with that depending on where that top line goes. But that what we're managing to is the full year EBITDA margins relatively in line with last year. Ariane Gorin : And I would just remind you and as Julie said, obviously, looking very closely at what are the macro trends, what are the demand trends, where do we want to spend in marketing and advertising. And we look at marketing, promotions and pricing and loyalty all sort of in the same bucket to then say which of these is going to be most effective given the environment. And then even within marketing, are we going to put money more into performance or into social or into other channels. And I spent a lot of time with our marketing team just looking at where we're getting the best returns, where we're leaning in, where do we need to pull back and the like. Kevin Kopelman : And you noted maybe rationalizing some marketing spend. What were you referring to there? If you could share any more color? Ariane Gorin : So we -- I mean, one of the things we've been doing in the last bit of time is really interrogating every dollar of our marketing spend. And for example, looking at nonworking versus working marketing spend, understanding the returns on each because we -- especially if we're going into an environment that is a bit more volatile. It's just so important that every dollar. We understand the returns when we're investing more in international and Vrbo, we need to be making up for efficiency elsewhere. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Ken Gawrelski : Just two, if I may. First, could you've talked about the EXPLORE Conference in May a lot about your marketing plans and your advertising and media plans, I should say, not your marketing plan, sorry. Could you talk about opportunities, not necessarily in the short term but over the kind of next 1 to 2 years, how you can continue to grow that business robustly and what the opportunities look like? And then second is just more tactical. As you think about the One Key expansion to the U.K. Do you expect that to be a material and how material do you expect that to be on Hotels.com in the back half of the year? Ariane Gorin : Thanks for the question. Let me start with the first one. So you're right, we talked about the travel media network at EXPLORE and we're really excited about the opportunity to grow advertising and to bring value to our advertisers. Today, a lot of our advertising business happens on the shopping and booking moments of the travel funnel. So when someone's in the search results or when they're in the booking process, there's not as much sort of when they're in the dreaming and very upper funnel and there isn't as much, for example, in post booking. So we think that there's an opportunity there. We also think that there's an opportunity to expand in the number of partners who are using our advertising tools. So whether it's the sponsored listings and having more hotels or airlines using sponsored listings, or new products that we can bring to destination, management organizations think that there's a lot of growth and opportunity there as well. I'd also call out that we're doing some interesting work on providing more tools to these advertisers. So making it easier for them to sort of self-serve on some of our advertising products, self-serve on sort of getting -- letting us do more of the targeting for them, we're about to introduce some video into our ads which we think will make those perform better. So I would just say for the long term, we think there's a lot of opportunity here. On the question about One Key and expansions in the U.K., I don't think it's going to have a material impact at the company level. Certainly, you learned from the One Key rollout in the U.S. on how to treat the sort of higher value of Hotels.com customers who might feel like they're getting a sort of downstep in their value and we're using that in the U.K. but I think at a company level, it's not material. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein Societe Generale Group. Richard Clarke : Just a question on the pause on the rollout of One Key. Does that mean that the Hotels.com buy 10 nights get 1 free. That will remain in all markets, apart from North America in the U.K.? And is that awkward to your sort of supply partners that they've got to deal with you in multiple different loyalty schemes. And what does it mean for your sort of B2B rollout? I think One Key was one of the things you were offering as part of the B2B rollout. So how would that affect the rollout of B2B in sort of non-U.S., non-U.K. markets? Ariane Gorin : Yes. Okay. Thanks for the question. In terms of whether the Hotels.com 10 for 1 will remain the same outside of the U.S. and the U.K., the answer is yes. It's a simple program. For now, it's remaining that way as we work to figure out what would the path forward be. For our supply partners, our hotels, for example, it's completely transparent to them. They participate in member deals where they provide different levels of discount for different tiers of members and we actually translate that into our Hotels.com rewards program. So if I'm a hotel, I'm able to reach those Hotels.com rewards members, whether they're in a country that has the existing 10 for 1 stamps or whether they're in the U.S. In terms of B2B, actually, One Key is not rolled out to the B2B business. That's a business where we're providing inventory and technology but a lot of our partners have their own loyalty program. You may be thinking about -- we've talked about rolling out One Key to our advertising partners and allowing them to use some of their advertising dollars to accelerate One Key earn for their hotels. And that, again, won't really make a difference. They can do that in the U.S. and the U.K. It won't be something that we can do outside of that. But again, this is why we are going to take the time to think about what is the value proposition for our loyalty programs in countries where we only have one big brand at scale. Operator : Our next question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. John Colantuoni : Great. Two quick ones for me. First, on the 3Q outlook, does your outlook for the third quarter assumes there's a recovery in night in August and September relative to July? And second question, just talk to some of the pricing reductions you started making last quarter and how that impacted conversion. And now that you're seeing some trade down, whether you might have to lean in a little bit more there. Julie Whalen : Yes. As far as the first question on the 3Q outlook, we have not sort of baked in any upside or something in September. We've looked at obviously run our various scenarios and what the information that we have based on what's happening in July and ran that out as to where we think the quarter will land. Certainly, it's also you have to take into consideration for revenue at least what happened in prior quarters because then the states come to fruition in the third quarter. So we already have some of that data and that's just going to play out. But certainly, based on all the new data in July, we've just run our scenarios and let it play out for Q3 accordingly but there wasn't any sort of step-up in September that we assumed. As far as the pricing actions, yes, we had made a call, you probably remember from last quarter that we had done some pricing actions towards the end. That then we're going to be coming into this quarter, we did see that come in. And we only do those pricing actions if we get the returns. And so certainly, they are driving conversion for us. And so as we have been doing, we're going to continue with that, going forward as it is a good returning marketing lever for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Great. Just going back to the B2B opportunity. Is there any way you can sort of give us a backlog or just frame like the amount of contracts you think are up that can potentially drive growth there? And then just on Vrbo, just thinking of the fourth quarter marketing strategy, that's usually when you have like a large brand campaign. If this softness continues, can you just talk about how that impacts your marketing strategy? Ariane Gorin : So on the first one, so thanks for the questions. On the first one, I'm not going to share details about the pipeline. What I will say is we're thoughtful about which deals we want to bid for. I think often when you have an B2B team, it's as important which deals you decide not to bid for and which ones you decide to bid for. And we have a super experienced team, a great business development team that's being thoughtful about where do we want to play and where do we not. I'd also say that growth can come from finding new partners but growth also comes from our existing partners. So sometimes you might have a partner that we're powering 3 of their points of sale and then they decide that they're going to expand into another couple of countries and it's incumbent on our team to make sure that we're the ones powering them as they're growing their business. So when you think about the B2B business, it's not just that sort of the pipeline of new business, it's also what are all the actions we're doing in our existing partners in order to either win share or to just grow along with them. Julie Whalen : As far as the Vrbo marketing strategy, certainly, we learned from last year that you don't want to pull back too much on the marketing spend because Q1 -- sorry, as you're entering in Q1 is a really big time for Vrbo. So that's part of the reason why we're even guiding in Q3 to pressure on EBITDA because we want to continue investing in Vrbo for that very reason because we're investing for the longer term. And so we would continue to invest in Vrbo. I mean, obviously, it depends if there's some massive level of softness that all things are off the table. But we're not expecting that but it's not how we've been guiding. And so our expectation is we continue to invest in to Vrbo and that's assumed, obviously, within our margin guidance on the year to be relatively in line with last year. Operator : Our final question comes from Ron Josey with Citigroup. Ron Josey : Maybe, Ariane, a follow-up to your comment there on investment in marketing. I thought the 20% growth in room nights in Brand Expedia was a really key highlight. So I wanted to understand just the drivers here, maybe a little more on geographic mix. And really, the benefits from the advertising side of the brand continues to evolve. And then I think I heard you say conversion rates improved in the quarter as in multiproduct attach rates. And so again, just wanted to dive a little bit deeper on the product to hear how the funnel, how transactions are going on Expedia overall. Ariane Gorin : Yes. Thanks, Ron, for the question. As you said, I mean, Brand Expedia has been a great highlight for us. And it's also what gives me confidence because it was the least disruptive of all of our brands and it's the brand that's gotten all of our innovation going into it. We've also, over a number of years, really built up the brand value there. We spent quite a bit in marketing over time and now we're seeing leverage with it because we have a great app installed base, strong repeat, a great member base and the value proposition on Brand Expedia to shopping and booking multi-item scripts, whether it's directly through the package path or buying a flight and then later coming back and buying a hotel at a discounted rate, is really strong for travelers. So I would just say, in general, we feel good about it. It's still to my liking to U.S. focused. I mean, as is our whole consumer business, we'd like to see more growth internationally. But as you say, Expedia is really a highlight. So thank you for the question. Operator : I will now hand the call back over to Ariane Gorin for closing remarks. Ariane Gorin : Okay. Well, so I just want to thank you all again for joining us. Julie and I appreciate the questions. I just want to leave you with the thought that, we know the environment is becoming more volatile. But regardless, we believe we have a lot of opportunity ahead. We have great consumer brands that travelers love, a differentiated B2B business, diverse supply, the strongest it's ever been and a really powerful tech platform. So as we look to the future, we're going to use these assets to drive profitable growth. Thank you, all. Operator : That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to SVP, Corporate Development and Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's third quarter 2024 earnings call. I am pleased to be joined on today's call by our CEO, Ariane Gorin; and our CFO, Julie Whalen. As a reminder, our commentary today will include references to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. And unless otherwise stated, any reference to expenses exclude stock-based compensation. We will also be making forward-looking statements during the call, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Actual results could materially differ due to factors discussed during this call and in our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. Our earnings release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ariane. Ariane Gorin : Thanks, Harshit, and thank you all for joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect strong execution across our company. We exceeded our expectations on gross bookings and earnings with revenue landing in line despite weather and currency headwinds. We accelerated gross bookings in our consumer business for the second straight quarter, driven by continued strength in Brand Expedia, Vrbo returning to growth, and good results in our international points of sale. Our advertising and B2B businesses continue to outpace the industry, both delivering strong double-digit growth. We remain disciplined on costs with cost of sales and overheads, both declining year-over-year. Overall, we're pleased with the results of our work. We're executing and what's in our control and capitalizing on growth opportunities to rebuild momentum after our tech replatforming. The travel environment in the third quarter was healthy, but mixed with demand softer in July and then improving into August and September. International demand was stronger than the U.S. And compared to last year, booked room nights grew in the low single digits in the U.S., low double digits in Europe and high teens in the rest of the world. Like last quarter, prices held up for both hotel and vacation rentals. For air and car, we saw continued pricing pressure, though air ticket prices grew in September for the first time this year. Turning to our consumer business. We remain focused on the fundamentals, driving more direct traffic, improving product performance, enhancing our supply and expanding internationally. Gross bookings were up 3% year-on-year, which was a 2-point acceleration compared to the second quarter. Global app downloads for our core brands was up nearly 10% year-on-year led by EMEA at 20% growth. And the percent of bookings coming from our apps improved by 3 points. Brand Expedia continued to be strong with room nights at mid-teens year-on-year. We shipped great new product features like destination comparison, flexible date search and live flight tracker, all of which create better traveler experiences. Our package product that allows travelers to dynamically bundle a huge selection of flights, hotels and cars, all with attractive package savings is a real differentiator for Brand Expedia. Last quarter, we released new features like the ability to book accommodations for only part of the trip and package searches for 1 way flights. These make planning and booking multi-item trips even easier, and combined with our targeted promotional activity drove a 25% increase in package bookings in the third quarter. Shifting to Vrbo now. We delivered our first full quarter of bookings growth this year. Bookings were up modestly with traffic and conversion both growing despite the negative impact of Hurricane Helene. We're meaningfully improving Vrbo app performance, making the app faster and adding new features to streamline shopping. App traffic growth has accelerated and more visitors are signing in. We've also further strengthened Vrbo supply. We added nearly 1 million units that had previously only been available on Brand Expedia. These units skew more to urban areas and shorter stays, which allows Vrbo to appeal to a wider audience. And beyond the additional supply, we improved the quality of our existing supply with more discounts for long stays and more flexible cancellation policies. Looking to the fourth quarter, while October has been tougher for Vrbo due to Hurricane Milton, we believe that our focus on the basics, traffic, our product and our supply will continue to drive positive momentum for Vrbo. Before moving to B2B, I want to highlight progress from our international expansion, advertising and loyalty initiatives. In the last few quarters, we've moved back into faster-growing international markets, investing surgically and are seeing promising results. Bookings growth for our consumer brands outside the U.S. accelerated by 5 points in the third quarter. One particular highlight was healthy double-digit growth for Hotels.com in Scandinavia, where we already have high brand awareness. We believe we have a big opportunity ahead to grow internationally and to win share. Our Advertising business delivered yet another strong quarter with revenue up 32% as we've continued to add more advertisers and evolve our products. We simplified our sign-up process and are testing new product capabilities like video ads and search results, which are driving a nearly 30% increase in engagement. All of this means we're delivering more value and better returns for our advertisers. In terms of our loyalty program, global active membership grew 7% year-over-year in Q3, and our 12-month member repeat rate was up 150 basis points compared to last year. On our 3 core brands, nearly half of our room nights came from silver, gold or platinum members. And as a reminder, these higher tier members get further member discounts funded by our supply partners. We've also enhanced the One Key value proposition in the U.S. and U.K. This quarter, we introduced member-only discounts for the first time ever on Vrbo and have seen great early results. And on Brand Expedia, we just expanded redemption options to include more airlines. We're continuing to fine-tune the loyalty value proposition for each brand and each market while capitalizing on the capabilities of our underlying tech platform. Turning to B2B. We had another strong quarter with bookings up 19% year-on-year, slowing only 1 point from the second quarter. Growth was broad-based and came from all partner segments and regions. We shipped new solutions for existing partners, adding activities and ground transport for hotel partners like Hilton and introducing new loyalty capabilities for Alaska Airlines. We also secured important wins like long-term renewals with Despegar and Traveloka and a new partnership with Canadian Bank, CIBC. Just last week, we announced a new partnership with Microsoft Bing. So overall, we continue to extend our leadership in B2B. Let me now spend a minute on a few highlights of how our tech platform and AI capabilities are contributing to better conversion and enhanced customer service. On conversion, some of the most compelling use cases so far have been property question-and-answer, smart and natural language filters and review summaries. Over 70% of travelers read reviews before making a booking, and we use generative AI to efficiently summarize reviews and provide detailed property and neighborhood information. This makes it easier for travelers to shop while taking less of our development time and resources. In customer service, we're continuing to leverage AI to allow travelers to self-serve, which both lowers costs and improves the traveler experience. For instance, our virtual agents now handle nearly half of all traveler inquiries through self-service. Additionally, our agent copilot feature, which summarizes voice and chat interactions, significantly reduces after-call work for our call center agents. Before closing, I want to share a couple of leadership updates. We announced today that Julie will be stepping down as CFO and as a member of our Board of Directors. We expect to announce a successor prior to Julie's departure to allow for a smooth transition. I want to thank Julie for all she's done for Expedia Group as a Board member and as our CFO over the last 5 years. We're deeply grateful for all of our contributions and appreciate her partnership during this transition. We also announced last month that Ramana Thumu is joining us as our Chief Technology Officer. Ramana is a great leader and technologist and he's led tech teams for over 2 decades. More recently, he built and scaled the multi-brand platform at Fanatics. So his experience is directly relevant to our growth aspirations here at Expedia Group. In closing, we're pleased with our third quarter performance and the progress we're making. We continue to see healthy travel demand and are confident in our ability to execute, which has led us to raise our full year guidance, and Julie will talk about that in a minute. I'd like to thank our team for their hard work and the successful delivery of our third quarter. With that, let me hand it over to Julie. Julie Whalen : Thank you, Ariane, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter results. Despite some headwinds during the quarter, including unfavorable macro trends, weather events and FX, we were able to deliver year-over-year room night growth of 9%, gross bookings growth of 7%, and acceleration of over 150 basis points versus the second quarter, revenue growth of 3% and EBITDA growth of 3% with only slight margin deleverage of approximately 16 basis points. But before I jump into more of the financial details for the third quarter, I just wanted to say thank you to Ariane, the Board and the Management team here at Expedia. I'm proud to have been associated with Expedia Group as a Board member since 2019 and more recently as CFO. I am committed to supporting the company until and after my successor is in place to ensure a smooth transition. I am confident in this management team and our strategy, and I remain excited about the opportunities ahead for Expedia Group. Now back to the financial details for the third quarter. Total gross bookings of $27.5 billion grew 7% versus last year, driven by lodging gross bookings, which grew 8% and includes our hotel business growing 10%. We were happy to see that we have once again held or grown hotel gross bookings share in virtually all of our key markets. Booking windows for hotels expanded in August and September when compared to last year, which provided a tailwind to our third quarter gross bookings. Outside of our hotel business, we also saw a strong recovery in our air business, driven by growth in multi-item packages and improvement in air prices. And we also saw a continued acceleration at Vrbo, which returned to modest growth on the quarter. Revenue of $4.1 billion grew 3% versus last year, led by our B2B business, Brand Expedia and our advertising business. Excluding FX, however, revenue growth in the quarter would have been 5%. In addition to FX, revenue growth was also impacted from pricing actions in prior quarters, which as a reminder, translate to contra revenue at the time of the stay. Third quarter revenue also saw pressure from soft Vrbo bookings in the first half of 2024, translating to stays in the third quarter. As a reminder, Vrbo has a longer booking window versus our hotel business, and the third quarter is the largest revenue quarter for Vrbo driven by summer stays. Total revenue margin was approximately 50 basis points lower year-over-year. The uplift from advertising growth was offset by all the previously mentioned impacts to revenue as well as the outperformance in air bookings, which is a lower margin business. Cost of sales was $385 million for the quarter and $24 million or 6% lower versus last year, which combined with higher revenue growth, drove approximately 90 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue year-over-year. We continue to see our ongoing initiatives deliver transactional efficiencies. Direct sales and marketing expense in the third quarter was $1.9 billion, which was up 11% versus last year. Sales and marketing deleverage as a percentage of gross bookings primarily due to higher commissions to our partners from the strong growth in our B2B business. As we have stated previously, commissions paid to our B2B partners are in our direct sales and marketing line and are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business. However, because they are generally paid on a state basis to contractually agreed upon percentages, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate. We also saw some deleverage in our B2C business as we reinvested back into Vrbo and our international markets to drive improving growth and global market expansion. Excluding these investments, we saw marketing leverage in our B2C business. Overhead expenses were $602 million, a decrease of $15 million versus last year or 3%. This resulted in approximately 90 basis points of leverage, primarily driven by lower people costs and product and tech from our actions to rationalize our head count as well as overall strong expense control. We remain committed to driving efficiencies across our P&L, and we're pleased to see another quarter of reduced costs and strong overhead leverage. On the bottom line, we delivered third quarter EBITDA of $1.25 billion, which was up 3% year-over-year with an EBITDA margin of 30.8%, slightly deleveraging approximately 16 basis points year-over-year. This was better than expected due to our effective expense management. As far as our EBIT performance, which includes the impact of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, we delivered $892 million of EBIT with a margin of 22%, deleveraging approximately 100 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter. This quarter's results included the accelerated vesting of our former Vice Chairman's RSUs, which drove a onetime $51 million increase in stock-based compensation. Excluding this acceleration, EBIT would have leveraged approximately 27 basis points year-over-year in this quarter. Our year-to-date free cash flow remained robust at $2.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher EBITDA and lower capital expenditures. Moving on to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $7.2 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $4.7 billion and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion. Our debt level remains at approximately $6.3 billion with an average cost of 3.7%. Our gross leverage ratio at a further reduced 2.2x continues to make progress towards our target gross leverage ratio of 2x driven by our ongoing strong EBITDA growth. In addition, our strong cash position enabled us to repurchase $1.6 billion or 12 million shares year-to-date. We continue to believe that our stock remains undervalued and does not reflect our expected long-term performance of the business. As such, we expect to utilize the strong cash generating power of our business to continue to buy back our stock opportunistically, and we have approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. We expect gross bookings growth in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 6% to 8% versus last year. The growth is higher relative to our prior expectations due to a more favorable outlook for our air business, which as a reminder, contributes more to bookings growth and less to revenue and earnings. As a result, we expect revenue growth to be about 1 point lower than our gross bookings growth, and we expect EBITDA and EBIT margins to be relatively in line with last year as we will continue to lean into our marketing investments in Vrbo and international markets. Moving now to full year 2024 outlook. Based on our strong third quarter results and our improved fourth quarter outlook, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect gross bookings growth to be approximately 5% versus last year, up 1 point relative to our prior outlook, and we now expect our EBITDA and EBIT margins to be slightly up versus last year, an improvement from our prior outlook of flat levels. And our revenue guidance remains at approximately 6% growth versus last year. In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, including the acceleration of our B2C business as well as the continued strong growth of B2B, Brand Expedia and advertising. Our ongoing execution against our growth initiatives, combined with our strong financial position, give us confidence in our long-term opportunity to deliver profitable growth and shareholder returns. Before I open the call for questions, I also want to extend a big thank you to our Expedia associates and partners for their ongoing dedication and support, which has enabled us to deliver these third quarter results and gives us the confidence to be able to deliver our full year results and beyond. And with that, let me open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Lee Horowitz of Deutsche Bank. Lee Horowitz : Julie, pleasure working with you. Maybe on marketing investments at Vrbo -- Vrbo ex common international markets. I guess how should we think about your ability to be able to deliver aggregate marketing leverage on a go forward? I know this year is a big investment year for those brands. But presumably, they're not back to the levels that you'd expect and you'll remain invested. Do you need these bids to get back to market level rates before you can perhaps deliver marketing leverage for the whole business? Julie Whalen : Yes. From a marketing leverage perspective, I mean, obviously, as we said, B2B sales and commissions are in that line. So that does put pressure given their level of growth on that line. But if you speak just a B2C business, ex those investments in Vrbo and international markets, we have seen leverage. So essentially, as we get those businesses back to where we need to get them, we expect to see that we'll be able to see some leverage going forward. Lee Horowitz : Great. Then Ariane, you're seeing really strong growth out of your Media Solutions with an acceleration this quarter against tougher comps. Maybe if you could just unpack what the driver is there? Is it pricing? Is it the expansion of the media network? Any understanding of what's driving that? And then maybe just framing up the opportunity of how large you see that business over time? What's the big opportunity? Where is the clear white space? Ariane Gorin : So on the growth, we have a sponsored listing business and the display business. On both of them, we've got a lot more partners that are participating, especially in sponsored listings. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've done quite a bit of work on making the sign-up process, easier doing sort of marketing activities to bring more partners into the auction. At the same time, as I mentioned, we're testing new things like video ads and the like, such that those ads are even more effective, which then translates to pricing. So I think there continues to be a big opportunity on sponsored listing and on display. And if you look at the advertising as a percentage of our overall revenue and compare to some other big retail companies, you can see that we've got quite a bit of white space in order to sort of grow that in the years to come. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Deepak Mathivanan : Maybe I'll start with Vrbo. Now that the business has kind of returned to modest growth, what is required to accelerate further and get the growth rates on par with the results that we're seeing from some of the alternative accommodations providers in there? And then second question, maybe for Ariane, I'm not sure if you're ready to comment about 2025. But maybe you can qualitatively discuss how we should think about kind of the cost side that's required to grow the business further and maybe the implications on margins for 2025? Ariane Gorin : Okay. Well, so on the Vrbo question, -- as we all know, Vrbo went through a migration at the end of last year, and that's why it had such a slow start to this year. And I would say the teams have been doing great work this year in adding the black product features, making the app faster, as I sort of described in my prepared remarks, doing work on supply, I would also call out, we have this great marketing campaign with Nick Saban in the last couple of months. Perhaps people saw it. It was a great performing campaign and drove a lot of conversion. As you think about Vrbo going forward, we need to continue that formula of continuing to improve the product, continuing to expand the supply and having great marketing. And as I mentioned, we've got some new supply that's in more urban destinations. I would say that we're underpenetrated in the markets that we're in internationally. So we have a new general manager who's in, who's running Vrbo, we're looking at what are the longer-term growth plans. So I'm confident that the basic formula we have right now layered on top of it where the market opportunity is, will be what will drive growth. And I'd just add one other thing, which is -- all the work that we're doing to sell vacation rentals well on Vrbo will also help us sell vacation rentals on Expedia. We've had so much going on in the last few years as a company that we haven't made a big concerted effort to sell vacation rentals well on Brand Expedia. And again, all the work on Vrbo on servicing, on communications and the like will then help us as we turn to that for Brand Expedia. Julie Whalen : And then as far as 2025, yes, we're not going to be providing any commentary on this call for that. We'll plan to give more updates on that for next call. But I would just say generally that we are very focused on both the top and the bottom line. And as you can see, we've done -- made incredible progress with getting cost out of -- cost of sales and overhead and we're going to continue with that as we move forward into next year. Obviously, top line revenue growth is a play on what will happen on the bottom line. But I think the biggest line, clearly, as everyone knows, is the marketing line. And so as we get these businesses back up to where they need to be, as the product starts to get optimized more and more, we should be able to drive more, repeat and direct behavior and, therefore, drive more marketing efficiencies as we've been seeing in Brand Expedia. Operator : Our next question comes from Trevor Young of Barclays. Trevor Young : First one, just back to Vrbo on the modest growth in the quarter. Can you just speak to the actual cadence throughout the quarter? It wasn't clear last quarter around whether July was still positive relative to the positive June exit rate. And then similarly for October, I think you had called out some of the increment weather issues. Was Vrbo still positive here at the start of 4Q? Julie Whalen : Yes, we're not going to give out sort of the monthly comps, if you will. But I think what the great thing is that we're seeing is that business is continuing to accelerate. So I mean as we move to the quarter, we definitely saw that business accelerate. I would say that certainly, when you are impacted by hurricanes and things that create some bumpiness in the results. But out of -- coming out of July, we saw incredible acceleration from that point Trevor. Trevor Young : That's helpful. And Ariane, maybe 1 bigger picture 1 for you. You\u2019re now roughly 6 months into this new role. Can you highlight 2 or 3 things that have been positive surprises to you and maybe a few things that stood out as maybe more challenging than you had anticipated when you first cut into the seat? Ariane Gorin : Sure. I think -- look, I obviously knew the B2B, the private label business and the advertising business and the supply part of the company quite well because I've been running those for a period of time. The consumer business, while I've been in the management team and I knew it well, that's the part that I've gotten much closer to in the last 6 months. On the positive is just how much passion and I would say, awareness and love there is for our 3 big brands, Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo. So that's sort of the positive surprise is just how much sort of love there is there. On the sort of what's been tougher is I think I appreciated all of the technology work that we've done on our platform, and it is really enabling us to innovate faster to have 1 customer identity and the like. But connecting that directly into the brand value propositions, we had done that quite well on Expedia, and I'm now appreciating just the work that we needed to do to get that into Hotels.com and Vrbo. And again, what's been wonderful to see is how quickly the organization and the brands are responding to that. And that's -- when I look at the acceleration we've had in the consumer business from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, it's seen those daily improvements and the way that we're connecting in our brands themselves, what the value proposition is, what the marketing is and what the product and platform can do that gives me real confidence in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : On the move to add 1 million rooms from Expedia to Vrbo. Just curious on what drove that outcome. And then as you think about additional supply going forward for Vrbo, is the urban market is something that you're focusing on a little bit more than before? And is there any difference in returns from that move? Ariane Gorin : Thanks for the question. So we took about 1 million units that had been listed on Expedia, and we moved them over to Vrbo. And these are -- this is inventory that's a little bit different from the other inventory that we had on Vrbo. So we've needed to figure out what's the right UX and design, what's the pattern for people shopping and discovering on them. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we've actually seen that, that's allowed us to go after a part of the market that's more urban, that's shorter stay than we've been in before. And -- it's true that historically, Vrbo has been a brand that has tended to be sort of beach and mountain and the like. And we think there's still opportunities for us to grow there, and we'll also be looking at where else can we grow. In terms of -- are there different returns? Again, it's early days for us in exploring that part of the inventory. But ultimately, what we want to do is make sure that people know the Vrbo brand, they understand that when they come to Vrbo, they're going to have whole homes and apartments. They won't have shared spaces, they\u2019ll get to redeem their One Key cash, and they'll have a full supply of whatever it is that they're looking for that we can fulfill for them. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Helpful. And then you talked about -- or you touched a little bit on just the attach rate of other travel products. Obviously, your competitor talks a lot about that. I was just curious if you could just unpack that strategy a little bit more. And where does that stack up on the priority list? And you obviously have a lot going on, but is it up on the top of where you think? Ariane Gorin : Thanks for the question. Selling multiple items in a trip is the core DNA of Brand Expedia. Brand Expedia is multi-line of business. So air, car, hotel, activities, cruise, is all of that. And so we have a long history of being able to attach, whether it's attaching when you start with 1 product and add another or doing the actual dynamic packaging at the same time. So I would say that's always been at the core of the strategy for Expedia. I highlighted the growth in our dynamic package travel, but also the multi-item attach is something we continue to work on. It's certainly improved over time, not only in the UX and the design, but also in the recommendations. So being able to personalize what's the next best thing to recommend to a traveler by category and also by item. So I guess I would just conclude by saying it is important to us. It's a core part of Brand Expedia. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan of B. Riley. Naved Khan : So Ariane, you shared a stat with us about 150 basis point improvement in the repeat rates for One Key users. How does that compare versus your own sort of expectations when you sort of launched this program last year? And what are the things that you control to kind of drive further improvement from these levels? So that's one question. The other one I had is on B2B, maybe just -- it's seeing really strong growth. Just give us a sense of what the pipeline here, it looks like that can continue to drive the strong traction? Ariane Gorin : Yes. So I'd say on One Key, right? It's been -- we launched it in the summer of '23. So we've been pleased with the results so far. I shared some of the stats in my prepared remarks. I'd say we're especially pleased with our tiered member deals, so the silver, gold and platinum members. They're available everywhere, but we're seeing that, that's about 30% of our travelers, but 50% of our room nights. We also, when we launched One key, we're looking for cross-sell across our brands. And as I shared last quarter, 30% of travelers who are redeeming their One Key cash on Vrbo after earning it on the other brands are actually net new to Vrbo. So that's great that we're seeing. And finally, I'd say the One Key technology is giving us capabilities that we didn't have before. So things like gifting One Key cash that has an expiry date, which allows us to be more promotional in order to sort of drive purchases in a short window. At the same time that there's been a lot of positives, we're continuing to work to tune the value proposition by brand and by geography. So for example, I said on Vrbo, we know that 1Q is driving new travelers, but we're still assessing the impact of Vrbo earn on traveler shopping decisions every day. So the One Key program, obviously, as Julie talked through it, it's in our contra revenue. And we are interrogating the spend on loyalty in the same way that we do our marketing spend and the like and making sure that we're able to tune the program. And the good news is the way the technology is built, allows us to configure it. So that's what I would say for One Key. On the question about B2B. As you said, we had another strong quarter at 19% growth, only 1 point down from last quarter. And the B2B business has a massive market, we can work with corporate travel agencies, off-line travel agencies, online travel agencies, financial institutions that have their own loyalty programs. So it's true the last set of quarters, it's grown at a very elevated rate. Some of that was Asia that was really coming back. We believe in this business. We believe it will continue to be healthy double-digit rates, even if perhaps not at the elevated levels that we've seen. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Austin Riddick : This is Austin Riddick, actually speaking for Mark Mahaney. Congrats on the quarter. We would just love to hear your thoughts on the U.S. alternative accommodations market, particularly as it relates to the recent regulatory updates coming out of California, Hawaii, et cetera? And do you think if these are basically one-off situations or the sort of a broader trend? Ariane Gorin : So I would just say all that, but we work with local government to make sure that obviously we're abreast of the regulations. We're taking those into consideration. I think there's always a balance between the contribution to the local economy and following the regulations. But we believe there's a big market out there for alternative accommodations, just like there is for hotels and the like, and that's not impacting our view of our growth potential. Operator : Our next question comes from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : You mentioned integrating Vrbo with Brand Expedia. Can you talk about the opportunity to integrate Vrbo with B2B? And then I didn't hear a mention of Hotels.com. Can you give us an update on how that's performing since you've sort of replatformed the loyalty program outside the U.S. and the U.K.? Ariane Gorin : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. On Vacation Rentals, as I said, yes, we are -- we already have some vacation rental inventory on Expedia, and we think there's a bigger opportunity. On B2B, we do have a few partners who are using our vacation rental inventory. As you can imagine, on selling vacation rentals, there is some complexity that is different from hotels. Requirements on communication between the traveler and the owner, for example. And so we're testing it. We want to make sure that we're going to be able to deliver a great traveler experience to our B2B partners\u2019 travelers and to our hosts and owners. So I do see that as an opportunity in the long term. If you ask me on the list of priorities that our B2B business is going after, is this at the top, probably not. But in the long term, this is a real opportunity for us. In terms of Hotels.com, I'd start by reminding us this is a brand that has very strong brand recognition and a large customer base. The performance in Q3 was stable, but it hasn't returned to growth. And this was a brand that was very impacted by our migration, by our change in loyalty program and our international pullback. Now as we are going back into international, Hotels.com is benefiting. And we've got a new general manager in place who's looking at this with a fresh set of eyes, and I'm really excited about what he's going to do with the brand in the quarters to come. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of TD Securities. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] in for Kevin. You mentioned the hurricane impact in October, but can you talk more about quarter-to-date trends and what you're seeing across your consumer brands? And maybe give color on your efforts to regain share in international markets? Julie Whalen : Yes. We definitely saw an impact in October from Hurricane Milton. But I would say that it's material, but not anything that we thought it would be originally. So it came in better than our expectations. And the reality is that if you take things out of the picture for things like the hurricane for the election, et cetera, we are actually seeing the underlying health of the business being really strong. So we're excited to see those as we've entered into the fourth quarter. Ariane Gorin : And then on international, as we said last quarter, we're being surgical. We're looking market-by-market, understanding which of our brands has brand strength there. And then going in with the full funnel market plan -- sorry, a marketing plan in order to start to regain share, but we're being quite surgical about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Post of Bank of America. Anthony Post : I apologize, it's been asked already. But I wanted to get into selling and marketing. I know B2B is a big contributor there. But when you back that out, -- how do you think about your efficiencies versus competitors? And are there costs that you think you can take out of there over the long term? Julie Whalen : Yes. I mean, I would say that, that is an opportunity for us. I think Ariane has said in the past that we want to interrogate every line, and so it is something that we're looking at. And we are delivering efficiencies. I think, obviously, as we've said, we've been investing at the same time back into Vrbo and international markets. And if you exclude that, investment, we are actually seeing efficiencies, particularly in Brand Expedia. And so this is more about us sort of getting the flywheel back on these other businesses getting back to where they need to be, and we think we have an incredible opportunity to be able to deliver more efficiencies when that happens. At the same time, we need to be optimizing the product, the supply and putting all of that together for these businesses to be able to deliver value to the traveler that encourages them to return to our sites as repeat behavior and direct. And so when that starts to happen is when we'll also start to see some of that leverage. But it's certainly something that we are laser focused on going forward. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions. So I'll turn the call over to CEO, Ariane Gorin, for any further remarks. Ariane Gorin : So thank you all for your questions today. I'm very pleased with our Q3 results. We remain focused on accelerating growth in our consumer business, ensuring our B2B business remains industry-leading and leveraging our unified tech platform to drive more innovation. We have a strong foundation in place to drive sustainable, profitable growth, and I'm confident that we'll continue to create value for our travelers, partners and shareholders. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Ariane Gorin : Thanks, Harshit. And thank you all for joining us today. I want to start by welcoming Scott Schenkel as our new CFO. It's great to have him on board, you'll hear from him shortly. Our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations. With room nights, gross bookings, and revenue all growing double digits. This top-line strength reflects our continued strong execution, along with better than expected travel demand. Our disciplined cost management and top-line outperformance resulted in strong EBITDA growth with margin expansion. Bookings for the consumer business accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to 9%, up five points sequentially. Each of our core brands, Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, saw bookings growth. Our B2B business had a stellar quarter. With bookings growth increasing five points sequentially to 24%. And our advertising business posted yet another strong quarter with 25% revenue growth. Travel demand remained healthy in Q4 despite price increases in hotels, vacation rentals, and air. Like last quarter, international demand was stronger than the US, with booked room nights growing high single digits in the US low double digits in Europe, and high teens in the rest of the world. Our B2B business continues to benefit from this strong international demand, especially in APAC. And in our consumer business, our global expansion efforts continue to show solid progress. With bookings growth outside the US accelerating four points sequentially. Within our consumer business, Brand Expedia remains strong with room nights growing mid-teens. Air on Expedia notably improved driven by higher ticket prices, continued package product improvements, and new merchandising capabilities. For Hotels.com, bookings returned to slight growth driven by momentum in international markets. And for Vrbo, bookings growth accelerated sequentially as well. With improved traffic and conversion. Global active membership in our loyalty program grew 7% in Q4. And our twelve-month member repeat rate was also up over 300 basis points year over year. Across our three core brands, nearly 50% of room nights came from silver, gold, or platinum members. These higher-tier members receive additional benefits such as member discounts. Which are funded by our supply partners and help to drive loyalty to our brands. Our strong fourth quarter results contributed to a solid full year 2024. When I stepped in as CEO last year, we set an ambition to bring Vrbo and Hotels.com back to growth while extending our strengths in Brand Expedia, B2B, and advertising, and being disciplined in our costs. While we have more work ahead, I'm proud of how our teams delivered against this call to action and built momentum over the course of the year. Bookings growth in our consumer business accelerated every quarter in 2024. From negative 3% in Q1 to 9% in Q4. B2B bookings grew 21% for the full year. We've grown bookings from existing partners through strong account management, great inventory, and new product features, and had our best year ever in production from New Parkins. Overall, B2B accounted for 27% of our bookings last year, and we've cemented our leadership here. Our advertising business or sorry. Our advertising revenue grew 32% in 2024 and drove 5% of our overall revenue. We onboarded more advertisers to our platform, launched new ad types like video, and introduced new tools for partners to manage their campaigns, all of which are resonating strongly with our advertisers. As a reminder, advertising is a high margin, high growth business. And we see a lot more opportunity to innovate. Supply is at the heart of our business. And we made great strides last year in improving our supply through technology investments, stronger partner relationships, and everyday efforts from our commercial teams. We're sourcing more traveler benefits, whether through member deals package discounts. We've released new functionality around merchandising, have improved the quality of our vacation rental supply. All of these are great for travelers, delivering valuable and targeted demand to our supply partners. As we move into 2025, we have three overarching priorities. Building on our progress from 2024. First, deliver more value for travelers. Second, invest where we see the greatest opportunity to drive growth in each part of our business. And third, continue driving operating efficiencies and expanding our margin. I'll share more color on each and then talk about how AI will help us across all three. Let's start with our first priority of delivering more value for traveler. Already today. We create effortless, personalized, and rewarding experiences for customers. We do this through our supply, which deals travelers can only get through us and bundles and savings that we can uniquely create. We also do it through our industry-leading customer service, and innovative products and features that travelers want. And in 2025, we're going to do even more. In supply, more member rates beyond hotels and more targeted offers. In servicing, more self-service options both in the product flows and in the virtual agent experience. And, of course, in product. All powered by deep insights and data that enable personalized experiences that travelers trust. Moving next to our second priority, We'll invest where we see the greatest opportunity to drive growth in each part of our business. In our consumer business, this means focusing on our three biggest brands, having clear sharp value propositions for each of them. For Expedia, for example, that's building on our strength as a one-stop shop and focusing on differentiators like packages, while scaling newer products like vacation rentals. Harshit Vaish : Our consumer business is still heavily weighted to the US, Ariane Gorin : And while we made progress in 2024, looking ahead, we'll continue to push internationally in a targeted way. In our loyalty program and marketing, we'll be even more targeted in our spending. For example, looking deeply at where we see the biggest impact from our loyalty earn. And in B2B, it's about forcing unique supply for our B2B partners, testing new products, and signing new deals, and deepening our commercial partnerships. And finally, our third priority is to continue driving operational efficiencies and expanding our margins. We were disciplined in our cost management in 2024. And that allowed us to expand profit margins while reinvesting in strategic areas. We believe we still have room to deliver further efficiencies across our variable costs and fixed cost base. To expand our margins even farther. AI is an accelerator for all three of these we've only scratched the surface. As we look ahead, we're exploring the many ways AI will unlock even more value in our product. We're already seeing evidence of how AI is driving better experience across the discovery, shopping, and post-booking journey. In turn are driving loyalty and growth. Going forward, we'll continue to test and release AI-generated features to further personalize our traveler experience. AI also opens new possibilities to drive traffic to our brands as consumers increasingly search in new Gen AI native Experiences. And we're ensuring that we meet them where they are. And for our B2B business, the AI the AI native travel startups that will inevitably emerge present new partnership opportunities for. Finally, we see tremendous opportunity to use AI to allow our teams to move faster and be more productive. It's not just about cost reduction. What's even more exciting is how it will enable our teams to spend more time where they can have the biggest impact. Ariane Gorin : We're excited about the potential Ariane Gorin : and are seeing early results across customer support, technology, marketing, and our commercial teams. Really across all parts of how we operate our business. So in closing, we're pleased with our fourth quarter performance and the momentum we've built over 2024. And we believe that in 2025 and beyond, we have a substantial opportunity to drive even greater value for our travelers, Partners. And shareholders. With that, Scott Shankel : over to you, Scott. Thank you, Ariane, and good afternoon, everyone. Scott Shankel : I'm excited to join Expedia Group, and I look forward to partnering with you and the team to help deliver our priorities. Let's get started. Wrapped 2024 with a strong fourth quarter, both financially across many of the operating metrics. Room nights, gross bookings, and revenue all grew double digits with EBITDA margins expanding nicely. Total gross bookings was $24.4 billion grew 13% with a five-point sequential acceleration in both B2C and B2B. With a better than expected demand environment and strong operational execution. We had a particularly strong post-Thanksgiving promotional window where bookings during this period were the our highest ever. Lodging gross bookings grew 12%. Which includes our hotel business growing 14%. And and continued acceleration at Vrbo. Outside of our lodging business, we also saw notable strength in our air business, driven by higher air prices, growth in multi-item packages, our new merchandising capabilities. Revenue of $3.2 billion grew 10% led by our B2B business, which grew 21%. Revenue growth accelerated seven points from the third quarter primarily driven by Vrbo's bookings momentum throughout the year translating into stays and further improvement into Hotels.com. Gross margin was nearly 90% for the quarter, up 125 basis points. We are pleased to see our ongoing initiatives continue to deliver transactional efficiencies particularly in customer service. Direct sales and marketing Up 13%. Leading to flat leverage as a percent of gross bookings. This was over 20 basis points of sequential improvement driven by continued efficiencies at Brand Expedia. As I noted earlier, Brand Expedia did benefit from the merchandising as they resulted in bookings without any incremental marketing expenses. Overhead expenses were $643 million. A decrease of 1% resulting in nearly 250 basis points of leverage. This was primarily driven by lower people cost in products and technology, from our actions in 2024 as well as overall strong expense control. We remain committed to driving efficiencies across our P and L and we're pleased to see another quarter of strong overhead leverage. We delivered fourth quarter EBITDA of $643 million up 21% with an EBITDA margin of 20.2% an expansion of 175 basis points. This was better than expected due to both the higher revenue growth and effective expense management. We delivered $338 million of EBIT with a margin of 10.6% up 280 basis points. This was a hundred and fifth a hundred and five basis points greater than EBITDA margin expansion. Driven by lower stock-based comp And ongoing depreciation leverage. Turning to the full year results. We posted gross bookings of $111 billion Ariane Gorin : up 7% Scott Shankel : and revenue of nearly $14 billion also up 7%. Underpinned by a notable recovery throughout the year in our B2C business and continued strength in B2B our advertising business. While we decided to invest in market to accelerate our B2C business, we feel that was net beneficial to the business, and we paid for this by being financially disciplined driving gross margin improvement of 170 basis points and overhead of approximately 140 basis points. As a result, EBITDA margin for the year was 21.4% an expansion of approximately 60 basis points. This strong earnings growth enabled us to generate another year of robust free cash flow at $2.3 billion up 26%. Driven primarily by higher EBITDA growth in deferred merchant bookings, and lower capital expenditures. Moving to our balance sheet. With the strong cash flow ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. In late January, we notified the holders of our May 25 debt tranche that we will pay those notes in February. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet with the goal of maintaining debt levels consistent with our current investment grade rating. As a result and subject to market conditions, we intend to refinance and maintain our target leverage ratio of two times. As part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we repurchased $1.6 billion or 12.1 million shares in 2024. This combined with the shares we have repurchased since we reinstated the program a little over two years ago, as a result in over $4 billion or 36 million shares repurchase. So in summary, a solid year with a strong Q4 finish. Moving to our first quarter guidance. We expect our first quarter gross bookings growth to be in the 4% to 6% range, and and revenue growth to be 3% to 5%. This reflects approximately two points of foreign exchange headwind at current rates and the impact from lapping leap year and in revenue, the Easter shift to April. In Q1, we expect EBITDA margin to be flat to slightly better year over year, As a reminder, the first quarter is our lowest EBITDA quarter causing margins to be highly sensitive. Moving to the full year guide. We expect our 2025 gross bookings and revenue growth in the 4% to 6% range which is roughly in line with 2024. Factoring in the two points of negative FX impact. On the bottom line, we will continue to optimize our cross track to deliver efficiencies. And as a result, we expect to deliver another record year of EBITDA with margin expansion of 50 basis points year over year. With strong performance on EBITDA and cash flow, we will continue to buy back our stock opportunistically approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Additionally, today, we note we announced that we are reinstating our quarterly dividend starting in March of 2025 with a dividend of 40 cents per share which is approximately a 1% annual dividend yield. So in closing, we remain focused on delivering long-term profitable growth while being disciplined capital allocators. I'm confident with our strategies for growth and and strong ongoing execution, we will continue to deliver shareholder returns in 2025 and beyond. Let me now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Keypad. If you'd like to remove your question, you may press star followed by two. Our first question for today comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Thanks. I just want to ask about, Vrbo and Mark Mahaney : Hotels.com, the recovery that you've seen, the improvement recovery for HCOM and and the ongoing improvement for for Vrbo. Just just talk about the sustainability of those into next year. What were the what were the initiatives that you think really started turning those businesses around so help us to have confidence that that that's gonna continue into 25. Thank you very much. Scott Shankel : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with Vrbo. Harshit Vaish : You. Ariane Gorin : We did a lot of work in 2024 on product supply, and marketing. And that all three of those drove the acceleration through the year, and I do want to take a minute to thank the teams for that because it was it was a big task to do it. We are cognizant of the fact though that Vrbo you know, Vrbo with Hotels.com was meaningfully disrupted during the replatforming. And we lost travelers that were still winning back. On product, we put back some features that we had lost You know, Vrbo also benefited from some of the platform capabilities like dateless search or property comparison, but we chain supply in particular, and we've got some exciting plans coming in in 2025 around both of those. So I would just say, especially on product and supply, we know there's more work ahead. We're gonna continue leaning in we see the best returns and pulling back where the returns aren't as strong. When it comes to Hotels.com, you know, that one was also that brand was also pretty meaningfully impacted with not only the tech migration, but also the change in the loyalty program. And pulling back in international. You as I said, we we you have come back to modest growth at the end of the year. And the team has some big plans around really reinvigorating that brand that we'll see come to life in 2025. So I would say all up, we've got conviction in these two brands. We know there's still a bunch more work to do, but we feel good about where we are right now. Scott Shankel : Okay. Operator : You very much. Ariane Gorin : Thanks. Scott Shankel : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Operator : Line's now open. Please go ahead. Ariane Gorin : Great. Thank you. Looks like Q1 guidance has some decent Mark Mahaney : could you talk about and other issues. Any any headwinds early Q1 that that you're thinking about And then just longer term on margins, you know, fifty bps know, nice improvement year over year, but but where you are versus peers, it looks like there's a lot of room there. How how are you thinking about you know, longer term and and what you can do with margins versus your peers? Thank you. Scott Shankel : Let me start with that Q1 guide. First off, You know, as I said in my script, the the bookings growth is four four to six percent. Factoring in two points of FX headwind. And about a point lapping leap year So, you know, if you look at that, that's roughly seven to nine percent. Excluding those two realities. Yeah. When when nothing appears to be travel environment to your question, We have seen some softening relative to Q4, which was strong as we pointed out. And our latest guide reflects that. And in light of strong some strong holiday promotions in December, we also believe there may be some there might have been some pull ins of some of the January bookings. So we think all of that kinda brings us to the the four to six percent. We feel pretty good about that. Pivot to revenue growth, just to kinda close out the point, I'm sure Our guide at three to five percent reflects some some added pressure from lapping last year. In particular the Easter timing shift. So you take three to five percent plus two point foreign exchange plus a point from leave here and roughly a point from Easter. Where the where the kind of rate very equivalent to last year is the way we think about it. Maybe I'll take a shot at margins Look, I think a half a point of margin in two thousand twenty four And a half a point in margin in twenty five, a nice one point is a good start. And I think we're we're doing it in a way that balances growth, make sure that we we we handle what we need to with marketing and make sure that we keep traffic and the demand up. And we balance the the forward looking needs for overhead and make sure we take reduce that. And I think you've seen both in two thousand twenty four and twenty five overhead come down and realized some nice leverage in the cost structure. Alright. I don't know if if you know anything else. Thanks, Justin. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Line is now open. Please go ahead. Scott Shankel : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Arian, just wanted to dig Harshit Vaish : little bit deeper into the B2B side. What's driving the strength in APAC? Can you also talk about kinda, like, the roadmap of new partnerships and what would be the primary growth drivers as we think about 2025 for the B2B business. And then, Scott, great to hear from you again. Deepak Mathivanan : Maybe I'll just ask you to expand a little bit on the margin comment You know, last year, you guys had cost saving efforts that helped with margin expansion. This year, you know, whether you should still see fixed cost leverage, But what is the high level strategy beyond, you know, achieving fixed cost leverage? Maybe also in terms of how you're thinking about marketing investments and so on. Any color you can add about different line items that should help with the leverage would be super helpful. Operator : Thanks again. Ariane Gorin : Yeah. Thanks, Deepak. So on on B2B, the couple of things that are driving the strength in APAC is one, Yep. The partnerships that we have there, we're adding new partnerships We have some deep long standing partnerships. And fact that the markets there are growing well, so the partners that we're working with r Growing in line or faster than the market, and we're able to win share with them. So typically, what we do is you'll sign a partner, You'll have you'll get some of their business, and then over time, as you deepen the relationship, as we put in place sort of new new strategies with them, we're able to windshield. So that's really what's going on in APAC. And then in terms of B2B for this year, as I said, it's really a formula of Yeah. What can we do with our existing partners as they are growing You know, what new inventory can we put in with them? You know, where can we have our inventory surface more? It's also signing new partners and testing you know, we're gonna be testing some new product In market. I also wanna make sure everyone understands the importance of supply. The quality of our supply is so critical in growing that B2B business, and you we've over the last couple of years, done a lot of work in being able to get some supply that is particularly relevant to some of our B2B partners. Just on the margins, maybe I can pick it up for Scott as well, is we're we're not gonna break out the different pieces, but clearly, we see opportunities in a number of places We just wanna make sure that we maintain the ability to invest in the areas that we see good long term growth. During 2024, we talked a number of times about how we were leaning in international markets, we were leaning into Vrbo, maybe in ways where it wasn't as, you know, good a short term return as we might get elsewhere. But we we believe we need to have that ability to balance sort of investment for the long term and also, you know, remain committed and disciplined in our margin expansion. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thank you very much. Ariane Gorin : Thanks, Deepak. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan of B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Harshit Vaish : Great. Thank you very much. Deepak Mathivanan : So I remember you guys added some inventory of to verbal. I think it was apartment type of inventory. Or roughly a million properties. Wondering if you have any any color to provide in terms of how that Harshit Vaish : that inventory performing relative to expectations? And as you think about 2025, is that the type of inventory you're will try to kind of add to Vrbo or or it would be more of call homes. Deepak Mathivanan : And the second question I have is really just around the Harshit Vaish : the advertising revenue. So this 25% growth really is strong, and wondering how sustainable that is into into 25. Deepak Mathivanan : Thank you. Harshit Vaish : Yep. Ariane Gorin : Okay. Thanks for the question. On the Vrbo inventory, as you said, we added a million properties. These were a lot in urban areas. They're always properties that aren't shared spaces that have no host. There there were a number of apartments. And, you know, I'm not gonna say specifically how they're doing other than to say that you know, did contribute to, you know, Vrbo's recovery. As we look to supply in 25, it's not only about adding new supply, but also how do we make sure that the supply that we have you know, has flexibility, has great cancel policies, has maybe longer you know, different promotions and the like. So you know, when we think quality of supply, it's not only in the number of properties, but it's also in know, rate types and flexibility. In terms of ad revenue, you're right that the last multiple quarters, we've been growing that very quickly. You know, we still see a lot of road ahead. Whether it's getting more advertisers into our products, into our auctions, because, you know, we work with tens of thousands of hotels and other partners around the world. Whether it's innovation in the products themselves, so that, you know, the advertisers are getting better returns and we're able to monetize, or new ad types in our brands. So the team has quite a road map ahead. And, you know, they're very focused on driving more value to our partners and also doing it in a way that's positive for our travelers. Deepak Mathivanan : Thank you, Aiden. Ariane Gorin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Trevor Young of Barclays. Line is now open. Scott Shankel : Great. Thanks. Ariane, in the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned Trevor Young : potentially partnering in AI. You expand on that? And you know, do you view using some of those applications as a potential customer acquisition channel, for Expedia. Whether you'd be a supply partner for them, And then, relatedly, you know, does that shape how you think about some of the investments in Romy AI and other AI capabilities in house? And then second question with us, Bigar getting or potentially getting acquired, any thoughts on how that changes your outlook for Laban and your partnership there? Ariane Gorin : Yep. Thank you for the question. Yep. I would say in AI, I would really think about it sort of in in three buckets. The first bucket is how are we using AI to make our products better? Whether it's for travelers or for partners. And we've we've been doing it for a couple of years. There's obviously a lot more to go. But we need to make sure that when travelers come into our brands, a, they wanna start there with their search, and they're getting a delightful experience that makes them wanna come back. Same thing with our partners, whether it's through onboarding or, you know, things we're doing in advertising. How do we use all of the great developments in AI in our products? The second is looking at changing traveler behaviors. You know, as I, you know, remarks, you know, travelers are going to start to search in different ways. And so we need to make sure that know, our brands are showing up in those new places where people are using Gen AI native search. And, you know, fortunately, we've got a very Tech sophisticated marketing team that's making sure that we do show up there. And then there's the question of if there are these native AI travel start ups Could we go partner with them, and can we go power them? And that's why to me, if I think about all three of those, we see opportunities across the board. We wanna make sure that we're really on the front foot. And, of course, in all of that, I'm not even talking about how are we using AI for our internal uses. In terms of Latin America and Despergar, I would say it doesn't change our perspective on LatAm. You know, Despergar is a great partner for us. We have our own brands in LatAm, and and, yeah, we have a number of partnerships there as well. Scott Shankel : Great. Thank you. Ariane Gorin : Thanks, Trevor. Harshit Vaish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Line's now open. Please go ahead. Scott Shankel : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Think you saw some nice leverage on the marketing side. Could you just talk about the the the tact changes that you're making there and just you know, if that's aiding in in just, like, underlying growth in international markets and whatnot. And then I think you mentioned in in the prepared remarks just merchandising and better cross selling of product. Can you talk about that a little bit more? How's bundling, you know, been, and and, you know, what's your expectation for that in the twenty five in general? Thank you. Ariane Gorin : Yep. Thanks for the question. Just on on marketing, we've talked over the last, I think, year and a half about how we've been looking at marketing loyalty and our sort of promotional spend look at all three of those together to say where are we getting the best returns and which of those works the best in which place. And the teams are getting more sophisticated on understanding that understanding those returns both by brand and by geo. So I would say it's not really a tactical change. I mean, it's just it's continuing down that path of better understanding returns and being able to to to act. Decisively when we see things. And can expect more of that in the year to come. Yep. Some of the international growth also came from work we've done in packages. I've talked about sort of you know, work on the package product, also on promotions. So And some countries tend to be more package heavy countries than others. So that's helped us in the growth. We do see that when travelers buy multiple items, from us they're more likely to repeat. And so we know that we give travelers a great deal when they buy a package from us, or when they, you know, buy one thing and then add something else on. So they're getting a good deal and we know that it drives repeat for us. So that would say, has been in the Expedia brand's DNA. Thanks. The beginning, is something we continue to lean into. Scott Shankel : Appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks. Bye bye. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Hey. Great. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Deepak Mathivanan : Two, if I may. Just just looking at your full year guidance for twenty five, one would assume it implies some type of deceleration in your B2B segment. So can you just give us an update, you know, how we should think about B2B in twenty five? Then I was a little surprised. You're saying your margins are gonna be flat in one Q. I figured you were comping last year where you pulled back on some purple advertising in one Q. Scott Shankel : So can you just give us an update on how you're viewing your advertising around verbal? Thank you. Ariane Gorin : Sure. Why don't I take take that and then you weigh in? Scott Shankel : The first off, like we talked about, FX is a headwind for the year as well. So if you index off the revenue growth, I'll start there. At three to five percent. You got two points ahead when from from the foreign exchange. Got a little for Q1, and you have a little bit of an Easter shift as well from from the comping of Easter in in really getting pushed out to to the second quarter. So that pressures revenue as well. So you're really looking at a range factoring in those three items to seven to nine percent, roughly just fill it out. So, yes, the deceleration, but some of that we're factoring in is really driven by some of the dynamics that we talked about with regards to seeing what we've seen in the first few weeks of January. So without rehashing that, we factored that into the guide You were gonna say something? And then I was just gonna add on the Vrbo question. It was really in Q4 three. Ariane Gorin : That we pulled back significantly in the advertising on Vrbo because that was the time that we were going through the migration. So that just Scott Shankel : Alright. And margin wise, you're roughly flat. Think what's well, it's leaving enough room for us to make sure that we can redeploy marketing as we talked about very much in line with what Arian just said a minute ago. As well as continue to get the leverage out of overhead and some of the other cost buckets but leaving room for the for the investment as we see fit to drive growth. Harshit Vaish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Great. Thanks so much for taking the time. May you know, Scott Shankel : maybe one on margin. Appreciating you guys, you know, won't break out the pieces of the margin guide. I know in the past, we've obviously talked a lot about marketing leverage. Can you maybe help us understand if you expect to get marketing leverage in twenty five? Is that an input to that fifty bps margin? Or are there other sort of areas of fixed and variable cost efficiencies that can drive this kind of margin? No. I think to reflect a roughly half a point, we're not gonna have margin expansion for the year. We're not gonna get into the different line items. We'll explain them as we go through the year. Operator : But I appreciate the question and understand why you're looking for that. Scott Shankel : Okay. No worries. And then then maybe just on Vrbo, any comments you know, obviously, pointing towards a little bit of a slowdown in the 1Q relative to a strong 4Q. Any comments on Vrbo quarter to date trends? And maybe just like your outlook for for where Vrbo can grow sort of longer term. Particularly relative to a market that, you know, is maybe growing low to mid single digits. Deepak Mathivanan : Do you think you guys can outpace the market for quite some time? And what do you see as the key differentiators to do that? Harshit Vaish : Yeah. So and we're not gonna give sort of Ariane Gorin : directional guidance on on one of the brands, but I can say is, you know, we believe that Vrbo has a differentiated value proposition of being, you know, a vacation rental pure play. Where there's no host and it's whole homes. Again, we recognize that know, there it it hasn't know, had some of the investments or some of the investments whether it's in product supply and the like until last year. And, you know, we believe that there's there's a lot of gross that we can get from it. At the same time, I would argue we're still testing what are the things that work the best, whether it's around marketing spend, the loyalty program, You know, we're learn we've learned a lot in the last year in particular regarding the loyalty program us what are the returns from various things. So I think you will find in the year to come That a, we'll continue to be investing in the brand, as I said, across marketing supply and product. And that will make decisions based on what we need to do in order to grow grow it. But we completely have conviction. Deepak Mathivanan : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of TD Securities. Operator : Line is now open. Please go ahead. Scott Shankel : Great. Thanks a lot. And, Scott, Mark Mahaney : congrats on the start. Deepak Mathivanan : Yeah. I just wanted to ask you about capital returns philosophy. Mark Mahaney : If you can give us any more color on first, I guess, how you're thinking about share repurchases your philosophy there. And then with the re institution of the dividend, how you're thinking about the size of that dividend over time, and where it falls with your capital returns. Thanks. Scott Shankel : Yeah. Absolutely. Let me just start with the basics around capital allocation. So we talked about in the script about repaying some of the debt. And we plan to refinance that if market conditions are favorable. So we'll remain committed to the target leverage ratio of of two times. Buybacks specific to those, we remain a capital it remains a capital allocation that a priority for us. In twenty four alone, as I covered, we we bought back twelve million shares. For a billion six. And while the pace of these buybacks can vary quarter to quarter, With over three billion remaining in our current repurchase authorization, we'll continue to be Specific to Dividends what I'd say is let's start with forty cents and let's see how the how things progress from there. Obviously, part of this is making sure that we have a dividend for income investors that wanna be invested in our stock and thresholds. So it's really important that we do that. And it was important for us as a company as we think about having to have turned off dividend during the the during COVID to bring it back is important for our shareholders and our overall capital allocation methodology. And thought process. And and then I think it's also important you know, we have room in our capital structure to invest in the business, including m and a if the opportunity opportunities present themselves. So it's it's important to keep that flexibility. I think with a really strong stock buyback, with the with the the allocation that we have, a strong dividend coming out of the gate of one percent we feel pretty good about where we're gonna go and what we're doing. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. That's really helpful. And just maybe a follow-up on your comment there. With kind of the core consumer brands Operator : doing better Mark Mahaney : does that change the way that Expedia is thinking about larger acquisitions and whether it would be a time to to add another brand into the fold Scott Shankel : Look. I think look. I'm coming in new here, but I think any time a company is at our scale and our our our technology base. Should be in the market and looking at m and a. And I think they've been and will continue to be I don't know if, Arianne, you have any other I mean, like you said, we obviously we have a team that's that's looking at deals. Ariane Gorin : Right now, we're continuing to be focused on running the brands that we have growing the B2B business, the advertising business, and continuing to have strong returns. Deepak Mathivanan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Anmer from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Scott Shankel : Great. This is Deane on for Doug. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First one, could you share your views on the overall travel Deepak Mathivanan : demand in four Q? I think two It's only twenty five travel season. And if there were any particular regions in four Q or you might have been taking share, and any impact from the appreciation in the US dollars. And then secondly, we're curious if you have any update as well on your loyalty strategy in twenty twenty twenty five, particularly in markets of tomatoes. The US and UK. Ariane Gorin : Sorry. Can you repeat that last? I didn't hear the last bit. Deepak Mathivanan : So we're curious about your you have any updated thoughts on your loyalty strategy. In twenty twenty five, particularly in the markets outside of the US. And the UK? Operator : Okay. Ariane Gorin : Yep. Thank you. So just in terms of the travel environment, as we said, the travel environment was very healthy in the fourth quarter. And while we've seen some softening in January relative to Q4, as I said, you know, some of it we think is is pull forwards from the strong Thanksgiving promotions, There was FX pressure. There's some moderation in prices, but we don't think anything has structurally changed and that the environment is healthy. In terms of regions where we're taking share, I shared in my prepared remarks that our room night growth was higher in international markets than in the US, and we believe that a number of those markets, we are taking share. In terms of the impact from the stronger dollar, obviously, as Scott, you know, Scott shared the impact of that on our guidance, But what it also means is that over time, stronger dollar Makes it more attractive for Americans traveling abroad. And whenever there are opportunities around that, our teams are always looking at how can we help travelers understand when there are good deals for them. In terms of our loyalty strategy in twenty five outside of the US and UK, As you all may know, we paused the rollout of OneKey after the UK. And so what our teams are now working on is taking the learnings we've had from One Key, where we know that it's been a net positive for Expedia. It's been a drag on bookings for Hotels.com. And for Vrbo, it's driven new travelers from cross sell, from people who have earned On expedienthotels.com. Then redeeming on Vrbo, but we're still assessing the impact of the always on earn on Vrbo So we're gonna take all of those learnings and then look by brand and by geography we need to do in loyalty. We'll share more in the year to come. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Operator : At this time, we'll take no further questions. So I'll hand back to CEO, Ariane Gorin, but any Further remarks. Ariane Gorin : So thank you all for joining us today, and we appreciate the questions. We closed the year with a strong fourth quarter and solid full year results. Looking ahead, we're focused on our three priorities, of delivering more value for travelers, investing where we see the greatest opportunities, rev growth, and expanding our margins. And I'd like to close by thanking our team for their work and dedication behalf of travelers and partners all around the world. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for joining today's call.
