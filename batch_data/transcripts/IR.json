In the first quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.27, which includes $0.02 of restructuring, translating to adjusted EPS of $0.29. That's $0.01 above the top of our earnings guidance range and a 32% increase versus the first quarter of 2013. Revenues were $2.7 billion up 3% versus last year. Revenues were consistent with our guided revenue range of up 2% to 3% for the quarter. Orders were up 5% in the first quarter with climate up 7% and industrial down 1%. Against the top industrial comp, last year\u2019s first quarter include two significant project awards. Adjusted operating margin which excludes restructuring from both years was up 60 basis points. Climate margins increased 210 basis points. Pricing exceeded direct material inflation marking three, four years of 12 consecutive quarters of consistent execution and our pricing capability. : While the team was able to makeup total loss days of production, some shipments were delayed until the second quarter.

Let me give you a high level summary and then dive into the details. Our bookings for the quarter were up 5%, revenues were up 3% and our operating margins without restructuring were up 60 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share were $0.27 and adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.29 versus guidance rising in volume were a little bit better and more than offset the operating inefficiencies we experienced due to the weather, taking as $0.01 above our guidance range. Now let\u2019s go to Slide 4. Orders for the first quarter of 2014 were up 5% on a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate orders were up 7%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single digits. Transport orders were up high-teens led by container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 2% excluding currency. As Mike noted, there were two significant awards in the first quarter of 2013 making an external challenging comparable. Club Car orders were up low-single digits. Now let\u2019s go to Slide 5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment in regions. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, first quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and 4% excluding currency. Excluding currency, climate revenues increased 5% with HVAC revenues up low-single digits and transport revenues up low-teens. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Industrial revenues were essentially flat on a reported basis and excluding currencies. I will give more color on each segment in the next few slides. On the bottom chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 3% in the Americas, 6% in EMEA and Asia was up 3%, all excluding foreign exchange.  : : In the box, you can see that this is comprised of 50 basis points of headwind from investments and a 60 basis point benefit from lower restructuring cost. So if you prefer to look at this on an adjusted basis, adjusted margins increased in net of 60 basis points versus 120 basis points on a reported basis. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the first quarter were just over $2 billion. That\u2019s up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up low-single digits. Orders were up in the Americas and Europe and down in Asia. Trane\u2019s commercial HVAC first quarter revenues were up low-single digits. Revenues were up mid-single digits in Europe and Asia and flat in the Americas. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up low-single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year. Thermo King orders were up high-teens versus 2014's first quarter with a significant increase in container orders. Thermo King revenues were up low-teens, with truck trailer revenue up high-single digits and marine container revenues up significantly. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. Unit volumes were also up mid-single digits and mix was positive in the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 6.6% in the quarter, 210 basis points higher than first quarter of 2013 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Notably the North American HVAC businesses, commercial plus residential leveraged at over 200% in the quarter. . : : : In addition, two severe storms hit Augusta, Georgia causing production to shutdown for several days in January and February as well as causing inbound and outbound logistics delays. Well in most of our businesses, we were able to compensate for any loss days due to weather by increasing capacity in March. Club Car seasonal business was already scheduled at full capacity in March, already working in multiple shifts in weekends as they do every March. And much of that revenue shifted out of the first quarter. The logistic issues from the storm also resulted in incremental costs incurred for premium freight less than optimal outbound loads and additional overtimes. Industrial's operating margins of 11.6% was down to 320 basis points on flat volumes compared with last year as productivity was more than offset by the disruptions of Club Car inflation and investment.  : In addition, two severe storms hit Augusta, Georgia causing production to shutdown for several days in January and February as well as causing inbound and outbound logistics delays.

Michael W. Lamach: Okay, thanks Susan. Please go to Slide 11. As you know the first quarter comprises only 10% of our annual earnings given the seasonality of our businesses. In the aggregate, markets were about what we thought they would be some of them better and some of them weaker, but in total the bottom-line with our outlook going into the year. You saw that in our first quarter revenues which were in line with our guidance. Guys put in place forecast for 2014, shipped it somewhat in the latest update. The commercial and industrial forecast was revised up, while the institutional forecast was revised downward. In total, the 2014 forecast is slightly higher. Again commercial and industrial buildings tend to use more unitary equipment, while the institutional markets tend to use more applied equipment. Single family housing activity was adversely impacted by weather although a full-year forecast is still from mid to high single-digit growth in industrial unit volumes. Transport markets had a good start for the year particularly in Europe and in marine. We continue to expect the full-year North America trailer market to be flat to slightly up on a unit basis and industrial markets were fairly slow in the quarter. All that said the second quarter as a much more excelling quarter in which engage the balance of the year. Given that and as is our normal practice, we\u2019re maintaining our full-year guidance for both revenue and earnings at this time. We will be taking a look at the full-year outlook again and we talk to you in July. Please go to Slide 12. The second quarter guidance referred to the right hand column on the chart shown. Second quarter 2014 revenues are forecasted to be up 4% to 5%. We expect relatively stronger in Climate than in industrial but those should be in a low to mid single digit range. Second quarter GAAP, continuing earnings per share are forecasted to be in the range $1.08 to $1.12. Restructuring costs are expected to be about $0.01 in the quarter. So on an adjusted basis, the EPS range is $1.09 to $1.13. We are assuming an average share count of $275 million and a tax rate of 25%. For full-year 2014, we expect to generate free cash flow of $900 million. So in closing, we\u2019re pleased to have delivered at above our earnings commitment in the first quarter, despite some challenges. As we ahead into the seasonally important second quarter, I feel good about our positioning and our focus for the balance of the year. Now Sue and I will be happy to take your questions and Karen I will turn it over you to moderate. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC:  Hi, good morning and congrats Mike. Michael W. Lamach:  Thanks Steve. Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC:  Nice quarter, a couple of questions. One, I got hearing a lot about these systems in ERP issues through the quarter that I think it pushed out expectations as well. Can you maybe give us some color on what actually happened on that front? How you have mitigated it and what the status is if it\u2019s all through all that? Michael W. Lamach: : And then for stock businesses, we built an inventory buffer to compensate, so we expect a lower productivity during the system downtime, just prior to go-live and then as people get used to new standard work-in processes going forward. And then our experience and that of all the folks were working with would be that it takes about six months post launch to achieve the expected productivity benefits than from a conversion of like that. So the TK and the airs business launches went very smoothly and unitary conversion was much more typical, and productivity grew by just mentioned a second ago. We planned an additional ten days inventory to be held at the unitary warehouses and we have that in place by the end of January. On the 29th and 30th of January, several plants were shutdown due to the first snow storm and ice storm that Sue alluded to. And then of course with the knock-on impact and (indiscernible) all the way in that process as well. And what usually happens after something like that as you see demand play after this one clear which we saw and that\u2019s depleted a portion of the buffer that was in place. Now the second storm actually hit two days after the go-live, which shutdown a number of factories for about 4 days and to have the same logistics and demand knock-on effects, I mean that one as well. So by February 15, our 10 day buffer stock was largely depleted. And so we had a full core process on from mid-February until we ended the quarter and I would say by quarter end we were able to keep shipping pace with incoming order flow. And I\u2019ll further say that in April, we continue to see better productivity each week. So as of today, we think has past few backlogs, forecast shipped in the second quarter primarily in the residential business and I would say it\u2019s about one week of higher backlog than we saw last year whether we would like to have at this time. But as you saw, Steve, leveraged 57% and then specifically the Trane North-America businesses which we raised and in commercial delivered 230% operating leverage in the quarter which was phenomenal, so net, net with all disruptions from weather and the new systems, we delivered a really great quarter in Climate.  : Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC:  Hey, great. Michael W. Lamach: Yes. Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: And then may be higher level of question. On Nelson Peltz rejoined from the Board that we saw, are you likely to still the feet, and what kind of skill set that are you thinking you have answered? What\u2019s been lost and how are you thinking about that? Michael W. Lamach:  Well, the Nelson coming off in June and two directors come off next year. We\u2019ll go out and look at it, Christchurch ideally would love to have somebody with international large scale P&L experience in the industrial setting. So we\u2019re out there and over the next 15 months or so, we\u2019ll be kind of looking through at the Head of the Board around those three departures that have planned over the next year, 15 months. Probably looking to fill two and have a Board size of about 11. Operator :  Thank you and our next question comes from the line of David Raso from the ISI Group. David Raso \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Hi, good morning. On the margins for the year by segment, I am just going to get a feel for how are you thinking about the full year for both margins, obviously climate had a greater quarter, industrial disappointment. Could you jut update us on the thoughts for margins free segments for the year and then I have a question related to that for 2Q? Susan K. Carter:  David, it is Sue. So as we think about the full year and again we haven\u2019t changed our guidance for the full year outlook, so this is going to be pretty much information you know. Climate operating income margin, we expect 40 basis points to 80 basis points improvements over last year and on the industrial segment flat to up about 20 basis points. David Raso \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Okay. So on the industrial, it gets back on track for that, it appears what the second quarter is implying for margins. I assume you\u2019re looking for a nice snapback in industrial margins for the quarter where industrial margins will be up year-over-year in 2Q? Susan K. Carter: Yes, so let\u2019s talk about the second quarter, so the guidance we would be looking at sort of low single-digits on revenue growth for the business and operating margins, backing perhaps the 16% and 16.5% range. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC:  Thank you. Good morning. First just on price and cost, Mike, you said price overcame materials cost inflation, but did you actually have net materials cost inflation or material is actually grinding a little bit lower here? Susan K. Carter: So let me, I jump in and look at your question. So when we think about the first quarter, I mean obviously the direct material inflation is pretty same and perhaps there is a little noise in that, as we get towards the end of the year, but if you think about in total if we saw about 50 basis points of price and then as we talked about in the call about 40 basis points overall for price versus direct material inflation. So when we think about the price we\u2019ve got positive points in both of our segments and no positive in TK, positive in Trane, commercial and res and so we feel pretty good about that pricing and again direct material inflation pertained in Q1, probably pertained through the first half and then maybe some noise around CO in the back half of the year. Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And then my second question is on the investment spend, should we still expect something in the neighborhood of $0.18 for the year and that kinds of appears from your commentary that most of that spend was in industrial this quarter, is that correct, have you addressed both of those spends? Susan K. Carter:  Yes, so I think the full-year remains about the same. And as we think about the first quarter versus the full-year, I would say that more of the investments spend, it had a bigger impact on the industrial margins in the first quarter but again it will be pretty balanced as we go through the year, but the total hasn\u2019t really changed. Operator :  Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jo Blackshaw from Goldman Sachs. Jo Blackshaw \u2013 Goldman Sachs International :  Hi, good morning everyone. Michael W. Lamach:  Hi, Jo. Jo Blackshaw \u2013 Goldman Sachs International : So I thought the incremental margins this quarter were pretty doing good in north of the 25% number that we talked about last quarter despite the ERP issues, the weather issues and Climate and Club Car disruptions, is there a potential catch-up embedded into your 2Q guidance and perhaps. Maybe you can talk a little bit about whether your incremental margins are conservative for the remainder of the year? Susan K. Carter:  So Jo, as we think about leverage in our terminology obviously you know the Climate businesses had very good leverage in the first quarter at 57% and then overall for the company about 26% for the business. So when you think about Q2 and what that means, the guidance would sort of give you the implication that the overall leverage for the company is up around the 40% level with just north of 30% coming out of the operating segment and then you start to get some tailwind out of the corporate expenses also. And so you, obviously as we look at it, in the second quarter the guidance looks right to us. Again the business is just over 30% total, just over 40% as we do start to get some of that corporate uptick. The full year, obviously what we haven\u2019t changed anything, we\u2019re still sticking with the story that we had in the upper 30s for the full year with 25 coming out of the businesses but in fairness as we go through the second quarter and we come back in the month of July and talk about the total year, we will take another look at that. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : That's helpful, Sue. And just one follow-up question, it looks like you took up your free cash flow guidance to the upper end of your range. I think you had $850 million to $900 million last quarter, now you're at $900 million. Pretty good free cash flow as the year progresses. Talk to us a little bit about your uses of that cash specifically as it relates to buy back and MM&A? Susan K. Carter: So we talked about what we were going to do on share repurchase and we said that that we completed the $2 billion authorization that we\u2019re spending on the remaining of Allegion money about $175 million in the second quarter, and then we said we take about $400 million to $500 million of the free cash flow and applied to share buyback in the year and that\u2019s \u2013 that sort of get you the first quarter plus the second, the final Allegion dollars and then the $400 million to $500 million get you to that, $1.375 billion to $1.425 billion that we talked about in the script. And so then if you think about that with the $900 million of free cash flow guidance that\u2019s roughly about half of the free cash flow and we said that what we would do is with the remainder is it\u2019s toggled between M&A and investments in the business in share repurchase for the remainder of the free cash flow. Operator : : Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: Hi, thanks a lot. I guess the first question was around the mix of business within the climate segment. If you look at the institutional facing businesses, I think those were down slightly. The applied business was down slightly. You talked before about applied being flat for the year. Are you still sticking with that? And maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your applied customers in terms of quotation and order activity? Michael W. Lamach: So it\u2019s mixed globally Julian, but I think North America tends to be the focus of the question typically. Interestingly, when you look at bookings in the first quarter, the North America applied, they are actually up high-single digits. If you look at unitary North America, they\u2019re actually up high-teens. And one thing that you probably had identified here is that there is a buy, sell component of what we do often tied to contract and we might do a performance contract and have a pump set made by somebody else that we sell through to the end customer. That\u2019s actually the business that\u2019s down. So what we\u2019re seeing in terms of an uptick in our bookings for resourcing of our plants, absorption of our plants, it would lend toward a decent back half of the year, kind of recovering back up to the level that we have thought. So it\u2019s actually a very good quarter in both applied and unitary in North America. I would say that that the weakness is probably more around the mature economy which we could include China and Asia-Pacific. And it\u2019s just a matter of which segments of the market are going to be working there and not specifically in China, it\u2019s easy to identify it\u2019s going to be areas like nuclear, pharma, food and it\u2019s going to be away from some of the housing industries like shipbuilding and so on and so forth. So we will adjust accordingly, and how we are looking at that, so. And then Europe has been very strong for us as well, in fact the applied business in Europe was up high-single digit. So it\u2019s pretty good quarter for bookings and I think we\u2019ll see that flow through to the balance of the year and obviously for the Climate segment, we should end on higher note. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: Thanks. And then in terms of the gross productivity measures, is it fair to say that those have been fairly steady the past six months? I guess in Q4 you just have a costs rising up to offset that and then they fell back again in Q1, but overall gross productivity should be fairly steady through the balance of the year, there was nothing special in Q1? Michael W. Lamach: Well, remember too that the gross productivity really hasn\u2019t changed much between Q4 and Q1 for operations. That uptick we saw was really on headquarter spending, it related to lot of the benefit plans and changes that had to be approved from the fourth quarter on a strong year. So but operationally, what we were planning to run was about 120% of the pipeline that we think we needed the productivity in a given quarter or year and that\u2019s been a pretty good mechanism for us to make sure we\u2019ve got enough on the productivity pipeline to keep things coming. So it was a good quarter, but the underlying productivity in quarter four was good too. I think it was a little bit misunderstood because of the blurring all the adjustments and accruals made outside of operations in the fourth quarter. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from BofA Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Hey guys. Just a question on the industrial side. And I'm just surprised that given all the excitement about short cycle industrial recovery, industrial even ex the Club Car business is sort of not doing better. Can you talk about what kind of visibility we have on industrial in mature markets in North America and Europe? Michael W. Lamach: Well, visibility on compressed air systems and services is pretty good, Andrew and we got a pretty look there for the most part when you \u2013 as you look at the quarter about two-thirds of the leverage missed expectation would have been through the Club Car and they did a fantastic job getting golf fleets out in the quarter, but what had to give was the ability to get some of the utility vehicles that go with that out which will be through second quarter and third quarter of this year. The remaining one-third on the deleverage piece of that was heavy in terms of the investments question was asked earlier and a lot of that is not just in channel and not in product, but it\u2019s also in kind of putting the right level of talent into these business units power tools, fluid management, material handling. We are seeing really good bookings in material handling, as an example. We are seeing very good bookings and fluid managements little weaker \u2013 little weaker in capacity, and Club Cars as we have mentioned has got low-single digit growth. So I feel like for the long cycle businesses, which really are minor at our Club Car, material handling and the compressed air assessment services business, pretty good visibility for the year. Power tools tends to be motor spot buy and fluid management attracts with a lot of what you are seeing in comparables in other companies as well. So and just that core visibility too at this point. I feel good about the plan, we\u2019ve got for the balance of the year to bring margins back up over the balance of the year. Andrew Obin \u2013 Merrill Lynch : And just to clarify on orders, do you think orders were impacted by the weather? And if yes, you think you're going to get them back in second quarter? Michael W. Lamach: Orders not so much, shipments of Club Car, absolutely but orders not so much. And so I wouldn\u2019t think there will be much or more of a push there. I would suppose that I would think about it being something more fundamental being pushed in the second quarter. We think didn\u2019t have any issues in any of our factories whether it would be Climate or Industrial, I don\u2019t think we lost a minute of downtime to anything other than weather. So we were able to keep up the inventory levels where we had stocking in tools and fluids were pretty good. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Stephen E. Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning. I might be splitting hairs a little bit here, but I guess I'm just trying to think through this order question as well. You put up a couple quarters of 5%, but they are only kind of guiding the year up 3% to 4% in terms of revenue. Is there anything that would lead you believe things will decelerate going forward or is this just kind of normal conservatism? Michael W. Lamach: I think it\u2019s got a more of a long cycle view as to whether or not we think things will happen in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year that picked on some of the bookings we\u2019re seeing, a very large compressed air business services and very large applied HVAC orders and that\u2019s two areas that as you look through that and sort of some delays on these projects are particularly from some of the matured economies in Asia, it\u2019s a little bit hard to pinpoint exactly when we would see those, revenue for the year. : Stephen E. Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. I can appreciate that. And maybe if I could ask you to comment on the tenor of the quarter? Did things get kind of better into March? And any early read on April yet? Michael W. Lamach: March was pretty good for us. You know I will tell you that, you know, we have good strength, even in the HVAC res business, January and February just picked up the second hearty sell through. We actually matched the five in January and the nine in February. March we haven\u2019t seen yet. So we\u2019re anxious at some point to get that data as well but we're matching at least the hearty segment there, and I think that we were happy with March\u2019s performance. I am not going to give you much more of a read in the second quarter, it\u2019s pretty early for us and I think I said all along so much of the year, we really delivered in the last couple of weeks of June for us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Research. Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Inc :  Thank you. Good morning everyone. Michael W. Lamach:  Good morning. Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Inc :  Mike, I had a question on the potential that Douglas systems would gain more adoption in the U.S. and in Europe. So just looking in your crystal ball today, how fast might you see the take on Douglas? What might be gaining factors be in this Trane, have the right capacity in place to response to this demand, if it does comes through? Michael W. Lamach:  Yeah, we\u2019re counting on the world being a Douglas placed and being a player across the world in all geographies. It is interesting that we don\u2019t hear as we much about Douglas portions in other parts of the world, but our unitary business in Asia was the larger business; it is actually a 35% in the quarter. So we\u2019re growing in that business as well. We want to have a full product suite, we want to have Douglas systems, we want to have applied and unitary systems and then we want to have hybrid systems where it XSense of, it\u2019s really a matter of building up portfolio. Relative to your question about do we have the product portfolio, I would say yes we do and if we don\u2019t we have the right partnerships, but I think we\u2019re doing the right things for the results in position to be a global player in all technologies. Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Inc :  Great and then for Sue, I was hoping you comment on the stranded cost from Allegion size first where it stands and what\u2019s the Horizon is for taking those costs out? Susan K. Carter:  Okay so the best way to think about all of that is to think about most of those stranded costs being in the corporate number. So as we have talked about corporate and what we think corporate will look like, the unallocated portion of it for 2014, we expect that to be about $200 million for the year. 2013 and that corporate number was $260 million, so there were about $40 million of stranded cost which came out and then about $20 million of other savings that we planned into 2014. So in the fourth quarter, we did all our restructuring actions that again some of those fell over into the two senses that we saw in Q1, but those costs are primarily out of Ingersoll-Rand. We are completely with that restructuring in the stranded cost have gone away. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Well, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to (indiscernible) of North-American Trane leverage, you call that 20% incremental margins and that\u2019s going volumes are still pretty like that, but I\u2019m wondering could you just talk about base cost productivity pricing and how does that\u2019s been leveraged as the volumes pickup 15 years, types of those, what sort of incremental margins could you get from Trane North-America? Michael W. Lamach: Well, Nigel, it was about point of productivity looking at core gross productivity, less total inflation and then from a price perspective, about 70 points on price alone. So in general they just done a good job of consistent productivity to keep the pipeline full, there\u2019s not been a silver bullet, same things as we\u2019ve talking about four, five years there and just a very excellent quarter, excellent execution of that. The startup, it wasn\u2019t weather related. We did lose a minute in production in many of our factories, so I\u2019m proud of that. I\u2019m not sure what else I could really to tell you on that one. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  How that business will leverage as particularly the commercial HVAC volumes start to pick up? Michael W. Lamach:  Nigel, as we think we\u2019ll leverage at about the gross margin of the business and so I\u2019d be looking potentially if that would be as high as 30 and as we set as low as 25, this is where the guidance is. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura Securities. Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd:  Good morning. Michael W. Lamach: Hi, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd: Hey Mike, maybe just to follow-up on that. I mean the 57% conversion in climate, and I think you said 230% North American Trane, I mean I know you're expecting good leverage going forward, but I guess what are the things that make it come down from that level? Michael W. Lamach:  Well it is a timing of productivity. I mean there were no one half that happened; it\u2019s somewhat on low growth, the law of small numbers working for you in this case as well. So I just think as you would kind of get into a fuller year with larger numbers and more normalized in margins incrementals going forward. You\u2019re going to tend to revert back to gross margins business. That's fundamentally what the view is. Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd: Okay, no, that makes sense. And then just maybe update, you talk about potentially toggling to M&A, I mean what are your current views of that market in terms of what's out there and how active do you think you might be? Michael W. Lamach:  Well, we\u2019ve been very selective. We got a small in the first quarter on energy supply company that we didn't take any headlines with that but \u2013 so we\u2019re looking selectively. We've got a few smaller things that are really tucked into the commercial channel for HVAC that we\u2019re looking at. But it\u2019s been and continues to be a pretty disciplined process, really nothing or chattering, simply nothing transformational in the cars, but those, probably I would say active ideas we\u2019re looking at, it will be based as Sue said on evaluation and a holding in Europe to our share price however our investments has been, what we think as best of the shareholder year out. So that\u2019s our view. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners. Josh C. Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners LLC :  Hi, good morning guys. Michael W. Lamach: Good morning. Josh C. Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners LLC : So just maybe to beat this operating leverage question to death, looking at 2Q, it seems like a lot of that strength persists and I know you mentioned that 1Q, some of that's just a function of good productivity on smaller absolute volume numbers. I guess that implies some decel there in second half. Is that a comprehensive view on maybe some of that problematic steel pricing that you mentioned or lower productivity pipeline for the second half or is that just we don't have the visibility yet to make that call? Susan K. Carter:  As I think one of the ways I would look at it, and Mike can add his thoughts afterwards. As we talked about where we expect the second quarter to be and that we really haven\u2019t updated the guidance for the full year and that we were talking more about that in the July. I think what you are seeing on that leverage and the calculation is just a math at this point in time, I think we feel good about, we feel very good about where climate came out in the first quarter. We feel very good about where we\u2019re looking at both businesses as Mike said in roughly the gross margin territory for the second quarter and as we get into July, we\u2019ll give you more color on what we think of the full year will look like. Michael W. Lamach:  Yes, Josh, I'd probably add what I am looking at quarter one and quarter two from both segments and the productivity really says same which is exactly what we were looking for as that 120% pipeline drum beat that with breakage products that you get so what you, you thought you would get 100% maybe do better that\u2019s always a good thing, if you can do better, but it is split, is there going to a pipeline. I would say that investments would pickup, particularly in the climate business a little bit, tying with the things, like new product launches, but and also you get second quarter the effect of all the wage increases, which across the company start in April 1. So you\u2019ve got a little bit of a run rate change there and the wage fixtures up, every (indiscernible) back or something like the gross margins, and that\u2019s a pretty steady drumbeat that we look to obtain overtime. So we are going to have great quarters like we had \u2013 and we are going to have some weak quarters in there, but 25 is a good number we have planned with 30 that would be the gross margins of the business. So that\u2019s what we look to do. Josh C. Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners LLC :  Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, and I think Nigel asked this question, I don't know if you addressed it directly, any differences between applied and unitary? I know you've done some big product refreshes on both sides. Any differences there when we start to see that applied business pick up? Whether it is mix positive or negative, I guess should we expect that to attained differently when that finally comes around? Michael W. Lamach:  Yes, with all the restructuring has been done over the last four to five years, all the five allotments taking place. We are in different really as \u2013 if unitary or applied goes up, there is really not a change in the contribution margins of the business and so, it\u2019s the nice thing is we\u2019re \u2013 I think, we are levered either way, and I wouldn\u2019t expect that things would change, one way or the other with the higher applied versus unitary mix. So I mean right now, of course we are using how unitary and applied eventually it will take a back around. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Hi, good morning. Michael W. Lamach: : Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  The way you guys started this year, Mike, maybe you can contribute and offset some of these rounds played that are down, should be a pretty good spring for you guys sounds like. Michael W. Lamach: Good. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : The incremental margin question, I guess I want to get a little more precision on this because to get to $1.10 in EPS, using kind of the 4% to 5% growth rate, it seems like there is a little bit of a higher kind of implied incremental. What is corporate going to be in the second quarter? I guess and then I can kind of guess back into what that implies for the segments. Susan K. Carter:  So when you think about corporate and we are spending it should be roughly $15 million-is, can you take that $200 million for the year and it\u2019s roughly the same throughout the quarters. And what we\u2019ll find, when you are thinking about this in terms of leverage is that the quarters in 2013 the corporate cost and the corporate components rationally increasing. Therefore, taking out this stranded cost and taking out some of the G&A cost will provide a bigger list in terms of leverage as we go through each of the successive quarters and we do see that in the second quarter. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. And then I guess just for the so \u2013 you can kind of based on, you told us what the industrial margin range is going to be, I'm getting something around 14% for the climate margin in 2Q? Susan K. Carter:  Yes, 13.5%, yes, somewhere nearly, you are not far off. Michael W. Lamach:  Yes, if we look at 40 to 80 basis points maybe for the full year and last year it was around 12.7% so, kind of 13.5% is public view much better number than 14% there. The incremental Sue, mentioned really in her comments, our 30% and even said, probably more precisely like 31% from the businesses together. 10 points of lift comes from the high quarter\u2019s reduction and so there is a little better incremental margin in Q2 versus Q1. That was planned. Of course weather wasn\u2019t planned, but the transition to the ERP system was planned and so that didn\u2019t really change much in terms of what we had expected there. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Hey, guys. Just a couple loose end items. Can you just talk about the sustainability, the strength you\u2019re seeing in Thermo King? And then also, the commercial HVAC orders down in Asia. Is that bad lumpiness or is that kind of the trend you\u2019re seeing over in Asia? Michael W. Lamach:  Well, the lumpiness really has to do with just sort of the macro economy in China and we\u2019re dealing with that like everybody else. There are some very, very big deals in Asia that would swing that, but absence of hotels, hospitals and pharma, some nuclear \u2013 there is some real weakness in some of the other segments of the market, really actually the weakness in industrial plays through the HVAC where, if not the largest, one of largest process cooling providers out in that marketplace. So then semiconductor businesses go down. We feel that in the HVAC business. They\u2019re actually just to sustain. So that\u2019s an example there. Your question on TK and the outlook there, it\u2019s a good start to the year. Containers have run more like 5% of our total TK mix. It was 10% in the quarter. Those are very, very lumpy in terms of how that works. And so the underlying businesses, we\u2019re strong in Europe, I think that that moderates and normalize for the balance of the year. And North America, truck and trailer is about what we thought in fall of the year, little difference there. Well, that\u2019s flat industrial volumes, but our revenue picked up some mix with the new product and more expenses with the new curve of compliance. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Thanks a lot. Michael W. Lamach: Welcome. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital Markets. Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC :  Good morning. Thanks. Mike, maybe just some of the market commentary you mentioned with the Dodge revisions? You also talked about in North America, your applied orders were up in the quarter, but you\u2019ve also been a little more cautious on the market forecast. Just wondering if you can maybe give us an update on if these trends maybe change your view on the cycle at this point? Michael W. Lamach:  Yes, and we always look at a group of indicators. I think I say that every time. We make, but I\u2019m always cautious. Somebody might be new to listening to a call. One of the key areas of the Dodge putting in place the starts data, which we triangulate with a couple of other metrics, one that we also think is important. This is what\u2019s happening in terms of our own proposal pipeline that we can look at the same. So related Dodge forecast for 2014 put in place up about 8% versus 2013. And you got to look at the underlying trends by verticals within that institutional. It\u2019s over half of the put in place dollars, is actually forecasted to be down 2% in this revision and that\u2019s for sixth consecutive of that happening. Of course the AVI numbers were a little bit weak this morning as well, but the commercial industrial activity is forecasted to be up 18%. So really on the commercial industrial activity, my view would be that will come down slightly from 18%. I don\u2019t think it will stay there. I think they\u2019ll revise it down. And I think that the applied market, at least what we\u2019re seeing, it might be a little bit stronger than what we\u2019re seeing there. : Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC :  Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the resi side, maybe you can just comment on what you're seeing on the mix of efficiency levels that you're seeing in revenues and orders? And then maybe your expectations for a pre-buy or inventory build ahead of the January cut off for the new efficiency standards next year? Michael W. Lamach:  Yes things are trending toward higher efficiency, so trending up towards 2014, at this point using the 2013 there and that change is good for us, good for the industry as well. Relates to any sort of a pre-build, the nice thing here is that we\u2019re going to have a pretty good opportunity to look at the price gap between 2014, 2013 stay at the end of the year in the marketplace. That\u2019s going to drive a lot of what happens in terms of the pre-build of course the larger the gap, the more pre-build that you would see, the smaller the gap, less you would see. We\u2019ll rollup a view from all of our dealers and distributors and closer to the end of the year, a nice thing about all of that is we would be building air conditioning \u2013 our air conditioning plants in the fourth quarter which is a very seasonally low quarter. So all of that pretends to being able to take a relatively late look in the summer at that and then planning accordingly for fourth quarter based on the variables, dynamically I just mentioned. Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC :  Thank you. Michael W. Lamach:  Thank you and our final question for today comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just to clean-up issue, you had a very impressive first quarter despite all the weather and issues and postponements, stuff like that. You have any measure of how much production was actually pushed into the second quarter from the first quarter? Particularly, looks like in industrial it's got to be measurable at this point? Michael W. Lamach:  Yes, it was exception of Club Car, everything else with the push, we had higher demands of parts and services and lower demand for few industrial parts but generally we have pushed, but Club Car was the big out layer there for us. From a production standpoint, nothing else really pushed from a distribution standpoint, I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve got a week more in backlog and we would like to have a residential business that can shift more orders and what we flushing that out of the next weeks or too. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities :  Great, and could get some quantifications? Is that like $20 million or $30 million worth of production that we're going to see in catchup in the second quarter? That's looks like it's something to that effect? Michael W. Lamach:  If I looked at the resi keys of that is probably not too far off, the club car piece, second, third quarter that will kind of picking there as well. I would say that you\u2019re probably in the ballpark on that and that\u2019s for the quarter, you can take in the second quarter up from 4% to 5% reflects that we\u2019ll see a little bit of that, whether it\u2019s a 25% to maybe 40% in total but some of that. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities :  That's helpful. And then finally, your restructuring I guess is implying $0.07 in the second half of the year, a little bigger. Is there any change causing the back half orders? Is it always been that way? And does it say anything about 2015 restructuring, since your numbers are strong in the second half of the year than the first half? Michael W. Lamach:  Maybe there were a lot of restructuring for the long time I would say. I think that what you got here is the maintenance piece, the $0.10 which has been typically what it\u2019s run for us. And so the $0.03 being that is in the first half, we selling from the back half, that\u2019s again one of those things you like that, in July. I think we\u2019d have better a view, clearer view of any projects, we want to undertake third, fourth quarter and update you there, but for now that threshold that I think stands and it\u2019s a good number to rely on. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any concluding comments. Susan K. Carter: Thank you Karen We don't have any further comments. Joe and I will be around for follow-up today. Everybody have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

With that, please go to Slide 3, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Great. Thanks, Janet, and good morning and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. In the second quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.13. There was a small amount of restructuring in the quarter less than a penny. This quarter\u2019s reported and adjusted EPS are identical. That\u2019s at the top end of our adjusted earnings guidance range and a 22% increase versus the second quarter of 2013. Revenues were $3.5 billion, up 4.3% versus last year. Leverage were consistent with our guided revenue range of up 4% to 5% for the quarter. Orders were up 5% in the second quarter with Climate up 6% and Industrial up 2%. Adjusted operating margin which excludes restructuring from the prior year was up 150 basis points. Climate margins increased 150 basis points and Industrial margins were up 30 basis points. Pricing exceeded direct material inflation as it has each quarter for more than three years. Operating leverage was about 50% with 43% leverage at the segment. We repurchased 4 million shares in the second quarter. Overall a very good quarter with revenues about where we thought they would be, and excellent operating leverage on the revenue growth, particularly in HVAC businesses, both residential and commercial. Now Sue will walk you through in more detail on the second quarter. I\u2019ll then take you through the third quarter and 2014 outlook. Sue Carter : Thanks Mike. Starting at a high level, our bookings for the quarter were up 5%, revenues were up 4% and our operating margins without restructuring were up 150 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share were $1.13 versus midpoint guidance of $1.10 we were little bit better on price and mix and a penny lower in restructuring. Let\u2019s move to Slide 4. Orders for the second quarter of 2014 were up 5% on a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate orders were up 6%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single-digits. Transport orders were up mid-teens. Orders in the Industrial segment were up 2% on both, a reported basis and excluding currency. Let\u2019s go to Slide 5. Here\u2019s a look at the revenue trends by segment and by regions. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, second quarter revenues were up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 4% with commercial HVAC revenues up low-single-digits and transport revenues up high-single-digits. Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single-digits. Industrial revenues were up 4% on a reported basis and excluding currencies. I\u2019ll give more color on each segment in the next few slides. On the bottom of the chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 3% in the Americas, 16% in EMEA and Asia was down 2%, all excluding foreign exchange. The lower revenue in Asia was mainly driven by geography outside of China. China was about flat excluding currency. Now let\u2019s go to Slide 6. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from second quarter 2013 of 11.4% to second quarter of 2014 which was 13.1%, an increase of 170 basis points. This chart is on a reported basis. We\u2019ve clearly strained down the impact of restructuring cost for you which was 20 basis points of tailwind year-over-year. Volume mix and foreign exchange collectively were 60 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continue to outpace material inflations adding 50 basis points to margins. As Mike said, we\u2019ve been consistently positive on this measure for more than three years. Productivity versus other inflation was a full margin point positive impact in the quarter. Productivity ramped up in the quarter as we got passed all the weather-related impacts of the first quarter and saw benefits from the restructuring done in late 2013 and earlier this year. Year-over-year investments and restructuring were higher by 40 basis points in total. In the box, you can see that that was comprised of 60 basis points of headwind from investments, mainly in IT, channel expansion and new product investments, and there was a 20 basis point benefit from lower restructuring cost. So if you prefer to look at this on an adjusted basis, adjusted margins increased a net of 150 basis points versus 170 basis points on a reported basis. Leverage in the quarter was excellent and almost 50% excluding restructuring from last year and 43% in the segment. Climate\u2019s leverage at 48% was led by the HVAC businesses particularly in North America. To Slide 7. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the second quarter were $2.7 billion. That\u2019s up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up low-single-digits. Orders were up in the Americas and Europe and Asia. Commercial HVAC revenues were up low-single-digits. Revenues were up high-single-digits in Europe, up low-single-digits in the Americas and down in Asia. Commercial HVAC new equipment revenues were down slightly, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenues were up mid-single-digits versus prior year. Growth in worldwide unitary equipment revenues was more than offset by lower applied revenues. Thermo King orders were up mid-teens versus 2014 second quarter led by increases in truck trailer and bus. Container orders were slightly lower in the quarter. Thermo King revenues were up high-single-digits with truck trailer revenue up low-single-digits and marine container revenues up significantly. Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single-digits versus last year. Unit volumes were also up high-single-digits and mix was positive in the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 14.2% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2013, due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Now let\u2019s go to Slide 8. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $794 million, up 4% from last year\u2019s second quarter. For the Industrial segment excluding Club Car, revenues were up mid-single-digits and orders were also up mid-single-digits versus last year. Excluding Club Car revenues in the Americas and Asia Pacific were up while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were up over 20%, part of which was positive currency impact. Revenues in the air compressor business were up mid-single-digits with strong gains in oil free products and parts and services. Club Car revenues in the quarter were down low-single-digits while orders were down mid-single-digits versus prior year as golf markets were down in the quarter. Industrial\u2019s operating margin of 16.4% was up 30 basis points on higher volume productivity and pricing, partially offset by inflation and investment spending. Turn to Slide 9. Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4% of revenue in the quarter. The increase versus prior year is from higher receivables in inventory, partially offset by higher payables balances. Days sales outstanding is up mainly due to mix of business. Delinquency is unchanged from prior year. On inventory, we have been intentionally increasing stock inventory levels of key assemblies in order to ensure supply, particularly in the higher selling season. Year-to-date June free cash flow was $98 million. Working capital will come down in the second half to a level closer to 3% of revenues based mainly on timing of revenues. May and June are our highest two month sales volumes and given our DSO is about 60 days. That drove higher working capital balance at the end of the second quarter. And let\u2019s go to Slide 10. We\u2019ve repurchased 4 million shares for approximately $200 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date June, we have spent $1 billion in share repurchases and repurchased about 17 million shares. Our forecast for the year remains to spend between $1.375 billion and $1.475 billion on repurchase with $400 million to $500 million of that coming from free cash flow. And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Mike. Mike Lamach : Great. Thank you, Sue. And please go to Slide 11. Before we review the forecast, I want to take a few minutes to mention some very important new products in Trane commercial introduced in Europe at the end of June. This is a milestone for Trane since we\u2019re introducing five new chiller products at the same time. Products included centrifugal air-cooled and screw chiller designs and cover a broad range of sizes and market applications including education, healthcare, lodging, large commercial buildings and fastest cooling in Europe. All these new systems are available with advance controls and designed for cost effectiveness and optimal energy efficiency for both full load and part load performance. The chiller in the upper right side of the slide, Series E CenTraVac is truly a breakthrough technology. These products are designed for cooling large commercial buildings and are up to 10% more energy efficient than the next best chiller available in this tonnage range. The true innovation is that the E Series is the first commercialized chiller used in ultra-low global warming potential HFO refrigerant. The new refrigerant allows the E Series chillers to continue to utilize Trane\u2019s highly reliable and efficient direct drive and low-pressure designs that have may Trane chillers the global leader in centrifugal chillers. I believe we are gaining momentum and capabilities to introduce new products tying all of our businesses this will help to improve our growth rates as we see the slow recovery of our commercial construction in that market began. Now let\u2019s move to the forecast, please go to Slide 12. In the aggregate markets we\u2019re about where we thought they would be, some a little better and some little weaker, but second quarter revenues were in line with our guidance. Dodge has put in place forecast for 2014. Did that change much in the latest update? In total, the 2014 Dodge forecast is still up about 8%. Relate this to our North American business commercial and industrial buildings tend to use more unitary equipment, while the institutional markets use more applied equipment. The commercial and industrial forecast is unchanged at up 18% versus 2013, while the institutional forecast still is forecasted to be down 1% for the year. Within commercial and industrial, the vertical of largest growth is still warehouses that are over 30%. They have little HVAC contact. Key verticals for Trane are office and bank, retail and manufacturing which are all up but at a more modest rate. Within institutional, government is expected to be down over 20% while education and healthcare are forecast with slightly down in 2014. The only vertical in institutional forecast is to be up 2014 is amusement which is not a key vertical for Trane. We expect Europe, Middle East and Africa to be up mid-single-digits for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be up low-single-digits overall with China up low-to-mid single digits. Remainder of the region will be fairly flat. We\u2019ve seen impact for example in Thailand from the political unrest there. The full year outlook for residential HVAC markets is still for mid-to-high single digit growth in the unitary volumes, industry volumes. Transport markets had a good start for the year, particularly in Europe and in Marine. Bookings growth has been front-end loaded for both trailer and container. We expect booking rates to moderate in the second half. We expect the full year North American trailer market to be flat to slightly up on a news basis but up high-single-digits on a dollar basis due to mix of car compliance products. Industrial markets were somewhat improved in the quarter. The latter half of course with some recovery in China. Based on the first half results, our outlook for the second half, we are raising our full year revenue. We see revenues up about 4% from the prior guidance of about 3% to 4%. It\u2019s really not much change in the aggregate to our Climate revenue outlook. The changes in Industrial where we are raising revenue expectation. Our updated forecast is for Industrial to be up 2% to 3% versus the prior forecast with flat to up 2%. The increased outlook within our core Industrial businesses, the golf markets are expected to be flat down for the year. Please go to Slide 13. The third quarter guidance refer to the middle column on this chart, although we\u2019ve included quarter four on the chart to show you some math. Third quarter 2014 revenues are forecast to be up approximately 4%. We expect growth to be stronger in Climate than in Industrial but both should be in the low-to-mid single digit range. Third quarter GAAP continuing earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.04. Restructuring costs are expected to be about $0.01 in the quarter. So on an adjusted basis the EPS range is $1.01 to $1.05. The currency situation in Venezuela is evolving. We are continuing to evaluate the impact but of inclusive about $10 million or about $0.03 per share foreign exchange losses related to Venezuelan currency in the third quarter forecast. We\u2019re assuming an average share count of 273 million shares at tax rate of 25%. There is an EPS bridge versus last year\u2019s third quarter in the appendix for your reference. For the full year, as I said, we see revenue growth of about 4%. We are raising our full year 2014 earnings outlook to a range of $3.13 to $3.21 on a reported basis. Prior comparable range was $2.95 to $3.10 which includes $0.10 of restructure. For the full year, we\u2019ll now expect to spend about nickel in restructuring. So a nickel of a change in guidance is from change of restructuring outlook. Recall, the $0.03 foreign exchange that we have in for Venezuela in Q3 guidance which flows through to the full year. The core earnings forecast was going up by about $0.13 at the midpoint. There is no change the full year average share count guidance of 275 million shares at a tax rate of 25%. So in closing, we\u2019re pleased to have delivered above our earnings commitment in second quarter with excellent performance in the segments. I continue to feel good about our positioning and are focused we had in the latter half of the year. With that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi. Thank you. I guess I had a quick question on the margin guidance by segment for this year. You\u2019ve obviously updated the revenue assumptions. You talked about Climate 4% up, about 40 to 80 bps Industrial, flat to up 20 basis points. How do those look now to you? Sue Carter : So Julian, when we look at those, we\u2019re leading the industrial segment at flat to up 20 basis points. And then on Climate as you pointed out, we were at 40 basis points to 80 basis points, and it now looks like about 80 basis points to 110 basis points. So we did take that up with the guidance increase. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thank you. And then just within the margin bridge, sort of in aggregate, the productivity number was very good in Q2. Do you see that as kind of a good, sort of ongoing rate balance of this year when you look out into sort of \u201815 and \u201816, just because I think you\u2019re only half way covered on the value streams of the cost base and so on? Mike Lamach : Julian, the thing that is important there is the pipeline that we measure. And as I\u2019ve in the past, we\u2019ve tried to keep that pipeline between 110% and 150% of what\u2019s required understanding that there is timing issues and some things don\u2019t work that were planned. So to help the pipeline looks like it\u2019s still in fact both materials perspective as well as direct and indirect labor perspective. So I would say that we\u2019re not forecasting any real changes in productivity, however it\u2019s always subject to the pipeline timing of what project actually has. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America : Yes. So very pleasantly surprised on Industrial growth revision. Can you give us a little bit more detail as to what\u2019s really happening by region and North America, Europe? Mike Lamach : Well, the core Industrial markets which is non-golf are doing better than we anticipated. Europe clearly is better than we anticipated across the board. As Sue mentioned, we\u2019re up 20%. In EMEA in the quarter and the orders booked there was looks great. North America, a little bit stronger but again stronger parts and services as well. China, which showed a little bit more strength in the later two months in the prior quarter has a decent outlook for the balance of the year in terms of the pipeline, but there frankly Andrew, it\u2019s a large equipment orders and typically that become more of a timing issue as to whether its fourth quarter or first quarter of next year, but all in all we\u2019ve developed the core industrial businesses is bit of a fresh look. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America : And then just a follow-up. How sustainable is the EMEA strength, and what\u2019s driving the strength? Is it market share gain or any particular market because that looked very strong? Mike Lamach : Yes, it\u2019s actually mostly in Western Europe as well too. So it\u2019s combination of other things, Andrew. I wouldn\u2019t just to pick one but clearly we\u2019ve done well with the efforts to invest feet on the street in the region. We\u2019ve got I think great product with a good price point in the region. I think that oil free, it\u2019s been a significant gainer for us there as well, and for that matter across the globe. So no, I don\u2019t think that 20% growth rates are something to plan on when you are going forward, but we are pleasantly surprised to see that we have a great quarter. Sue Carter : And Andrew let me just add one thing on there. For 2014, we\u2019re expecting revenues in EMEA to be mid-to-high single digits for the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, good morning everyone. Mike Lamach : Hi Joe. Sue Carter : Good morning. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : So good quarter. It seems like pricing clearly has been strong for quite sometime, but may have surprised the upside this quarter. Europe was good but you didn\u2019t really take up your growth expectations significantly. It seems like a lot of the guidance range is driven by the margins, particularly on the Climate side. And so I guess just what gives you the confidence at this point in raising the guidance for the back half of the year? Sue Carter : So Joe, as we think about the guidance and what we\u2019re seeing in the markets in our performance, we\u2019re obviously pleased with what we\u2019ve seen through six months and we\u2019ve seen actually gives us some confidence for the year. As you pointed out, we\u2019re still in a low to moderate growth environment. And so as we looked at the revenue, the outlook is only a little bit higher, and most of the earnings guidance is from higher operating performance. The enterprise leverage is in the mid 40s and the segment leverage in the mid 30s for the revised guidance. And again as we looked across the businesses, the performance that we have, what we see on enterprising versus material inflation, productivity, etcetera we thought this was the right place to land. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess one follow-up on the cadence for 3Q and 4Q, particularly as it relates to the incremental margins. It seems like there is a step-down implied in your guidance for the incremental margins for 3Q and then a step back up in 4Q. I just want to make sure I am thinking about that the right way, and if so, what\u2019s causing that 3Q versus 4Q? Sue Carter : So I think as you look across the quarters, I think we\u2019re still seeing in the third quarter that prices is going to offset direct material inflation but at a lower rate, also same for the fourth quarter in terms of the overall businesses. And then one of the other things that you see in terms of that leverage is the amount of corporate expenses that are in the fourth quarter. Mike Lamach : That corporate last year as we were really truing up half spend, there was stock-based comps, benefit changes that came out really in the fourth quarter higher than the normal run rate. So there is a pickup in the fourth quarter. We also had a flood in China in our Industrial businesses which hopefully won\u2019t repeat again this year, so that would be another reasons why the fourth quarter leverages looks so much higher than the normal. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hi good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Jeff. Sue Carter : Good morning. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Just wanted to kind of focus on the applied market. And I think you said that the Dodge date is still being pretty choppy but I am just wondering what you\u2019re seeing in the quoting activity, any signs of inflection or accountability momentum into \u201815? And then what\u2019s in that \u2013 if you could just kind of update us on your VRF strategy relationship with Samsung and how do you think VRF competes or doesn\u2019t compete with the chiller-based systems? Mike Lamach : Lot there Jeff as always. So when you look at the applied markets in general, the market in quarter one, this is the North American market which is for the latest most available was down about 3%. Last year, it was down 4% total of the market. Second quarter was down a little bit lower. The market was down 4%, but the market expectation third-party prognosticators here think that it will come back to zero for the full year, which implies a pretty sizable third and fourth quarter pickup. Conversely on unitary, the market last year was about 5%. First quarter was strong at 7%. Second quarter was actually 5% again the prognosticators will call that down to 4%. I think it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019re not going to see the \u2013 you\u2019re going to see a ramp up and improvement in applied markets in the back half of the year, probably not to the extent that is being prognosticated. And I think on the unitary side, those are very strong. If you even take the first two quarters for us, our bookings in unitary were up double-digits for the first two quarters. And the momentum there certainly will slow, but not to the extent to bring it down to where the market is calling it. But I think that you will see more gradual turning it unitary and applied as we go forward. Now specifically VRF, remember our strategy is multi-fold. We produce some VRF in our own factories. We have an arrangement with Samsung as well as two other VRF manufacturers that we utilize for components. So all-in our unitary business was doing well across the world which includes VRF, and of course our VRF growth rates are going much faster than industry VRF growth rates because the fact that we\u2019re working off smaller numbers there, but just has the ductless growth rates are increasing, so too is the ducted component globally for us. So from a unitary perspective, we had really good growth across the world in unitary through the first two quarters both in ducted and ductless. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay, great. And then just, I don\u2019t know if I missed this. Can you give us an update on what you think corporate is and just maybe what the run rate is exiting \u201814, and is that kind of how to think about the go-forward run rate? Sue Carter : So Jeff, what we\u2019ve talked about for corporate spending was a range of around $200 million for the year. When we\u2019re talking about today and what we\u2019re thinking about is a range of around $200 million to $220 million, depending on how some of the things that Mike referenced earlier like the stock-based comp. The benefit planned true-ups and investment spending comes in for the year, so that gives you sort of $50 million to $55 million quarter range for corporate expenses, but as we look at that and I talk about $200 million to perhaps $220 million, I want to be clear that the restructuring spend and the stranded cost that were taken off from the Allegion spin were taken out in late 2013 and early 2014, if the number was above the $200 million range, it would be \u2013 because we had decided to do more investments or we had items again in not stock-based comp or in benefit planned true-ups. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies & Co. Steve Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co: Hi, good morning. I am wondering if we\u2019re getting any better visibility into the next iteration of SEER requirements here in States, and how that might impact your business, whether we might see some pre-buy or perhaps an issue, just any update on that? Mike Lamach : Well, I think that your point has probably gotten more murky as opposed to less to more clear. The standards really at this point in time as you\u2019re probably are aware are bit up in the air again. We\u2019ve got activity happening in the next couple of quarters, where DOE will lead some panels to go through the enforcement of changes to the standards in 2015, but those really won\u2019t become rule sometime in 2015, so it\u2019s very difficult to tell what the impact would be. I would say probably what you won\u2019t see is a quarter or two ago, thought those rules would be in place, you might see some last manufacturing of 13 SEER systems, and I think that that probably will not be the case, so it will be that you\u2019ll see 13 SEER systems manufactured and sold throughout the country sometime into or through 2015. That\u2019s a bit more speculation on my part. Steve Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co: Okay, great. Thanks. And then can you just comment on where you think channel inventory is, and whether it might need to be adjusted going forward? Mike Lamach : Are you talking about residential HVAC or what part of the business? Just assuming you\u2019re on mute at this point, I am going to assume that\u2019s residential HVAC. And they are at about normal levels at this point of time. We\u2019re running higher bookings in the first quarter, shipped a lot of those bookings in the second quarter towards fairly low at the beginning in the second quarter. So fairly normalized levels for us, which tends to be a little bit lower than some of what our industry competitors sold. And if you go back over a long period of time, largely we\u2019ve been trying to do better job on cycle times from the factories to the dealer to allow distribution to actually hold less inventory at different times during the year. So the answer to your answer, in short form, fairly normalized. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Good morning everybody. Mike Lamach : Hi Andy. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Just a couple of follow-ups, a lot has been asked. Within the Industrial order improvement, asking I think it was Andrew\u2019s question a little bit different, are you seeing any specific pockets of strength like type of customer as opposed to region? Mike Lamach : Well, yes, we do see some. I mean even in China as you look through, as an example you wouldn\u2019t see strength in areas like some of the heavy metals businesses in China, but you would see some in some of the verticals that we would play more into. So of course food and beverage and nuclear would be a big market right now in China where we\u2019re doing well in those markets, but staying away from a lot of the sort of heavy industry over capacity size places that China has outlined would be an example. And the UA [ph], it\u2019s a bit broader based than that. And then from the technology perspective certainly as we said, oil free parts and services are stronger. And frankly the parts and services piece of that is consistent with some of the investments that we made earlier in the year, where I am putting some additional feet on the street both in terms of selling capability but also in terms of technical service strengths and filling some pockets out there. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, great. Thanks Mike. And then returning to your prior question again, I think last quarter you called out some improvement in the applied unit order growth within the Climate orders. Did you see that continue? I know what you said about the industry forecast, but I am just wondering within your orders, did you see that continue? Mike Lamach : Yes, we have and we actually have what we believe is the much more reliable part to review that which is a pipeline view which goes all the way from early conversation with the customer or the identification of the project, all the way through to following it through a pipeline percentage estimate of flow and so and so forth. So you do see a large pipeline going through, but again I don\u2019t see that there is sort of an immediate inflection point in applied that some of the third-party market data points would suggest I think some more gradual improvements through 2015 with some more gradual moderating in the unitary business in 2015, but yes, we\u2019re seeing that as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : Thank you. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Hi Jeff. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : Could you just give a little bit more granular first on kind of the price side, Mike. Is there any real distinction where you\u2019re seeing it, I would guess resi versus unitary and applied, but can you just put some perspective around what\u2019s going on in pricing in general? Sue Carter : So let me give a broad overview on pricing and what we\u2019re seeing. So from the perspective of being overall, we still expect the pricing environment to be fairly modest in 2014, so about 50 basis points of price. We still expect to be able to more than offset material inflation, but we think towards back half of the year, as I said earlier that the positive gap will look more like what we saw at the end of 2013, which is more in the 20 basis point to 30 basis point range as opposed to the 50 basis point range that we\u2019re seeing. And I think that across the segment we are seeing favorability, and but to your point resi was a little \u2013 was part of the stronger piece of price. Mike Lamach : Jeff actually we had across the board, so if you put Climate, both resi and commercial and then split up, commercial by region, by product. We actually have positive price in all areas that as we did industrial as well. So there weren\u2019t any big gaps and that Sue just alluded to clearly one of the biggest surprises was the residential was actually price leaders for us in the quarter. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : Great. And then, Mike, could you just address kind of the comment or perhaps Sue on inventory running higher to meet demand. It sounds a little counter to what we\u2019ve been hearing on better flow to the factory and better reaction times and the like. Are you hitting some diminishing returns there or is there something in particular in the outlook that you\u2019re trying to prepare for? Mike Lamach : Well, it\u2019s a very inexpensive insurance policy right now with working capital rates where they are in a company, and areas where we got long lead items. Great example might be a diesel engines for TK would be a perfect example. That was a really strong bookings backlog. And although we expect it to moderate, but still I don\u2019t want out of engines which can take 12 weeks to come across the water to get here. That would be a good example. And it\u2019s selective throughout the business. So if you go to our tools business, there is 25 tools that we just absolutely will not stock out of, and there has been great activity in that business particularly around some of the new product launches with our electric power tools that actually have electronic interface into customer production system, that\u2019s been a big winner for us and that\u2019s something we\u2019re going stock out of. So again it\u2019s really building advance. And also campaigns that we\u2019re running certain areas of product growth team are spearheading, so we talked about the six product growth teams but in areas where they\u2019ve got a deliberate plan, its spearhead, something into a particular vertical market or particular region, we\u2019re making sure that to tie our order plans consistent with what we\u2019re trying to do. In other words, we\u2019re trusting that those product growth teams are going to be able to action out what it is trying to do. The worst thing we want to do is have them do that not be able to support the product. So it\u2019s selective, not across the board. It got nothing to do with the value stream. It has got to do with where they are pockets of growth and where there is the unique opportunities, it is being able to take advantage of that. And certainly and really lead, 12 to 16 weeks items that commence from suppliers that we want to make sure that we\u2019re not running out of those. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from the ISI Group. David Raso \u2013 ISI Group : Hi good morning. Ex the corporate expense year-over-year, the incremental margins this year are \u2013 you are targeting around 30%, 31%. Can you give us some puts and takes to how to think about the incremental margin moving forward? Just trying to look out to \u201815. Just think about further productivity improvements. I was happy to see the compressor business which is usually better incremental starting to show some life. Then also maybe Thermo King in North America, just trying to run up against some tough comps. So just maybe just big picture get your thoughts on how we should think about the segment incremental margins moving forward? Mike Lamach : Yes, David, for five years we\u2019ve been running somewhere in this 40% to 50% incremental margin range. I haven\u2019t calculated likely but I don\u2019t think we wrote it much last year. And at some point in time, logic prevails that you\u2019re going to be normalizing back towards something that looks like gross margin of company. Of course we\u2019re trying to drive gross margin of the company up and of course we had higher rentals, but any time we do above 30%, we\u2019re truly digging in beyond variable costs, we\u2019re digging into the fixed cost base of the company. So we guided initially the 25% along with some breakage in the business, and pipelines that may not materialize. In the first two quarters, the pipeline did materialize and we were able to take advantage of the opportunities and manage away the risks, but that\u2019s not always the case, that\u2019s why I caution you and listeners on the call that good number tends to be the gross margin of the company. And really the safer number is the gross margin of the company less the breakage that normally is involved in these sorts of things. David Raso \u2013 ISI Group : Just trying to think a little bit that you have the lower share count exiting the year than your average share count. When it comes to things like the tax rate for next years, still think of it 25 as a good base case? Mike Lamach : Yes, actually I\u2019ll pass to Sue because I was talking specifically about segment operating leverage. David Raso \u2013 ISI Group : Sure. No absolutely I was as well. I was just trying to think of the other puts and takes. Mike Lamach : Okay. Sue Carter : All right. So David as I think about share count and I think about tax rate is we\u2019re looking at the \u2013 I\u2019ll give you an example. We\u2019re for the second quarter, we got about $0.10 benefit coming out of the share count and a headwind out of the tax rate of about $0.15. And for the full-year, you\u2019re going to have the same story. You\u2019re going to have more of a headwind coming off of tax than the benefit from shares. So as I look to what happens next, I mean obviously we need to go through and do our operating plan. We need to look at the areas where our income is going to come from in \u201815 and beyond, but I think from an overall basis, there isn\u2019t a reason to think that it would be a lot different than sort of the mid 20s type of range which is sort of where we\u2019ve been at for a while. So again in \u201814 you\u2019re going to have less benefit from shares than the headwind on taxes at around 25% for the year. David Raso \u2013 ISI Group : And in that same spirit, thinking about the repo for the next year, just again I know it\u2019s only July but framework. This year roughly a $1.4 billion. Just trying to think of a normal framework for \u201815 just given your cash flow and balance sheet? Is $800 million, $900 million kind of number the right way to think about, just framework for continuing repo going forward? Sue Carter : I think as we think about it, I would say let\u2019s hold on to somewhat about 2015 until we get later in the year, see more of the activity and continue to evaluate where we are. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein: Hi, thanks. Mike, nice quarter. Good morning. Could you comment on M&A Mike and consolidation? We\u2019ve talked about it lot in the past. What\u2019s your current thinking on that and where we are at this point in time? Mike Lamach : Yes, well we always have the mirror we hold up which is share buyback. You can do something that\u2019s more accretive on EPS, margin, ROIC. We probably do it, if it fits right into the core business, meaning that it\u2019s new technology, inter-related business that we can use our consistent distribution to do or vice-versa, we might have a gap in distribution and the distribution actually do more of what we do today. So quite frankly if we found those things, we would them Steve, and I think that\u2019s the key is there being selective as we have been and not paying [indiscernible]. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. And then just to follow-up your answer to the other question on incremental and fixed cost reduction, it looks like your restructuring opportunity evidence ebbs and flows here, but given how much of the cost base you still have to address on the lean side as well. Can you describe the sort of longer term restructuring these run way that\u2019s left inside the existing portfolio? Mike Lamach : Yes, as it relates to factory utilization, just think as a bit where you\u2019re going with lean. You could think about the fact that we\u2019ve taken so much that physical footprint out which has given us that 40%, 50% operating leverage over these past five years, we feel pretty good about the factory footprint at this point in time. And although it\u2019s always a thing or two we might consider doing, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re doing any wholesale changes to that where we\u2019re very well utilized across the business. And so lean at this point in time, more about making sure that as we see business pick back up we have the capacity, we have the ability to handle more throughput through the fixed cost base, and that again will help ensure that we\u2019re getting operating leverage at least equal to gross margins of business which would be the plan. That\u2019s how we think about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan: Hi good morning. Mike Lamach : Hi Steve. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan: Just on HVAC first. What percentage of your sale this year do you think are going to be 14 SEER and above, and using kind of rule of thumb, I don\u2019t know, 15% to 20% higher priced 14 versus 13 SEER. Is that fair? And then just on HVAC, the commercial stuff you talked about the applied markets. It doesn\u2019t sound like anything in Climate is going to get worse in the second half or it actually sound like maybe things could get a little bit better, but you have a consistent growth rate there, maybe just talk about that dynamic as well? Mike Lamach : Yes, Steve, the first part of your question. 14 versus 13 SEER, the industry price is somewhere between 19% and 21% difference between 14 and 13 with the expectation I think that 13 saw decline probably more cost reductions on 14. And therefore probably a lower differential from what was 13, so what will then be 14. I don\u2019t have a breakdown in front of me Steve on 14 through. We had nice sure gain there, so it plays to our strong suit because we are seeing a mix up particularly as you\u2019re looking at 16 and above for being nice actions there for us. And then to your point, we\u2019re mildly optimistic. Our forecast for applied, unitary or commercial HVAC in general would tell you that we expect stronger back half than first half. So it\u2019s marginally strong but it\u2019s a better second half than the first half. That\u2019s again going back to this point that the market prognosticators show that happening. We see that happening. Albeit we think that not be very steep inflection point that are more forecast to the industry data. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan: In any way to quantify that pipeline comment you made whether it\u2019s bidding activity or any numbers, high level numbers to quantify that and help us understand how \u2013 because I think JCI made the same comments about how optimistic they were maybe carrier this morning as well in North America but it\u2019s kind of hard for us to get our hands around it. And any kind of high level data around that pipeline? Mike Lamach : Yes, Steve, actually interesting for us because there is two things going on. One is the pipeline is improving but the second activity here is making that a little bit difficult to give you an exact answer which is that in most of our climate businesses, there is a market coverage initiative on your way which is looking to make sure that whether it\u2019s by ZIP code or by country or by region or places we get our hands on it, what\u2019s our coverage ratio of the market, how many projects are we finding, what\u2019s the density of our revenue per available square foot of HVAC content. And what that\u2019s doing is driving investments into these markets, additional sales people for market coverage. So you\u2019ve got a combination of market coverage and improved pipeline giving you a larger number than I think what\u2019s actually going to be reported by some of our competitors. So I don\u2019t want to give you a wild number on that. A year from now, I think we\u2019re bit more normalized there. That would be the number that I hope we could report to you bit more would be bit of a leading indicator on pipeline, but I would not be comfortable to throw out a big number at you today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi. Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mike, if we could stay in that residential mix topic. We did a survey earlier this quarter shows a pretty interesting demand characteristics, cluster demand both at the very low end, the 13 SEER but also a lot of intercept at the high end, and you just mentioned that the 16 SEER and above. So how are you positioning the portfolio today towards that higher end? You have all of the SEER levels represented, and how do you expect that demand for both the highest and lowest end to play out? Mike Lamach : Yes, Deane, it\u2019s mixing up which is good always for Trane and for American standards, good for us. Our strategy is always been to make sure that we\u2019re shoring up sort of the13 and 14 which I kind of see as one bucket. And then really however you play 15, but 16 and above would be higher efficiency systems that always has been a strength. It continues to be of strength, both in dealer base but also in the product portfolio. So the key there is we want to continue to have that historical Trane strength, American Trane strength in the higher SEER systems but we\u2019re making a lot \u2013 we\u2019re making a lot of progress in the 13, 14 as well and so it\u2019s really playing both. Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup: That\u2019s helpful. And in showing us these five new chiller products makes the question. What type of growth investment have these chillers \u2013 just broadly in terms of new product introductions, what type of growth investment has this involved and where do you stand on your product vitality? Mike Lamach : Yes, that set of investments there would be somewhere north of $100 million is what you\u2019re seeing on that page [ph] there. That\u2019s been part of what we\u2019ve been talking about for four or five years. We started on that ECTV [ph] project I think when I was still running Trane commercial in 2009. So it takes four, five years to be something like that, now they come out much faster than that, which is a good sign but vitality is good. The vitality for the Trane applied portfolio really kind of the off the charts in the next five years, won\u2019t make any sense. It won\u2019t be meaningful, it will be almost a complete transition of the product portfolio. Unitary, we\u2019ve been at that and kind of cycling through, so it\u2019s a more normalized kind of 20% to 30% number that must be there, but applied will be 50% to 100% probably over the next say three to five years. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question today. Our final question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks for letting me in guys. Good morning. So I just wanted to switch to acquisitions. You addressed that question a little bit earlier, but obviously I\u2019ve seen sometime since you did an M&A deal. And obviously the bias is still towards buyback, but are you actively pursuing acquisition opportunities both on opportunities at this point, and if you are, what are you seeing in terms of pricing opportunities? Mike Lamach : Yes, Nigel, same old broken record with me. I can tell you it\u2019s well over 100 things that we looked at in the five years since I\u2019ve been here, in this job. I think it\u2019s been three years maybe five tops that we\u2019ve had a real interest in for various reasons. So it\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t been looking at exercising that muscle all this time. It\u2019s just the longest time simply was not as good as the share buyback was. So we\u2019ve made the right decisions there. So as we look in the future, we\u2019re going to continue to hold up that mirror and understand which is more accretive and over what period of time. And that\u2019s the same old answer I am out with. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then just switching back quickly to Industrial, the ad business. I know we\u2019ve kind of \u2013 I had a few questions upon that already, but just approaching it from a different perspective, you\u2019re clearly outperforming Atlas Copco. And I\u2019m wondering, you mentioned share gains in air free and particularly in Europe but \u2013 sorry, oil free, but if we look at small systems versus larger systems, do you think that this outperformance was primarily in mix shift issue or do you sense you\u2019re gaining the share in both smaller and larger systems? Mike Lamach : It comes back to basics. The feet on the street in the right places. It\u2019s been a constant drum beat on the portfolio innovation there on change, as that continues it\u2019s a similar story as our applied HVAC business in terms of what that roadmap looks like or a product portfolio going forward. And when we launch those products, we in fact launch them feature that are superior to competition at margins that are superior to what the replacement product was. So the double effect when we launch products that we should have margin expansion and growth. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing there. So there is no magic there. It\u2019s been \u2013 that group has been hard at it for five years like the Trane team has. They had a earlier market recovery when HVAC of course had much more supporting incremental margins for the first three or so years of that. And hopefully that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see in the HVAC business going forward. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back for any closing comments. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Karen. Thank you everyone. John and I will be around for any follow-up that anyone has. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day.",

With that, please go to slide 3, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Great, thanks, Janet, good morning and thank for you joining us today. In the third quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.10. There was a small amount of restructuring in the quarter, it was less than a penny so reported and adjusted EPS are identical. That\u2019s a 21% increase versus adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2013. Revenues were $3.4 billion, up 5% versus last year on a reported basis. Revenue growth was about a point higher than our guide which was to be up about 4% for the quarter. We saw somewhat stronger revenues in transport particularly in auxiliary power units and marine equipment and in commercial HVAC equipment in both North America and Europe. Revenues were up 6% excluding currency. Orders were up 7% in the third quarter and up 8% excluding currency. Climate orders were up 9% led by auxiliary power units, marine units and commercial HVAC equipment orders. Industrial orders were up 3%. Adjusted operating margin which excludes restructuring was up 90 basis points. Climate margins increased 120 basis points; industrial margins were headwind of 110 basis points. For the company pricing exceeded direct inflation that has each quarter for more than three years. Operating leverage was 31% on an adjusted basis. On the year-to-date basis we have delivered 110 basis points of margin improvement. We repurchased 2.6 million shares in the third quarter. We have narrowed the range of our full year forecast the midpoint of guidance for adjusted EPS of $3.22 is unchanged and now includes diligence and transaction cost related to the Cameron acquisition that we were not in our July guidance. I\u2019ll give you some more detail on the fourth quarter and the year in a few minutes after Sue walks you through more details on the third quarter. Sue? Sue Carter : Thanks Mike. Starting at a high level again, our reported bookings for the quarter were up 7%, revenues were up 5% and our operating margins without restructuring were up 90 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share were $1.10 versus midpoint guidance of $1.03 the $0.07 fee came from a few areas.  As Mike said revenue growth was about a point higher than mid-point guidance which would be about $0.03 earning. The currency exchange impact from Venezuela which we have point out as an estimate in our third quarter guidance of $10 million cost or about $0.03 did not occur in the quarter. So that was three of the $0.07 difference plus the revenue. However, the risk in Venezuela remains and we\u2019ve rolled that now into the fourth quarter guidance. The tax rate and share count were each about a penny favorable. FX excluding the Venezuela item was about a penny unfavorable to guidance. So that gives you the full $0.07. Now if you'll go to slide four. Orders for the third quarter of 2014 were up 7% on a reported basis and up 8% excluding currency. Climate orders were up 9%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digit. Transport orders were up over 20% and as Mike said led by auxiliary power unit and marine unit orders. Orders in the industrial segment were up 3%. So if you can go to slide five. So look at the revenue trends by segment in regions, the top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company third quarter revenues were up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 6% with commercial HVAC revenues up mid-single digits and transport revenues up mid-teens. Residential HVAC revenues were up low single digits. Industrial revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and excluding currency.  I\u2019ll give more color on each segment in the next few slides. For the bottom chart which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 6% in the Americas, 9% in EMEA and Asia was down 2% all excluding foreign exchange. Within Asia, China revenues were down mid-single digits in the quarter with climate revenues down low-teens and industrial revenues up slightly. Now go to slide six. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from third quarter 2013 of 11.8% to third quarter of 2014 which was 13% for an increase of 120 basis points. This chart is on a reported basis. We\u2019ve clearly spiked out the impact of restructuring cost for you which was 30 basis points of tailwind year-over-year. Volume mix and foreign exchange collectively were 80 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continue to outpace material inflation adding 10 basis points to margin. We have been consistently positive on this measure for more than three years although we\u2019ve foreshadowed in each earnings call this year the gap has narrowed as we move through 2014. Productivity versus other inflation was 60 basis points of positive impact in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and restructuring were higher by 30 basis points in total. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 60 basis points of headwind from investments, those are the new product investments, channel expansion and also IT. There was a 30 basis point benefit from lower restructuring cost. So if you prefer to look at this on an adjusted basis, adjusted margins increased a net of 90 basis points versus the 120 basis points on a reported basis. Leverage in the quarter was 31% excluding restructuring from last year and 27% in the segment. Climate\u2019s leverage at 34% was strong across both the HVAC and transport businesses particularly in North America and Europe. Now if you'll go to slide seven. Let\u2019s talk about the climate segment. The climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King Transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.6 billion that is up 6% versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digits. Orders were up mid-single digits in the Americas and Asia. HVAC orders were up more than 20% in Europe, Middle East and Africa with strong increases in both applied and unitary products. Commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single-digits. Revenues were also up mid-single digits in Americas, up low-single digits in EMEA and down in Asia. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up mid-single digits. HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were also up mid-single digits versus prior year. Growth in worldwide unitary equipment revenues more than offset lower applied revenues.  Thermo King orders were up over 20% versus 2013 third quarter led by increases in marine equipment, auxiliary power units and North American trailers. Thermo King revenues were up mid-teens with truck trailer revenue up low-teens. Bus, APU and marine equipment revenues were all up over 20%. Residential HVAC revenues were up low-single digits versus last year. Unit volumes were also up low-single digits and mix was positive. The adjusted operating margin for climate was 14.3% in the quarter, 120 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2013, due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Now let\u2019s go to slide eight. Third quarter revenues for the industrial segment were $741 million, up 3% from last year\u2019s third quarter. For the industrial segment excluding Club Car, revenues were up low-single digits and orders were also up low-single digits versus last year. Excluding Club Car revenues in the Americas and Asia Pacific were up mid-single digits while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa declined.  Club Car orders and revenues in the quarter were up slightly, growth in utility vehicles offset a decline in Gulf markets in the quarter. Industrial\u2019s operating margin of 14.8% was down 110 basis points due to inflation in investment spending partially offset by higher volume, productivity and pricing. We have increased investment spending in industrial versus prior year product development and advance of upcoming regulatory changes and infrastructure investments to support channel and services. Let\u2019s go to slide nine. Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4% of revenue in the quarter. The increase versus prior year is from higher receivables in inventory, partially offset by higher payables balances. Day sales outstanding is up mainly due to mix of business in higher terms in certain geographies such as China. On inventory, we have been intentionally increasing stock levels, inventory levels of key assemblies in order to ensure availability of supply. Year-to-date September free cash flow was $417 million. Our full year cash flow forecast is 800 million to $850 million versus prior guidance of $850 million to $900 million. The change mainly reflects investment we are making in inventory to support key stocking levels and support the regional standards change in residential HVAC that translates the free cash flow of 90% to 95% of net income.  Please go to slide 10. We repurchased 2.6 million shares for approximately $160 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date September we have spent $1.2 billion in share repurchases and repurchased about 20 million shares. Our forecast for the year remains to spend 1.375 billion on repurchase.  And with that I will turn it back to Mike. Mike Lamach :  Great, thanks Sue. Please go to Slide 11. In August we announced our agreement to purchase the Centrifugal Compression division of Cameron; this chart was shown during the webcast we held of the day of announcement. It\u2019s great fit with our compressed air business it generates value for our shareholders, and it\u2019s decretive to all of our key metrics. It adds to our core compression capabilities and it adds throughout the range to our compressed air business.  Please go to Slide 12. There are no updates to the timing of the closure. Everything is progressing according to schedule; we still expect to close in the fourth quarter. The forecast I will go into next does not include any operational results for Cameron. We will update you once we know the closing date.  Please go to Slide 13. Our full year revenue forecast for growth was about 4% is unchanged. There has been some movement within the climate segment, where transport is going to come in somewhat stronger given the orders we have in hand for marine containers and APUs that will ship this year which is offset by somewhat lower HVAC revenues in Latin America and Asia and the impact of negative foreign exchange. Please go to Slide 14. For the full year as I said we still see revenue growth of about 4%. We are adjusting our full year 2014 earnings outlook to a range of $3.17 to $3.21 on a reported basis. For the full year we now expect to spend about $0.03 in restructuring versus $0.05 in our prior guidance. So on an adjusted basis in a range of $3.20 to $3.24. This includes absorbing some transaction cost related to the closing of the Cameron acquisition which again were not in the July guidance. There was no change to the full year average share count value to 275 million shares the tax rate of approximately 25%.  Fourth quarter 2014 revenues are forecasted to be up approximately 3% to 4%. We expect mid-single digit growth in climate and low single-digit growth in industrial. Fourth quarter GAAP, continuing earnings per share are forecasted to be in a range of $0.68 to $0.72. Restructuring costs are expected to about $0.01 in the quarter, so on an adjusted the EPS range is $0.69 to $0.73. The difference between the prior fourth quarter guidance and current guidance is from a negative Venezuelan currency impact estimated of $0.03 to a timing moving from Q3 to Q4 to as Sue discussed, some timing of shipments between Q3 and Q4 versus the July view and transaction cost related to the closer of the Cameron acquisition which were not included in our prior guidance. We are assuming an average share count of fourth quarter of 270 million shares and a tax rate of about 25%.  So the EPS bridge versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter in the appendix for your reference. So in closing we are pleased to have delivered above our earnings commitment in the third quarter with solid performance against the macro headwinds. I continue to feel good about our positioning and our focus as we head into the final quarter of the year.  With that Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator :  Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague of the Vertical Research Company. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Company : Mike can you give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the applied market, whether you are seeing any signs of churn there. And maybe if there is any geographic color to put around that is kind of the first part of the question. Mike Lamach :  Sure. Applied equipment revenue was down closed and ubiquities, but applied revenues were actually up in North America kind of mid-single digits. So we saw that the weakness really in all regions except North America. And so that really Jeff I think is the first quarter that we have seen kind of mid-single digit growth. And I think if we were to see another quarter or two of that we feel better going into 2015 as there would be moderate recovery in institutional construction. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Company : Then secondly, just on industrial can you give us some color on the investment spend and maybe more importantly how does it continue going forward, obviously there is some slide down in your log but maybe give us some color on where that lays geographically between the segments. And do we see that tapering off into the new year. Sue Carter :  Let me give that a shot Jeff and talk a little bit about industrial and I will kind of broaden the question a little bit and talk about some of the things that that we were doing. So when we think about industrial and we think about where we are and where we are with the third quarter results, there is a piece of this that says that as we have gone through 2014 and we've looked at this. The first quarter created a quite a hole for us and we knew that and we knew it was going to take some aggressive actions to get back to the target on operating income margins for the year.  In addition to that as we have gone through the year we have been looking at these businesses sort of the new structure and we\u2019ve been looking at growth and the businesses and prioritize, good payback investments that are going to support growth, they\u2019re going to support product development, service infrastructure investments, channel investments like I talk about in the script. So as we were going through the third quarter we looked at where we were again climate has been over achieving. We did accelerate some of the investments in industrial and again looking at new products to prepare them for the upcoming technology efficiency standards, investments in channel and services and in addition to that as we thought about the back half of the year, we were expecting perhaps more recovery in Club Car than what occurred. So Gulf markets have really remained down as we\u2019ve gone through the year. And so when we think about industrial then going forward nothing that we\u2019re seeing in the investments that we\u2019re making is not going to change our longer term margin opportunity for industrial and we expect them to have margin improvement in 2015. Mike Lamach : : Jeff I probably add on here little bit and say when you back up and look at the longer term guidance we\u2019ve given around 15% to 20% EPS growth in \u201814, \u201815 and \u201816 we\u2019re tracking at about 21% at the mid-point of the guidance we\u2019re giving right now. And with bookings being so strong in the third quarter and really setting up well for the fourth quarter in 2015 there is no reason when we see a good idea here not to act on it pull it forward and really build and protect against the 15%, 20% EPS growth in '15 and '16. So I think that there are no surprises here and I want to emphasize there is absolutely nothing wrong with this business, these are investments that we fully expect to have a return in \u201815 and \u201816 and we\u2019d expect that business to return to normal incremental margin expectations of \u201815 and \u201816. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley :  Yes, thanks good morning guys. I just wanted to follow up on Jeff's point on the industrial margin and I just want to -- you thought of two points, one was the investment spending which you just went through, that sounds like that\u2019s going to taper in 4Q in \u201915. But you also called that inflationary pressure as so maybe if you could discuss that and Mike just I couldn\u2019t help but reiterate that you put out that 15%, 20% for \u201815, do you still feel comfortable with that target for \u201815 right now? Mike Lamach :  Yes, Nigel first of all we\u2019ve laid out a 15%, 20% \u201814 \u201815 and \u201816, \u201814 happened about how we bought relative to growth in the market leverage per share count tax and buyback all being factors that are yielding a year that should be just a bit up top of that range and again we\u2019re looking at this thing a little longer term, and that just quarter-to-quarter and there is some opportunity particularly in the industrial segment where we think that we can accelerate growth much like to see that acceleration right now and find it is going to take just a little bit of investment and want to be smart about that but I have no reasons to have any different expectation than 15%, 20% EPS growth \u201815 and \u201816 as we see about. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Sue Carter :  And then to repeat Nigel on your question on the inflation that we referenced in the press release. So there is a bit of material inflation that happens on the industrial side of the business, again it\u2019s not something that is unexpected but it is inflationary pressure. There is also inflation that occurs from our businesses with people, with compensation and different pieces of just year-over-year inflation again, none of that would be an unexpected event for the businesses, what you balance that which is that sometimes in the businesses and this in particular occurred with the industrial side is that the productivity is a little lumpy which means that we had some productivity that was better in Q2 versus Q3 but the inflation numbers were a little higher in Q3 than they were in Q2. So you got some flips and puts and takes between the couple of orders but again there is not an inflation that was something we wouldn\u2019t expect for this unusual for the business and these are normal things that occur. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Douglass of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research :  Good morning everyone. Can you discuss, you talk about applied but unitary must have been at least up high single digits, can you discuss what\u2019s going on in commercial unitary? Mike Lamach :  Yes, actually a very successful quarter for us worldwide unitary equipment was up high-teens in the third quarter so that was a success. Train, commercial, unitary revenues were up by low-teens in the third quarter that was certainly a positive for us as well. High-single digit in Americas, a very strong growth in Europe, and a decline in Asia. So again high-teens unitary orders and then good revenue flow through in the quarter across the inventory business again low-teens. Good continued success in the Americas high single-digit. EMEA was really outstanding again sort of a high mid-teens in Europe, Western Europe I should say, a little bit higher than that in the Middle East. And all that brought down by the events of what was happening in Eastern Europe. So a good quarter. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research :  Thank you. And then can you talk about how you are approaching the regional standards in the U.S. and Brazil. Are you anticipating a significant pre-build but not necessarily pre-buy in fourth quarter? And how are you seeing that play out with your distributors in 2015? Mike Lamach : : Yes I would say Mark as of today the impact is going to be very different for each OEM depending on what their channel structure is. So I think you are going to see different results that are going to phase in over the year and actually you are seeing some volatility in order and shipments rates between OEMs in the res business. As you probably know we own part of the distribution and part of its independent. We have been talking to our distributors and our dealers and even among them it's not one size fits all, it depends on their liquidity, their stocking capacity and the strategy that they want to employee themselves for management transition. But as we see it today we will have some pre-buy and we will certainly have some pre-build in the fourth quarter and as we are following the situation closely. We have plans in place for both. And we are flexible enough to adjust accordingly as it evolves within the quarter. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Hi, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the overall segment incremental margin. So I think you talked in July that it should be in the mid-30s this year. And if that\u2019s still the case that would imply maybe mid or high-20s for Q4. I just wanted to check that was still correct? And then related to that should we see that number pick up into next year more akin to the gross margin level of sort of 30%-31%. Sue Carter :  So I think Julian when we look at the full year of 2014 at the midpoint level for the full year, what you see is an incremental leverage of about 33%. And then in the fourth quarter what you have is a segment leverage of about 30%. So overall when you look at first half, second half they are pretty evenly weighted. And again I think as we talk about going forward we would continue to expect that sort of the threshold would be at the gross margin level for its leverage expectations. Mike Lamach : : Yes that\u2019s right Julian. I think really in your prudent modeling would probably have us telling you something more like 25% along breakage when things go right for us, like they've done a lot this year. We might see something closer to gross margins; in fact depending on where that business is coming into us, there could be some leverage against fixed assets depending on what we have done there at the time. So 30% is probably a good more aggressive number, 25% more prudent. And there will be some volatility I think in quarter-to-quarter but again over the full year and then over a long period of time now four years or five years we have been able to pretty consistently have those top quartile incremental margins and that\u2019s a pretty important part of our commitment strategy how we run the business. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks. And then just on the industrial business. I just wanted to clarify that; price mix for you was about zero in that business in Q2. Was it around zero in Q3 or it went negative? Sure Carter :  No it was around zero in Q3 also. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great, thank you. Mike Lamach : : Yes Julian price would have been just a touch higher material emplacement but so close that it rounding correctly is about flat. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research :  Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to get a little more clarity on the $0.07 you called out for the Q4 reduction versus last guidance. So $0.03 on Venezuelan currency. And then is it fair to say the other $0.04 is all revenue related and some mix of that's FX and something else. Because it sounds like you are calling out continued strength in margins. So maybe just a little more clarity in terms of how you broke that or how you are thinking about that. I am looking at the bridge but the bridge is just year-on-year and not your change in thinking from last quarter to this quarter. Sue Carter :  Right. So what you would end up with Steve is you would have the Venezuela as we called it out. We also called out having some of the Cameron cost that were in there. And as we have said in August when we announced the transaction about a penny or two on the cost for the Cameron fees. And then as you think about it and as we talk about it today we may have had some revenue that was holding to Q3 versus Q4. So nothing again other than really sort of those raw components but the biggest two pieces being Venezuela and also the addition of the expected Cameron transaction cost. Mike Lamach :  Yes simply for me Steve, three pretty much coming out of Venezuela a couple coming out of Cameron one currency maybe even. Sue Carter :  Yes, yes. Mike Lamach :  And the balance of that is just being a little bit more sensitive to the volatility of what we\u2019re seeing with some of the order rates and China is a great example where you\u2019re seeing volatility one strong booking this quarter followed by a weak bookings quarter and lag of course to a revenue quarter and so on so forth. So the volatility here in Latin America is weaker and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change for the balance of the year in addition to China. So it\u2019s a little bit of market but I would say the market is probably a penny exchange on the balances just Cameron and Venezuela. Sue Carter : What I would also state though for those on this call is we take Venezuela at $10 million as we went through the mid-point of the year which is what we had in the third quarter numbers and we rolled that into the fourth quarter numbers, that\u2019s an extremely volatile situation. The number could be different than the $10 million but we weren\u2019t going to play with making any changes in our overall guidance for what that might be doing because we just simply don\u2019t know. I mean it is just going to continue to move and if there is a negative impact from that we\u2019ll balance it off of the $10 million but that\u2019s not a known number, that\u2019s the piece that we put into the guidance and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that with things down there.  And I just want to make sure that clear that, that\u2019s the number that we write that and put into the guidance. Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research :  Sue is that -- which exchange rate did you use to get to that? Sue Carter : [indiscernible] the normal rate wasn\u2019t the CCAB [indiscernible] one or two rates. Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research :  And then for my second question if I could, just the VRF, what do you think on VRF penetration and how that\u2019s affecting you good and bad through the quarter? Mike Lamach : Can you repeat that? Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research :  Yes, Variable Refrigerant Flow, VRF penetration in the quarter? Mike Lamach : That's a really good growth in the quarter Steve, really good growth in the quarter all regions of the world and as always point out continued penetration of ducted and ductless markets as well. So it\u2019s a good balanced approach but good success with VRF excellent growth coming in all regions with the line. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: On the resi stuff so should we just basically think about the difference in free cash flow as kind of your best estimate of the type of inventory you\u2019re going to build for this transition? Mike Lamach : There is puts and takes in there Steve, see we normally have without a pre-built sort of a laying down and lower working capital we got to add back on top of that. So it\u2019s not completely in that number but the change in thinking certainly I think will be attributable largely to our thoughts around pre-built. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. And then when you think about the transition, do you expect it to have, there are a lot of moving parts here and do you expect it to be kind of a net impact next year? Do you think about the kind of mid-single digit industry trend line that we\u2019re in right now? I mean given this is more of a pre-build than a pre-buy, any kind of impacts around margins or growth that you want to call out that you guys kind of planned for this thing here? Mike Lamach : No, it\u2019s little too soon; Steve it happens with certainly \u201814 to your pricing and then just in terms of dynamics as it plays out in each OEM in its own strategy, it's how much inventory that we're rebuilding and holding and again that\u2019s a factor of how quickly those \u201814 comes balancing push against \u201813 and I would say that overtime possibly relatively short period of time you\u2019re going to see some focus on cost reductions coming into the \u201814 so you\u2019re going to cross the competitive space. There is a lot of play there for us to make a call on that now.  The other point I would make that\u2019s the capital question there was some other selective areas where there is quite of bit of order volatility as an example marine container, auxiliary power units even the TK unit that go on trucks. So the vehicle power self-powered truck units, lot of volatility in the order rates there, those are nice businesses for us so you got us holding and bringing in more component inventory as long lead items be able to build against that demand. And it\u2019s really a fine tuning of the working capital for the upside to ensure that we\u2019ve got the ability to take advantage of really good progress and order rates across those businesses. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: What is your mix now -- the last question, what is your mix now of just the baseline \u201813 here, what will mix of \u201813 here be the shares of percentage of your volume? Mike Lamach : Even though if I have that handy Steve, I'll say what, we\u2019ll look for it, take the next question and I'll answer that as we go here. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Berry of Susquehanna. Your line is now opened. Robert Berry - Susquehanna:  Hey guys good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up first on the Resi HVAC impact. How much are you factoring from that in the 4Q outlook? Mike Lamach : : Well for the industry our view of units in the industry has been something to the neighborhood of five points of normal growth and probably a couple of points of growth associated with pre-build. So we end up with sort of a mid to high single-digit residential environment. That\u2019s the environment we think we are playing into and our plans would be commensurate with that. Robert Berry - Susquehanna:  That couple of points is that for just the fourth quarter or is it for the year will be higher in the fourth quarter? Mike Lamach : : I think in the industry it's started already, competitively one large OEM that had a ERP system conversion and put about 30 days of extra inventory into the channel. We've had a couple of other OEM competitors that have had more aggressive campaigns against moving into the channel. So some of that\u2019s happened in Q3. I think more will happen in Q4 but in total I think it\u2019s a couple of points probably to NBU volumes which would put us somewhere in the neighborhood of a range of a low-end of 700,000 and high-end maybe a million units in market and pre-built. Robert Berry - Susquehanna:  And then just finally, could you just update us on what you are seeing changed in Europe since the last quarter in particular industrial I know was particularly strong in 2Q. I think it ended up being down a little bit in this quarter. I know that\u2019s lumpy but. And then in TK in particular just what you are seeing in the Europe environment? Thank you. Mike Lamach : : Yes, thanks. In industrial it is choppy. And so I think your question, I have the answer in it as well. It\u2019s absolutely, it's been choppy large centrifugal air compressor orders are going to be a big swing factor there and that was a difference for us well. With TK it's been again strong growth in Western Europe of course marine container is strong but very, very slowly growth in Eastern Europe probably no growth. I mean there is really no businesses that\u2019s really dry it up until things normalize there. And then with smaller vehicles again small truck, that\u2019s moderated somewhat as well. So TK is slowing down a little bit in Europe but we are picking it up in other areas like in marines. And industrial I would expect to see some choppiness but it ask us to be able to continue to move towards that kind of 1% to 3% sort of growth rate for the year and probably after a couple of quarters I don\u2019t see any big shots happening there. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research :  Hi good morning guys. Just first on the applied side. You talked about strong revenue growth there. I think you have a really tough order comp from last year on a new product line. Can you talk about what orders did? And then I guess prospectively how those are coming along either any log or conversations with your customers? Mike Lamach : : Well you have got one solid quarter I think in North American growth. And if you recall we said last quarter that we thought like we are seeing an inflection point. And so you had the inflection point off the bottom, we had one quarter of good growth. We don\u2019t really describe to the Mcgraw Hill data view as of there is 10 point happening in 2015 institutional construction. I think that we are more likely to see a multi-year mid-single digit in a given quarter or two it may touch high single-digit applied rate. And there's many, many reasons for that, some of which include the availability of field trades and labor to work on these projects for institutional customers. And that\u2019s very consistent with what we are seeing for inquiries and we are seeing in the pipeline of projects that we are looking at. So I'd like to see another quarter or two Josh before we say that kind of is an inflection point but it\u2019s a trend that we would feel good about calling for 2015. But I think it's pointed in the right direction for moderate year. And again a stronger but more moderated recovery than what Mcgraw Hill was projecting. Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research :  What were orders in applied in the quarter? Mike Lamach : : Well I think you are mostly thinking about North America applied because that\u2019s where we would see typically the institutional recovery that we -- that was mid-single digit. Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research :  Okay. And I do recall right that it was a tough comp from last year from than new product. Mike Lamach : : That\u2019s right. Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research :  And then just a follow-up question. As you raw mats playing out here obviously the war on copper has this taken down exposure that overtime. How do you feel about that that price cost after this has been narrowing through the year. As we get into next year should that staying narrow, is there an opportunity for that to widen out or could actually go negative if demand stays choppy? Mike Lamach : : It stays fairly narrow and we've had very good success for some three or maybe more years now driving price in in excess of petrol inflation. It could invert quarter or two. Don't see that happening, but it could happen. But I would expect that over time, over three or four quarters of time rolling you would see a slight premium to petrol inflation and that\u2019s just what we built in to the operating system and into the expectations of product management and in the way that our people can compensate it that self. Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research : Got you. And I guess just underneath that if I can squeeze in one more on the 13.0 pre-built well there would be any change in your view on industry pricing for that 13.0 product versus what its price at today? Mike Lamach : If anybody has got on that it\u2019s a the wild west I think as it comes to expectations around what really happens on that. But if you look at some point it\u2019s not the richest margin product that anybody is selling so I think sensitivity around price cost is narrow enough that there is not going to be really anything crazy happening there. Why go through the operative pre-building if in fact you are going to give it away as part of the 2014 equation. So I don\u2019t really see that as being a significant problem.  And then Steve back to your question I think it\u2019s about 60% on the 13.0 mix cross. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andrew Obin - Bank of America : Hi. Just a question on restructuring we\u2019ll lowered it from $0.05 to $0.03. Are we doing less? Are we changing the timing, are we being more effective? Sue Carter : I think as we have looked at our restructuring for 2014 Andrew we started out with a forecast that said we had a lot of plans that we actioned in the fourth quarter of 2013 and sort of a normalized levels would be in the $0.05 to $0.10 range in 2014. And as we\u2019ve gone through the year what we\u2019ve done is a natural part of the business as we looked for opportunities that made sense. But we did do some pretty heavy lifting on restructuring in the fourth quarter and so as we\u2019ve gone through the year we sort of led this naturally fall out with things that we needed to do and things that fit the construct of how we were running the business and it just happens to be $0.03 this year that is in day predictor of what the future will be but we have put in basically a placeholder that said what was normal and given the work that we did at the end of last year and actually first couple of months of 2014 just wasn\u2019t as necessary throughout 2014 so were at $0.03. Mike Lamach : And the maintenance Andrew I think is sort of if you look back over a long period of time sort of the maintenance that we view around the footprint probably get you some sort of a nickel that we put into recruiting every year but it\u2019s not the big story. We\u2019re generally always looking at, but generally happy with where the footprint actually is, what utilization is and what the available capacity is, hopefully going into some growth coming into \u201815 and \u201816 particularly in the HVAC commercial businesses. Andrew Obin - Bank of America : And just the follow up question on the industrial, as you\u2019re pushing into oil free compressor stays with more capacity, should we be concerned that one of your European competitors would push back and will somehow impair the structural profitability of the market space? Mike Lamach : Well, I'm sure if they did they'd be impairing their own profitability so I\u2019m not sure that wins anybody\u2019s sort of affection in that regard. I would say that the investments that we\u2019re making are few fold, one is, there has been some efficiency rules put in place in China for air compressors that\u2019s moving to Europe and I think it will adopted soon and it eventually in early conversation with DOE it will come to the U.S. and other countries as well. And so it\u2019s really getting in front of a lot of these 2017, '18, '19 efficiency requirements. Our belief is that the grand promise that's been around energy efficiency and around reliability and so what we want to be able to do is to able to continue to sell the most efficient, most reliable product in the marketplace and that\u2019s really what the investment is, certainly it\u2019s not indicative of some oil free pressure that we\u2019re seeing around the pricing, it\u2019s not the story that we had in Q3 or Q4 around the compression in margins, it really is we have not the gulf recovery although our orders were up a little bit we certainly haven\u2019t seen shipments improve across gulf, that\u2019s hurt and then we pull forward a number of NPD and channel investments and set ourselves up in \u201815 and \u201816 particularly well across all of the industrial businesses as quicker. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Steve Volkmann - Jefferies :  Good morning. Just a quick follow up on Thermo King I know guys got some new product there. it seems like its going fairly well, kind of what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s driving the strength? is it an upgrade cycle do you think you\u2019re taking any share and then I\u2019m curious if there has been any move in the margins in that business with the new product as well. Mike Lamach : Well last question first, the incremental margins have been right at expectation and pretty consistent with past performance when the business is growing and leverage there is something unique or really remarkable about the leverage that we\u2019re seeing there. in fact the climate segment the remarkable leverage that comes from the commercial and residential trends in particular. The growth that we are seeing is certainly highest in APUs. When you think about what our truck customers faced, the number one issue that they have is the availability of drivers. A couple of large customers told me that drivers only last about nine months in that business but some of the larger companies have found that by installing APUs in their cabs they were able to significantly increase driver retention. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons we are seeing APUs really expand dramatically even though fuel prices have dropped and it used be that APUs increased as fuel prices increased but this is a disconnect, fuel prices are dropping and the drivers really around driver retention more than anything. Marine container has been good, particularly gen sets, the inter-marine containers have been very strong for us and we continue to leverage new products which is more expensive but with the Tier [indiscernible] new carbon requirements coming into play and that\u2019s driven a lot of -- obviously the revenue upside for us as well. Steve Volkmann - Jefferies :  Great, thanks. And then Mike any thoughts as we get into 2015 about sort of capital allocation. I know you are in the process of obviously big acquisition here but how do we think about things like share repurchases next year or your appetite for further M&A? Mike Lamach :  Nothing's changed in terms of wanting to be smart and practical and pragmatic use of capital in terms of how we are thinking it. We have said that the dividend needs to be 30% to 35%, and we are going to continue to keep pushing on that. And make sure that we are competitive in peer group. We are going to control any share dilution so share buybacks will continue be a harden story. Then depending on what\u2019s starts from there which would probably toggle between share repurchases and acquisitions that are accretive to us accretive in the short term. And we will see where that goes. But we will guide more in 2015 on that but wouldn\u2019t expect anything different than what we have been saying on the last couple of few years. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hey just to follow-on Josh\u2019s question on pricing. It looks like in late September you put through a 2% to 5% price increase in North America commercial. Can you just talk about what\u2019s driving that and what are you seeing from your competitors? Mike Lamach : : Mostly what\u2019s happening is freight prices are really increasing particularly flat bed. So where you are moving really large pieces of equipment. So chillers or extremely large rooftop units, which I think you know we have got a very high share of, those are moved typically over one or more flat beds as opposed to closed body trucks. And the theoretical utilization of flat beds like 106% right now in the marketplace which isn\u2019t even possible other than if you look at what\u2019s happening you got prices going up and trucking companies not really investing in new fleet because they can\u2019t find drivers. So that\u2019s primary driver there is freight for us. And I think that our competitors are seeing the same thing. We probably as a mix have a higher degree of that just due to the mix of applied versus unitary and even the large unitary mix that we have versus their unitary. Some of our competitors only go up to 30 tons to 40 tons and of course we go up to 150 tons of unitary which can take two or three semis to move. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just like the Europe commercial HVAC orders being up 20. Is there any kind of good lumpiness in there as their share gains it just seems kind of an outlier versus what we are hearing in Europe? Mike Lamach : : Well we had that outlier happening now for a while. So I probably can\u2019t hide -- can\u2019t look past the results there. We are doing really well in Europe. New product launches have gone extremely well we have got a great management team on the ground that\u2019s very energized and I don\u2019t know how long it will persist but we are enjoying it for the time being. Operator :  Thank you. And our last question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : So my first question is really around the I guess the elevated investment that you talked about in industrial. Clearly it seems to make a lot of sense given that you are tracking ahead of your 20% EPS growth target. And you are looking to protect your investment in coming years. I guess my question though is, how much of that incremental spending increased this year? I think you guys were talking about like a $60 million plus type rate for \u201914. So I am just wondering how much that\u2019s changed? Sue Carter : : So Joe, if I look at where we are in a full year now, we are probably adding $9 million to $10 million to that $64 million so it now looks more like 74-75 on the incremental basis. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful Sue. And then just my one follow-up is really on just industrial margins. I think when we most recently spoke I think the expectations were to at least kind of try to hold those margins flat. Fully understanding you are investing more in that business today. But what\u2019s the expectation now embedded in your 4Q guidance for industrial margins. And then the corollary to that is how do you think about those margins moving forward into \u201915 on an organic basis? Clearly Cameron is going to change things but it would be helpful to hear your thoughts there as well. Mike Lamach : So one thing in particular. Sue gave you an absolutely true and actual corporate number which is around circa $10 million of investment but even if you look at the mix change of that 10 million it\u2019s shifting much more toward industrial than it is at the climate has been very efficient with the plans and so we shifted actually more of that then we tend to industrial in a little less in climate so that\u2019s a bigger impact of the climate margin just the absolute 10 million for the company.  Incremental margins there should look to recover in 2015 probably certainly at the gross margins but then depending on weather in Q1 and Q2 of next year meaning we don\u2019t have multiple ice storms and the severity that we had in Club Car we should not have a repeat of Club Car in gulf environment Q1, Q2 and that was I guessing $20 million impact to us probably in the first quarter. So if you don\u2019t repeat that and get back to the normal incremental margins in the business hopefully with little higher growth rate which is something we\u2019re looking to it to, is what can we do to these investments to drive a little higher growth that what we\u2019re thinking. We should get incremental margins at or above gross margins for area in 2015. As we enter into that planning process and enter into guidance with you when we talk to you soon in the first quarter we\u2019re going to tune that but that would be a pretty good indictor of what at least my expectation and Sue's expectations would be going in. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just one maybe one follow up to that is the investment, what\u2019s the investment level expected in industrial in 4Q and what\u2019s that delta versus 3Q? Mike Lamach : Look it\u2019s, I don\u2019t have that broken out exactly where you can see it, it probably 50 basis points. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Okay. Mike Lamach : Yes. Operator :  Thank you. And at this time I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for any closing comment. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Sam. Thank you everyone.

The past year demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multiyear strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in our core businesses, matured in key strategic capabilities and delivered excellent financial results. All in all navigating shifts and changes in global markets. For the year our revenues were up 4%, markets were uneven around the globe. Our growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa was double digits where I believe we outpaced the market in most or all of our businesses. Growth in North America was mid single digits, while revenues in Latin America and Asia were lower for the full year due to market and currency headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.33 a year-over-year increase of 25%. Sue will take you through the bridge in a few minutes, so I\u2019ll leave that for Sue on the quarter. There will be some puts and takes but the short answer is that volume and operational leverage with guidance particularly in the Climate segment. We grew adjusted operating margins 140 basis points in 2014. Our Lean focus again showed significant results in the implemented value streams and we continue to invest in the future of the business by funding significant new product development, investing in IT platform and building our channel services footprint and product management capabilities. We generated $810 million of cash flow, our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value and it\u2019s consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continue to increase our dividend with a 19% increase in 2014. We repurchased 22 million shares for $1.4 billion in 2014 funded by the remaining Allegion dividends and from free cash flow. We announced two value enhancing acquisitions during 2014, the purchase of the Cameron Centrifugal Compression division which closed at the beginning of this month and is now part of our compressor business unit and FRIGOBLOCK which we expect to close in the first half of 2015 which will become part of our Thermo King Transport refrigeration business unit. Our performance in 2014 where we outperformed the three year path laid out in late 2013 confirms our conviction to our strategy and positions us well going into a challenging global economic backdrop for 2015. Let\u2019s go to Slide 4. We\u2019ve delivered steady improvements in operating margins over the past three years. Climate margins are up 340 basis points over that period. Overall, our operating margins were up 230 basis points over the last three years despite a tough year in industrial for 2014. As I\u2019ll review when I go through 2105 guidance we expect industrial to recover and a 40% organic operating leverage in 2015. Please go to Slide 5. This chart locks to the change in operating margin from 2013 at 8.9% to the 2014 which was 10.9% shown on a reported basis, but we strike out restructuring Uni-box. Overall margins expanded 200 basis points on a reported basis and a 140 basis points on an adjusted basis. The margin expansion was delivered from a combination of organic growth driven by our strategies to invest in new product and service offerings, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and interim inflation to pipes analytics and value pricing and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our Lean operating system and overhead cost just of Lean altogether outpacing other inflation. We continue to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems and service and sales footprint underpin the future growth of the business. 2014\u2019s margins performance exceeded our annual goal delivering 85 to 100 basis points of margin improvements. I\u2019ve always said that most improvements are not typically linear, but being ahead of goal going into 2015 is a great place to be, given the short movements that the world is seeing in exchange rates and oils and metals markets and the economic ripples that that will create. So, now Sue will walk you through the fourth quarter and I\u2019ll come back and take you through 2015\u2019s outlook. Sue Carter : Thank you, Mike. Let\u2019s slide go into Slide 6 please. At the high level our bookings for the quarter were up 5%, revenues were also up 5%. Foreign exchange was 2 percentage points of headwind to both to excluding foreign exchange both orders and revenues were up 7%. Our operating margins without restructuring were up 230 basis points and operating leverage in the quarter was excellent at 61%. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.82 up 34% versus last year and consistent with Mike\u2019s commentary for the full year, the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter particularly in terms of margin expansion and earnings performance. Let me start by taking you through a bridge to our guidance for the quarter. Let\u2019s go to Slide 7. As you recall we updated our guidance on October 24 to reflect the incremental interest expense from the bond issuance and early retirement of our 2015 notes. So, our starting point on a reported basis is a range of $0.63 to $0.67 or midpoint of $0.65. Okay, get all the way to an adjusted basis since that seems to be where most of you are tracking. Volume and operational performance particularly in Climate delivered a $0.11 incremental to guidance. Our financial statements continued to reflect the official rate in Venezuela and therefore we did not book the recent charge which was included in our guidance. Movements in currencies including the euro, Asian and Latin American currencies resulted in a $0.04 negative versus guidance and $0.04 of other positive items mainly in other income that brings us to $0.79 of reported earnings per share. There were $0.03 of add back in the quarter to bring you to the $0.82 on an adjusted basis. So, with that let\u2019s go to Slide 8 please. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2014 were up 5% on a reported basis and up 7% excluding currency. Climate orders were up 6% and up 8% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid single digits, transport orders were up high single digits led by North American trailer. Orders in the industrial segment were up 3% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency. Given that more of industrials revenues come from outside of the U.S. its foreign currency impact is larger than in Climate. We saw order growth in all regions and industrial products and a small decline Club Car. Please go to Slide 9. Just look at the revenue trends by segment and regions. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company fourth quarter revenues were up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and up 7% excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 5% on a reported basis and 7% excluding foreign exchange. Commercial HVAC and transport revenues were each up mid single digits. Residential HVAC revenues were up high single digits. Industrial revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency and I\u2019ll give more color on each segment in the next few slides. The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis with and without currency. Excluding currency revenues were up 6% in America. Up 22% in Europe, Middle East and Africa led by strong HVAC performance and Asia was down 3%. Please go to Slide 10. This chart shows the change in operating margin from fourth quarter 2013 of 7% to fourth quarter 2014 which was 10.7% consistent with prior quarter, this is shown on a reported basis where we spiked out the restructure to give you adjusted margins as well. Volume mix and foreign exchange collectively were 70 basis points positive versus prior year, pricing was slightly less than direct material inflation impacted by negative price in Asia mainly China. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 210 basis points driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and other items were lowered by 100 basis points and in the box you can see that this was comprised of 40 basis points from investments and 140 basis points from lower restructuring cost. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was excellent at 61%. Please go to Slide 11. The Climate segment includes Train, commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King Transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion that is up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 7% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid single digit. Orders were up in all geographic regions. Trains, commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid single digits. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up low single digits while HVAC cards, services and solutions revenue were up high single digit versus prior year. Thermo King orders were up high single digits versus 2013's fourth quarter with a significant increase in North American trailer orders. Thermo King revenues were up mid single digit with truck trailer revenue down as increases in North America were more than offset by lower revenues in foreign exchange overseas. Residential HVAC revenues were up high single digit versus last year. The adjusted operating margins for Climate was 12.2% in the quarter, 210 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2013 due to volume and productivity partially offset by inflation. Climates operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter. Please go to Slide 12. Fourth quarter's revenues for the industrial segment were $795 million up 3% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and materials management revenues and orders were up low single digits versus last year. Revenues in the Americas were up mid single digit while revenues in Europe and Asia were down low-single digits including impacts of currency. Club Car revenues in the quarter were up mid single digits and orders were down low single digits versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 15.8% was slightly down compared with last year, as volume and productivity was offset by the impact inflation, investments and currency. Please go to Slide 13. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 3.1%, the increase versus prior year was primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory related to the regional standard change in residential HVAC, additionally we have been intentionally increasing stocked inventory levels of key assemblies in order to ensure availability of supply. We had good collections in the quarter with our day sales outstanding and days payable outstanding both improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect our working capital to be in the 3% to 4% range. Please go to Slide 14, cash flow was $810 million in 2014. Cash conversion was 87% for the year below our long term target of 100% mainly by our strategy for working capital as I addressed on the last slide. As you will see when we look at 2015, we expect to be back at that 100% target this year. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities this year given the financing we did in October and the early retirement of 2015 note. Our cash balance was unusually high at the end of December as we have the cash on hand to fund the Cameron acquisition on January 2nd of 2015. We expect free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. And with that I am going to turn it back to Mike to take you through 2015 guidance. Mike Lamach : Great, thanks Sue. And please go to Slide 15. It\u2019s certainly an interesting time to try to predict exactly what will happen over the next 11 months in order to give you guidance. In the past few months the world has experienced discount in oil markets and foreign exchange rates. So I will give you the best view of what we see in the market sitting here today and some more color on how it could be impacted from further improvements in foreign exchange. Starting with North American non-residential, we anticipate the first positive year in institutional market since 2008. Albeit in a more moderate pace than the current batch forecast. We have started to see some positive signs in our recorded pipeline particularly in K-12 education. We continue to see growth in commercial and industrial based on this mid single digit growth for 2015 in North American commercial HVAC markets. We expect Latin American, Asian, European, and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to the up lower mid single digits at constant currency but flat down after considering currency. We expect North American transport market to be up mid single digit in 2015 and European markets to be down including FX. We expect residential HVAC industry motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to be up low single digits in 2015, the revenue should be up mid single digits due to favorable mix. We expect industrial markets to be up low to mid single digits and Gulf markets are expected to be up low single digits. Aggregating those market backdrops we expect our revenues for full year to be up 4% to 5% versus 2014. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind for about 3 percentage points. We report the Cameron Centrifugal business for the entire year and that's going to add 3 points so for organic growth excluding FX front and back at 4% to 5% range. Translating that to our full year outlook by segment we expect climate revenues to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding currency. The industrial segment revenues are forecasted between a range of up 13% to 14% on reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding Cameron and foreign exchange. As Sue noted industrial has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. as compared to Climate. So, industrial expense is more impacted from FX relative to Climate. Operating margins, we expect Climate margins to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. We expect industrial margins including Cameron operations and amortization, but excluding the impact of the inventory step up to be 14.5% to 15.5%. The inventory step up will be recorded in the first and second quarters and is about $12 million per quarter. Since its non cash, and isolated to those two quarters we felt it was more representative of ongoing earnings to spike out the step up and should note that we are in the final validation stages for the purchase accounting for Cameron, for the amortization and step up numbers might move around a little but this is our best estimate as of right now. If you peel out the Cameron impact the legacy industrial business is leveraging at about 40%. Please go to Slide 16. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings for share range is estimated to be 360 to 375 per share. Excluding the Cameron inventory step up which is in the range of 366 to 381, an increase of 10% to 14% versus 2014. When you exclude the impact to bring in Cameron revenue and earnings and for the first time this year, the legacy company is leveraging at about 48%. Given the outperformance in 2014 with full year EPS growth of 25%, we are on path for articulated three year cagier growth target range of 15% to 20% even if they had wins from currency and uneven markets. As a note for 2015, FX is a headwind of about 3% to revenue and $0.17 to earnings. This reflects full year tax rate forecast of 25% in an average diluted share count of 270 million shares. To give you some more insight into the sensitivity to additional movement in currency, in 2014, about 63% of our revenues were denominated in dollars. Only 7% is in China and another remaining 30%. The Euro is about 10%, Asia outside of China and Latin America were 6% to 7% each and other currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the British pound make up the remainder. So our much of the focus has been on the movement and outlook for the euro currency movements in Asia and Americas have been significant for example between August and December, the Yen, dollar and Malaysian ringgit all moved down 10% to 15%. And since half of the revenues in Asia are outside of China this has an impact. We built our guidance around the Euro at 116. to give you some simple math to gauge sensitivity of $0.01 move in the euro means about a penny in earnings. And if all currencies move 1% versus the dollar, although it's very unlikely they will all move the same magnitude that would be about $0.02 of earnings. Now to focus on the first quarter guidance to the right hand column on this chart, first quarter 2015 revenues are forecast to up 4% to 5% on a reported basis and you can see the currency and acquisition impact on the slide. Reported first quarter earnings for share forecast to be $0.26 to $0.30, the inventory step up all hit in the first and second quarters and impact first quarter by $0.03. Adding this back to get to adjusted basis, the EPS range is $0.29 to $0.33. And it seemed this morning there are some questions about first quarter guidance so let me give you some more color now in order to address that. At the midpoint first quarter is about 8% of the total year adjusted earnings and historically it would be closer to 9% or 10% but slightly less than normal. There are few things impacting the first quarter. First it's the portion of the full year Cameron\u2019s earnings are less in the first quarter due to the calendarization of their revenues. Second, the cost are higher in the first quarter than historical due to the timing of the cost incurred relative to our healthcare program and equity compensation trends. Specifically, this year in the U.S. for the first time our employees are all participating in health savings accounts with their health care program. So, employees are in credits their health care saving accounts they are doing certain activities related to wellness. Those fund at the beginning of the year but we will see the benefit to us in the year to lower healthcare cost as we go along.  Third, to get more benefit later in the year from lower copper because of our layering strategy we added the year with copper lock at about 70% for the first half. So, copper movements won't have much impact in the first part of the year. And then finally foreign exchange of course is more negative versus prior year in the first quarter given the variance of rates from the year ago. So, we provided EPS bridges for both first quarter and full year in the appendix and that will help give you the walk from year to year. For the full year 2015 we expect to generate free cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion which is at a long term target of 100% net income. We intend to increase the dividend as appropriate to be consistent with the pat ratio in the peer range. We expect FRIGOBLOCK to close in the first half of this year and we will utilize 100 million of Euros of cash to do that. We anticipate a minimum of 250 million of spending for share repurchase which will offset delusion from equity issuance and that will leave us about 350 million of cash that we see as a toggle between value, accretive acquisitions and share repurchase. We have a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core business and we weigh those risk adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value. So, in closing we are pleased to have delivered another solid year with 2014 margin improvement and earnings growth ahead of our targets, our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multiyear trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvements. Our focus is to continue to grow earning of cash flow through further implementation of those strategies. We have proactively worked to deliver productivity and make good investments for the future. Our new product line is the strongest as it has been in decades. If any of you read the AHR show this week, you saw clear evidence of that. We continue to invest in new product and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems and by further developing our people and our operating capabilities. We continue to execute a consistent value maximizing capital allocation program. So from the progress that we have made and the results we have delivered and believe that we are well positioned as we enter 2015 and for the future. And with that Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi good morning guys. Mike you talked a little bit about the differences between institutional and commercial and some of the momentum you are seeing in K-12, can you put that in terms of apply versus unitary for the year. I guess maybe starting off with what bookings were for each in the quarter and then how you are thinking about the difference between the two businesses? Mike Lamach : Well, the unitary markets globally worldwide and in North America were very strong low double digit team type growth there. So we are seeing that in commercial industrial and obviously some of that happening in small institutional projects where unitary would be applied. You might see more unitary in sort of the lower schools, K-6 maybe some smaller middle schools, you\u2019ll kind of see in the bigger high schools perhaps more applied. So that was kind of the mix K-12 that happened. But, we have worked hard over the last five plus years that we got relative parity in margins between applied unitary and we got good utilization and capacity left for whatever that mix would swing. So, I think that from a company point of view we feel good about the contribution margin as applied more unitary and we feel good about the capacity upside that we have got in our facilities to build out, if we were potentially surprised by better markets we would have the ability to work against that, execute against that. Josh Pokrzywinski : Do you think that unitary pace is applied in 2015? Mike Lamach : Yes, I do. I actually do. I think that applied, you probably look at something more like a mid single digit growth rate. I do think that that will sustain itself over a multiyear period if you look at what's required from an institutional infrastructure perspective that would make sense that that would be the case. So, as you get through that route into multiyear view you may see an exchange where unitary comes back into more normalized low to mid single digit type growth pattern that it could sustain that way for a while. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Andrew Casey : Thanks. Good morning everyone. In the quarter it looks like productivity benefit really accelerated versus last quarter and it was against a little bit easier comp, but that doesn't buy itself explaining. Could you give a little bit more detail on what drove that and kind of what you expect going forward? Sue Carter : So, Andy when you think about what happened in the fourth quarter overall, first of all we talked about that the revenues guide was up and the revenues that came through were good revenues that provided some additional leverage and when you look at the pieces of the business we gone from good productivity out of our cost base, we got some good productivity out of the direct material inflation and from some of our other components of cost whether it would be something like warranty or other item, so really when you take in you look at the quarter and all of the pieces everything was just better than the way that we had looked at it because people in our businesses did a great job of not only executing on the revenue side, but they also did a great job of executing on the cost side which like I said cross board and all of the different categories gave us additional productivity. So, there is no really one big thing that you can look at but - Mike Lamach : Yes, Andy one thing that maybe to emphasize to this point is we would look normally at every quarter on a really detailed risk and opportunity assessment in the quarter and looked at that through the last minute of the quarter end. And it was a case and I wanted to hats off to the team, the whole team sort of business team and functional team because it was a function of executing all the opportunities and managing all the risks in a way where you get the best net out of that that's possible and it's just like that. Andrew Casey : Okay. Thank you. And just quick follow up on that. So based on your description of a lot of things going right it seems like that should be sustainable at least for the short term as that accurate? Mike Lamach : Andy I always say that you have only room for breakage? Okay, I mean that was a perfect quarter for us but compares with the you don\u2019t tell things aren\u2019t perfect so that you are allowing for breakage so we will continue to look at things on a risk adjusted basis and I would suggest that that\u2019s a pretty good leverage that we have in quarter and I dial you back on something looks a lot more like the gross margins of the business for us, okay because that over a very long period of time which is what we have done over five years and going multi years into the future if you are able to leverage that at your gross margins it\u2019s phenomenal, it means there\u2019s no fixed cost investments, very hard to sustain, means keep hard doing that but that would be a fantastic 10 year sort of view and that from the operating system that we are building as we have five good years of that we would like to have at least five more before we call that something sustainable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe just obviously conversations on closing Cameron and maybe just if you can talk Mike about sensitivity of Cameron\u2019s to the oil price and how the operating fund for Cameron has changed if at all since you announced deal? Mike Lamach : Sue will give first crack at that she has been really close, very, very close to that team effectively with sensitivity, oil and gas. Sue Carter : Alright, so Nigel the way that I would start looking at that piece of the business as you divided really into sort of four almost equal categories or pieces of the business, so you got the engineered aero piece of the business which is largely the air separation and pieces you can't replant aero piece there was two pieces though again let\u2019s call each of the pieces 25% of the business for the sake of argument, there was two pieces of business that were really going flux with just the IGR industrial indices. So, those are not going to be as exposed you got the process gas pieces of the business again another 25% of the business and that has some exposure that comes to the oil and gas side but then pieces of the business is going to look at a lot of things that are hydrocarbon. So, well you have an impact from the oil and gas pricing, you also have the piece that says that there was some power generation. So, conversion from vehicle to a lower natural gas price which is a good thing and something that around the globe that business has so products into which it\u2019s not necessarily seeing as much impact as well as petrochemicals which have been strong and so that\u2019s another 25% of the business and that of course the other side of the aftermarket. So again, when you think about the business, the exposure directly to oil and gas is really in that one piece but it is not the entire piece of the business and it\u2019s not just a negative. And one of the things that you asked Nigel was impacts, since we actually signed up the transaction and so what we\u2019ll see is if you recall the commentary when we bought the business was that this is, the long lease bookings for the business so the things that you book in one year going to sell the next year. We saw some lighter bookings in the back half of 2014 before we actually started operating the business. So, we will expect some of the lightness that we talk about is more in the back half. Mike talked about in his commentary that their first quarter revenues were like that\u2019s part of the normal cycle that isn\u2019t anything to do with the market or how we are seeing the business. So, not a lot of oil and gas exposure and truthfully let me expand that out just a little bit and talk about the total company because that maybe another question that you might have is for the total company. I would say you could ask to me the oil and gas piece maybe 2% of revenues something in that range. So, I think we are on solid footing with the Cameron business, we\u2019re looking at the synergies we think we\u2019re going to continue to do a really good job of executing notes and the fourth piece of the business that I didn\u2019t mention was the aftermarket piece and the service piece which is our intention to grow. Nigel Coe : Yes, thanks Sue that was really helpful knowing we definitely thinking -- from the lower price and then just the follow on, on the investment spending with the heard to the industrial margins in 2014 and I am wondering what is the investment outlook for 2015 overall things around, what sort of rate is that growing at and to what extent did investment spent get pulled forward into 2014? Sue Carter : So again, Nigel when I think about the investments spending and I think about 2015 so our incremental spending is going to be up on a year-over-year basis. It goes from something like $64 million up to sort of $82 million number with the investments for 2015 and so here is how I would look at those actual investment is when we start to look at them and we look at where we are investing money. So about 50% of the investment dollars in 2015 are going to be in product and product related type of area. So, I mean that one include any go to market type of pieces out of the investment spend and then you are going to have the other pieces which are going to be the business operating system so call at another 25% and then the IT system and so when you think about sort of that break down and think about it in terms of overall strategy we want to continue to grow the investments in our product and how we go to market with the product. We certainly want to continue to invest in the business operating system per the strategy and those things are really paying off for us. So, we think that those numbers in 2015 are good investments and something that is really going to be helpful for us. Mike Lamach : Nigel, let me add, the remaining piece was with the IT systems and infrastructure piece and we did some of the infrastructure pieces typically that relates to security and some \u2013 and making sure that we were doing that and largely from headquarter basis, it's the best way to spend that as opposed to every business unit making a different decision about that. So that's the source of the other piece of investment. We probably flattened out here from an IT perspective through about 2018 and then we begin to sort of roll up lot of the depreciation in 2019. So that piece of it as you mentioned I think flattens out here in 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Great, thank you and good morning everyone. My first question is on price cost. Like we did get the HR show earlier this week and it seems like you are getting really good pricing on your commercial HVAC products with all the new products that you actually \u2013 that you can clearly there is a cost tailwind as well this year. And I am just trying to understand what\u2019s embedded in your guidance in terms of the price cost tailwind that you should see in 2015? Sue Carter : Joe, let me try that one on and the Mike can add some color if he chooses at the end. So the way that I would think about our pricing versus the direct material inflation which is how we talk about it is, we look to have a positive spread in sort of 20 to 30 basis point revenue. So, it looks a lot like 2014. So, we built that capability and in the pricing with our ability to anticipate and react. So, we are focused on maintaining that spread regardless of sort of what's happening on the commodity side. Now having said that, we are fully aware that copper has come down and in price. Now the impact to an Ingersoll Rand based on the way that we buy copper is really going to be more in the back half of the year. So, we go into the front half of the year being we bought 70% of the copper that we are going to buy. So, you are not going to have a direct impact in the earlier part of the year based on that commodity spend and then we also have exposure on the aluminum and the steel side which are more than the flattish. So overall, in 2015, again you have got the piece that you know with the benefit coming out of copper but we still think that in total direct material is going to have a slight headwind for us and we think we are going to have pricing that's 20 to 30 basis points above that direct material inflation overall. Mike Lamach : Joe, it\u2019s important concept there because we look at scenarios that are kind of 40 basis points of deflation, 40 inflation I would lean more towards the deflationary story than inflationary story but again it was just really testing ourselves around the ability to wrap the spread. The only place where it's been difficult in the quarter for us was really China where you have got just the lot of many local competitors, pricing lower on anticipated cost so that was the one place where we didn\u2019t catch up with ourselves, but it actually was quite close. It wasn\u2019t like we really missed it out there. So, I think that 20, 30 basis points positive spread pick your number on inflation and that's what we hope to do during the year. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s really helpful color guys and I guess maybe my one follow up question here is really on the applied market Mike mentioned earlier that your expectation is below what dodges for 2015 and when I take a look at your order trends for this quarter it looks like you declined. So, I am just curious like what are you seeing in that market today, what gives you the confident that we will get some growth as we head into 2015, it does look like municipal standing has gotten better, I am just curious what you are thinking? Mike Lamach : Yes, actually total [indiscernible] actually up in bookings little bit in the quarter looks embedded but they were up and then as we are talking to our people around the globe and we have the ability of course to see little bit further out with pipeline that we will look at in our sales pipeline and that's more positive reflecting some of the K-12 activities that I mentioned, which I think will translate into bookings in the year. Being that K-12 schools generally are a little bit smaller and typically had a lot of activities between April and September possibility there that we will see some of that come through toward the middle or early fall in the year and that would be a good indication for us that we are seeing momentum there. Our view about being a little bit lighter than dodge has better view now for the long time but particularly in the last year around how institutional cover would really take shape and it has a lot to do with industry capacity of trades people about how funding flows through municipalities and states and just the ability to construct as much infrastructure frankly it's not going to snap back at that double digit rate. I believe that you will see more sustained mid single digit curve going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi thank you. Just the question on the industrial guidance because your sales and margins have been flat there for about four years, but your guidance today for 2015 you have got a decent organic growth rate of 4 to 5 dialed in and I also think you are looking at what close to 40% incremental margins on the underlying business ex Cameron so maybe talk a bit about the conference on the organic growth step up. I saw you had a one good quarter of orders and also why the incremental underlying suddenly take off? Sue Carter : So Julian, when we think about industrial and what's happening in those markets, you are right, as we look at 2015 we have got the revenue growth on the legacy business we are looking at that 40% leverage in 2015. We think that the business has got good line of sight to the market, to the orders that they are expecting. They all been owning their strategies and again if you think about what we were doing with reorganization of the business and going to a business unit structure and focusing on growth that gives us a lot of confidence that we have got people that are looking at right things in terms of the products and the revenue growth they have also been looking in prioritizing some really good payback investments that support the growth those include product development, service infrastructure investments for the business and other channel investments and so when you look at 2015 there are larger percentage of the investment spends and they are of our revenue profile but we think that those are, we think that those are the right things for those businesses to be doing. And so what we think is as you put all of those pieces together with the team is focused on the businesses and growth focused on their different markets and the focus on investments to really grow those businesses that\u2019s what gives us confidence that the business will have that 2015 that we are projecting. Mike Lamach : Julian, mechanically to Club Car last year, last 10 days on a storm about 10 days, first on these issues that we are not going fax really write after that so you don\u2019t have that repeating. So just by having a more normal low single digit Club Car business leveraging at really good margins which it normally would do plus not having to repeat last year ice storm again happened in February. So let\u2019s hope that we don\u2019t get one down there again that out of snap back even mechanically much better just to do that alone. Julian Mitchell : Thanks and then my follow up would just be on the Climate adjusted operating margin, it looks like you are hitting the margin target that one year early, you hit the guidance. So looking beyond that given your running at such a good rate where are you targeting sort of medium term, the margins and Climate can get to assuming no major gyration in organic sales growth outlook? Mike Lamach : Yes, Julian if you recall, our structural view was something in the 14% to 16% range for the Climate so I think clearly, we think there is structural opportunity up in that area so let\u2019s work on that probably next. We are always away from that at this point in time and I think that they are going to continue to see that but again it takes investments, we\u2019re investing heavily into product, channel, service footprint all around a long term view that that\u2019s structural in the business. We can update that in May talk about it that point in time but we are really pleased to be where we\u2019re at this point, it\u2019s great execution by the entire global team both residential and commercial and the service business. So, all [indiscernible] there really. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Thank you very much. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning. Stephen Volkmann : I\u2019m wondering about your comments about building a little bit of inventory in 2015 and I guess I\u2019m just curious your thinking behind that what areas were that be and what gives you confidence of that\u2019s sort of helpful strategy? Mike Lamach : We saw some of the higher margin businesses last year was order volatility that you can literally be 200% sort of a historical rates and so market volatility that we are seeing in the world is translating the order volatility on stock and semi assembled products and we want to make sure is that with that stuff is very quick turn. Somewhat discretionary in terms if you got the product you are going to sell it, we don\u2019t want to be stingy on that we want to make sure we protected against the possibility that sort of volatility and so widening out the corn barns, widening of the stock rates and we think about the certain product in the company that we say if the zero stock of product literally 100.0x you want product you get the product if want it and we really like that when those products, the contribution is accretive of the overall margins of the company. So, margins accreted to the company\u2019s overall margin profile, stock, semi stock, we want to have product when you want to buy it and there is no point with cost to capital being what it is, you feel stingy about that. So it\u2019s just straight economics. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, thanks. And then maybe a quick follow up are there any share changes in any of your product lines that you like to color for us and I guess Thermo King continues to look pretty good and sort of in that vein, are you worried at all about competition in the compressor business with your competitor having kind of euro cost base? Mike Lamach : Yes, if you listen to me for a long enough I don't talk about sort of market share one way or the other much because I think that over the long run if you are growing margins and your growth rate is higher than your peer set, you must be doing good job. Our approach is to be top quartile every single year around incremental margins and organic growth. That\u2019s what we have done over the last five years on margin and last couple of three years on our organic growth profile company. So that's our formula and I can tell you that we feel like the investment and the product and service it's working and I feel like even more that toward the compressed air side of our business, the tool side of our business and fluid side of our business our pro rata as Sue mentioned that is good, good for us as well. We see good growth opportunities. We see some pockets of growth and some niche opportunities for the product that we have assessed. We have done a lot of strategic analytic behind the scenes to support that. So we feel good about that. We are going to poke in those areas. So compressed air, tools, fluids, all big ideas that we have got to kind of throw that disproportional. The product growth team around the company, you heard me talk about that, we have doubled those in 2015, we have got outsized growth and share and margin performance in those last year for the six that we had and feel like we have got the capacity to take on and do six more for 12 in total. I am excited about that going into 2015 eventually really having that match the value stream of the company. In fact all of those product growth teams are actually value streams in the company anyway. So that was pre requisition to selecting those so this is over the next five years looking out I think really good model to draw the company and focus our strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Good morning. I have one question in two parts. On the commodities side, first of all what you are assuming on price, was price realization kind of the majority of that 20 basis points this year. Is that the same thing you are assuming on price and then assuming all other commodities like steel and aluminum are wash and you just marked copper to where it is today, you said plus, minus 40 basis points I am not sure what you were saying but we know it's not going to be a drag so what would copper be? Mike Lamach : My comment on the 40 basis points was rather than trying to be self precise in our ability to predict flux rates to commodities we run cases toward how quickly can we respond or react business in different inflation or deflation environments and could we sustain 20, 30 basis points of improvement. A big part of that though is not just relationship between the cost of commodity and pricing of the current product. Its making sure that there is a an economic value estimation of new product that better value prices what's it's replacing and where there is an opportunity to grow margins on the top line relative to that economic value created, that's the big idea obviously that we are doing fairly well at this well. So the introduction of new products for us is enormous opportunity to raise the margin profile of the company even if we were to hold commodity and pricing flat on the legacy product which is not our goal of course, it's price there too. But, not all that out that's how we come back to 20, 30 basis points positive but on multiple scenario. Steve Tusa : So basically, you are saying is that you are going to use some of that commodity tailwind to drive to kind of get these new products out there? Mike Lamach : No, different thing. The commodity tailwind largely it's going to be reflective on competitive pricing at some point in time. And so that\u2019s going to take its own I think competitive dynamics into consideration. New products that we are launching and when you look at the as an example the energy efficiency or the reliability of the product or the total cost of ownership or other service ability factors that can translate into a value into the customer that's not something that you see a cost for, you see a margin pricing opportunity. That's the kind of thing that we actually want to make sure that we are doing good job understanding that as we launch the product. So there are two different thoughts that both show up in the pricing column. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI, your line is open. Mike Lamach : I just want to make sure that I want to give Steven a crack to make sure that we got is questions so if you could just make sure Steve if you could tell us we got it, I will give you one more crack out if we didn\u2019t if not we will go on. Operator : Steve if you can press star then one on your touch tone telephone. Alright. And our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI, your line is open. David Raso : Hi good morning. My question is on Thermo King for 2015. You mentioned mid single digit growth in North America is a target. Is there a notable slow down that you are looking for in the out quarters I am just trying to understand the initiative seems to be far stronger than that so I am just trying to understand how to read that guidance? Mike Lamach : We are coming off a peak Dave, and I think that as we look at even some of the changes that have made in terms of driver stops and the ability to create additional driver capacity through decent number of inventory stops helps create and unlock a little bit of capacity to our customers. With that being said you are coming really off the peak and so again lapping the new product lapping the old product is not that big sort of revenue price differential that we are going to get lapping out this year to last year we will get something but not much. But early in the year and again this is an early read on the full year, you tend to lock in orders really early lock in customer intend and there is a lot of sensitivity to market and capacity for these customers so throughout the years those intangible rates may change. So that in particular David is a good reason for us to update the guidance in April and July because that number can move around. But right now that really is our best guide. David Raso : But just unclear, is your current backlog or order trends up that modestly? Mike Lamach : Backlog is up a little higher than that. The order trends are okay year at the slow. So it's a forecast that we have got. David Raso : Okay, just the clarification when we spoke to 40% leverage on organic that was pre investment just on clear, is that correct, pre investments? Mike Lamach : 40% organic on industrial. David Raso : I think that was the total company comments, making sure I understand their organic leverage comment. Janet Pfeffer : David this is Janet, it's just basically taking Cameron out of, kind of legacy parts of Ingersoll Rand. David Raso : But it includes the incremental investment for this year. Janet Pfeffer : What? David Raso : But it includes the incremental investment figure for this year. Janet Pfeffer : Yes. Yes. David Raso : It does. Okay. Thank you very much. Mike Lamach : You know actually this morning you are correct I mean you are bringing all of Cameron in this year at the beginning of the year so the math is little bit different. The true incremental of the company is closer to 40 and then Cameron is a start to that okay in the one year. David Raso : Well I guess I will have it then. The currency drag what are you assuming on detrimental to be fair if you are looking for the whole company to have about 145 million of EBIT growth, if you put 40% on organic I\u2019m already up at 230 million so how much is the currency drag? I mean I run the numbers on how you imply $0.17 and I looked it but the drag is only $60 million? Janet Pfeffer : David, this is Janet. I think you are misunderstanding how we use, legacy is the right word, it's the legacy company. So that\u2019s - David Raso : So it must be ex-investment then, is that what you are saying? Janet Pfeffer : No, it's all in. David Raso : Okay, we will do the math offline I\u2019m just saying, you have got 230 million of EBIT growth just from organic growth out of 40% incremental and the EPS comment and currency would suggest currency drag again the currency detrimental must be rather significant. Janet Pfeffer : David why don't you give Joe a call and locate it. David Raso : Exactly. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Just two quick ones. Just back to Cameron, it looks like your guide would imply Cameron revenues something like 360 million for 2015 kind of 12% off to your industrial base so that's down 10% or so from what the 2013 revenues were described as. I don't know if that was just some kind of round numbers in the mix there but are you actually looking for the business to be down that much and maybe just I mean your industrial orders actually look pretty good right up three in Q3 and up six in Q4. What is that about their business that their orders would have been soft in the second half? Mike Lamach : Jeff, when we looked about evaluating the business as we acquired it we had given at 10%, 15% year cut from where it was just based on what we knew that I am glad we did based on what we are seeing. So, your math isn\u2019t too far off. We are somewhere between 350 and 360 and probably how we see that. Sue Carter : Yes, and I think Jeff, when again as Mike said your math is right and when you think about the business being down and we went through all of the different pieces one of the areas where my assessment is that they meet on the booking side in the back half of last year was on the normal booking bill that goes on in the business. Now what causes that I don't know because we weren\u2019t in control but that's something that our team and the Cameron team now part of Ingersoll Rand need to look at for 2015 and really focus on getting that book and bill back in to it. I think the issue is it's not a fundamental issue with the business. It's getting into our operating system and our management team and focusing on the business and just operating. Mike Lamach : Yes, I think the good news Jeff is that we have been really able to kind of go back and look at the EBITDA and EBIT numbers and confirm that we have got line of sight to how to do it based on business case we put together which to your point already was year cut 10%, 15%, as we did the valuation for it. Jeff Sprague : I am just wondering on investment spending and coming around to that the comment that it levels out was that just the ITP, I think it was \u2013 can you just give us a view holistically on investment spent when it might kind of I don't know normalize the sales growth or something that is not a meaningful P&L headwind? Mike Lamach : I will correct on the IT span Jeff, that\u2019s the only one that flattens out. And relative to the business investments it really depends on the pipeline of ideas and there is an innovation review that we are conducting all the time. There are multi generation road maps that we are looking at for the product and we think we have got a pretty good equation here. And again if we could continue to get the same incremental margin in growth in the business we would have no reason to tell you that we are going to ever change the investment profile what we are doing. Now having said that we don't know beyond about 18 months because it really does depend on what that multi generation product plan might look like or what acquisition like in terms of footprint that we are bringing on board to serve channel footprint which is another big part of the investment. So, we are going to give it a year time but what you will see, kind of hear is that we are investing in growth of the company and in the FX performance of the company at about the same rate albeit larger absolute dollar year to year to year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein, your line is open. Steven Winoker : Thanks. Good morning. You spent $200 million for shares, $3 million to $4 million in the fourth quarter but you are holing share count flat I guess at 270 million through 2015, maybe just and what generating about $1 billion you mentioned free cash flow. Just give us sense for why you\u2019re guiding in that way for the rest of the year and what are you thinking about capital deployment more broadly then? Sue Carter : Steve, I think the way that that we thought about it and just modeled it for you was if you take that $950 million to a $1 billion maybe a third of it goes to our dividend. We said that we would follow our long term guidance which is to add a minimum key the delusion from occurring from option exercises and from programs that things are maturing and so we gave it to you in those two pieces and then send the remaining say third of the cash flow that we would toggle between M&A and share repurchases and it\u2019s we just broke it up that way so that you would say okay here is the minimum that they\u2019re going to do and then the piece if we have good M&A candidates that follow along with our strategy for that we would do it and if not we would look to return the cash for shareholders. Mike Lamach : Steve, I think your question about share count, I will bring in the expert too if I get off track we will be issuing shares in the first part of the year at the programs and buying back shares in last part of the year so you are going to see delusion in the first couple of quarters and then you are going to see us coming back to neutral on the back half of the year just the way that it averages share count for the full year. So, average share count it just not beginning, I\u2019m sorry beginning and ending but it certainly yes, extremes of issuing in the first quarter and doing a lot of buybacks towards the fourth quarter. Steven Winoker : Okay and then Mike you talked about risks and opportunities R&Os before in the fourth quarter and how I think you used the words perfect that was for their performance, maybe just give us a bigger idea of how they Rs versus Os, look like they\u2019re balancing out and what you have to believe when you think when you most excited about that list and what you are maybe most concerned about as you think about 2015 results? Mike Lamach : Steve, our philosophy in giving guidance has always sort of net R&O that we see for guidance and for quarter. One of the things that you don\u2019t see in our numbers now as we haven\u2019t put anything in for Venezuela, it\u2019s just noisy for us to forecast that didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going happen at some point probably will happen and we can just update you when something like that actually happens. You also noticed that we didn\u2019t spend much really in restructuring last year rather than putting noise around that if we see something that we need to be doing, we are going to do that and update you on that but probably can manage that within the base that we have got. The rest of the items that show up in here are typically commercial puts and takes when something lose something, it\u2019s all based on pipelines that have typically four levels of commitment everything from we\u2019ve pretty much got at the back to pretty much of the competition got at the back, a case when you get a swinger, [indiscernible] lose one that we were we should have got, as we net those things out, the operational performance of the company is becoming much more predictable in terms of how executing against that and again this is big kudos for the bench strength around the company operationally forgetting the time, quarter-over-quarter, quarter for long time now and managing through that because they\u2019ve their own unique set of R&Os between suppliers that are having floods and fires and suppliers that we are switching out changing, line moves, plant moves and running the day to day so that\u2019s the kind of thing to look at on at least monthly basis. Operator : And now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. A - Janet Pfeffer : Thank you. Thank you very much and everybody have a good day. Joe and I will be around for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Joe Fimbianti : Thank you Danielle, good morning, welcome to Ingersoll Rand's first quarter 2015 conference call. We released earnings at 7 :00 AM this morning, and the release was posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting in addition to this phone call through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find the slide presentation that we'll be using this morning for the call and this call will also be recorded and archived on our website. If you would, please go to slide 2, which is our safe harbor statement. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to vary materially from our anticipated results. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables to our news release. With me this morning on the call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. So if you will please turn to slide number 3, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike Lamach : Great, thank you, Joe, good morning and thanks for joining us. In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.38, an increase of 31% versus last year's quarter. We closed two acquisitions in the quarter, the acquisition of Cameron\u2019s Centrifugal Compression division closed on January 1, so results were included for the entire quarter. We also closed the acquisition of FRIGOBLOCK in early March, so that has a very minimal impact to quarter given that less than one month of results were reported. Both integrations are going very well, Cameron compressor achieved our forecast for bookings, revenue and operating income. We are seeing some early traction on cross-selling and synergies and we expect continued progress for the balance of 2015. Currency had a significant impact throughout the results, so in our comments today, we will mainly focus on organic growth, which excludes currency and acquisitions, but you can get a better view of end market trends. In the first quarter, we saw solid organic revenue growth of 8%, let by strength in the US, and Europe, particularly in the Climate Segment. Order rates remain healthy in the first quarter at 5%, excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted operating margins increased 40 basis points and increased 100 basis points, excluding the impact of currency and bringing Cameron results into our financial statements for the first time. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.07 above our adjusted EPS guidance, mid-point of $0.31. The improvement primarily came from higher than expected volumes, mainly in North America and good cost control and execution to our plans. Foreign exchange translation negatively impacted the quarter by about $0.01 compared with guidance. However, this was more than offset by FX gains recorded in other income. Now, Sue will walk you through the first quarter in more detail and then I'll come back to take you through our outlook. Sue Carter : Thank you Mike, we are very pleased with our performance and our execution in Q1 and as Mike talked about, you're going to see a lot of moving pieces with currency and purchase accounting and we're trying to provide you with a lot of details to facilitate your understanding of the quarter in both the slides and in our comments. So if you would go to slide 4. Orders for the first quarter of 2015 were up 3% on a reported basis and up 7%, excluding currency. Orders were up 5%, excluding both FX and acquisitions. Climate orders were up 2% and up 6%, excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digits on a reported basis and by high-single digits ex-currency. Transport orders were up low-single digits and up high-single digits ex-currency. Organically, Thermo King had strong order growth in North America and high teens growth in Europe. Orders in the Industrial Segment were up 3% on a reported basis and up 9%, excluding currency. Orders for Industrial were up 2%, excluding currency and acquisitions. We saw organic orders increase by low-single digits in air and industrial products, and improved by high-single digit in Club Car. So if you would go to slide 5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segments and regions. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total Company, first quarter revenues were up 6% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 6% on a reported basis and 9% ex-currency.  Commercial HVAC was up high-single digits and transport revenues were up mid-teens, both ex-currency. Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single digits. Industrial revenues were up 7% on a reported basis, up 13% excluding currency and up 4% excluding currency and acquisitions, and I'll give more color on each segment in the next few slides. Bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis with and without currency. Excluding currency, revenues were up 10% in the Americas, 22% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, led by strong HVAC performance and Asia was down 3%. If you back out acquisitions as well as foreign exchange, the primary changes in Americas, which would be up 8%. Please go to slide 6. This chart shows the change in operating margin from first quarter 2014 of 5.7% to first quarter 2015 which was 5.9%. Consistent with prior quarters, this is shown on a reported basis, and we've spiked out the restructuring to get you to adjusted margins as well. Volumes, mix and foreign exchange collectively were 40 basis points positive versus prior year.  Price was positive but was slightly less than direct material inflation. Pricing was most competitive outside of North America. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 80 basis points, driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Productivity favorability was in direct materials, G&A and solid executions including the third phase of our ERP implementation in the first week of April. Year-over-year investments and other items were 80 basis points. This was the first quarter which included results from Cameron and as expected, impacted margins by 50 basis points due to inventory step-up and intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 60 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points positive from lower restructuring costs. In the green box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 12%. Backing out currency and acquisition results, leverage was approximately 20%. Please go to slide 7. The Climate Segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the first quarter were $2.2 billion. That is up 6% versus last year on a reported basis and up 9% ex-currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digits on a reported basis and up high-single digits ex-currency. Organic orders were up in all geographic regions, with notable strengths in North America and Europe. Trane's commercial HVAC first quarter reported revenues were up mid-single digits and up by high-single digits ex-currency. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues and HVAC cards, services and solutions revenue were both up high-single digit versus prior year ex-currency. We saw year-over-year gains in both applied and unitary ducted and ductless equipment. Thermo King reported orders were up low-single digits and high-single digits versus 2014's first quarter ex-currency. Organic orders increased in all regions except Latin America. Thermo King reported revenues were up high-single digits and up by mid-teens ex-currency, with strong gains in North American truck and trailer and auxiliary power unit. In Europe, organic revenues were up high-single digits.  Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single digits with volume gains in all major residential product categories as well as in light commercial products, which were up low-double digits for the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 7% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than first quarter 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation, currency, and higher investment spending. Please go to slide 8. First quarter revenues for the Industrial Segment were $729 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 4% organically, which excludes the Cameron acquisition and currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues and orders were both up low-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in North America were up low-single digits, while revenues in overseas markets were flat. Club Car organic revenues in the quarter were up high-teens from improved sales of golf car and utility vehicles. Organic orders were up high-single digits versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 11.9% was slightly down compared with last year, as we're in the early days of the Cameron acquisition, including heavy purchase accounting impacts and negative currency. For the segment, price offset direct material inflation and productivity offset other inflation in the quarter. We achieved our Q1 plan for the Cameron acquisition and the business will continue to add benefits as we continue the integration process. Industrial's organic operating margin at constant currency was 13.9% for Q1, an increase of 180 basis points over prior year. Please go to slide 9. For the first quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.3%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory, this includes some incremental inventory related to the regional standard\u2019s change in residential HVAC and additionally, we have intentionally increased stock inventory levels of key component assemblies in order to ensure availabilities of supply as we enter the prime selling season for commercial and residential HVAC products. We have good collections in the quarter with days sales outstanding and days payable outstanding both improving over the prior year. Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year given the financing we did last October and the early retirement of the 2015 notes. Our cash balance is at normal levels. We expect free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 to $1 billion. Before I conclude, you saw that we devalued our assets in Venezuela in the first quarter due to the ongoing decline of the Venezuelan currency, this charge was reported in other income and expense and we've adjusted it out of earnings per share given its unusual nature. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through our guidance. Mike Lamach : Great, Sue thank you, and please go to slide 10. So overall, our forecast has not changed materially since the last call in January. North American institutional markets were up in the first quarter and we expect to have a positive year albeit at a more moderate pace than the current Dodge forecast. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofits. Based on this, we expect mid-single digit growth in 2015 in North American commercial HVAC markets. We expect Latin American, Asian and European and Middle East HVAC markets in the aggregate to be up low-to-mid single digits at constant currency but flat to down, after considering currency. We expect North American transport markets to be up mid-single digits in 2015 and European markets to be down including FX. We expect residential HVAC industry motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to up low-to-mid single digits and revenue should be up mid-to-high single digits due to favorable mix. We expect industrial markets to be up low-to-mid single digits. Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up 4% to 5% versus 2014. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 3 percentage points. We expect Cameron centrifugal business to add three points for the year. So, for organic growth, excluding foreign exchange, we end up back at 4% to 5% range. Translating that to our full year outlook by a segment. We expect climate revenues to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding currency. For the industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of up 13% to 14% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding Cameron and foreign exchange. Industrial has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the US than climate. So, industrial experience has more impact from FX as compared to climate. For operating margins, we expect climate margins to be in a range of 12.5% to 13.5%. We expect industrial margins, including Cameron operations and amortization, but excluding the impact of the inventory step-up to be 14.5% to 15.5%. The inventory step-up will be reported in the first and second quarters is about $12 million per quarter. Since it\u2019s non-cash and isolated to those two quarters, we felt it was more representative of ongoing earnings to spike out the step-up. If you remove the Cameron impact, the legacy industrial segment has operating leverage over 50%. Let\u2019s go to slide 11. Transitioning to earnings, our reported earnings per share guidance range is $3.42 to $3.60. Excluding the Cameron inventory step-up, restructuring, and the Venezuela currency devaluation, the range is $3.66 to $3.81, an increase of 10% to 14% versus 2014. When you exclude the impact of bringing Cameron revenue and earnings in for the year and currency, the legacy company leverages at approximately 30% and including acquisitions and currency, we should be in the 25% range. The $0.07 per share outperformance for the first quarter largely offsets the additional currency headwind for the strengthening of the dollar against overseas currencies in the quarter. For example, we built our original guidance at a euro rate of $1.16 and our current forecast is at $1.08. Just as a reminder, the information we gave you last quarter, to give you some simple math to gauge our sensitivity to currency movements, $0.01 movement in euro means about a $0.01 in earnings. If all currencies moved 1% versus a dollar, that would be about $0.02 of earnings. To focus on second quarter guidance, see the right hand column on the chart. Second quarter 2015 revenues are forecast to be up 4% to 5% on a reported basis. You can see the currency and acquisition impact on the slide. Reported second quarter earnings per share is forecast to be $1.14 to $1.18. The inventory step-up, all hits in the first and second quarters and impact second quarter by $0.03. We also expect about $0.01 of restructuring costs, adding these back to get to adjusted basis, the EPS range is in $1.18 to $1.22. We have provided the EPS ranges for the second quarter in the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year. For the full-year 2015, we expect to generate free cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion, which is at long-term target of 100% of net income. We increased the dividend by 16% to be consistent with payout ratio in the peer range. We also utilized the EUR100 million of cash to pay for FRIGOBLOCK. We anticipate a minimum of $250 million of spending for share repurchase, which will offset dilution from equity issuances. That leaves about $350 million of cash that will be put to either value accretive acquisitions or share repurchase. We have a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core businesses and we weigh those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multi-year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of those strategies. We have practically worked to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. We continue to execute a consistent value maximizing capital allocation program. In closing, we\u2019ve given you a lot of data and analysis on our operations this morning. There are lot of moving parts for this year\u2019s numbers and it\u2019s likely to continue as we go through the year. Filtering out all the noise, I hope it\u2019s obvious that our overall business fundamentals are strong. Our investments are fueling our revenue growth and our productivity improvements are on plan. Our two new acquisitions are on forecast and we believe we have purchased two very sound businesses. There is still a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m very pleased with our steady operations, improvements and a growing maturity in our operations. Part of the progress we\u2019ve made, results we\u2019ve delivered and believe we\u2019re well positioned for 2015 as well as for the future. With that Sue and I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Danielle I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, Mike and Sue. Just wanted to -- just kick off first of all with the margin bridge from the slides and little bit surprised to see 20 bps impact from price rolls [ph] this quarter, especially given the [indiscernible] we\u2019ve seen in the raw materials. So, I\u2019m just wondering, can you make some commentary on price and why those negative? Mike Lamach : Yeah, we had positive price in the quarter. We had a little bit of carryover, material inflation, just due to some of the assemblies that we\u2019re working on, but essentially the price would come into the Asian market, particularly China, a bit into Latin America, which really in the last quarter or two, those markets have struggled and we\u2019ve got some local competitors I think with some capacity to utilize and so, that\u2019s been a bit more pressure there. We also had bit of a rebate timing from Q4 to Q1 and if you sort of add that back to Q1 and normalize it, we were pretty close to being flat, which -- it is 20 basis points less than what we had hoped for, but it was fairly flat. Nigel Coe : Are we still looking for about 23 bps benefit for the full year? Mike Lamach : Yeah, we\u2019re challenging ourselves to do that. That\u2019s probably one of the challenge points in the forecast, but our plans, the road maps we\u2019re building, the countermeasures that we got to realize price would have us doing about 20 bps, 30 bps in material inflation gap. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Mark Douglass from Longbow Research. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Mark Douglass : Hi, good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning. Mark Douglass : There is still little bit of conservative in guidance on the organic growth expectations. I suppose some of that\u2019s because 1Q is really seasonally weak, don\u2019t want to read too much into the year, but your trend seem pretty good and certainly outpacing the 4% to 5% organic growth expectations. Mike Lamach : Yeah, I mean, the optimism in the quarter was the strong growth, but as you pointed out, it\u2019s seasonally such an insignificant quarter to the full year for us that we typically go back and fine-tune in July and we\u2019ll do that again this year, but your question and Nigel\u2019s earlier question where we might see potentially some upside to volume, mix was not particularly favorable in the quarter for us. Currency is still quite a bit of headwind if you look at the euro at $1.08 and currencies where we are today, it\u2019s about $0.11 of headwind, we offset about $0.07 in the first quarter, but we\u2019ve got more room to work for the balance of the year and then again the pricing question, we\u2019ve got more aggressive view on pricing for the balance of the year. So, you net it all out, I think it nets out to a balanced view on guidance, but specifically on your question, if we were to see stronger markets and by July, we would probably make a little higher call there at that point in time. Mark Douglass : Okay. And then you mentioned industrial had better than 50% incremental margin in the legacy business. Can you describe what\u2019s really driving such strong incremental leverage? Sue Carter : Well, I think it goes back to Mark when I talked about -- when I talked about the segment is that, if you save a higher impact from currency, right, so, if you take that out, that\u2019s a piece of it and then if you take out the Cameron acquisition that it\u2019s in its early days and it\u2019s got all that purchase accounting, the business for the segment itself actually had positive price versus direct material inflation. They actually had productivity that offset inflation and so, they actually had a very nice quarter in terms of operational performance that underlie the basics of that. So -- and also investments were in line with the revenue percentage in the first quarter of 2015. So, you take out some of that noise that we talked about, they actually leveraged very, very well for the quarter. Mike Lamach : Club Car did a great job too, doing what we expected against a very easy comp from last year, but Club Car did a nice job in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you, good morning. Couple of questions. I was hoping you could give some clarity on that whole inventory situation with residential HVAC and the new SEER requirements and has that inventory been sorted out and then secondly, some commentary on the strength you saw in EMEA, that up 22% FX? Mike Lamach : Deane, on where we sit with 13 SEER just for competitive reasons, we\u2019re not going to talk much about that. We really don\u2019t want to discuss our position at this point in time. The main thing we\u2019re trying to do is, we saw across the business a lot of order volatility starting last summer and I commented on that in the third and fourth quarter and frankly, that volatility was broader than even the min/max requirements we would have for stocking key components and so, rather than trying to guess the volatility of the markets, we will expand it those min/max\u2019s for key material for components and assemblies, particularly in high margin businesses, where cycle times were very short and there was some discretionary opportunities with customers that wanted to buy what was on hand. And so, we took that up and I think that\u2019s an important point because we\u2019re looking at fulfillment rate and cycle times to be balanced with inventory levels and the net of that really is strong growth in the quarter and improved customer delivery rate. So, I\u2019m not sure where working capital will really end for us exactly, but frankly, if we can continue to get strong growth rate fulfillment, it\u2019s an inexpensive investment in terms of the EPS growth for the company. Europe just continues in the HVAC business, but I would also say, across all the businesses to perform very well. The standout was the HVAC business, as it has been for probably more than a year now. And it\u2019s the combination I think of -- just the winning combination is having right management team on the ground, a lot of new products hitting the markets at the right time and combination of that really coming together with some great results. I think they were probably north of 20% before currency in that business. Deane Dray : Thank you. Mike Lamach : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you, good morning everyone. Mike, could you give us a little more color on what\u2019s going on in the institutional markets, institutional applied, in particular, and it does sound like commercial unitary was robust also? Is there any particular verticals there that are standing out? Mike Lamach : Yeah, it is interesting, Dodge is calling for 11% increase in institutional, so that\u2019s still 25% off its peak and we\u2019ve contended that you are more likely to see an extended sort of mid-single digit institutional recovery perhaps over two or three years.  Education is probably a little better than 5%. Healthcare is looking at probably a little less than 5%, those are two important markets for us. I commented that, we needed to see some education orders moving to the pipeline. We are seeing that, so that\u2019s a positive and we would expect healthcare, which typically are going to be a bit more complicated, a bit more applied work going in there, applied engineering and applied product going in there probably late this year, early next year. So that\u2019s shaping up. We are seeing strong still commercial and manufacturing construction going on. That vertical as it relates to HVAC, I am talking about industrial buildings being built, the commercial buildings being built continues to be strong, but we\u2019ve had great success with light commercial. That is the product growth team for us, they\u2019ve done an excellent job. Sue commented that we\u2019ve seen double digit growth year-over-year there. So, we are very pleased with what\u2019s happening across that business. Jeff Sprague : And just a quick one for Sue to follow-up. So you had FX gains I guess in other. Can you just describe what \u2013 where you are at on hedging for the year and kind of what the strategy is and how hedged you might be? Sue Carter : Right. So, Jeff, when we think about what goes into the other income and expense and the favorability that you see in Q1, that whole line is going to be a couple of different items, one of which is the foreign exchange that I will get to. What\u2019s also in there is earnings from some of our equity affiliates, some interest income and as you might expect the other cats and dogs on the P&L, but don\u2019t fit into another line item. In general, that line item is going to be somewhere between $2 million and $6 million favorable. And if you think about looking back to the fourth quarter, it was actually $6 million favorable. So you\u2019ve got the $10 million in the first quarter, not unheard of, but the big drivers for the first quarter, to answer your question, were better earnings out of our equity affiliates. And then also the foreign exchange gains and losses outside of the Venezuelan currency devaluation.  Now what happens with the foreign exchange gains and losses is the only thing that we do cash flow hedging on is of balance sheet position and things that are known to us. So when we put those hedges on, if the dollar is strengthening when you close down those positions, you get a gain and that\u2019s part of what we saw in the first quarter. It doesn\u2019t mean then it\u2019s repeatable because as you role those hedges, you are resetting the rates. And if you look at Q1, this is the biggest change quarter-over-quarter in terms of foreign exchange rates, particularly on the euro that would have been on average for $1.33 last year and $1.09 this year. So again, some nice gains that are in there from a transactional point of view and we try \u2013 there isn\u2019t a direct percentage that I would say is hedged, but we are looking at things with intercompany loans and things that are known that don\u2019t have a lot of volatility and risk for those. And that\u2019s just a routine for us that we are putting cash flow hedges out for that. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Robert McCarthy : Hi, good morning, everyone. How are you? Mike Lamach : Good morning. Robert McCarthy : I just wanted to talk about the trajectory for the US non-residential construction in terms of how you are seeing and in terms of the exit rate, in terms of orders coming into March and April. How are you feeling about the year? And then, maybe we can talk about operating margins throughout the back half. Mike Lamach : I think that mid-single-digit view is a good view. Again, I think that you will see education maybe a bit north of 5%, healthcare a bit less than 5%. We will still have a good unitary business for office and manufacturing. So really sticking to that kind of mid-single-digit and to your early point that things continue to shape up, maybe it\u2019s to the high end of that range and we will come back and adjust in July. Robert McCarthy : And just given the cadence of the year and all the noise you are seeing and obviously some of the incremental headwinds with FX, how should we think about the cadence for incremental margins at climate throughout the back half of the year? Mike Lamach : In general, for the company I would start, you would look sort of all-in reported about 25 and if you take out acquisitions, you are probably closer to 30 to gross margins in the company. Climate, we do about the same. Interestingly, when you see translation in our company, obviously it\u2019s going to impact businesses like industrial that have higher exposure to foreign currencies, which is the higher margin business in our climate business, you also find in there that TK is one of the most global businesses we have and so obviously the operating leverage, the deleverage on currency there is higher coming back in. So it\u2019s obviously more difficult to offset translation per se, so we have to drive harder with productivity to be able to do that. And that\u2019s the roadmap that we are building. And so a lot of companies I know have taken down guidance as a result of currency. I thought, A, it was too early in the year for us to do that, and B, we\u2019ve had good success with productivities and good volume in the quarter and feel like the leverage should support staying with the range that we\u2019ve got at this point. Sue Carter : And the other part of that, Robert, is going to be that the direct material inflation. So we talked about we\u2019ve got some inflation in the first quarter and a bit in the second quarter some of that tier 2 carry over in the back half of the year. We see that that levels out and we are not getting material inflation, so that also helps the leverage in the back half of the year for actually both of the segments. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, thank you. Just a question on the industrial margins. You\u2019ve got the target for the year of 14.5% to 15.5%. I just wonder if you think you will be able to get into that in Q2 or it\u2019s really about a big sort of second half move. Sue Carter : No, I think that as we look at it, Julian, our projections would say that we are going to continue to grow and the second quarter will be stronger than the first. So I don\u2019t want to \u2013 not allow for any breakage, but I think we will start to see things get close to that range in the second quarter for industrial. And when we think about what\u2019s happening there, they are still going to have the big FX impacts, they are still going to have the Cameron step up, but there is productivity in the additional volume that is going to help them. So the short answer to your question is, yes, we should get close to that in the second quarter. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Then my second question, your Asia revenues organically were down sort of four quarters now. Just maybe give a bit of an update on that. I understand there has been a price [indiscernible] HVAC for sort of six months or more and do you think that your Asia business can get back to organic growth in the next six months? Mike Lamach : Well, the overall market is down, so it\u2019s not actually any sort of a share issue and it\u2019s somewhat choppy and we\u2019ve seen this before in China in terms of the choppiness and the shortness of the cycles that we\u2019ve had years of two quarters down, two quarters up, net up. And I think that you are looking at that here. The pipeline there would support back half of the year which is stronger than the front half of the year. So even for the second quarter, we are likely to see sort of flat for the overall company down in terms of bookings, but for climate I would expect to see an uptick in Q2, potentially high single digits or maybe even better if bookings \u2013 timing \u2013 bookings comes in as we would expect. Then for the full year we should have I think pretty strong growth there in HVAC. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. David Raso : Good morning. My question is on Thermo King. The strength is obviously the North America for a while, but seeing some improvement in Europe, can you flush that out for us? What\u2019s the order growth rates you are seeing in Europe? Just trying to maybe find a little offset if Thermo King is down in \u201815 domestically, do we have some international offsets? Mike Lamach : Yeah, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the order growth rates were coming back in Europe, although I think there is more optimism in general in Europe and if you take currency out, obviously just look at the market for itself, is more sort of optimism around Europe, but we didn\u2019t really see that in the first quarter. The growth we had in TK there was largely North American truck and trailer, but across the world, we would have seen great container growth. Again, we saw APUs with really strong growth, something near 50% in that regard. Also air, rail and bus combined were up as well, David. So those businesses are becoming more significant. It\u2019s a total part of the mix at PK. North America is performing about where we thought it would be. Europe hasn\u2019t quite recovered, but we think we will a bit towards the end of year on a constant currency basis, and we expect the ancillary products around rail, bus and APUs and containers to continue to have good run. Overall, kind of a mid-single-digit view. David Raso : And for this year, at least Thermo King domestically has a pretty healthy backlog. How far does it extend into? Does it cover now pretty much the majority of the rest of \u201815? Mike Lamach : We\u2019ve got a pretty good view of \u201815, we are slightly less than act of [ph] looking at 43,000 units I think in the last forecast and we would be something a bit less than that at this point in time. So where X calling for, say, 10%, we are calling for kind of more of a muted mid-single-digit growth rate there. Again if there was some optimism, if we chose to view that, hopefully act is right. Again, this is where we\u2019ve got inventory in place in case it is right. That typically could be some longer lead items on diesel engines and that\u2019s one of the positions we said could be a stronger backlog of components and inventory there. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on Cam. Now you have had Cam in the full for a quarter, just wanted to see if you can give us an update on your outlook for that business and specially whether you\u2019ve seen any pricing pressure particularly on the oil and gas side of that business. Sue Carter : So let me try to walk you through the business and the different markets that they are participating. As we told you, they met our revenue and operating income expectation for the first quarter and we are on track with generating the synergies and doing the things that we are planning to integrate the business. So everything is going along as we would expect with the business at this point in time. If I divide and go into the individual markets for them, process gas, again a piece that does have some exposure on the oil and gas side, we are actually seeing some strength in the business with natural gas and with LNG. There is some project delays that are happening in perhaps the Middle East side, Petrochem is holding up as well as power generation in some of the pieces. So all in all, process gas is holding up well. Plant air, we are seeing good activity there with business and the book and turn activity was good in the first quarter. Engineered air which is a piece that is exposed to air separation and some of those markets, it\u2019s showing a little bit of a pull back. And that\u2019s really more of an across the industry type of pull back, particularly in Asia where there was a lot of building and lot of overcapacity in air separation. And on the aftermarket side, the aftermarket is stable for us, but we, of course, have plans to grow that as we talked about when we did the acquisition. So all in all, we are seeing what we expected to see out of the businesses, the markets haven\u2019t really let us down in any big way, and again our exposures being more on the gas side than the oil side of this are keeping us on track with what plan was for the business. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, Sue, it\u2019s really helpful. And a follow-up I guess just on the incremental margins just being slightly lower this quarter for a variety of different reasons, lots of moving parts. It seems given that you have got an expectation that you\u2019re going to get a little bit more price cost leverage as the year progresses, I mean is it fair to say that as we get into the second half of the year, you should \u2013 could you see incremental margins that are closer to the type of incremental that you experienced last year? Mike Lamach : Well, If you go back to the first quarter guidance, we are probably just maybe a point or two better in terms of operating leverage than we had guided, so we are pretty close on that, it\u2019s got there a little bit differently that \u2013 it\u2019s factored little bit weaker price, little inflation, little stronger productivity, little better volume, little worse mix, but bottom line, it was a solid execution to get to the leverage that we have planned.  When you look at getting that 25% reported op leverage or 30% ex-acquisition op leverage, it would imply a better back half than front half and I think we are at this point all of the productivity pipeline, all the plans we have, price realization are in place, so it\u2019s a matter of executing on that, but again our forecast would be 25% reported, 30% ex-acquisitions on leverage for the full year. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, just quick question on the acceleration in the Americas HVAC bookings up to the high-single digits, I think it\u2019s been a while since we have been there. You know, does that feel like sort of achieving lift-off for you guys, or is there something sort of keeps you in check, whether it\u2019s \u2013 because it\u2019s 1Q or something else you\u2019re seeing out there that doesn\u2019t want to extrapolate that. Mike Lamach : I think we are getting great lift-off on the product growth teams we have put in place and again, I couldn\u2019t be more happy with the efforts of that entire team, which is a very broad team of product management engineers, operational people and selling organization doing a fantastic job with that. So I am more pleased with the execution of product growth team than I would be to call anything more than what I have, which is a decent institutional market, which believe me, we are delighted to see after years of negative, it will be a positive.  And I think that the commercial and industrial building and retrofit markets have some lives left as well too, but again, we are all in all \u2013 even dodge would say, we are 25% off the peak, so we have got a long way to go. Shannon O'Callaghan: All right. And then just on the M&A versus buyback with the discretionary cash, maybe just a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing out there in terms of the M&A environment and what kind of things you\u2019re looking at sort of which segment sort of size we might view as possible? Mike Lamach : We have taken the philosophy to \u2013 across all of our businesses to look for the best opportunities. And so, I think the filtering that we do and the balancing that we do would be at the corporate level, but as it stands right now, we have really got all of our businesses looking for the right tuck-in opportunities at markets we know well, either channels that we can use to exploit the new products and services or the other way around, we have got products that we need to channel for. And so those are the typical acquisitions we are looking for.  Obviously, we are trying to balance toward 15% overall operating margin target for the company, so that pushes us to looking for good businesses where the synergies are clear and that\u2019s a tough threshold obviously to look out there for us. But look, it\u2019s competitive out there in terms of acquisitions still today, a lot of these pipelines take a long time to develop, a lot of these are based on historical relationships, relationships we are building with companies that we would have an interest in. In some cases, they maybe partners suffice to us in other areas. So it\u2019s across the board, Shannon, and I wouldn\u2019t highlight or isolate one particular interesting business for you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Steven Winoker : Thanks, Mike, Sue, Joe, thanks for getting to me. Couple of questions, I\u2019d like to you to put a finer point on. The first one is on your material inflation assumptions for the rest of the year, copper, steel, particularly seems to me like there is a lot more opportunity than what I am hearing in your commentary. Can you just help me understand how you are thinking about your raws? Mike Lamach : Yeah, cooper and steel are moving in the right direction, Steve, we buy a lot more component and assemblies. That is two-fold. One is, in some cases you are paying more for overall general wage inflation or freight inflation and some of those commodity, that\u2019s not always just a material commodity decrease as a part of the assembly.  But we are working with suppliers to make sure we are getting our fair share of that back, and where that\u2019s not happening, we will clearly resource that to a supplier with the better price points and that will take some time as well. So I think we are on top it. We do see a sort of a flattish to down overall inflationary environment in certainly steel and copper and zinc. Our factors that are positive in that as well as freight for that matter. Steven Winoker : I think you would be in a pretty good negotiating position right now on those. And the other question, the final point on volume mix, so 8% core growth and volume mix 100 basis points of expansion. Mix must have been really bad or just help me understand the trade-off between those a little bit given the very, very strong core growth you had? Mike Lamach : Well, climate grew specifically in HVAC much -- sort of it was the largest contributor to the overall absolute in the company and it was largely equipment. It has a long service tail on that and that takes a while to materialize over time. So look, when you are mixing higher climate versus industrial and higher HVAC versus TK, it\u2019s a bit of a challenge into the mix, that\u2019s really the sum of it. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Yeah, good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : I think you guys are \u2013 the majority of inventories are what -- 50% is LIFO, is that right? Sue Carter : Yes, something like that. Mike Lamach : We can let you know, Steve. Steve Tusa : Is there a dynamic there on how the raw material benefits are going to kind of run through given the more pronounced seasonality in your business, that\u2019s the first question, and what kind of impact that may have.  And then just on the buyback, just remind us where you guys stand on your authorization for the buyback, and do you need a new one to kind of -- if you are going to do more in the back half, do you need a new one? Sue Carter : So, let me take the share buyback, because that\u2019s probably easier than LIFO, but I will come back to LIFO. We had the $1.5 billion authorization in 2014 and as of the end of the year, we had utilized about half of that. So given the minimum of $250 million that we had set for 2015, that still will carry us through the year, so no problems on the share buyback authorization.  On the LIFO side with prices going down, and volumes, there was no impact as I looked at the financials really in the first quarter from LIFO and I woudn\u2019t expect that to change as we go through the latter part of the year, Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. And then one last question just on the non-resi stuff, you know, JCI also out there saying things are pretty positive. On the institutional front, I believe the dodge forecast have gotten a lot better, maybe if you could just \u2013 just with the sales guidance, I mean, it just seems like things are getting better, not worse out there. How much kind of visibility do you have into the back half of the year now for commercial HVACs? Mike Lamach : I mean, we had great performance in the quarter revenue, great performance in terms of orders, applied, the books are filling out through the fall, education, little less applied, health care a little bit more applied, so it\u2019s more of a move up there.  Unitary continued strong, Steve that I don\u2019t think is going to slow down much for the year. So yeah, we are optimistic in kind of a mid-single digits growth rate. Dodge has been optimistic for a long time and so we have generally used our own pipeline and triangulation of all the data that we have and have had a fairly accurate estimate over the last say four, five years around that I don\u2019t see any reason to change from that. With that being said, look if there is some sort of a boom we\u2019re missing here, once again, it\u2019s this sort of component inventory, particularly on the applied side that we are going to make sure that we are not cutting ourselves too thin in terms of inventory. We have plenty of capacity, that\u2019s not an issue for us at all on the capacity front. Joe Fimbianti : Operator, we will take two more please. Operator : Thank you. And you next question comes from Robert Berry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Robert Berry : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start by just clarifying what the message was on the commodities, I don\u2019t want to mince words too much, but I think on the 4Q call you talked about commodities still being a modest net headwind for this is year, and I know Mike you just mentioned it being flat to down. So I just wanted to clarify what the bottom line message is there. Mike Lamach : It\u2019s so close to flat, that I couldn\u2019t call it either way frankly, but it\u2019s certainly not going to be to my mind, much of a headwind, if any headwind at this point time the things continue as they are continuing, it would be a slight tailwind for us. Robert Berry : Okay. So that sounds a little better than what the message was last quarter, which\u2026 Mike Lamach : That\u2019s also part of why pricing probably isn\u2019t as strong too, again, it\u2019s about this gap between price and some of the commodities, which drive some of the pricing in the market place. Robert Berry : Fair enough. And then also just wanted to follow-up on the answer to a prior question about TK in Europe and clarify the outlook. I think you had guided to low-single digit decline in Europe, in the first quarter you\u2019re seeing high-single growth, I don\u2019t know if one of them is with currency and one is without, but maybe you can clarify that. And if you\u2019re seeing high-single now and expect low-single for the year, does that imply a meaningful deceleration through the year? Any color there would be helpful? Mike Lamach : Yeah, European revenues were actually up high-single digits organically and if you take FX against that, obviously you get a story, which \u2013 Sue Carter : Yeah, the low-single digit with currency. Operator Thank you. And our last question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. Mike Lamach : Hi, Joe. Jeff Hammond : Mike, you mentioned kind of be a more confident in your product groups in the way you\u2019re going to market in commercial versus say, optimism about demand side. Can you just give us a little more color on what they are doing right, what you are excited about from a new product or how is it going to market differently that\u2019s driving that? Mike Lamach : The market analytics and the segmentation we\u2019re doing around some of the customer segments has been really critical, both in understanding about what we will grow and why, what competitors are doing or likely to do, scenario of planning around that, economic value estimation of the products we\u2019re launching and make sure valuing sort of products versus looking at it on a cost plus basis, all that really consummating and having an operations team and engineering team and a product management team having the same goals and objectives. This is an example. If a plant manager is looking to maximize the inventory turns and a product manager is looking to maximize product availability, they are obviously in conflict when these people all agree on what it is as being the number one and number two things to grow market share and margins, great things happen.  We have got those teams totally aligned on how to grow margin and how to grow market share and if you talk to anybody on that team, sort what stripe they wear from ops, engineering, sales or product management, they are going to give you the same exact answer. And that\u2019s where the investments are going and they are not going anywhere else, and this is why we got three, four times growth in the overall portfolio last year, this is why I am excited about doubling that this year, and ultimately that\u2019s why I am excited about next say, five years, because we will build this thing out all the way. People are having a great time doing this, they feel like they are winning and we are going to keep going as fast as we can. Jeff Hammond : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Joe Fimbianti for any further remarks. Joe Fimbianti : Hey, thank you all very much for this morning. Hope to see you at our Investor Day in May. I will be around for the rest of the day, so please call me if you have any additional questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

In the second quarter, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.20. We saw organic revenue growth of 3%, led by strength in the U.S. and European transport in commercial HVAC businesses. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter, as distributors delayed restocking and some customers deferred purchase decisions. As a result organic revenue in industrial is down 4%. Industrial revenue trends started out weak in quarter two, but strengthened in the last few weeks of the quarter. Not enough to fully recover within the quarter, but giving us some more positive trends going into the second half. Similarly, organic order rates softened in some markets, but remained healthy overall in the second quarter at 4%. Adjusted operating margins were slightly down, but increased 50 basis points, excluding the impact of currency and the accounting impact of bringing Cameron and Frigoblock results into our financial statements for the first year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was at our guidance midpoint, but there were some puts and takes and we did not perform to our expectations in terms of operating leverage and margin. Revenues were approximately $100 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast. On a percentage basis, we are looking organic growth of 5% to 6% as compared to the actual 3% growth rate for the quarter. Climate came in right on our revenue outlook, the difference was on industrial. For industrial, organic revenues in Europe were down low-single digits, excluding currency. Asia continue to be weak. The U.S. seem to have taken a pause in April and May, and showed some signs of stabilization in June. North America was down 6% on an organic basic in industrial. The earnings impact to the lower volume was offset by corporate spend controls and lower compensation and benefits as well as favorability and other income. We'll talk more about it in the outlook. We're taking aggressive and targeted cost actions, where we see volume weakness. U.S. industrial trends improved in June and have continued thus far in July. So we are partially reflecting that stabilization in our outlook. Before I turn over to Sue to take you through the quarter, we did reach an agreement with the IRS in mid-July to resolve all disputes related to intercompany debt and similar issues for the period 2002 to 2011. The details are in the 8-K, we filed a week ago, and Sue will take you through that in more detail today. So with that, I'll turn it over to Sue. And then, I'll come back to take you through the outlook. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Before I go into details on the quarter, I wanted to take you through the reported versus adjusted results, given a larger difference due to the impact of the tax agreement. On a reported basis, our continuing EPS was $0.31. To get to adjusted earnings per share, we're making three adjustments totaling $0.89, which we think are appropriate, given the nature of the items. First, the tax agreement resulted in a charged income tax expense equaling $0.84. Second, as we guided all year, we are adjusting the inventory step up component of acquisitions. This now includes both Cameron and Frigoblock, but the great majority is Cameron. In total, that adjustment is $0.04 this quarter. And finally, we had $0.01 of restructuring in the second quarter. So that's the breakdown of the $0.89 to get you from reported continuing of $0.31 to the adjusted earnings per share of $1.20. Now, let's go to Slide 4. Orders for the second quarter of 2015 were up 2% on a reported basis and up 6%, excluding currency. On an organic basis, which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 4%. Climate orders were up 3% and up 6%, excluding currency. Orders in the industrial segment were down 1% on a reported basis and up 5%, excluding currency. Organic orders for industrial were down 1%. We saw organic orders decrease by low-single digits in the air and industrial product and improve by high-single digit in Club Car. Let's go to Slide 5. If you look at the revenue trends by segment and region, the top-half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, second quarter revenues were up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 3% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 1% on a reported basis and down 4% organically. I'll give more color on each segment in the next few slides. The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 4% in the Americas; up 3% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and transport performance; and Asia was down 4%. Let's go to Slide 6. This chart shows the change in operating margin from second quarter 2014 of 13.1% to second quarter 2015, which was 12.6% on a reported basis and 13% on an adjusted basis. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 70 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points was from constant currency and about 30 points was from volume and mix. Price and direct material inflation contributed 20 basis points to margin, with positive price and very little direct material inflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points Year-over-year investments and other items were 90 basis points. That breaks into three pieces. This is the first year in which Cameron is included in results, and as expected, impacted margins by 50 basis points due to inventory step-up and intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 30 basis points of headwind from investments and 10 basis points from higher restructuring costs. In the grey box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 10%. Backing out currency and acquisition, organic leverage was approximately 30%. Now, let's go to Slide 7. The climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the second quarter were $2.8 billion. That is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 6%, x currency. Climate bookings were up 6%, excluding currency. Global HVAC orders, excluding currency, were up high-single digits with growth in all geographic regions, except Latin America, led by double-digit growth in North America. Thermo King orders were down slightly versus 2014 second quarter, excluding currency. Organic orders increased in North America and were down in Europe, Latin America and Asia. Second quarter organic HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits, led by a mid-teens increase in the North American applied business. Excluding currency, HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits in the quarter compared with last year, and increased by a high-single digit percentage in Europe and Middle East. The North American residential HVAC market continued an orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Weather impacted end-market demand in part of the quarter, but we saw positive trends in June and have been continuing in July. HVAC revenues, excluding currency, increased by a mid-single digits percentage in Latin America, as revenues in Asia were down by a low-single digit percentage in the second quarter compared with last year. Thermo king revenues were up high-single digits, x currency, with strong gain in North American truck trailer and auxiliary power units. In Europe, organic revenues were up low-single digits. The adjusted operating margin for climate was 14.4% in the quarter, 20 basis points higher than second quarter 2014 due to productivity and volume mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and higher investment spending. Now, let's go to Slide 8. Second quarter revenues for the industrial segment were $785 million, down 1% on a reported basis and down 4% organically, which excludes the Cameron acquisition and currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in both North America and overseas market were down mid-single digits. As Mike noted, order and shipment trends in the U.S. were unfavorable in the first two months of the quarter and strengthened in June, with the push outs in customer request moved some revenue out of the quarter and impacted results. For the balance of the year, based on the backlog and order trends over the past several weeks, we see some recovery, but are reducing our revenue and profit outlook for the second half in industrial to reflect the lower volume. At the consolidated level that volume is essentially offset by an improved volume outlook for climate, we are also taking appropriate actions to increase productivity in the impacted businesses to mitigate as much of the profit impact as possible. Mike will take you through the entire forecast in a few minutes. Club Car organic revenues in the quarter were down slightly. Organic orders were up high-single digits versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.3% was down compared with 16.4% last year. The Cameron acquisition, including non-purchase accounting impact and negative currency, account for 180 basis point of the decline. The remainder was due to lower volume, inflation and investment, partially offset by price and productivity. Let's go to Slide 9. We took a few minutes to walk you through the agreement with the IRS. On July 17, we signed an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes and litigations surrounding the treatment of intercompany debt. The agreement encompasses the years 2002 to 2011. We previously disclosed, the IRS had asserted Ingersoll-Rand out approximately $774 million in taxes plus additional amounts for penalties and interests during the 2002 to 2006 tax years. And the company expected the IRS to raise similar claims for the 2007 to 2011 period. We believe that this agreement is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders. Once, final, it will provide greater certainty around the company's tax structure, effective tax rate and financial position going forward; and avoid the risk, expense and time commitment, inherent with litigation in a complex multi-year matter. The agreement covers all aspect of the dispute before the U.S. Tax Court, the Appeals Division and the Examination Division of the IRS. Under the agreement, no penalties will apply with regard to any of the tax years 2002 to 2011. The company will pay $230 million in withholding tax, plus interest with respect to the 2002 to 2006 years. And no additional tax will be owed with respect to this intercompany debt and related matters for the years 2007 to 2011. The next step is for the agreement to be reported to the Congressional Joint Committee on taxation or the JCT for review. The agreement cannot be finalized until the IRS considers the views, if any, expressed by the JCT about the agreement. In connection with this agreement, we recognized a charge of $227 million to income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015. And expect to have a net cash outflow in the second half of 2015 of approximately $375 million, consisting of the $230 million in tax and $145 million of net interest. We will fund the payment from cash flow and commercial paper. We've gotten some questions regarding how this will impact our capital allocation for the year and in the future. First, the amount of the payment is manageable within our current leverage targets. We expect no impact to our ratings. We still plan to repurchase $250 million of shares in 2015, as we've guided all year. What has changed is that based on the pipeline we currently see, our M&A spend for the second half of 2015 will be pretty minimal. If opportunities emerge over the next few months, we'll evaluate them. But as of today, I don't see much usage of cash for M&A in the back half. You may recall that we had a $350 million placeholder for M&A. That reduction in essence funds the majority of the IRS tax payment. For the future, this does not change our balanced capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in the businesses, paying out a competitive dividend, share repurchase to at a minimum offset share creep and value accretive M&A. Now, let's go to Slide 10. For the second quarter working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.8%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This include some incremental inventory related to the regional standards change in residential HVAC with good collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding and our days payable outstanding, both improving over the prior year. Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. Our cash balance is at normal level. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion, which excludes the IRS payment. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike, to take you through guidance. Michael Lamach : Great. Thank you, Sue. And please go to Slide 11. In the aggregate, our adjusted EPS forecast has not changed since last update in April, but within the guide we've made some adjustments based on market and performance trends. Let me walk you through some of the geographic regions that is probably the best way to give you some color. North American institutional markets continue their recovery in the second quarter, and we are increasing our revenue forecast here. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. Based on this, we expect mid-to-high single-digit growth for 2015 in North American in commercial HVAC markets. The regional standards change in residential HVAC is going as planned. Monthly trends bounce around based on channel stocking levels and weather. At the end of June, channel inventory levels were at normal levels and distributors had begun restocking to maintain those levels. We expect motor bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat-to-up low-single digits. To round out North America, we expect North American transport markets to be up high-single to low-double digit for 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer, truck and APUs. North American industrial markets took a pause in the second quarter. Overall, we did see signs of stabilization in June, which continued so far in July in most businesses, but we did bring down the industrial markets growth outlook for the year, based on the trends. This particularly impacted some of our shorter-cycle businesses in Industrial, such as small-medium compressors, power-tools, material handling and fluid management. Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits. We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle-East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low-to-mid single digits, and constant currency was flat-to-down after considering currency. Within those regions, Europe and Middle East have been relatively strong for us with flat-to-slightly up expectations in Asia, and a decline expected in Latin America. We expect European transport markets to be down including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe, Middle East, Latin America and Asia are more challenging and we expect them to be flat-to-down for the full year. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up 4% to 5% versus 2014. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 3 to 4 percentage points. We expect our acquisitions to add 2 to 3 points for the year, so for organic growth, we end up back at 4% to 5% range. That's unchanged from the prior forecast at the consolidated level. However, we did update the ranges for both segments. Based primarily on a stronger outlook in North American HVAC and transport, we now expect climate revenues to be up 3% to 4% on a reported basis and 6% to 7% excluding currency, which was up 4% to 5% in our prior outlook. In the industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of up 6% to 7% on a reported basis and organic revenues to be up 1% to 2% versus 4% to 5% in the prior forecast reflecting softness we saw in the second quarter and continued weakness in overseas markets. This forecast requires industrial to have roughly 2% to 2.5% organic growth in the second half versus about flat in the first half. We see a path of that based on the activity that we've seen over the past several weeks in our booked backlog. Also, the Cameron compressor revenue calendarization, that's heavily skewed to the second half and specifically to the fourth quarter based on customer delivery dates that are already in the backlog. The orders are in for about 60% of Cameron's -- 60% of Cameron's revenues were in the back half, and we're focused on the operational execution and coordination, and require the customers needed to deliver on that schedule for those units. For operating margins, we expect climate to be in the range of 13%, which was the midpoint of our prior guidance. We expect industrial adjusted margins to be approximately 14%. That's about 1 point lower than our prior guide, which was a range of 14.5% to 15.5%. Slower industrial markets, particularly in some of our shorter-cycle businesses in North America, Asia and Latin America, geographies and markets where we generate higher than average margin, put pressure on those margins targets, and despite aggressive cost actions and the impacted areas, we do not see a path for the prior range. This does not change our long-term view in the larger potential business, but given the demand environment, we accelerated productivity and action to help mitigate the impact from lower volume. Please go to Slide 12. Transitioning to earnings, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range is unchanged at $3.66 to $3.81, an increase of 10% to 14% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition inventory step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency evaluation and the IRS agreement. Include those items the range reported EPS is $2.59 to $2.74. We are reconfirming our adjusted EPS range. The forecast for the second half reflects some pluses and minuses versus our prior outlook, which are not netted. It reflects lower material inflation. In fact, it's actually deflation for the second half versus first half. And higher levels of productivity from cost control and reduction action, as well as, prioritization of higher returned productivity projects particularly in the businesses where we have seen some weaker market trends. We plan to fully use the top end of the restructuring range at $0.05 that we had guided for the year. In parallel, we're evaluating additional actions and we'll trigger those when needed to further adjust the cost base to market conditions. To focus on the third quarter guidance, see the right hand column on the chart. Third quarter 2015 revenues are forecasted to be up 4% to 5% on a reported basis and 5% to 6% on an organic basis. That compares to on organic growth of 3% in the second quarter. The higher growth rate comes from several areas. Restocking the res HVAC business, which we are seeing that order rates thus far in July and correlates with channel inventory levels; delivery of the scheduled backlog and longer cycle businesses, such as applied HVAC and centrifugal air compressors; some recovery in certain of the shorter cycle industrial businesses such as Club Car, smaller compressors, and fluid management parts; and at this point we've seen improving order rate from low activity in April, May continuing through July. For the third quarter, earnings per share forecasted to be $1.13 to a $1.17. We expect about $0.02 of restructuring costs, and adding these back to get some adjusted basis, adjusted EPS range is $1.15 to $1.19. We've provided EPS ranges for the third quarter in the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year. I'd conclude by reiterating that although that the midpoint of our earnings guidance from the second quarter, we didn't performed to our own expectation, potentially in terms of operating leverage and margin, we've already taken and we're going to continue to take action to generate the growth in earnings that we have been communicating to you. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multi-year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement and there remain the right strategies for the future. So our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementing these strategies. And now, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Joe, I'll turn it over to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Mike, you sort of answered my first question a little bit in your closing remarks. The 5% or 6% organic for 3Q just feels on face, it's a little bit aggressive, but you talked about the swing on residential, and talked about the shipments and some of the backlog businesses and commercial HVAC business. But there's still some -- obviously you've seen recovery in short-cycle. I'm just wondering, what's the great promise do you have in that 5% to 6%. And if you got to haircut that number, would you be comfortable seeing some acceleration from the 3% we saw in 2Q? Michael Lamach : I saw your note this morning, because Q2 and Q3 are fairly flat, and there was some question about the normal seasonality of the business, but there are few things that go on here. First, third quarter North American commercial HVAC bookings, Thermo King, are going to continue at high levels and that really underpins the climate forecast there. We had excellent bookings and growth in second quarter. A lot of that in the schools market, so I'm pretty confident that we're not going to see weakness at North America with HVAC and TK in the quarter. We also have seen the restocking of the res channel take place in late June and through July and believe it should match results where we had in our direct model. So that goes well. And we had a good quarter in res for Q2 and I think that will continue in Q3. Now, China is interesting because it's a place you wouldn't expect for us to see a lot of growth, but if you go back to the fourth quarter of 2014 we had bookings of about 33% growth in the fourth quarter in China. A lot of that now ships in Q3 and those projects are being delivered into vertical markets that are growing, so we don't see any real risk in delivering those as planned. Now, the industrial segment moves from really negative revenue comparisons in the second quarter to really a low-single digit rate and that's based on a couple of things. First, Club Car had a strong June, kind of plus 18% and that's really a delay, if you will, in Club Car business from Q2 to really Q3. So I think that we'll see that pick up. We're seeing a tickup, an example, June's, our compressed air business was up by 22% in bookings, most of that being in small and midsized compressors, which we feel like we'll book in turn. Then as you look at late Q3, and I know this goes down into Q4, this is where we get into just delivering on the backlog of large machines, whether the Cameron or Ingersoll-Rand, so I think that it's a little bit maybe unusual from a seasonal pattern for us, but I think all the pieces makes sense that we should be able to deliver that. We have put in place a lot of actions by compressing the productivity schedule, looking at discretionary spend, looking at investments spend, triggering many things now, and in fact things got weaker or they mature up in the top line, we're looking between the third and forth quarter to make sure that we manage the bottomline. So that's probably more than you asked for in your question, but that's the answer. Nigel Coe : By the way 3% is still isn't too shabby, compared to some of your peers. The follow-on be the headwind from volume mix, the 30 bps this quarter, big swing from the plus 100 last quarter. It sounds to me that that's more of a geographic mix than a product mix. Can you maybe just confirm that and maybe talk about the big swing that we're seeing in Q-over-Q and what's caused that swing? Michael Lamach : The mix, it's a bit of a worse case mix that we saw, if you set back, as your higher margin, industrial segment that is just down everywhere averaging at the gross margin of the business. And if you unpack that, you end up with a very disproportionate growth rate and deleverage happening in the highest margin businesses, which are going to be tool, fluid management, material handling. Then if you look at it on a geographic basis, it's particularly weak in Asia and Latin America, which historically have been very good profitable markets. So when you look at that sort of mix challenge, it's squarely into the industrial segment for us, in essence, climate did well and offset mix with extra volume and so really hit expectations both for leverage and topline. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : First, just a follow up on industrial, Mike, again, if you could, and then a separate question, but in industrial bookings that strength does sound quite remarkable just given kind of the general tone in industrial land, after this earnings season. Can you give a little color on kind of vertical markets where you're actually seeing that level of activity? And then as part of the industrial outlook, it does look like Cameron is actually coming down quite hard. You mentioned it's typically seasonally backend loaded, but certainly on a year-over-year basis, it looks like it was very weak here. Michael Lamach : Jeff, actually Cameron is not as bad as you would think. If you go back to the original idea that we had, we thought that it was up $350 million to $365 million of business where based on that depending on which side of that you take, maybe $15 million to $25-ish million wider overall, it's heavily coming across the smaller businesses and smaller compressors, which go into small industrial customers across the board. So it was really sort of a pause in the industrial economy in the U.S., which was quite unexpected. Most of these things are going to be stock products, they built and didn't turn in the quarter, and so it was pretty tough for that. It's also the business that in June was up 22%, largely in small compressors. We also saw some improvements in fluid business. I mentioned, Club Car was up nearly 20% in June. Haven't seen quite the increase back yet in the tools business, and the material handling for us is really our only oil and gas exposed business and that continues to be very weak there. So the backlog, as I think about big machines, is at this point in time pretty well in the bag. The catch or the key for us here is being sure to deliver that. I mentioned that Cameron's business is 40% skewed toward the fourth quarter, and so that is actual customer request for delivery on big machines, and so it's more of an execution of the backlog question there for the full year. Susan Carter : Mike and Jeff, I think we might have confused you just a tad with one of the slides in terms of Cameron. So let me try to add a little bit of color to what Mike has already said. In the second quarter, there were a mix of revenues in the Cameron business, but it was perhaps nearly 10% of the industrial mix, so it wasn't a big part of that and some of that was actually revenue that shifted over to the third quarter and the back half of the year. On Slide 11 where we talked about organic reported revenues, and we said 2% to 3% for acquisitions and 3% to 4% for FX, our original guidance for the year, as you well know, was that we were going to have about 3% on acquisitions offset by 3% in FX. This a little bit of the rounding puts and takes. I do expect the acquisitions to be right about 3% and FX maybe slightly over 3%, but we won't be at the outer margins of that guidance. So I would say, let's call it back to more of the 3% on acquisitions and maybe just slightly more than that on the FX side. Jeff Sprague : And just on raw materials. Mike, you touched it a little bit as you were wrapping up your concluding comments. But can you give us a little bit more color on how that plays? Obviously, we're in a pretty severe industrial metal deflation right now. Obviously, you've got hedging and other things, but can you give us a little bit of an update on how we think this should play through? How big of an impact do you see in the back half? And do you see that really undermining anyway your attempts on the other side on the pricing environment? Susan Carter : So Jeff, let me give that a shot. As we look at commodities, first of all, we've said all year that the commodities would turn to a deflationary environment in the second half of the year. And so if we look at that back half, we've got about 70% of our copper bought, and about 40% of our aluminum bought, so that deflationary environment is going to flow through what we've got in the back half. So I don't see a big risk to that. And it does help us from a first half to second half comparison in terms of materials. On the pricing side, and what we talked about with pricing, we consider that we still want to have a positive spread between the direct material inflation in price of about 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the year. That's where we were in the second quarter. We were roughly about 20 basis points. And so I think the back half material deflation is going to give us a little bit wider gap or some more positives there. And we still expect to have some positive price. And the overarched on price and material inflation is that we build our pricing capabilities to get paid for delivering higher value to our customers and to anticipate and react to movements in commodities. And I think that's what we're doing. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Berry from Susquehanna. Robert Berry : A quick follow-up on the price cost. I think it was down 0.2 in 1Q and up 0.2 in 2Q, so call it neutral for the year. Does that imply that to get to the 20 to 30 for the year, it would be kind of 40 to 60 in the back half, is that kind of order of magnitude? Susan Carter : I think it would be in the 20 to 30 range and a little bit higher than that to get us to in a range, as we said 20 to 34 for the full year, so just slightly higher than that. But again, that's really the material coming down. As you know, we had a slight amount of material inflation in the first quarter, very minimal in the second quarter. So that turns deflationary in back half. Michael Lamach : I mean, Robert, your rough math works. Fundamentally, as materials coming down fast, price won't come down as fast, and so you get a little bit bigger spread in the back half of the year, unless something happens with pricing and it just is driving the marketplace, I think that that would be a case. We would see that from a commercial perspective, things have been weak in Latin America and Asia for sometime. So I don't see the pricing deteriorating further there. So I don't think the risk there is great. It does support falling commodities prices sort of moving slower and the spread widening in the back half. Robert Berry : And then maybe just a follow-up on the productivity actions. If you kind of put aside the price cost on materials, it sounds like those are stepped up. Could you quantify how much kind of incremental productivity you now expect versus what you had been expecting? And maybe in that you can touch on, in particular, corporate, I think that was expected to be kind of 230 basis points to 235 basis points. It looked like it really stepped down in 2Q. How was that tracking? Michael Lamach : You're right now, Robert. It's probably 30 basis points more productivity in the back half versus the front half. And then, in addition to that, we're really putting together a brief forecast for the balance of the year and reevaluating any sort of investment to the spend and timings. Even some of the CapEx just to kind of go back through that and scrub it through the back half of the year. So we're looking to not only get the 30 basis points second to the front half, but really get a bit of a natural hedge built in through some productivity actions being built in to protect the guess forecast we're giving it. Susan Carter : In the unallocated corporate, Robert, we're taking to sort of 220 basis points to 225 basis points for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : I just wanted a bit more color on what you're seeing in Asia and China, specifically on the Trane side. I guess your margins in Q2 in climate maybe a little bit less than some people have thought. Was there a mix impact from Asia being down within that? And then maybe just give some color on the bookings you're seeing in Asia now, I think carryover is down very significantly in Q2. Michael Lamach : Well, any sort of mix in climate maybe to start there first would be that on the res side, we're probably one of the few people that actually mix down the 13% and 14%, sort of the more we pull up the channel and the more we pull the product range. We tend to mix down just a little bit there. We also mix down a little bit when you look at European transport. And this is really weakness in Eastern Europe that it's kind of pulling down some pretty good results in Western Europe, as an example. So there are minor things happening within there. Latin America has been a really soft market for climate, very profitable market for us. There's really no recovery happening in Latin America as we speak. And so those are the mix drags you see to the climate at present. Now, China, it's not unusual. I can think about last couple of years, where we get the seesaw happening between strong bookings and weak revenue and so forth. And granted, it might be weak two quarters, strong two quarters. But as an example, the fourth quarter bookings we had last year kind of coming through into strong revenue in Q3 and good revenue in Q4. When we look at Q3 bookings in China, and this of course is based on pipeline of real deals and real projects, we also expect a strong bookings in Q3 and in Q4 for China in the HVAC business. This happens to be some of the broker markets that we're working in. We'd not be surprised when we find it to be mid-teens, and quarter three is an example in HVAC for bookings. But it's a seesaw there to a certain extent. I think that industrial in China remains weak. I know the power consumption, as an example, was down 2% in China last quarter. Now, compare that to the reported 7% growth in the quarter, and you get a difference between what's happening sort of on ground with a proxy as power consumption and what's reported in terms of GDP growth. And obviously, the more you're focused on heavy industries, sort of the worse off you're going to be, before you're focused on healthcare, data centers, food beverage, pharmaceutical, probably the better you're going to be in that mess. Julian Mitchell : And then just my follow-up would be with IRS thing potentially an out of the way, you talked about greater clarity or grater certainty in the release on the future effective tax rate. I just wondered if there could be any mechanism to think about bringing that down a little bit in the long run? Susan Carter : Julian, I think we keep the range sort of in our 24 to 26 range with sort of that midpoint at 25. We haven't evaluated anything that would change that from a longer term rate basis. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just on some of this near-term improvement Mike that you've seen in the industrial business, I guess, the 22% bookings growth in short-cycle industrial. I would imagine that, given some of the push outs you saw in 2Q that there might be a little bit of hedge to the second half. Can you help us maybe outline the difference between what the backlog supports, what the orders are telling you and what you're baking in the guidance? So I guess maybe the long way around there is that, do you have more push outs baked in? Because I guess from an industrial perspective this doesn't feel like the type of environment, where people are pulling in business and it does seem like there is still a lot of reliance on those fourth quarter bigger projects shipping on time? Michael Lamach : Yes, Josh, when you look at sort of if you stand a month in front of the next quarter and look at the visibility that we have at that business, it might be somewhere between 45% and 60%. The other 40% to 55% really comes through those short cycles, small compressors tools, fluid management, business like Club Car, material handling, and larger compressors tend to have just a bit more visibility in what we're looking at. What's a little bit unusual knowledge, as we think about how the Cameron business works, and this is really historical, if you look at the profile of Cameron, they're a big back half, big fourth quarter type of company. If you think about there are top five to 10 customers, their pattern every single year is delivery around that time of the year and so that happens. It's got the benefit of really improving visibility there, and of course we've always had good visibility on our big machine. So it's a pretty fair forecast kind of looking ahead, because we can see that big machine. We can see the Club Car business to the balance of the year. To a certain extent, you're guessing on the overall economy, as it relates to the tools business and some of the small compressor business. So if you had sort of handicapped all of this, there's probably, if you want to net it out further, maybe more upside that could happen on the HVAC businesses, maybe a little bit more weakness on the short-cycle industrials. But at the end of the day, I think we've had it really close and fairly. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then, just a follow-up on maybe the margin into that on the industrial side. Can you dimension out maybe what was more of a surprise factor in 2Q on the margin versus what gets better by managing that in real-time? And how that relates to kind of the better backlog outlook? So how much of the problems in 2Q just go away, because you're now on top of things and more surprises versus the revenue uptick? Michael Lamach : Let me kind of walk you from 16.4% last year to the 13.3%, just a big piece, and you can tell me, so you'll be having your impression about what it can be more top of and what it couldn't. The biggest piece of what we saw was volume and mix, which was 210 basis points of the difference. The FX piece is 110 basis points negative. And then Cameron it's 70 basis points. But that's more mathematical, Cameron adding revenue in that small OI. And now moving toward the back of the year with a really over-absorbed Q3 and they've really absorbed Q4, over-absorbed Q4, so you kind of balance that out. You also end up with investments and other, which were about 1 point, and almost actually the majority of that is just a legal accrual on an old item. So the other way back, you had productivity over other inflation of 120 basis points and price over the direct inflation, which is 60 basis points, for the good guys around productivity in place a 180 basis points. I don't think investments and others is a drag, I think Cameron turned itself around just through absorption in the factories. And then volume and mix is what we've been talking about. You got to place a bet on some of that, both on short-cycle high-margin businesses and some geographic spread on that. But all-in-all, the plans we've taken to address this really are contingencies around if things remain weak. And so I would look for productivity, so then significant would be better than other inflation. And for price, this will be better than direct inflation in this fast-reducing direct material environment that we're in, the price material that's deflating basically. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Evelyn Chow : This is actually Evelyn Chow for Joe. Maybe just returning a bit to your climate margin guide, I understand that these sales channel that impacts mix, but it seems like your second half margin guidance implies kind of a normalization of incrementals. Can you help us thinking that the puts and takes in margins, as it relates mix, investments spending and other items? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, leveraging climate just in the quarter, it's pretty good. So it was right around 25%. If you take Frigoblock out, it was right around 30%. Just looking at Q3 and frankly Q4, it starts looking around 30% again. So there's really not much of a difference in the leverage that we're seeing and expecting around the climate business, even with the res mix. So maybe you want to fine tune your question, you're missing a little bit, but it's fairly flat and linear there. Evelyn Chow : And then maybe just returning to your comment on China HVAC bookings, potentially being up in the mid-teens in the back half, that seems a little bit in odds from what we heard in that region from your competitors. So what's driving the strength in your business? Michael Lamach : It's really not unusual for competitor A to have bookings in one quarter and debookings in the second quarter, just based on what they're working on, and the customer order profiles for major projects. We see it all the time. When we're up 15%, 20%, and look good compared to a competitor and you're flipping around and it may look bad. But all-in-all, one quarter, two quarter differences in the competition is really what we're talking about. There is some differences though, depending on what competitors you talk about. Clearly, we don't have much of a presence in the res business in China. And so I think we've been helped by that, somewhat insulated by that. And we tend to focus on markets, again like pharma, healthcare, electronics, the data centers, food and bev, where we've done better. Evelyn Chow : And then maybe just returning to Cam briefly, could you provide maybe a little bit more color around what you've seen in the three main businesses there this quarter? Susan Carter : So Evelyn, let me take a look at where we are in the market for the centrifugal compressor business. So first of all, on the processed gas side, we're really more exposed to gas than to oil and gas. So we're seeing a little bit of growth from natural gas and from LNG, and particularly in the U.S. In the Middle East, we do have some project delays that are related more to oil prices, but we see petrochemical doing okay. And we expect power generation to grow for the business. On the engineered air side, we're seeing some of the industrial gas business, particularly in Asia with air separation declining. That's really due to overcapacity in that area. Lower steel demand also has an impact on the engineered air segment. For plant air, we see a slow recovery in North America. So we've got some good markets in auto, in food and beverage, pharma, electric power. So North America stronger, Europe and Asia is slightly softer in the plant air side. And then the fourth really piece of the Cameron centrifugal compressors is the aftermarket. And the aftermarket is stable, but we still have some more opportunities in synergies, again, on the aftermarket side of that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Sorry, I might have missed this, but what did you say about the resi, how resi kind of ended the quarter and start in July again on your independent distribution channel again. Did you give numbers around that? Michael Lamach : Yes, so to go back to the beginning, we saw wholly-owned up double-digits. And in the quarter we had independents down roughly the same, actually down double-digits. And then if you look at that and break it apart further, April and May were incredibly slow, first couple of weeks were frankly a little bit of slow. And last couple of weeks of June were record levels, record levels of shipments, that we have seen, and we're seeing that through July. My guess is that it's going to look a little bit more like the sell-through that we had with wholly-owned. All that, Steve, gets into kind of maybe flat-to-low single-digit, motor bearing sort of markets for the year. But pretty strong last four weeks, five weeks. Steve Tusa : So what do you think resi can do in the third quarter, assuming kind of weather is stable in your total resi revs? Michael Lamach : Yes, great question. I mean, if that's the case, you're probably looking at double-digits, low-double digit. Steve Tusa : And as far as the margin dynamics there, I mean are you starting see -- I know you guys redesigned your 14 SEER. What are you seeing on the margin front there? I would assume that's not fully reflected yet, because there was clearly some pretty wide dynamic in your number. So maybe just talk about how you can convert that with the new 14 SEERs? Michael Lamach : Yes, 14 SEER is good, Steve. 13 SEER is what it always has been. And I think if that really comes out of the market, and I would assume for the most part, it would be out of the market relative to HP units by August at that this rate. This is the market that PE pumps in the market live longer than that, but I think that'll you see the margins start to look better and mix back up. I think that for the res HVAC business this year for us was a good growth, probably shared gain and margin expansion again. So I think that they're playing it right, they're right on cue. Good launches coming in the fourth quarter relative to the heating season, those were on track. I think that that's kind of one more nice sort of arrow that they've got to shoot in the third and fourth quarter. Steve Tusa : And then lastly on just on your '16 margin targets for industrial, I mean are those kind of off the table here now? Michael Lamach : No, it's too soon to really tell on this. I think we need to get through and look at the delivery on Cameron for the year, look at the bookings going in, but structurally nothing changes for me. I guess, before coming out and shooting from the hip, I want to make sure that we've had as much of '15 as we can, look at the bookings, and the really big stuff, and just make sure that we're giving a number that we can live with for '16. So it's too early for me to do that. Steve Tusa : Can you buyback stock here? Sorry last one. Do you have the desire to buyback any stock here in the second half of the year, if the stock kind of stays where it is today? Michael Lamach : Yes, we're going to buy it all back that we talked about. So it's $250 million. Susan Carter : The $250 million. Michael Lamach : Yes, $250 million is what you can expect. Operator : Next question come from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Mike, could you comment on the inventory turn number, I guess it came down from 7% to just over 6% in climate versus industrial, what's going on there, a little more detail? Michael Lamach : When you end up with sort of getting an air pocket come through and you built inventory and its sitting a bit particularly on those quick turning stock business as you get caught a little bit away sitting there. You also get caught needing to pull some production days out, because you've built inventory and so that even compounds some of the margin problems you see when you've over built. So we've got to work that out in Q3. And then you're going to see obviously the res business start to really move inventory levels down, as you get the independent restocking taking place late June or early July, so no question in my mind that by the end of the year, we'd have turned to the right place at that point. And the teams are working on very detailed plans that they come up by month-by-month on a glide path, certainly by December, and we're doing our best to pull it forward into the third quarter just have a better chance to go and collect it in the fourth quarter. Steven Winoker : And it's not weighted disproportionally to industrial that the challenge on that one or it is? Michael Lamach : Well, res HD would be a big part of that. And the balance would be industrial FX. Susan Carter : Yes, it's about 50-50. It's not over weighted to industrial. Steven Winoker : And then on the IRS litigation, assuming that that -- sorry, the settlement that that's all finalized, you're just looking through to Q when your exposures that you had called out publicly before looked like just adding all that up, you were closer to, it looked like something like $1.8 billion to $2 billion depending on how you count the '07 to '11, but this gets rid off all of that, and there is nothing else that's pending out there, right, so this completely removes the litigation as called out in the filing, is that it correct? Michael Lamach : '02 through '11 all of issues and items are addressed, so again a lot of clarity on things. And then if you look at sort of '12 and on, I mean these are just normal open audit that the IRS would normally be working within any company. It's something where if you've gone from '02 through '11 and you have changed the '12 through '15 in terms of how you're sort of looking at managing your taxes, it would be very hard to assume, it would assert anything that was already agreed to between '02 and '11. So my guess would be although that '12 through '15 is not part of writing, it would be logical to assume that you wouldn't see those same issues asserted, since we have sort of settled that already. Steven Winoker : And then maybe just one last one, on non-resi, one more in-depth there, you guys are really, it sounds like significant strengths, you mentioned, schools, but any place elsewhere that's giving you confidence of really, I guess, long lasting rebound, Mike? Michael Lamach : Well, it's interesting for us. I would say, Steve, now as that the institutional markets were really strong, but we're pulling that with controls of performance contracting. And the performance contracting projects, we've booked one kind of in the mid-$30 million range for school this past quarter. We've got some very large ones booking and other verticals in Q3 and Q4 larger than that. They're slow burns, 18 months to 2 years in terms of the projects cycle they have to be managed. They put a little bit of pressure on the gross margin, because you end up a lot of paths through sub-contracts, but they are accretive to the contribution margins, because all of your cost are embedded in those projects, right. Everything down at the commissions for the sales people, if you will, are embedded in the project margin. So I think you might see some larger numbers start coming out there. I think a nice part about it, these are 10, 15, 20 year yields where its equipment, controls, service all bundled together. And it's a really nice project management business that's helping us from a energy retrofit perspective, just being able to take on and do really large projects effectively for customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : So it looks like you're coming up against some tougher order comps, and I think you mentioned, China up 33 in Q4 and I think you had some really good order growth in back half Europe last year. As you look at kind of quoting activity and thinking about that tougher comp, how should we think about order momentum into the back half? Michael Lamach : Quoting activity at commercial HVAC in North America is very strong. Performance in Europe in HVAC continues to be very strong double-digits, again strong, continues to go well in Middle East, same thing double digits, teens type of growth there. Low activity is in really Latin America. Choppy activity as we see really through China, but all of Asia Pacific, and then really an industrial big machines, Sue, kind of highlighted there with strengths, which I won't reiterate that. Probably a little bit more than choppiness, comes back into some of the plant there where you could see some air pockets from once a month, quarter-to-quarter that I think is just indicative of the overall economy. Jeff Hammond : And then just on residential, I mean you mentioned kind of mixing down, and it seems like the market is kind of going the other way, so can you just talk strategically how you're kind of positioning that business and how you feel like you're doing competitively, it seems like you have a little bit lower growth rates versus some of the competitors? Michael Lamach : Q2, that wouldn't be the case actually. The data we got from HR would say it was really good quarter for us in Q2 and actually year-to-date, so it's little tough with all the data you get and reporting people do, but the benefit is, at least the North America and U.S with the HR data we're able to see that relative to the marketplace. So we had a really good quarter and it's been good six month period there. It's hard for our business, Trane, American standard to anything, but mixdown, because historically we only played at one end of the spectrum, so whole strategy has been for years now to build a product line that runs the gamut, so the dealer has the opportunity to use the product line across all aspects of price points customers wants to pay. So it would not be at all unusual for us to see motor-bearing units going up and obviously as you felt '13, '14 the mix goes down a little bit, nothing unusual or unplanned about that at all. In fact, I would say, reiterate that we're getting more of our channel base and a dealer base to use more of the product across their businesses. That piece of parts business and it sees everything down the road including replacements too so, so it's all good. Operator : And our last question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Just had a follow up on the IRS settlement, and Sue, said there would be no change at this time to the tax rate. But would there be any change to how you're booking intercompany debt, is your P&L affect, and would we be able to see that? Susan Carter : No, Deane, there shouldn't really be that much of a change, and so really that change has already happened. So if you think back to the inversion debt, which was a big part of this settlement that inversion debt was gone at the end of 2011 and then we've simplified the structure even as we went through the Allegion spend in 2013 and we've really been very conscious of making sure that we're using our IRS domicile in the right ways for moving cash around the globe, but not really being aggressive on any of the different items. We've said a number of times that we've been playing it right down the middle of the fairway. And that has been the case for the last few years and so I don't expect any change to that at all. Deane Dray : Just last question, with copper at a six year low, I know you've always stayed very disciplined in terms of doing your laddered purchasing. You've got 70% already purchased. But with copper at these levels would you ever consider locking in or extending the duration of these hedges or advanced purchasing. Susan Carter : Yes, I think we have a commodity team that looks at all of these different items and a policy that gives us some flexibility when we do have prices that are at an all time low, and so that's something that we continuously monitor and the sourcing group is doing a good job of making sure that where it makes sense that we take advantage of that. Deane Dray : Has that happened yet? Michael Lamach : We got about a quarter unlocked in Q3 and about a-third unlocked in Q4, so there is a little bit more room there than we normally have to go take advantage of the stock rates anyway, Deane. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. I'd like to hand the call back over to Janet Pfeffer for closing remarks, please. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Earl, and thank you everyone. Joe and I will be around if you have any follow-up questions. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the call over to Janet Pfeffer. Ma'am, you may begin. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Tricia. Good morning and welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's third quarter 2015 conference call. We released earnings at 6 :30 this morning, and the release is posted on our web site. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this call through our web site at ingersollrand.com, where you'll also find the slide presentation that we'll be using. If you would, please go to slide 2, our Safe Harbor statement. Statements made on today's call that are not historic facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables which were attached to our news release this morning. With that, let me turn it over to Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. Mike? Mike Lamach : Great. Thanks Janet. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we exceeded our EPS forecast, improved operating performance and delivered profitable growth through solid execution, that more than offset headwinds from the global economic environment. Our operating income and operating margin percent were both all time records. Particularly good performance in the face of a slowdown in the industrial segment, and in the Asian and Latin American regions. Our team responded well to the challenges. We were able to over deliver on our commitments, despite lower than forecasted revenues. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21, that's up 10% versus the third quarter of 2014. That compares to our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.19, so adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.04 better [ph] than our guidance midpoint. Revenues were approximately $50 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast. About half of that from more unfavorable FX and about half from lower volume. That translates to a couple of cents headwinds versus our earnings guidance. The tax rate was also a little higher, and that was another $0.02 of headwind. These headwinds were more than compensated for by higher productivity and lower spending, as well as a slightly lower share count driving the $0.04 earnings outperformance. Organic revenue growth was 6%, led by strength in the U.S. and European transport and commercial HVAC businesses, as well as residential HVAC. Europe and the Middle East, excluding currency remain strong. Ex-currency, Latin America was down low single digits, with strong results in Mexico, partially offset weakness in Brazil. Excluding currency in Asia, revenues were down 3%, reflecting continued weakness in China and emerging markets. Climate organic growth was 8%. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter, organic revenue and industrial was down 2%. As you will see when I get to the forecast, we adjust our fourth quarter down slightly to reflect slower industrial markets and currency. Organic orders in the third quarter were up 1%, impacted by tough comparisons in transport against record orders in 2014, as well as a slowdown in industrial. Commercial HVAC bookings, excluding foreign exchange were up low single digits and were up mid-single digits in North America. Adjusted operating margins increased one full percentage point, a stronger productivity and pricing combined with deflation, more than offset negative currency, investments and other inflation. We repurchased about 4 million shares in the quarter, and have completed our announced 250 million of share repurchase in early October. And I will turn it over to Sue, and then I will come back to take you through the fourth quarter outlook. Sue Carter : Thanks Mike. Let's go to slide 4 please; orders for the third quarter of 2015 were down 2% on a reported basis, and up 3% excluding currencies, on an organic basis which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 1%. Climate orders were up 3% excluding currency. Commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, and residential HVAC bookings were up mid-teens. Transport orders were down, primarily due to difficult comparisons with record 2014 bookings in North American transport and in marine. Organic orders for industrial were down 4%. Organic orders decreased by mid-single digits in air and industrial products, and improved by low single digits in Club Car. Please go to slide 5; just a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, third quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis, and up 6% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 8% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 2% organically. I will give more color on each segment in just a few slides. The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis, as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 7% in the Americas, up 10% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and transport performance, and Asia was down 3%. Let's go to slide 6 please; this chart shows the change in operating margin from third quarter 2014, of 13% to third quarter of 2015, which was 13.6% on a reported basis and 14% on an adjusted basis. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 20 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points negative was from currency and 20 points positive from volume mix. Price and direct material inflation contributed 60 basis points to margin with positive price and direct material deflation. This is consistent with the expectations we gave you in July, as the positive gap widens in the second half of the year, from material deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points, driven by strong productivity and cost containments. Year-over-year investments and other items were 70 basis points. That breaks into three pieces. This is the first year in which Cameron is included in results, and impacted margins by 20 basis points due to intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 20 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points from higher restructuring costs. In the grey box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 45%. Backing out currency and acquisition, organic leverage was 41%. That is better leverage than our July guidance, as lower revenues were more than offset by productivity and spend control. Let's go to slide 7 please; the climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.8 billion. That is up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8%, ex-currency. Third quarter organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Excluding currency, commercial HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits compared with last year, and increased by high teens percentage in Europe and Middle East, and HVAC revenues in Asia were flat. The North American residential HVAC market continued in orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Residential HVAC revenues were up low-teens. Thermo King revenues were up low teens, ex-currency, with strong gains in North America. In Europe, organic revenues were up low teens. Climate's margin performance was strong. Adjusted operating margin for climate was 15.8% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2014, due to productivity and volume/mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and higher investment spending. Please go to slide 8; third quarter revenues for the industrial segments were $729 million, down 2% on a reported basis and also 2% organically, as revenues from the Cameron acquisition offset the negative impact of currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues were down low single digits in the Americas, up low single digits in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and down in Asia. Third quarter organic revenues from parts and service increased mid-single digits. Club Car revenues, excluding currency, were up high single digits. Industrial's adjusted operating margin performance was strong in the face of volume challenges. Adjusted operating margin was 14.4%, down 40 basis points when compared with 14.8% last year. However, the Cameron acquisition, including known purchase accounting impact and negative currency, account for 190 basis points of downward pressure on industrial margin. On lower volume, the team delivered pricing and strong productivity and cost savings initiatives to more than offset inflation and investment. Please go to slide 9; for the third quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.4%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory to support Q4 air compressor shipments and some pre-build of inventories prior to ERP system go lives, which went live in October, without event. Also the lower growth forecast puts pressure on inventory, which will probably end the year higher than our prior forecast. We had good collections in the quarter, and our DSO improved year-over-year. Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. We expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million, which excludes the IRS payments and restructuring. That would be within a couple of points of our 100% of net income targets for cash generation. And with that, I will turn it back to Mike. Mike Lamach : Great. Thanks Sue and please go to slide 10; North American institutional markets continued the recovery in the third quarter. There is no change to our revenue forecast there. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. We still expect mid to high single digit growth for 2015 in North America and commercial HVAC markets. The regional standards change in residential HVAC is going as planned. We expect motor bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat, up low single digits in 2015, reflecting the [indiscernible] that occurred in the back part of 2014. To [Indiscernible] North American climate segment markets, we expect North American transport market to be up double digits in 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer, truck and APUs for most of the year. North American industrial markets have remained fairly weak. Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits. We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid single digits at constant currency, from flat to down, after considering currency. Within those regions, Europe and the Middle East have been relatively strong for us, excluding currency. Asia has slowed since July, and we now expect Asian markets to be down for the year. We expect European transport markets to be down, including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe and the Middle East, Latin America and Asia are more challenging, and we expect these markets to be down for the full year. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up about 3% versus 2014. Our prior range was 4% to 5%. So in total, we are reducing the back half revenue forecast by about $140 million. As I said, really $50 million of that happened in the third quarter. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about four percentage points, which reflects the deterioration of several currencies since July, when the expected impact was 3% to 4% negative. We expect acquisitions to add about three points for the year. Organic growth, ex-currency and acquisitions remains at the same 4% to 5% range we gave in July. We expect climate revenues to be up about 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% organically. There was very little change to climate revenue outlook, only about $25 million or $30 million, and its mainly a reflection of softer FX rates than in July, and reflects continued weakness in China. For the industrial segment, revenues are now forecast in the range of up approximately 3% on a reported basis; which compares to an anticipated growth of 6% to 7% in July. In dollar terms, the full year industrial forecast was lower by about $120 million. Its almost all from lower volumes, that short cycle markets have not recovered, as well as allowing for some shipment pushouts on larger machines. You might recall, that our July forecast needed about 2% organic growth in industrial in the second half, the new forecast reflects about 2% contraction in organic growth in the second half and industrial. Within the industrial segment, organic revenues are now forecast to be down 1% for the full year compared to our July view of up 1% to 2%, reflecting the softness we saw in the third quarter, and a continued weakness in overseas markets. For operating margins, we still expect climate margins to be in the range of 13%, identical to our prior guidance. We expect industrial adjusted margin to be approximately 14%, also identical to our prior guidance. This higher productivity and the continued spending controls are offsetting the impact of lower volume. Please go to slide 11; our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has been tightened to $3.69 to $3.74, an increase of 11% to 12% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency devaluation and the IRS agreement. It slightly moves the midpoint for the year, down by $0.02, which reflects lower revenue backdrop that we are entering the fourth quarter with and partially offset by the cost actions that are taken and that will continue. The range for reported or GAAP [indiscernible] EPS is $2.57 to $2.62. Fourth quarter revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Currency impact offsets the impact of acquisition. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be $0.90 to $0.95. We expect about $0.02 restructuring costs and $0.01 related to taxes for Venezuela, including these, the reported EPS range is $0.87 to $0.92. We have provided an EPS bridge for the fourth quarter and the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year. The fourth quarter forecast will put leverage, excluding currency and acquisition, so organic leverage, at about 75%, at about 2.5 percentage points of growth. That higher normal leverage is driven by strong productivity, material deflation in the quarter, and includes $15 million lower corporate expense than last year. Before we go to questions, you might have seen the announcement we made this morning, naming Todd Wyman as the President of our Compressed Air Systems and Services business. Many of you have had the opportunity to meet Todd since he joined us six years ago. He has been instrumental in our value stream transformation and in the development of the company's first operating system, which is the foundation for the company's birth in operational excellence strategies. Todd's global business experience and demonstrated success and strategy implementation makes them highly qualified and serve as the compressed air system and services business President. Keith Sultana was named to succeed Todd as Senior Vice President of Operations and Integrated Supply Chain for the company, including leading our operational excellence strategy. Keith joined Ingersoll-Rand seven years ago, and most recently served as Vice President of Global Procurement. Before that, Keith led the global integrated supply chain for the company's commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning business in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Before that, he led the climate solutions and industrial technology sectors. So our commitment to our business operating system remains as strong as ever. At one point or another, Keith has had direct manufacturing and supply chain responsibility for every IR business, which makes him an ideal successor to Todd. These changes reflect our commitment to premier performance, aligning capabilities with business opportunities and market conditions, and they are consistent with our organizational leadership development plans. So in conclusion, our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a five year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. They remain the right strategies for the future. This quarter's performance, will be a demonstration of our focus on meeting or exceeding our commitments to you. Our focus remains to grow earnings and cash flow, with a further implementation of our strategies. We have already taken and will continue to take actions to generate growth and earnings, as needed to respond to market conditions. And so with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning Nigel. Sue Carter : Good morning. Nigel Coe : So let me start off with the change amendments for the industrial segment. Congratulations to Todd and Keith in their new roles. I am just wondering, what if anything changes in terms of the [indiscernible] for industrial tech, and to [indiscernible] the question Mike, is that -- the margins, the trickle of investor retention [ph] and I am just wondering, is that a recognition, given all the background that perhaps there should be a sharp focus on productivity and cost containment there? Mike Lamach : Well looking at the opportunities, Nigel, and we are dead committed to the 70% and 90% operating margins that we have communicated in the past. We want to accelerate that as quickly as possible, and for the segment to achieve that, we have got to achieve that [indiscernible] that business, first and foremost. So the effort here would be certainly on all of the growth and operational excellence activities in the company. We see great opportunity in the value stream work, and reaccelerating that. So its really -- I think, a tribute to Todd's leadership, but also to a commitment to being on-track and getting ourselves on track for that business. Nigel Coe : Okay. Fair enough. And just a quick follow-on there, Mike. The 50 bips of price cost benefit this quarter, consistent with commentary, but I think probably a little bit better than certainly what we expected. As that continues to get better, as the hedges start to roll off on the copper and aluminum, or is this a pretty good run rate from here? Sue Carter : Nigel, let's think about the cost or the price and material from a longer term perspective. So what we would have is a -- we'd have a total average spread between direct material inflation and price of about 20 to 30 basis points for the year. What we said when we talked in July, was that in the second half of 2015, we would see wider spreads, because the material deflation was really kicking in, which is exactly what we saw in that 60 bips spread. But in general, we are still targeting about 30 percentage points of spread for the year, then as we look at, going forward, we'd hang on to that goal of having a positive spread of 20 to 30 basis points. So I don't think that edge moves up forward, at least in the near term, that 2016 commodities are going to increase. We have got about 50% of our copper for 2016 locked in. However, I think its more realistic to think about the overall spread being 20 to 30 basis points, rather than a 60 basis point spread being a normal. I don't think that works [ph]. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Mike Lamach : I think Nigel, more than we though really, but we kind of thought 50, it was 60. So its pretty close to the number that we had thought. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning guys and ladies. Just quickly on Cameron and just the M&A impact. Just wanted to check my math, it sounds like you've actually held your Cameron forecast? If I am assuming a 3% acquisition contribution, that would imply about $380 million in revenues and back out [indiscernible], it was like 340-ish for Cameron. It sounds like no change there, but then Mike, you also made a comment about de-risking Cameron a little bit. So can you just reconcile that or am I missing something in that math? Mike Lamach : Jeff, great question. Let me walk through. So I talked about the fact that we reduced the back half for you in total for the company by $140 million. $50 million of that would have happened in Q3, so $90 million relating to Q4. Also [indiscernible], there was regular change to the climate, really the top $30 million, leaving $60 million in the industrial businesses. We think about the Cameron piece of large machines, and we took a $20 million to $25 million view of risk on that, saying that, we know of some instances and perhaps will know some more delays for oftentimes customer acceptance or readiness on those sides. So think about $20 million, $25 million being associated with big machines. The balance of that could be split 50-50 between all of what the short cycle replenishment is in industrial and FX again. So if you look at sort of the Cameron piece of this, on the large machine exposure, 20-25, and then if you look at just short cycle of recovery, some of that would be plant there, for both Ingersoll-Rand legacy and Cameron, it would be the normal smaller plant there. We are not seeing the order rates returning there, we are seeing some slowdown of capital spending from industrial customers in Q3 and Q4, and so there is a bit of that in there as well. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. And then, just shifting gears on TK, orders down on tough comps, but the comps are going to stay tough, right, in North America, in particular in trailer. How do you see things playing out? Should we still be thinking about double digit type decline or more in trailer in North America in 2016? Sue Carter : So Jeff, let me give that a shot. So you're right, as we look at the order rates for North America for trailer in the third quarter, they declined. Again, we expected that, we talked about some of those orders being roughly at peak in the second quarter, and it really is a tough compare to 2014. So when we look at the fourth quarter, so first I will take fourth quarter, we expect the trailer orders again to show negative year-over-year comparisons, again, based on really strong 2014, actually record order levels last year. So what we are looking at is, the tough comparisons on TK in total, orders for the third quarter and overseas markets were actually down, and ex-currency were roughly flat. But you also asked a question about 2016. So if we look at what's out there in terms of ACT data. So we are not telling you about your forecast. So we are looking at ACT data. We still are seeing forecast for that to come down in the ranges of probably some of those double digits. But we are closely assessing the markets, especially in trailer and in looking at the record volume. So not really a precise answer, but the tough comps are really the big part of the story, and in 2016, ACT doesn't see much change from the prior outlooks. Mike Lamach : Jeff, if you took that kind of 15% kind of the -- sort of the market for North American trailer. I recognize, it\u2019s a little bit less than 25% of our business. We are probably going to see pretty good markets in Europe and Middle East. We are seeing probably good markets for marines, rail, bus and for our air, refrigeration businesses that we talked about a scenario last time that, a 10% to 15% decline in North American trailer, is something that we think we could still grow margins, in the TK business, and potentially, actually grow the top line. But that's not to be concluded until we finalize the plan. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning all. Just to clarify that answer for Jeff. On the Cameron deal, you had originally promised $0.8 to $0.10 of gross accretion for 2015. So bottom line like, where is that -- what number it looks like you are going to achieve this year on that? Mike Lamach : So cash accretion so at about $0.08 -- maybe a little bit better, but about $0.08. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. And then on the restocking impact in resi and destocking across industrial. What are you seeing -- what kind of impact do you think that's having on the business? Mike Lamach : Well residential is lumpy. You know Steve, it's hard for a quarter-to-quarter compare with all that's happened with the change in [indiscernible] regulations. Our global residential business was up mid-teens, but our North American residential bookings were up high teens. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into the booking numbers, and some of the anomalies from quarter-to-quarter. The industrial restocking, is just more of an indication of slowing industrial markets, and as a fact that companies like ours are probably pulling in a bit on CapEx and we see our service businesses growing. So one thing you see in a typically mild pull back in your commercial-industrial phase, is that service business should grow. And our service business grew mid-single digits and mid single digits in industrial, which is a pretty good performance. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then just following up your point about 30 basis points ongoing prices versus raws, and if I think about same growth rate maybe next year as this year for the overall business, if that were to be the case. Do you think you can hold these kinds of mid-40s organic incrementals? Sue Carter : I think if we look at really more along the lines of what we have said longer term, which is -- we are comfortable with looking at incrementals that are -- and our gross margin levels, as opposed to trying to project what happens to all of those. And I understand the comment on deflation and the productivity that we have had, but I think there is going to be some other areas that are going to have even tougher comps in 2016 going forward. So I think, the price spread of 20 to 30 bips and our incremental leverage being at gross margin levels, have probably got a longer term weight of just thinking about the business. Steven Winoker : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I was hoping Sue could clarify the comment on expectations for -- did you say inventory increasing in the fourth quarter, and its impact on your free cash flow conversion? Sue Carter : Right. So I am hoping that our inventory does not increase in the fourth quarter. What I meant, and hopefully what I said is, right now, our inventory levels are higher than what we would have seen a year ago. Part of that is, because of the build-up of the air compressor inventory for Q4 shipment. Part of that is the pre-build for the ERP go-live and some other impacts from -- actually the revenue decreasing. But what I expect to see in the fourth quarter, is I expect to see the inventory come down, but the comment is that I don't really expect it to get back to the previous levels, or year ago levels at the end of 2015. So we will continue to work all of that off, it doesn't mean it's an issue, it just means its going to be slightly heavier. And what we have done, to answer your question, on a free cash flow basis, is that we did -- our original range was $950 million to $1 billion, we said roughly $950 million at this point in time, and what we are doing from a free cash flow perspective, is that everything that you might expect us to do, which is, we are overdriving performance on receivables. We are looking at all the things that make sense, in terms of being tight on all the other elements of free cash flow to make up for the fact that we have got a little more inventory than what we had a year ago. So I don't think any of this is an issue. I think our free cash flow, being at 98% and sort of projected net income is running in line with where we'd like it to be. So I don't think it\u2019s a problem, I think its just going to be a little higher than it was a year ago. Deane Dray : Sue, I appreciate the clarity. And Mike, I was hoping you could comment on the European strength in climate. Did that surprise you at all? How much is fix a factor there, and it looks like you could be getting some share gains? Mike Lamach : Well it is surprising us for a couple of years in terms of just the success I think we have had. But as I said in the past, we have got an excellent team, bringing new business and a lot of new products and services being launched into the marketplace. So continued good performance there. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Just a question on industrial. I think you're guiding for Q4 organically to be down about the same degree in revenues as Q3, so maybe down about 2% year-on-year. But the orders progression has got worse, Q3 versus Q2 and the organic sales hurdle is higher in Q4. So maybe just confirm is that's really the case, and maybe talk a little bit about how you are seeing industrial demand trending kind of within the quarter and in the last couple of months, specifically? Mike Lamach : The [indiscernible] Julian that we have really is in China, which really runs a pretty wide range of worst case, best case. And so, we are taking something out of a more conservative range in China at this point, and that's really the wildcard. The balance of it really is just sort of the book in turn that we know of and conservative views now on restocking into some of the stock businesses. Sue Carter : And I would say Julian, you are right. When we talked in July, we have seen some short cycle markets recover in June. Some, but its not all certainly, and that reacceleration didn't continue in the third quarter, as we had anticipated, and we did lower our industrial growth outlook for the second half from plus 2% to minus 2%. So you are absolutely right. Julian Mitchell : Got it. I guess, you are not expecting the decline to get worse in Q4, even though you have a tougher comp in industrial? Mike Lamach : We had a little bit of a surprise favorability in bookings in Latin America in the compressor business, a bit of a surprise. And again, we think, we have taken a conservative view and China team has a roadmap on some larger orders that could close. But I think we have got this tackled with the 90 million in the back half, 60 million of it really being attributed to -- I am sorry, the fourth quarter, $90 million for the company, $60 million in industrial. We think we have got it covered here with what we know today. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on Trane in Asia. I think obviously, the trends, even back in July, were pretty unsteady in China. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you have seen the order intake in the backlog moving there? Sue Carter : So let's just kind of talk about china in general. So obviously, economic growth rate, significantly below the historic rates, with the government attempting to rebalance the economy and all of those different pieces. Some of that is not smooth, some of it is lumpy and so some of the comparisons get a little bit volatile, if you just go from quarter-to-quarter. But if we look at HVAC bookings in China for the quarter, they were actually up low single digits versus last year. And for the quarter, HVAC revenues in China -- for the fourth quarter, the HVAC revenues in China are expected to be down low single digits, and part of that is applied systems and the growth there being more than offset by lower unitary revenues and currency. And so, there is a lot of different pieces that are moving around. If we just look at non-residential construction markets start in the fourth quarter last year, some of that continued into the second half of 2015. Some of the areas of strength or verticals, where we do see some growth would be data centers, healthcare, and mix development opportunity. Mike Lamach : Good news there Julian, was the fourth quarter positive bookings and HVAC in China. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning. Mike Lamach : Hey Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Mike, so just on the -- to clarify the leverage point in the fourth quarter. I think you said corporate going down $15 million to $60 million. Is there some other maybe offset below the line and other income or anything that we should be aware of? It just seems like, I end up a little high, if corporate goes down $15 million? Sue Carter : Well so when you think about the fourth quarter leverage and the different pieces, in the spot where you are going to look at and what's happening, if organic growth is going to be in the range of 2% to 3%, so you have got $75 million to $80 million of revenue. If you have got productivity and direct material inflation, we are still continuing to get price, and if those are the primary drivers of productivity in the fourth quarter, and you have lower corporate. To your point, the math does work out to be in the 75% to 80% range for the fourth quarter. Mike Lamach : Shannon, another way to look at it, $75 million of revenue at the midpoint, $40 million NOI on that, take $15 million off that for corporate, now you are talking about nearly $25 million on $75 million. You have got 33% leverage and look at the price deflation spread, look at the productivity of our other inflation spread, and its really a doable number. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And there is nothing -- I know your other line moves around, there is nothing different going on there. It has been bouncing all over the place, something I had to model, [indiscernible] currency, but do you have anything moving significantly down the other line? Sue Carter : No. So the fourth quarter should be relatively flat. So not really a lot of movement there that we are looking at. Shannon O'Callaghan: Just on the commercial HVAC bookings, up mid-single digits in the Americas, do you have sort of the North America split of that? I think you used to give, and is there any parts of North America you see getting better or worse? Mike Lamach : Applied is trending, as we said, applied, mid single, its sort of the institutional piece of that large unitary that applied to institutional is -- in fact, the larger unitary is doing really well. The open backlog [ph] sort of matches what the booking trends looks like, which gives us some sense that -- to think about open quote [ph] got predating bookings by three to six months. The rates stay fairly consistent going into 2016. So I think that its shaping up like the though, which is this mid-single digit institutional recovery that should last a few years. That state is still quite a bit more aggressive, and that you are showing institutional put in place 2016 versus 2015, 14%, starts at 10%. But I think as you all know, historically been fairly high, it comes down throughout the year. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Shannon's question. Can you just kind of give us the approximate margins? There are some rounding dynamics here, and you guys got some squiggly lines next to the numbers annually, and so I am just having a little bit of trouble again getting kind of low enough for the fourth quarter. Can you just give us more rough approximation of what the 4Q is for the segments? Margin-wise? Sue Carter : So if we are looking at the total year for industrial being in the range of 13% or roughly 14%. So you are right, we have got a little bit of a squiggle in there. What that would imply for the fourth quarter on industrial, is margins in sort of the 15.5-ish type of range. And part of that gets driven by the compressor shipments in the fourth quarter, as well as continued productivity and lower inflationary type environment. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then for climate, I think we are backing it into something around 13.5%? Is that about right? Sue Carter : So climate, with the sort of 13 that we are looking at for the full year, would be -- if you backed into a -- that climate midpoint would be just a smidge under the 13 range for the fourth quarter? Steve Tusa : Okay. Then that makes more sense. And last question, just on the resi dynamics, what will mix contribute this year? I don't think you guys had great mix in the second quarter, like maybe some others did? There maybe different timing dynamics around how much 14-SEER you are now selling? How much of that 14-SEER transition is booked this year, and then how much is kind of still yet to come for next year? Mike Lamach : We have some negative mix, Steve, in the year with 14-SEER, which works itself out this year. But we think that generally 14 is accretive [ph] to 13 and we are seeing really good margin expansion in the res business. So in spite of the mix down of 14 for us, good absorption, good expansion, and work itself through in 2015. Steve Tusa : And then for 2016, is there still some benefit to come in [ph]? Mike Lamach : I think there is better -- I don't think have got the issue of mixing down in 2016. I mean, there could be a quarter, four or five months that -- you have to take with -- these dynamics of the change this year, in terms of stocking 13-SEER. For the most part, I think we should be having a pretty clean year, next year, in terms of mix. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open. Robert McCarthy : Good morning everyone. I guess the first question I would have, is just, taking into account some of the comments around state of the U.S. non-resi and the limited visibility on the industrial side. I mean, how do you think about directionally about 2016 in terms of EPS growth, and what can you provide in addition, maybe for CapEx or -- you have provided some incremental margins. So what can you provide about 2016, how we should be thinking about it? Mike Lamach : I mean, first of all, remember, we will do it from February, so I will give just some general sense of where things are going. But before I do that, step back for a minute and we look at 75% of the companies being in the climate segment. Of that, really 60% of the company is HVAC and more than 60% of that is in North America. So you have got, really 40% of the company, with pretty strong growth dynamics going into 2016. I think HVAC in Europe, Eastern Europe, even potentially the Middle East will be growth organically for us, probably not the same rate of course as North America. But you have got that growing. So in essence, a large part of the business is growing for us. When you think about industrial; I think that Asia, Latin America, continue to be a bit of a struggle and maybe some currency headwind coming at us. But net-net, we see that even with low growth next year, we will expand margins nicely. I am not going to give you an EPS number today, but we certainly feel like there is an opportunity with the pockets we are seeing at growth in 2015 [indiscernible]. Robert McCarthy : Okay. And then just one follow-up; in terms of just capital allocation and then just reinvestment in the business, given the prevailing environment. Certain change or nuance of the margin in terms of M&A or other forms of capital redeployment or internal reinvestment? Sue Carter : No. When we look at it, we expect to continue the balance capital allocation that we have got. We have investment in our businesses. We can expect continue having a strong dividend payout. So in the 30% to 35% range, we will continue to, at a minimum, offset dilution with share repurchase activities. And then, the remainder of it, we will basically continue to toggle between value accretive M&A and additional share repurchase and just evaluate what makes the most sense at any given point in time. Now, you had also asked about CapEx, and so generally speaking, our CapEx is usually in the range of about $250 million, which is roughly equal to depreciation, and we don't expect that to change going forward either. Mike Lamach : The CapEx and investments are a number, that Robert, we can work with during the -- depending on what we see in terms of the environment. There is some flexibility for us to spend less, if we need to -- to help us on the EPS commitments that we will make. Robert McCarthy : Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi good morning. Mike Lamach : Hey Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a couple of questions, first on Cameron; obviously backlog is typically weighted to the fourth quarter, but can you give us maybe an indication on how order trends and visibility or coverage into next year looks, maybe versus what normal seasonality should look like? They are obviously [indiscernible] to the year yet, but just kind of any color on orders would be helpful? Sue Carter : Sure Josh. One of the interesting things about the history and what happened in that engineered compressor business, is that not only are shipments back half loaded, but generally, orders in the launch engineered compressors are also back half loaded. So we are seeing real time, what's happening in the different places in the market. So let me give you a little color on what I think we are seeing, and how that translates into what we see for 2016. So in general, you are going to look at this space being negatively impacted by all of the oil and gas majors are going to put [ph] in capital, 20% to 30%. There is industry consolidation. EPC activity is slowed, and so when you think about projects, there is probably, in general, fewer projects. Same number of competitors, which means that you need to be really sharp, you need to be really focused, and really work at the orders. Now, having said that, if I break down the different pieces of the business. So on processed gas, which is roughly a quarter of the business; there is still some growth from the natural gas side of things, and LNG. There are some Middle East project delays. However, you have got petrochemical doing okay. Power-gen, particularly in Europe being an area where, there are some projects and things that we can look at, and so, when we think about the processed gas, one of the things that you can start to think about, is on the chemical side or petrochemicals, is the lower gas price, give you a lower feedstock price and that could change some of those dynamics. I don't know. But its still a tough environment, as I said fewer projects and some things happening. Engineer, air, so another quarter of the business, you have still got air separation, particularly in the China market, that to be honest, I don't see changing any time soon. There is going to be some activity, but there is going to be a lot lower activity, and if you looked in just, what's happening from, industrial gas businesses and activity, you'd see lower activity in the first half versus 2014 and 2015, and I am not sure that that changes. And again, that industry, looking at projects where we might take place with some of that engineered air product, with air separation, you have got over capacity, lower steel demand and all of that. In plant there, which is -- we can turn pieces of business. Its roughly flat versus 2014. There are still some good markets out there, with auto, food and beverage. Europe is a little slower on that side and Asia is down, and then the aftermarket for the business is where opportunity still exists. And so in general, you have got softer markets, still some projects moving forward. But we are in the period, when a lot of the orders take place. So we have got our eye on what happens in 2016 with all the different pieces. Mike Lamach : Synergy-wise too Josh, we are really on track with -- as an example, just sort of the plant there, the rent synergies and the cost synergies, and if anything over the last few months, we have gotten a sort of even more conviction around the opportunity for the engineering, supply chain and manufacturing synergies that could exist in the business. So I think that we will continue to make the business accretive and in 2016, we will make sure that if we got the weakness. [Indiscernible] who is talking about, that we have got a response to keep the margins at or better than when they were this year. And we got a roadmap to do that. Sue Carter : And I think the bottom line of all of that is, its still a great business and its still a great product for us. And like I said, in spite of all of the things that I said about the market, its accretive in 2015, and we are getting the synergies. So more to come on this one. Josh Pokrzywinski : That's great detail. And if I could just ask a follow-up on TK, I have heard that some of the trailer guys have opened up the order books, maybe a month or so early than they normally would for the following year. Is that something you guys have seen, and is any of the strength in North America this quarter, and maybe a month or so [indiscernible] had from what you might normally have seasonally? Mike Lamach : Well, clearly [indiscernible] which customers opened up their order books and whose customers they are. So you could take the top 10 customers, they are going to order at different points in time. But I would say that, in the third quarter, you had some customers that open up their order books, and we have seen the same thing happen in the past, where there is a little bit of an anomaly between who is ordering. So we are -- whose order and who is left to order, and I don't think you're seeing a lot of dynamic shift in that. But you will see differences in book rates and revenue rates depending on when that occurs. Some of these guys will buy 1,000 to 2,000 to 3,000 units, and so it makes a difference when you are looking at 6,000 to 8,000 unit month, which we is what we have been saying the last few months. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got you. All right. Appreciate. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Andrew Obin : Yeah, good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Obin : Nice quarter in this doom and gloom environment. Just a question; there was some debate inside the company about how to look at the value stream process, and at the Analyst Day, you have indicated that you are reassessing your approach, because you have sort of touched a lot of low hanging fruit. And then, we seemed to have had a pause in execution last quarter and this quarter operating leverage just seemed to have come through very nicely. Can you describe to us what internal operating changes you have been implementing over the past six months to address this next level of operating improvement. Mike Lamach : Yeah, a lot Andrew. I am not sure I will cover it here, it would be a great discussion that we could have when we get together for our review this spring, in general. But we have used this product growth team as a basis to expand the effort across the company. We have continued to now touch really all of the business with the value streams. Sourcing has become, I think, mature across the company. We have got really good productivity last three quarters, really in general. If you look past Q2 and kind of look at the last three quarters, we are seeing productivity accelerate. Its never really that linear. I know we'd all like for it to be, but its not. We have projects and ideas that, at a certain point in time, kick in a quarter, and those make a difference. Higher volumes would make even a more positive difference of course. So we are doing this all with actually quite sort of low volumes than some of our businesses. So we are excited, as volumes do return, we'd see even better productivity and the change that we have made. And so, look, I think that we haven't really changed the operating system in five years, we have just really looked across as product growth teams, and now have touched most or all the companies in one way shape or form. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question, I apologize if you have answered it already. But can you comment on cadence of industrial orders throughout the quarter? Mike Lamach : Cadence throughout the quarter, there really weren't any sort of high spots in the quarter to say. They were choppy, they were just sort of low in the entire quarter. We had pretty good growth in our fleet management business, obviously which was a highlight for us. It was kind of a double digit grower there, it's a good sign. But material handling, which is really our only oil exposed business, significant declines of 50% in bookings in that business from prior year. So inside industrial, when you move the compressor business out of the way and you look at some of the smaller businesses, there are some high and low points, that generally speaking, pretty explainable if you look at material handling as a good example of that. Andrew Obin : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks and good morning. Mike Lamach : Hi Joe. Joe Ritchie : So a quick clarification. Mike, you mentioned earlier the dodge [ph] data on the institutional side, and your expectations for next year. But there is not a lot of noise in the data, especially on the commercial side. I am just curious, what if anything you're seeing and what you're making of that noise on the unitary side of your business? Mike Lamach : Well, I think that the large unitary business continues to do well, because, there is also a lot of large unitary that's split into more of the institutional environment. So that continues. Actually the commercial activity has been fairly strong. If you split up commercial-industrial, industrial has probably been just a little bit weaker in North America. But not a bad environment frankly at all for us. So we continue to think it\u2019s a pretty good North American market, for both institutional and industrial. But in terms of strength going forward, its really institutional than commercial, and then industrial HVAC kind of trending in that direction. Joe Ritchie : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe following up on that, how do you think about mix then, as you head into next year? Clearly, we talked a little bit about some North America headwinds on TK. But some of the mix headwinds on resi sits aside. How are you guys thinking about mix? Particularly, in light of the climate margin target of 13% to 14% for 2016? Mike Lamach : Well I mean, on track in a nutshell, Joe. I mean, TK still gives us really good volumes from a profitability perspective, working with pretty high volumes across the board. Even though the year-over-year decrease in the market will be there, we have got plenty of gas left there and grow parts of the business that we didn't have last time around. So we feel pretty good about being able to hold their head up on the TK business. As you look at a climate, great expansion in margins, in the res business. I have said before, I will say again, mid-teens, mid-teens plus EBITDA. The commercial business, particularly in Europe is doing well, and we are hitting some critical mass there, and I think we will begin to contribute more to that margins across the business. And then in general, North America just does a really good job in terms of share and consistent margin expansion there. So feel pretty good about that. The wildcards are really Latin America and Asia for us, as it relates to HVAC businesses. And here, we talk about pricing in China, but its not sort of an environment that's impossible, its just more difficult for us. So we are persevering in China, and again, we feel good at least about the quarter, bookings going in the right direction. We'd love to see next couple of quarters, look the same way before we feel more constructive about China -- about Asia in general. Joe Ritchie : Okay, thanks. I will get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Janet Pfeffer, for any closing remarks. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, everyone. Joe and I will be around if you have any follow-up questions, and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude the call. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

With that, please go to slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks, Janet. Good morning and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress in the transformation we've been working on in the company since 2010. Then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions. Starting with full year 2015, it was a year that I can characterize best by one word and that word is volatility; volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market. During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each of it ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headline results were essentially right on the forecast we gave you a year ago. The 2015 forecast we gave you a year ago was for 4% to 5% organic growth, and we came in at 5%. Our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74; our actual is $3.73. That performance was with significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind for currency in guidance, it ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion, and we delivered $985 million. We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control while doing our best to anticipate the things we couldn't control and we made adjustments accordingly. 2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multi-year strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, mature and key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets. We have consistently delivered on our commitments even in volatile times, and we hope that you'd agree that there are very few companies in your coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story. With the exception of a single quarter almost five years ago, we've met or exceeded our earnings commitments regardless of market conditions. For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes FX and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Growth in North America was in the mid-single digits while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low-single digits. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. In a fairly diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015. We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35%, which is above our target range of 25% to 30%. And Climate margins improved 60 basis points. We generated $985 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continued to increase our dividend with a 16% increase in 2015 and we announced an additional 10% increase of dividend last week. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $250 million in 2015. And more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011. In December, we announced an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Hussman, and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and positions us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016. Please go to slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins. As shown here, the last five years, our operating margins were up 270 basis points since 2011 despite tough years in Industrial in 2014 and 2015. During the same period, our adjusted operating leverage has averaged over 35%. Please go to slide 5. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from 2014 of 10.9% to 2015 which was 11%. This chart is shown on a reported basis, so it includes restructuring and inventory step-up costs which are excluded from adjusted margins. We had 20 basis points of higher restructuring year-over-year and also had a 20 basis point impact of inventory step-up on acquisitions. Adjusted margins, which exclude those items, expanded 40 basis points from 11% to 11.4%. The 40 basis points of margin expansion was delivered from a combination of organic growth, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material inflation through value pricing and pricing analytics, and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our lean operating system and overhead costs discipline, together outpacing other inflation. Foreign exchange was a drag to margins of 50 basis points. We continue to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems, and service and sales footprint to underpin the future growth of the business. Those collectively were a 30 basis point investment year-over-year. Now, Sue will take you to through the fourth quarter, and then I'll come back to you through 2016's outlook. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide 6. At the summary level, our organic bookings for the quarter were up 2% and organic revenues were up 3%. Residential and Commercial HVAC organic revenues were each up 5-plus-percent. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.94, up 15% versus last year. Consistent with Mike's commentary for the full year, the fourth quarter was in line with our earnings guidance. A slightly lower tax rate was offset by slightly higher compensation and benefit costs. Our adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points. Operating leverage in the quarter was excellent at 34% on an adjusted basis and 55% on an organic basis. Climate margins increased 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted Industrial margins were down 200 basis points but were only slightly down on 2% lower organic revenues when excluding the impact of currency and of rolling in the first year of Cameron's Centrifugal operating income and amortization. Finally, as Mike mentioned, given the impending closing of the sale of our Hussmann stake expected on April 1 and to take advantage of market volatility, we repurchased 4.9 million shares in January 2016 for $250 million. Please go to slide 7. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 1% on a reported basis and up 4% excluding currency. Organic orders were up 2%. Climate orders were up 5% organically. Organic global Commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single digits with a high-single digit increase in North America and declines in Asia and Europe. Organic transport orders were up low-single digits with increases in global trailer, truck and auxiliary power units partially offset by lower marine container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 4% on a reported basis and down 7% organically. We saw high-single digit order decline in air and industrial products and a mid-single digit increase in Club Car. Please go on to slide 8. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, fourth quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 3% on an organic basis. Climate revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Organic Commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits, with increases in all major geographic regions. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Organic transport revenues were down low-single digits as higher truck and trailer revenues were more than offset by lower revenues in marine and APUs. Industrial revenues were up 5% on a reported basis and down 2% organically. Air and industrial products organic revenues were down low-single digit and Club Car was up slightly. The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis as reported and on an organic basis. Organic revenues were up 3% in the Americas, up 2% in EMEA and Asia was up 9%, with strong growth outside of China. Please go to slide 9. Operating margin on a reported basis was up 10 basis points from fourth quarter 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015. We've spinned out the restructure (11:10) impact to get you to adjusted margins as well. Adjusted margins increased 50 basis points, from 10.8% to 11.3%. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were flat, with 40 basis points of positive margin from volume and mix being offset by foreign exchange. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was favorable by 30 basis points, driven by commodity deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 80 basis points, driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 100 basis points. In the box, you can see that it was comprised of 20 basis points from investments, 50 basis points from higher restructuring costs and 30 basis points from acquisitions. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 34% and, if calculated on an organic basis, which excludes foreign exchange and acquisitions, was 55%. Now please go to slide 10. Total fourth quarter revenues for the Climate segment were $2.5 billion. That is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5% excluding currency. Acquisitions in Climate do not change that rounding, so organic revenue is also up 5%. Organic Commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digit and were up in all geographic regions. North America was up mid-single digits while EMEA and Latin America were both up low-single digit. Asia was up low-teens. The growth in Asia was led by some large HVAC projects in Southeast Asia. Commercial HVAC equipment organic revenues were up low-single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up high-single digit versus prior year. Thermo King organic revenues were down low-single digits, with truck/trailer revenue up high-single digits, with growth in both North America and Europe. Marine and APU revenues declined against difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of last year. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 12.9% in the quarter, 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter of 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by currency and other inflation. Climate's operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter. Now please go to slide 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $834 million, up 5% on a reported basis but down 2% on an organic basis. Compression Technologies and Services, power tools, fluid management and material handling organic revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high-single digits, while revenues in EMEA were down low-single digits and were up high-single digits in Asia due to some large project deliveries. Club Car revenues excluding foreign exchange were up slightly versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.8% was down 200 basis points compared with last year. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, adjusted margins were down 20 basis points year-over-year on lower organic revenues. The Engineered Centrifugal Compressor business, or ECC, which we purchased from Cameron in January of 2015, executed well and came in essentially on forecast in the fourth quarter. In 2015, revenues were impacted by weakened industrial markets. However, synergies were above our acquisition model and EBITDA and cash EPS were both accretive. Please go to slide 12. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our DSO improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect our working capital to be in the 4% range. Now go to slide 13, please. Adjusted cash flow generation was excellent, at $985 million in 2015. Cash conversion as a percent of adjusted net earnings was 101% for the year. As you can see when we look at 2016, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. That range excludes the proceeds from the sale of our stake in Hussmann. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities until 2018. Please go to slide 14. Over the last five years, we've returned over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We employ a dynamic model for capital allocation, which adjusts based on market conditions to put our strong free cash flow to the rate used for shareholder value. Last week, we announced a 10% increase to our dividend. Our dividend increases over the last five years has been a 24% CAGR. Our payout ratio is in line with peers. We've repurchased 103 million shares in the past five years from 2011 to 2015. As we said earlier for 2016, we anticipated some market volatility in January and were able to accelerate our minimum share repurchase of $250 million to the beginning of the year. We repurchased 4.9 million shares in January. To remind you, our free cash flow generation is heavily weighted to the second half due to the seasonality of our businesses, namely the HVAC businesses. So, a normal timing for share repurchases would have been in the second half. But given we have the proceeds from the sale of our Hussmann stake coming in April, we thought it was opportunistic and still within our leverage range to accelerate the minimum repurchase and get that done earlier in the year. For the balance of 2016, we will use the same approach as the last couple of years, applying a toggle switch between value accretive acquisitions and share repurchases based upon relative valuation and risk-adjusted returns. We will apply our same decision-making framework to the situation at that time and leave the door open to pivot to share repurchase or M&A as it makes best sense for our shareholders. For the ease of modeling purposes, you'll see that for the 2016 share count, we've applied excess cash to repurchases in the second half of 2016 as we turn cash flow positive. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through 2016 guidance. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks, Sue, and please go to slide 15. It is always our intention, is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue outlook for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. North American Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC as well as transport and Commercial HVAC markets in Europe are generally positive while global industrial markets remain weak. Transport markets in the Americas will be flat to down as lower trailer volumes will be largely offset by higher auxiliary power units, small truck refrigeration and other products. The Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down. Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf and utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up. All the growth forecasts shown are on an organic basis. We're forecasting low-single digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total, mid-single digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-North American business for us, and flat revenues in transport. We expect air and industrial products, which includes our Compression Technologies, power tools, material handling and fluid management SBUs, to be down low-single digits and we expect Club Car to be up low-single digits. Please go to slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points as we've now completed a full year of Cameron's Centrifugal Compressor division and our results organic revenue growth and excluding FX are the same in this forecast. Translating that to the segments, we expect Climate revenues to be up 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% excluding currency. The Industrial segment revenues are forecast to be down the range of 2% to 4% on a reported basis and down 1% to up 1% excluding foreign exchange. Industrial also has a high proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. than Climate. So Industrial experiences more impact of FX as compared to Climate, 3 points adverse impact versus 2 points in Climate. For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 13.25% to 13.75%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 13% to 13.75%. And for the Enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.50% to 12% and EBITDA margins of 14.2% to 14.7%. Operating leverage would be about 60% all-in and about 3% (21:04) excluding currency. Margin expansion would be 10 basis points to 60 basis points on an adjusted basis. Please go to slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $3.75 to $3.95. Excluding restructuring, the range is $3.80 to $4, an increase of 2% to 7% versus 2015. As a note, for 2016 FX as a headwind is about $0.02 to revenue and $0.19 to earnings. For this forecast, we reflected consensus foreign exchange rate forecast. So for example, the euro, average rate for the euro is $1.03, but for the first quarter the euro forecast rate is $1.06. This reflects a full year tax rate of 24% to 25% and average diluted share count of 260 million shares for the full year. As Sue explained, for ease of modeling, we allocated all excess cash to share buyback and phased it to the back half of the year when we turn cash flow positive. This does not necessarily mean that this will be the actual deployment for the cash, but was done to simplify modeling. The EPS outlook does not include the impact of the divestiture of our stake at Hussman. We expect that transaction to close April 1, resulting in a gain of approximately $400 million, which will be recorded in other income in the second quarter. We'll update our guidance in April to reflect the closing but we'll adjust out the gain for comparability. First quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be flat to 2% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% excluding currency. Reported first quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.28 to $0.33, adding back $0.05 restructuring to get to an adjusted basis of the EPS range of $0.33 to $0.38. There are EPS bridges in the appendix for both the full year and the first quarter's guidance. For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow which excludes restructuring cash and proceeds from Hussman of $950 million to $1 billion. As we said earlier, we increased the dividend last week and have already completed $250 million in share repurchases, which will more than offset dilution from equity issuances. We had $143 million of commercial paper at year-end. And after paying that down, it leaves about $675 million of cash for deployment that we utilize when there is additional share repurchase or towards M&A. We continue to build a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core businesses, and we weigh those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value. In closing, we're pleased to deliver another solid year with top quartile performance in revenue and earnings growth. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multi-year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of these strategies. We proactively work to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. We'll continue to invest in new products and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems, as well as further developing our people and our operating capabilities. We continue to execute a consistent value-maximizing capital allocation program. So, I'm proud of the progress we made and results we've delivered, and I believe we're well-positioned in 2016 to again deliver on our commitments. With that, Sue and I will be pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just a couple of questions. On the first quarter dynamics, you have a decent organic growth rate but it doesn't look like there's much contribution from operations on EPS. What's going on there? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, Steve, good morning, first of all. As we start to look at the first quarter bridge that you can actually see in the slides, what we're looking at is we've got restructuring costs that are in the first quarter. Our operating results are really going to be in the range of \u2013 and this includes the restructuring \u2013 negative $0.01 to a positive $0.04. We've got a little bit of lower share count. But when you think about what's happening in the headwinds, the first quarter is going to be part of that currency headwind that we talked about, particularly on the Industrial business. And the revenues we expect in the first quarter and margins for Industrial, we expect to be even lower than where we ended the year. So in other words, we're looking at a low revenue base. We're looking at headwinds from currency. And so, I think the first quarter is just going to be a tough compares and then I think we get better as we go through the remainder of the year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So in Industrial, that makes a bit of a sense. On this gain you guys are going to take, Mike, given the environment has clearly gotten worse over the course of the last year, you guys are doing some degree of restructuring, and you don't typically do this over time like other companies, but any thoughts to maybe using this gain to perhaps take a bigger swipe at things and get out in front of some restructuring that you may have planned for a couple of years into the future, just to kind of solidify that ability to kind of execute and deliver, like you've been doing over the last year? Is there a bigger restructuring out there, I guess, a potential for that? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think, Steve, when you go back to 2009, we've been really consistent about particularly the factory footprint, and that's at a place right now where I think it's very productive, it's well utilized. And when we looked at ideas around us coming into 2016, paybacks were in the range of, say, five years to eight years, which is just outside the range of what we thought in this environment was doable. That being said, when you look at areas of the business particularly around Compression Technologies, there is restructuring taking place there. And largely, it's in the areas of head count and things that we can do on a non-qualified way. So, tremendous focus on both corporate and costs within each of the businesses. So, there is a sort of drumbeat over time of doing that, but it's an effective and efficient \u2013 relatively effective and efficient footprint. One of the things that we find is the better we've gotten at lean, the further we've gotten into that, the longer and harder it is to get a payback on a closure, which is a good thing. So we remain I think open-minded, Steve. If in fact things deteriorated further, if in fact we saw an opportunity, we certainly would look at that. We'll keep an open mind on that. But rather than putting a big placeholder out there with no specifics, we wanted to just keep it to the known actions and the announcements that we've made internally inside the company to this point. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. First of all, congratulations on a great second half. The execution is certainly a lot better than many of your so-called high-quality peers. So, well done on 3Q, 4Q. I just wondered if I could maybe pick up on Steve's point about \u2013 very clear answer on restructuring, but I guess the two areas that pushed back for 2016 plan would be flat Industrial and maybe flat TK. So, I'm wondering if those come in weaker through the year, to what extent do you have contingency plans in place to mitigate the deleverage that you'd see if those do come in weaker. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Nigel, listen, again, I'll pick it up from the point of Steve, this is where investments would be metered down. A lot of investments we're making are not only in product but in channel, and also letting attrition at times work for you. So, we will continue to work that down. We certainly have a plan to sustain a lower revenue outlook if we see that. It's baked within the guidance we've provided \u2013 the range that we've provided. And our focus really is on the Industrial segment and it's fundamentally on the Compression Technologies piece. Todd's all over it. He's well into several months now into the role. I think he's got his eyes wide open around the opportunities. He's optimistic around what he's doing and I've got confidence in Todd and the team that they've got the plans hardwired for lots of different scenarios at this point. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, I'll pick up offline. And secondly, obviously you'd be aware that there's a pretty fertile debate about non-resi in North America given the broader weakness in industrial complex. The high-single digit growth in bookings during the quarter suggests that you're still seeing relatively fertile end markets. But maybe just pick up on where you stand and perhaps maybe comment on how the front is looking (30:43) right now. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think the surprise in the fourth quarter, at least to me, was the strength that we had both in applied and unitary in North America. We had double-digit applied bookings in the fourth quarter and we had mid-teens booking in unitary in the fourth quarter. So as a backdrop going into the first half of the year, it feels like we've at least got enough out there for us to see in terms of visibility to see that. Also, we had really good service growth, kind of high-single-digit growth in services. And controls was up nearly double digits there. So, it feels like we've caught a little bit of a lift in terms of institutional markets. Commercial hasn't turned down fully, that's why we're seeing good unitary, although some unitary spills into K-to-12 as well. So, that continues. And then, as you'd expect, just the investments in the service network and service footprint have been good for us. So, it's a pretty good backdrop from the fourth quarter going into the first part of the year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks, Mike. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Nigel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Just a question around the Climate margin guidance. It looks like you're guiding for a 40%-plus incremental margin in Climate for 2016 overall. Maybe looking at slide 15, you might have some mix headwinds in that segment this year with Resi growing so strongly, Thermo King and Trane Asia being flat to down. So I just wondered what you're embedding for mix in Climate for the year ahead. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, Julian, as we think about where Climate is going to go in 2016, I think you're right. You hit some of the high points. So we still see the continued trends in what we talked about in terms of Commercial HVAC in the Americas being strong, in EMEA being up, but on the Asia side being down a little bit. We called Residential up mid-single digits. You also have the factors of Latin America as part of the business. And while you have some growth in those sides, you've also got the transport revenues being flat in 2016. So I think it's all of those mix pieces could strengthen on the commercial side in North America and Europe, a little down on the Asia side, flat Transport, down on Latin America and good mid-single digit growth in Res. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So mix is sort of broadly neutral then, 2016 versus 2015 in Climate? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Julian, Residential, if you look at the peer group, we're right at the top of the pack in terms of profitability. I think it's a point often lost on investors is the amount of margin improvement that we've had at Residential business. So good Residential growth is good for us. It's fine. On the Transport side, if you look at Transport North America trailer, the industry being down 10%, our guidance embeds more of a 15% decline. We look at APUs, we had good growth for the year, we had 16% growth in APUs over the full year. We had good growth in bookings in the fourth quarter. We've got a strategy for a higher attachment rate to non-refrigerated trailers, about a 3 to 1 ratio; if we sell three APUs, that's equal to one North American trailer. So there is, between APU and some of the air businesses and other businesses that we have within TK, the ability to offset that decline. And then I'd point you back to the fact that European trailer was up nicely and, as that moves up, that's actually even more helpful than North American trailer. So net-net, we're good. Actually, what's down for us pretty big is container. We had a big year last year in container. Container is soft, the market in general. We're against a tough comp. But container is an area where, frankly, less container is helpful on the mix. So net-net, we think we can grow margins. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. Price/material was a 30 bps tailwind for the quarter and the year in 2015. Are you assuming sort of similar-ish for the year ahead? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We are. Again, you're absolutely right with we ended the fourth quarter with 30 basis points and full year 2015 at 30 basis points to 40 basis points. For 2016, we're going to expect a 30 basis point to 40 basis point range for that gap or that spread between price and direct material inflation. You do have higher material deflation numbers. As you'll recall, we had inflation in the first and second quarters of 2015, so you do get a lift out of that. But I think as we think about the push and take between price and direct material inflation, we think all-in-all it's going to come back to about that same 30 basis point to 40 basis point range in 2016 is what we saw. One of the other points, and you didn't ask this but I think it's relevant when we're having this discussion about price and direct material inflation, when we think about the differences between Climate and the Industrial businesses, the largest pieces of the benefit on material deflation do go to the Climate business. There is some and there still is a positive spread in the Industrial businesses, but it's much less than what you would see in Climate. And so as you're trying to compare year-over-year, you also don't have that nice benefit coming out of commodities and the direct material deflation on the Industrial side. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Raso - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning. A couple quick questions. First, acquisition pipeline. Can you give us a little feel for where you're feeling the opportunities are presenting themselves most, be it geographic, end market, however you want to address the question? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Really, David, the strategy for us has been to look at all the SBU's core businesses across all markets. And so there's a pipeline that would reflect all that from that perspective. There are two fundamental areas that we see for investment. One is channel. We continue to see opportunities, whether it's geographically outside the U.S. for channel or even in the U.S. in terms of buying back commercial distribution. That's a continued emphasis for us. We also find that when we can take a product, it might be a technology that we don't have, and sell it through our existing channel, particularly on the Trane Commercial side, we do very, very well with that. So obviously it's more attractive if you're buying anything that's (38:21) outside the U.S. And so we're pretty active looking outside the U.S. for a lot of that, which can be then modified and brought into the U.S. with different power requirements and different efficiency ratings, but some of the technologies can be applied. So we're seeing an active pipeline there as well. David Raso - Evercore ISI : And given the balance sheet power and the cash flow, would you care to give us any sense of bigger than a breadbasket-type sizing of what kind of size deals are you looking at currently? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, probably, David, truthfully that would only get us into trouble I think by doing a big breadbasket estimates. I think that you can look at where we would end the year in terms of ratios. In terms of EBITDA to debt, we end the year around the 2.4 times range. There's obviously some capacity with some of the current debt rating. We've got the cash. We talked about in the call the $675 million that's unidentified. So, there is an opportunity to do something a little bit larger. But what we're generally seeing though are small- to mid-sized deals that just make great economic sense. David Raso - Evercore ISI : Okay. A couple of quick things. Tax rate, with the IRS settlement now behind us, can you give us some guidance on how you think about the tax rate, be it this year, next year? I saw the tax rate guidance. I must admit, I was looking for a little lower tax rate in 2016 given the IRS settlement. But can you give us some guidelines how to model the next few years? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. So, we were probably a little conservative on the 24% to 25% effective tax rate guidance for 2016. I think that when you think about the IRS settlement, what the IRS settlement really does is it takes the risk profile off the company and it puts to bed all of the issues around intercompany debt and any issues that would have been in the 2001, 2002 through 2011 range. But what it really doesn't do is it doesn't really affect the overall effective tax rate. So, what you have to do in order to make that tax rate move is you have to continue to refine your strategy. Now, having all of those issues off the table certainly does give you an opportunity. And we are certainly involved in looking at that strategy in terms of the different areas that we're looking at. So, we have a good trading hub that is in Europe. We're looking at Asia and Panama for trading hubs. We're looking at all of our intercompany debt and making sure that we're as balanced as we go into 2016 as we would like to be. But we do also have a slight headwind, if you will, on tax rate. And that is, when you look around the globe and you think about our revenue growth in 2016, the areas that are growing the most are in North America, which does pressure the tax rate. So, that's a long way around saying we absolutely have a goal of looking at every opportunity to bring that rate down. We're still going to be just as conscientious about the items we take on as we've always been. But I do think we'll see some opportunities in 2016. We'll continue to work that strategy and continue to communicate. But like I say, it's also a good thing that we have a little pressure on that rate coming out of the North America growth. David Raso - Evercore ISI : All right. So in speaking quickly on cushions, just making sure, the corporate expense \u2013 I know there's rounding and you have to give ranges on segments and so forth, but it does seem to be implying your corporate expense goes up 10%, $230 million versus $210 million last year. Is that a rounding issue or should we really think that corporate expense is going up that much? But if you back from a total EBIT sort of implied by the segments, it is a larger number than I would have assumed. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, so it's not really rounding, but as we look at corporate expenses and \u2013 so, if you think back at 2015, where we started the year with our guidance was about $235 million, may sound familiar, and we ended the year at $210 million on the corporate side. When we look at 2016, we took a lot of discretionary spend out of 2015. There are some investments that we need to continue to make around our IT infrastructure, around cyber security. And we also have on the corporate side. So, we talked about pension in total for Ingersoll-Rand being about flat year-over-year. However, with a lot of puts and takes in the elements of pension, pension is a little higher on the corporate side in 2016. So it's not just rounding, it's not just putting things back in, but I'll also tell you that we're going to be very conscientious about what that spend is and in looking at not getting ahead of ourselves on any spend before we see what's going to happen in the different markets. So, it's a long way of saying that the $230 million, $235 million range is a lot more normal than $210 million but we're going to watch it closely and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that the money is spent very well and to the level that we need to. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : David, if you take the run rate plus the pension, you're right, there was a little bit of gap there which we would normally apply to things like IT infrastructure and security that we're on a program too to refresh. But, look, if the markets turn down, we would just look to pull back from a discretionary standpoint in other areas in corporate. So, there's a little bit of flex in it that we would take if the markets are a little bit rougher than we think. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, all. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, Mike. You've often talked about one of the characteristics, distinguishing marks, of the new Ingersoll-Rand it's how you hold decrementals when volumes are in the down part of the cycle. So, we're obviously witnessing that inside of Industrial, or about to. Can you maybe talk about what decrementals you really think you're going to be able to achieve here if things do go a little bit further south? And what's giving you the confidence on just, I guess, down low-single digits in air and industrial products when it looks like bookings are a bit worse than that and the broader environment is also a bit worse? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Steve, look, a great of example of that was what happened within Compression Technologies. If you take the legacy business, it ran almost flat on much lower volume. So, a great example of that. That was a extraordinary effort by that team to really pull all the stops out on productivity and discretionary spending and really to win in the marketplace. It's a little bit tough to compare comps against competition. Typically, it's denominated in different currencies. But we did fairly well there on the product and service side of the business. So, that's a great example. I would say that where we try to leverage it in the gross range of 25% and 30%, we're certainly looking to deleverage within the gross margin range but not to exceed 25% to 30%. So, that would be sort of the essence of that. It's going to depend a bit on the business. I mean, TK has fundamentally, I think, more opportunity. It doesn't leverage up nearly as high as people think, it doesn't deleverage nearly as poorly as people think, largely because the distribution base of that business is independent. And so, we're really turning on and off sort of factory production and we got very flexible plants and labor forces that work with us on that. So, a great example is TK, where we would look to certainly work inside of normal margins in that business. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And, Steve, just to add on to what Mike said on the Industrial side, when I step back and think about Industrial, I kind of think about three big buckets that impacted that. Again, no excuses, the decrementals need to be at the same level as the incrementals when we go forward. But Industrial has an outsized impact from foreign exchange. So, over 50% of their revenues are impacted or they're non-U.S. and are impacted by foreign exchange. So, you have that headwind going against them. We do have the amortization from the accounting on the acquisition of Cameron. Again, took that on. You knew we took that on, but it does impact what we're looking at in 2015. And then, as I pointed out earlier, when you think about they don't get the benefit or the big benefit coming out of direct material deflation with commodity prices because that's just not how that segment works, the air business gets the benefit out of some of that but the other businesses within the segment do not. And so, when you say you've got outsized foreign exchange, less direct material deflation, and we put an acquisition in there with some additional amortization, so I'd think about that in the total inflation, too. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. And then, as a follow-up to an earlier question. You talked a lot about the price versus material deflation rage, spread, but a little more on the pricing environment itself absent material, what are you seeing in your big businesses in pricing, what kind of behavior are you seeing? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, both businesses in the fourth quarter are positive-priced, which is pretty outstanding, frankly, across-the-board, and that's with pressure in Climate in Asia and of course with Industrial pressure all over the world, still able to get price in that business. So, we're still seeing positive price albeit it's pretty thin in the quarter. So that's, I think, a good indicator of sort of pricing power and just sort of the pricing structure within the industry holds pretty well through tougher times. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And that same will hold for 2016, with both segments projecting positive price for 2016. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Just back to Industrial for a moment, Mike. Just thinking about the margins sequentially, if Cameron hit its targets and with the sequential revenue that you just had seasonally, I would have thought the margins would have been a little bit better there. Can you just kind of walk us through that? And then, just help reconcile this a little bit, how we get comfortable with the kind of flattish Industrial for the year coming off this Q4 order number? Is there something in particular that you see in the pipeline that gives you some confidence in that number? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Jeff, I'll start and then I'll let Sue finish. But what I think a lot of folks don't recognize when we talk about Industrial is impact that material handling and tools would have. Material handling is really exclusively oil and gas for us. It's 7% (50:34) of that segment has been hit incredibly hard. And, frankly, the tools business was hit very hard by that business as well. Highest-margin businesses in the portfolio. And so when those go down, you feel it. It's a substantial headwind buried inside the segment numbers that's independent of what's happening with Cameron or Compression in general. The other thing, if you go back to Compression Technologies specifically is we do very well from a margin perspective historically in Asia and in Latin America. And so from a mix perspective, when those markets are down, and they've been absolutely clobbered, we feel that as well from a mix perspective. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. And so, let's talk about the ECC business for just a little bit. And so, I think the overarching point that we wanted to make when we were talking about that business is that it was EBITDA and EPS accretive, which is where we had hoped to go. However, I would say that as you look at that business from the time that we looked at the acquisition until we completed 2015, I would say that that roadmap, just like we talked about with the entire company, has a few different components. So if you think about the revenue side of that business, you certainly have the four components of the business with the plant, air side of the business being really hit by the weakened Industrial markets, and so that book and turn business definitely took a downturn in 2015. You also have tough markets with oil prices. So on the processed gas side and on the engineered air side, you got fewer projects. You've got the same number of competitors, and so you've got some tough markets there. Then, you've got an aftermarket, which is an opportunity. Having said all of that, what we did with the business in 2015 with a top line that wasn't perhaps as strong as what we wanted is we accelerated some of the synergies in the business and, in fact, overdrove the operating synergies \u2013 not revenue synergies, but the operating synergies in the business. And we're going to continue to do that. So, the point wasn't that it's operating exactly as we would have called it a year ago. But I think as we look to the business and what we were going to do with it, we ended up with a pretty good result on the acquisition. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Jeff, too, lots maybe in this is really strong execution here by the team integrating it. It'll turn out that the synergy in this thing will be about 15% of Cameron's revenues. So, that's double the synergies we thought we would have, which is a good thing because, obviously, the top line is much weaker and that's the reason it's still accretive from cash EPS perspective in the year. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Just one housekeeping item. The release says there's $250 million of repo in Q4 and $250 million in January. That $250 million in Q4 is really referring to a full year number, correct? Was there some settlement issue or something else that I'm missing there? It looks like you did $233 million through nine months. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think that was in October and we had some settlements in September. So there... Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations : Late October, we said we had spent I think $233 million and $250 million by the end of October, yes. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Did you catch that? Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Not completely, no. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Okay, sorry. We were joining in on the response in the room and I apologize for that. So we did do the $250 million in the fourth quarter. We talked about that roughly in the third quarter call. And then we had a separate 10b5-1 program that repurchased $250 million in January. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : $250 million quarter four, $250 million quarter one. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right. I'll follow up. It says $233 million in the Q3 10-Q. That's why I'm confused. But I'll follow up. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's right. So, yeah. So what happened there, Jeff, so you're absolutely right. At the time we released earnings for the third quarter, which would have been the third week in October, we had not settled out the entire $250 million. So there was a little bit of leakage that was over into the remainder, but it was an October event. So in other words, we were announcing that we had gone into the market just like we are now. We're not talking about the first quarter, but in the first quarter we repurchased the $250 million, we had repurchased $233 million in October and the total was $250 million for the fourth quarter. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay, got it. Thank you for clarifying. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you and good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. So going back to Residential HVAC, I was hoping you'd give a little more commentary on the mix of new buying versus repair. Have you seen any change in behavior there and I guess any margin implication this might have? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, clearly we're seeing more that's not so much new construction and repair, it's largely new construction and replacement. And so we're moving back now towards replacement. Replacement is a very good place for us. We've got really good shares there as compared to new construction where shares are lower. So when the market moves toward replacement, we generally do much better and you saw that in the high-teens bookings in the fourth quarter and the overall good performance that we had in 2015, where we had really excellent performance in 2015. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on China just by segment and then also you touched on VRF trends. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, China, it's still rough. We're not seeing great progress in China in either business. Having said that, we're somewhat in a trough and we didn't see it really dip further in the quarter in quarter four. We saw great strength outside of China, so Singapore, Thailand, India, really sort of... Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hong Kong. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ...Hong Kong, kind of made the day for us relative to Asia. So, nice to see those markets finally recovering on that front. VRF continues to do very well for us, continues to grow at or above the pace of our unitary business. And we continue to have a very high share in North America, parts of South America in the VRF business. And I think, as you know, we don't play a big role outside of those territories, we play a small role in China largely in commercial VRF or in hybrid systems. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. That was it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Mike, in terms of the acquisitions and the currency impact on Industrial this year, I think it seems like every quarter they've been almost 200 basis points. Maybe Sue could provide us the split of what that was for 2015. How much was the acquisition impact, how much was currency? And then next year I'm assuming the acquisition impact year-over-year goes away but you still have some currency. Maybe help us on how those headwinds change. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's split about 50/50 in 2015. It was about 1 point both. So, translational and transactional would have been about 1 point and acquisitions would have been about 1 point of headwind. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : And for 2016? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No acquisition headwind because everything based on the calendar, it was all a 2015 start and finish. So there's nothing there. On the FX side, it's going to be, again, a pretty tough row to hoe, probably 4 points of headwind coming into revenues and we'd see normal leverage against that. So it's probably 30 basis points, 40 basis points coming at us on that front. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And to your question on the full year of 2015, so the overall operating margins were down 140 basis points. And the math would work out roughly the same if you took out the foreign exchange and the acquisitions, that that would be the majority of what the decrement was in the overall operating margin percentage. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then as you think about eventually getting this business get past \u2013 a lot of the focus obviously currently on this call about the near-term Industrial weakness, but you do have this target you want to eventually get to for the 2017 to 2019, and now Todd is in place in the air business. Other than cost take-outs to deal with the tougher current volumes, what are the key things you think you need to clear in order to get this to be a higher-margin business a few years out? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So the material handling piece, Shannon, probably hit for 1.5 points, maybe up to 2 points right there. So I think really an underestimation as to what the impact would be across the segment of the material handling business. So add 1.5 points there. I figure currency at least stops moving against us at some point and flattens out. That's going to be helpful to us. And then any volume we see there, we'd be leveraging that at 30%, 35% on that front. So there's been very soft productivity in that business, as I mentioned, particularly as it relates to the integration, that work in the back half, work, once we saw the revenue outlook deteriorates through 2015. So, it's not a productivity issue. It's, again, if you look at a business like material handling, a small business with that sort of an impact \u2013 you look at currency, which they get not only translation but there's a much larger transactional component there, where it doesn't make sense for us to have too many factories at the machining and so on and so forth, so if you're putting those in the wrong part of the world it's hard to move those and you're going to absorb some of that headwind for a while. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, listen, I think that we'll update you when we're together for the Analyst Meeting, Todd will sit again (1:01:49) in that seat and give you a point of view on that. And then Robert Zafari will clearly tell you kind of the other pieces of this as well, which have material impact as they're very high-margin businesses. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I think this has been asked a little bit already, but maybe just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions about the Industrial assumption for flat growth given the orders have been decelerating. Just maybe, some color there on what's driving that expectation. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you look at 2009 when we saw customers abandoning equipments, shutting plants, we're not seeing that in 2015, we're not likely to see it in 2016. We're seeing customers that are just reducing CapEx. So, you're not seeing large machines as an example. Now, large machines, both Cameron and existing Ingersoll-Rand, were about 10% of the total business. Now, we'll see parts and service probably in the mid- to high-single-digit range next year as these older systems need to be maintained and serviced. We even saw that begin to materialize in the back half of 2015. So again, 10% of the Compression Technology business being big machines, 45-ish percent being services. And then remember, too, you got Club Car, the tools and the fluid business which should be a tailwind. However, material handling will continue to be a headwind again going into 2016 there. So, net that all out and the best view we have is that that math works to about negative 1 to 1. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. That's very helpful. And maybe just kind of, well, a housekeeping question on the Hussmann adjustment. I think you talked about $55 million from Hussmann and asbestos. I think those two items through the third quarter were just under $30 million. So, was there like a big Hussmann 4Q, or maybe you can just unpack that a little bit? That would be helpful. Thanks. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, the Hussmann result in the fourth quarter were fairly normal with what they've been throughout 2015. So that really didn't have an impact. It was right on where we would have guided at the end of October. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We'll look at what you're talking about, though, and follow back up if there's more to that question. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: A lot of my questions have been answered, so maybe just first one, on the price/cost spread that you laid out there, Sue, if I think about how that pertains to Climate, threw the majority in there, am I to assume kind of normal volume leverage of that in the mid-20%s. Is that what you guys are essentially guiding to or am I missing something? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I think that would be a good assumption. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then just a follow-up. I know we've beaten the Industrial megatrend discussion to death. But thinking about Cameron backlog presumably coming into 2016, that's a little bit lower. Probably, particularly low in the first quarter given that is more of a 4Q-weighted business. Is that something that is contemplating guidance? How should we think about that as maybe a headwind to the broader reading out of just comps getting easier on some of the resource industries and the service piece being an offset? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Josh, no doubt we're going to see weaker big machine revenues. That's forecast into what we're doing. What we found here as an operator of the business is that the pricing in March in some of that big stuff is not very good. It's really around the service and longevity of those systems over time as opposed to sort of the impact on sale in the quarter and delivery. So really, what we need to make up there in the weakness is service, parts. And in some of the smaller machines including oil-free and segments of the market that will continue to grow like pharmaceutical, food and beverage end markets where it's more consumer-driven, say, than it would be through heavy industry. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. All right, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Janet Pfeffer for any closing remarks. Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations : Thank you, operator. One thing I wanted to just clarify \u2013 I was a little far away from the mic. And so, on share repurchase, we completed the $250 million buy in the fourth quarter. $233 million of it was completed as of the end of September, the remainder completed out and settled in October. Just so to avoid some folks, any confusion on that, I wanted to clarify that. And Joe and I will be around for your follow-up questions today. Everybody, have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ingersoll-Rand First Quarter 2016 Earnings Release. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Janet Pfeffer. Ma'am, you may begin. Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations : Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's first quarter 2016 conference call. We released earnings at 6 :30 this morning and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting in addition to this call through our website at ingersollrand.com, and that's also where you'll find the slide presentation that we'll be referring to this morning. The call will be recorded and archived on our website. If you'd please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated. And our release also includes non-GAAP measures which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. And to introduce the participants on this morning's call, Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations. Please go to slide three, and I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Janet. For those of you who don't know, that's Janet's last time she'll be to read the Safe Harbor statement. She's retiring at the end of this month after a brilliant career at Ingersoll-Rand. We're going to miss Janet greatly. And, Janet, I want to wish you and Ron all the best in your retirement. Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations : Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So with that, we delivered a very strong quarter that exceeded EPS guidance and reflected excellent execution across the whole company. The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here. First, we're leading our markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering operational excellence across our businesses. Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I said before, critical to any sustained cultural transformation, our employees are engaged, their scores are continuing to increase across the company. Employees continue to see Ingersoll-Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience, and that ultimately delivers shareholder value. Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full-year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beat. Now this morning I'm going to you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop, give you some color on how we're progressing for the year. I thought it would be useful to highlight where our performance maps specifically to our overall strategy, and then I'm going to turn it over to Sue and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year. So over the past 16 weeks I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees, from service technicians to sales teams. And as always I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still a long runway of opportunity in front of us. With that, let's go to slide 4. And I'm going to note that all my comments are on an organic basis so they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. And I'll turn first to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong overall and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. In commercial HVAC recent, put in place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth. And we believe this should continue through at least 2017. We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets, within the institutional markets; education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter coupled with high-single-digit bookings growth. I want to point out too that we expect to see a record for quarter two with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter two as a result of some large institutional project awards. We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we've made over the past years. And we've seen growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. As in 2015, we are beginning quarter one of 2016 with double-digit growth in our controls and service business. With over 4,300 company direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVA service to commercial customers in the world. Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs. Overall execution has been excellent. With clear discipline, the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business. I'm occasionally asked what do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll-Rand, and in reading some of the sell-side reports I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to lay out some of the facts for you. According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter over the past six quarters including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into the quarter one of 2016, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter one brought mid-teen bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high-single-digit range for the year. The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream, and it's showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies, and in our connected home strategy, where we have a profitable business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential Controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually. Shifting to North America and transport refrigeration markets, as usual the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve their margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year. ACT raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year, and their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%. We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast to approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance from last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February. Our truck refrigeration business was also solid, and the overall market for Class 3 to Class 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units to continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets. As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth. We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high-single digits against the flattish market backdrop. We are seeing excellent uptake of the new product introductions. And like North America, the service business also grew at a double-digit rate. I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made in the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With the FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us. Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and we expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Moving to Asia Pacific, it is difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed and it's not that consistent month to month. Our performance though has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and a focus we put on in increasing our direct channel market investment to achieve fuller market coverage. Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter one and up low-teens for Asia Pacific as a whole. Our strategic focus on growing the service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow, and our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences. Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia. So concluding, the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update would take us to Latin America, where markets remain very volatile with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions though in Mexico remain fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we are pleased with our performance in the market. We have expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace. Let's move to slide five. And here we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low-single digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we are focused in growing our service businesses across the enterprise and executing well on that strategy. In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters. Now large equipment CapEx, typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors, historically rebounds at utilization readings above 80%. On one visit I had the opportunity to meet with a major customer that's been around for decades building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 gallons to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this PhD physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in his end markets, and he responded very simply by saying it's when the telephone rings, and fortunately he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours in that area. So whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is to that even early activity in large machine quoting activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016. To give you a little bit more color on this for the North American market, when you look at compressors between five horsepower and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between five horsepower and 15 horsepower, is off roughly 10%, while compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first two industry-reported months of the quarter. Smaller compressors quarter. The smaller compressors are quicker book and turn with inventory re-stocking occurring in that category. We also believe we are seeing some re-stocking to the wholesale channel in our tools and fluid management business. Our material handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business we have a management team doing a very good job exhibiting strong cost control, execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines in projected global market growth. In Europe we're seeing increased exports to industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're cautiously optimistic to see if we have reached an inflection point as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea. And China's power consumption index has also shown growth in the first two months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage. So rounding up the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America where volatility in the markets there across the region continues to be driven by political instability, and this has contributed to reduced investment in verticals such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals. However, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlooks. So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company while using our operating systems to deliver well above industry average results. Now I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let costs get ahead of revenues in the quarter. Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and were up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5% both on a reported and an organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses led by commercial and residential in North America. Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter, with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015. Large centrifugal compressors and other Industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates but Club Car performed as expected with low year-over-year growth. Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix. Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year, exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1 our capital deployment actions included repurchasing $250 million of shares, and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter. Please go to slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter, i.e., there was no breakage. Price was positive in both segments, and direct material deflation was also very positive to our guidance. Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we controlled spending while we evaluated our end market volatility. Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range (18:44). Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks and will spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016. Please go to slide right. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high-single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied. We continue to see excellent growth in service controls, contracting and parts, with double-digit growth in the quarter. Regionally for commercial HVAC, we saw high-single-digit booking increases with a high-single-digit increase in North America and Europe, up low-teens in Asia, and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America. Residential bookings were up 17%. Organic transport orders were down low-single digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low-single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car. Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors while freeing (20:23) in some of our component businesses like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment. Please go to slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Our Industrial segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe while Asia was flat and North America was down high-single digits. Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier with a strong start in North America. Industrial segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost control. Please go to slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter, 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by 40 basis point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015. Overall reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment. Please go to slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 basis points and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4% respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending. The leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America. Europe had low-single digit equipment growth and high-single digits in services and trucking and (24:00) parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales. Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1 with very strong leverage and significant margin improvement. First quarter organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016. Please go to slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high-single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low-single digits and were flat in Asia. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.6% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive, productivity offset other inflation, and volume and mix were unfavorable. Please go to slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter and we're well-positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier-volume second quarter. Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems costs in the first quarter of 2015. Please go to slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategy and our operational excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system. We raised the annual dividend 10% in early 2016 with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We bought shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter at an average share price of $51.10. Please go to slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue. North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volume has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. Both the growth forecasts shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-American \u2013 North American business for us; and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipment to be down high-single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low-single digits. Please go to slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for the full-year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about two percentage points. While these revenue outlets do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates. We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically. For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margin. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30 basis point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year. Please go to slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note, for 2016 currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full-year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year. Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single digits on a reported basis. Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80. Back out $0.01 of restructuring and the $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32. For the full-year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring and the Hussmann proceeds, of $950 million to $1 billion. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thank you, Sue. And I'll be brief. As I started out this morning, we had a strong quarter. We improved operating performance in a volatile environment. We realized price in both segments. We achieved outstanding leverage and improved our cash flow. We're growing in the areas we put a strategic focus. There's clear evidence that this won't be crated. (31:39). Our operating system is gaining momentum. And I'm confident in our management team, and we feel good about our forecast for the remainder of the year. So with that, Sue and I will take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Josh. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just on the price-cost equation here, clearly a pretty strong contribution in the first quarter. Can you help us with how that dimensions out, just based on purchasing agreements and hedges you already have in place, over the balance of the year? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Absolutely. So you're right. The 160 basis point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis because last year we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than the 160 basis points. But what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half-second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, though Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance, and we expect some of that to continue in Q2 and also strong performance from the material side. Price is one of those areas where I think you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a big execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment. But as it comes to the commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs. But generally I think those are going to be pretty stable. We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016. Because of the way that our contracts are written we wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue. All of the tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in in Q1 also. So I think we had a great environment and I think we'll have a great result. So if you recall, we had given you a look at the full year I think 30 basis points to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance. And as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then, Sue, just as a follow-up, I remember last quarter you talked about some of the toggles for the tax rate and specifically mentioned intercompany debt. Could you just maybe update us where we're at on the total tax strategy in light of some of the Treasury rulings? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. So I think the first way to start out that question, Josh, is to say that we've looked at all of the proposed Treasury regulations, and we don't expect those regulations to have an impact on our effective tax rate in 2016. As we think about the tax strategy that I talked about, getting us into a low-20s% type of tax rate on an ongoing basis, I also don't expect those regulations to have an impact on us getting into those areas. And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do \u2013 trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned, and other tax-efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go. We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rates by each of our SBUs so that we're all working on taxes, we do our plans, and we do our forward looks. And I think that'll help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed Treasury regulations. We'll obviously continue to look at those and make sure that we understand all of the sort of derivative impact that might be out there from the regulations, but no impact on the rate and no impact on our strategy going forward. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks for the answer. Operator : And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Joe. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Joe. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I guess my first question, maybe starting on Industrial where you did see decelerating trends. I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter, and if I recall correctly there were some cam shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year. And so I'm just wondering is there still opportunity for further action in Industrial and I guess what's the strategy at this point? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So the $0.02 of restructuring that we spent in Q1 was related to Industrial. We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year, and those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about a $0.01 for each of the next three quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we look at it is that the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize the benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring, and that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about Industrial margins improving in the back half of the year. So some of that productivity kicks in and some of the restructuring actions that were actually started almost a year ago are going to kick in. Now on the ECC side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal compressors. Those are really coming down, so bookings are up, which is good. The revenues that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals. But also importantly as we think about ECC and that business is we expect to really be on track with the revenue and the cost synergies for 2016 that we had outlined. So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you see some strengths in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Joe, remember, too, that I think that we've been serial restructurers now for years, and that's both qualified and non-qualified. So we're always improving the cost base there. When you look at the type of paybacks that we are seeing in this business, we're getting numbers like seven years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running plants, utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants. If you couple that with the lead time to bring on new capacity when the markets return, that's a 24-month to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get whipsawed in doing any larger restructuring when this thing turns around because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious. So we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate values change or if tax incentives change from one location to another, it could swing something like that. So we're very cautious about looking at an upswing in the lead time to bring capacity on when you need it. And we don't want to ever be in a situation at an upswing in the market to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That makes sense, Mike. I guess maybe my follow-on question, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you say that 2Q North America commercial HVAC bookings were expected to be up about 25%? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, that's correct. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And is that the reason for the organic revenue guidance raise? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's more of an impact in 2017 and it's got a little bit of a positive in 2016, a little bit of a positive in 2018. But the bulk of that would be 2017 shipments. So it's really the strength of the business across the board. Unitary continues to be strong. The pipeline looks strong for us. Europe has been a great success story. I think it will continue as well. And of course the residential business continues to put up some very big numbers. And so all of that combined has got more to do with the guidance increase than the large booking number in quarter two. By the way, quarter three should look pretty good for us as well. Although I don't have a prognostication on the percentage rate, it should be a good quarter for us. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. I just want to say thanks a lot to Janet for all the help, and all the best. In terms of the first question, that would really be back on the Industrial margins. They used to be at sort of 16%, 17% of the odd quarter here and there, and they are down to 9% to 10% right now. And the guidance embeds that by the end of the year I guess they climb back into the sort of low-teens in the next three quarters. So maybe just help clarify what's driving that sort of 400 point-plus margin recovery. Is it just about productivity or is there something going on with the mix as well of Industrial versus compression? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So Julian, great question. On the Industrial margins, your math is absolutely correct that in the back half of the year we do have the operating margins for Industrial improving into the low-teens. And as we look at what's going to happen in the back half of the year, it truly is productivity, still lower inflationary type of rates. So you've got productivity offsetting other inflation. You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just a skosh more volume in the back half of the year than the front. I don't want anyone to think there is a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this; we have not. But there is by virtue of how the quarters pan out roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity. It is the restructuring actions that are kicking in, and it is the continuation of the actions that the management teams are taking to work through this low revenue and market decline. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There was also, Julian, the cost control there is exceptional. So even though you were seeing kind of a headline $0.02 restructuring, there's at least that much, maybe more than that which would be non-qualified restructuring. So it's sort of restructuring in place, not replacing or fulfilling spending. So there is a cost for that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment, but a big piece of that productivity is literally the cost control around head count, some of which is qualified, some of which is non-qualified in terms of how we would actually account for it. The longer-term question that you asked about the profitability of the business, Sue did a little bit of analysis on this, and it might be useful to kind of walk through when we would see a 17% margin business. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : All right. That's great. So when I look at it \u2013 so the first thing that we did is we went back and said at the time that we gave the original 17% margin guidance for the Industrial business, the revenues in the business were in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. If I look at where we're at today, we're roughly in the $3 billion type of territory. So I think as we look at the business, we're doing all of the right actions today to get the costs in line, but I think what we need is market recoveries and I think the revenues to return to sort of that upper $3 billion range for us to get into the 17% margin. We think that's doable, but I think the timeframe is really highly dependent on when the markets come back. Right now, we haven't seen the markets actually stop falling. So we need to stabilize first and then the markets to return, but again I think the way I'm thinking about it is once the revenues get back up into the $3.6 billion, $3.7 billion area where they were when we gave that guidance, that we'll be nearing those 17% type of margins for Industrial. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Remember, when you look at the gross margins of that business and look at the fixed cost of that business say relative to the Climate segment, you can see very easily why that business snaps back very strongly on volume. So when volume returns to that business, we'll get very aggressive incremental margins out of that. In the short term, we're controlling the heck out of costs the best we can. However, we're not going to spite our nose to save our face as it relates to capacity. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then just my follow-up quickly would be, on your overall firm-wide margin bridge, Q1 you had about 10 points or 10 bps from productivity and other inflation. I guess based on what you just said, should we think the number for the year ends up somewhere between that 10 bps and the sort of the 90 bps tailwind that you had last year for the year as a whole? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I do think that you will \u2013 we do see other inflation to be higher in the first half versus the second half is when our salary increases takes place. That's when a lot of the benefits take place. So when I look at what we plan for the full year, I would say it probably looks more like 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the full year, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Nigel. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. I really hope Janet isn't calling a peak here. I don't think she is. But thanks for all the help. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : She is fine. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So this North American auto expenses is really interesting, Mike, and I'm assuming that's really driven by these large-type projects, finally some big spend (49:04). I'm just wondering what's changed here. I mean is it just a case of old equipment we're seeing here, so the extended replacement cycle can move through? Is it budgetary? I mean any color there would be helpful. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Nigel, I think all that's true, but the constant persistent investment we've made over five years, six years, seven years in that business, the constant investment in the channel and the service footprint is really paying off. And I just think the focus we've had on all of that development being around energy efficiency, sustainability, new refrigerant development, all of that is such a powerful story when you look at it. This is what we were waiting for. This is what we hoped to have seen, which is outsized growth relative to the market and outsized profitability or margin expansion relative to the market. So this is a huge effort by lots of people all the way through to the technicians providing service on the street for us. This is a real accomplishment. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And obviously very early to call 2017 at this point, but if you just look at your North American commercial HVAC operations based on the backlog of pipeline, is it reasonable to assume that perhaps you might see some acceleration next year? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the thing you have to think about though is what happens to the office and retail business. As an example, our national accounts business has been doing extremely well into retail. Office building is doing really well, as you can see, kind of the high-teens bookings rate again. Unitary, that's been strong again. Some point you'd think that that would begin to subside and be replaced by stronger applied growth, which I think will happen. So I think what you end up with is maybe a change in the mix between unitary and applied, but I do think continued strong performance through 2017. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Mike. That's helpful. Operator : And our next question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Steve. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the Climate side, I mean just a very big margin number, obviously, and I'm trying to just wrap my head around the seasonality dynamics, 1Q to 2Q. In the last couple years you've had increases, like in 2014 you guys saw a doubling or almost a tripling of the profit number in Climate. Can you just maybe speak to maybe what you expect seasonally there or maybe just at a high level what you expect for the margin in that business as we move through the year? And my guess is the seasonality is a bit muted because you're now seeing the onset of commercial, which is a less seasonal business than some of these other things, or just maybe help us square that, just with the first quarter basis so high that just having trouble kind of getting low enough in Climate. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Steve, so I think that looking at something certainly in the 16% margin range for the entire segment is going to make a lot of sense for us. Again, to Sue's point, price I think subsides a little bit, material inflation kind of clips along pretty much at the same rate, bookings look good, pipeline looks fairly strong. We're not seeing \u2013 the container business on the transport side being down of course is not all that problematic for us in terms of margins as long as European trailer and North American trailer are doing well. So you put that all together and you're probably dealing with something in the 16% range. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you at some point soon kind of get to that 17%? Will you kind of hit that at some point this year? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know. I mean, really looking at Q3 and Q4 at that level of granularity around guidance, Steve, I don't know. I mean Q2 is seasonally a pretty good quarter for us. Quarter three can be. So we've got an outside shot at something like that. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just on the kind of go-forward leverage, so you had this nice pop off the bottom on margins. Should we continue to expect that if this kind of current mix holds, that if commercial HVAC does really continue to roll on here and we have a bit more of an extended cycle than I think most people were expecting probably three months to four months ago, can you still leverage that business really well, or do you have to add cost or anything like that? I mean I feel like you got to have plenty of capacity here to let it rip a little bit before you start to throw money at the business from a capacity perspective, right? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the service business and the controls business are growing so well, too, and our margins are obviously much higher. So it's a little bit distorting about how we might think about fixed costs being factory costs. So I do think that there is some capacity we have even in our field service and controls capability that wouldn't require incremental investment. Obviously it's feet on the street, but we stay in front of that, and we typically hire long in the service business. So I don't see why having leverage for the full year \u2013 it starts with a 4 \u2013 would be a problem in the Climate business. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then one last quick one. You guys took up the price cost year-over-year by I think 40 bps you said, but you only took your margins up by 30 bps. Anything \u2013 that's just volume and mix at Industrial, is that kind of that moving part? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, inflation kicks in just in terms of wage increases beginning in April for the full year, and we kind of see sort of the cost increase there as well. Puts a little bit of a squeeze... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ...on margins there. But fundamentally, Steve, there's not anything really changing other than the fact that it's hard to believe that price would stay high as it normally is, and material inflation should stay about where it is, but we're looking at just closing that gap a little bit probably from the price side. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jeff. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Mike, can you just elaborate a little bit more on kind of the bookings strength? And was that a \u2013 that 25% number, is that global or are you speaking to the U.S.? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It would be the North American commercial business. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : North American commercial. It does sound like Europe, though, is fairly strong for you on share gain. How do you see that playing out over the balance of the year? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I went \u2013 probably I saw five, six of our factories and operations in Europe a month ago. I met with the engineering teams. I saw product launching between August and December, Jeff. It's one of the best stories I've seen, absolutely the fastest cycle time between ideation and product launch. They're hitting it right on the money in terms of what the customers are looking for. It's been a great story for us on the ECC side in Europe. But I'll also tell you, switching over to FRIGOBLOCK, FRIGOBLOCK was a family-run German company. If you put sort of a paradigm around that, you might think slow to change or difficult to incorporate in the operating system. What I found there was one of the fastest implementations of an operating system that we've put in place across the company. It's very exciting. And the openness around that \u2013 and then the openness of our transport refrigeration team to include that hybrid electric technology into the truck platform is also very positive. So I left Europe feeling very bullish. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then could you address what's going on in 14 SEER? Probably still early in the season to know for sure, but does that price gap versus legacy 13 SEER holding in that 10% to 15% range? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Jeff, it is holding. And I think the great news about the 14 SEER is what we saw was the balance of 14 SEER and greater product is still about 80% of the revenues in 2016. So we're seeing price, we're seeing the favorable mix that we expected out of the product. And we're also seeing that the balance between 14 SEER and even the 15 SEER and above has not really changed, which does create a good environment as you alluded to with the price and cost differential. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : So is that 40 basis points of positive mix, Sue, that you elaborated all in residential? Did you actually have more than that in residential than you saw somewhere else? Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So it was not all residential. It was a combination of residential and also Thermo King. On the Thermo King side, and one of the things that we saw was we saw more strength than we expected in truck and trailer both in North America and in Europe. And then the big declines on Thermo King came from the marine container business that I said was down about 60%. So the 40 basis points of mix was primarily from res and from Thermo King. And my recollection is it was split pretty evenly. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBank Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jeff. Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. So what's driving the 1Q order growth in residential, and what gives you the confidence to kind of move that forecast up ahead of the selling season? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean first and foremost the product line really at this point has been fully developed, and we've hit stride, all the good success with the furnace product, all the good success with the new launches, the variable speed, growth in Nexia. All these things have just been really kind of coming together. Operationally, we just find the pipeline for projects and productivity and quality to be improving. Deliveries have been exceptional in terms of on-time delivery and having product available where you need it, when you need it, really investing in the warehousing and investing in the product availability. So just a sense here that things have gone right for a long time here and that we'll do better, particularly as the mix moves up north of 14 SEER, which it is. So as the mix moves north of 14 SEER, we do better anyway. And as the mix moves more toward replacement and away from new construction, we'll do better. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then how's the M&A pipeline kind of informing how you're thinking about buyback through the balance of the year? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There is no doubt we want to grow the company and grow value over the long run. So we said we're looking at ideas and businesses that we know and run and are successful with. FRIGOBLOCK and Cameron were great examples; different examples but great examples of being able to take businesses, put them into an operating system, improve the businesses and deliver essentially what we said we were going to deliver from an accretion perspective. So we feel good about our capability in doing that. We also feel patient. We feel like we don't have to \u2013 we're not compelled to do anything around M&A. We've got great positions in the marketplace, and there's not a compelling need for us to go do something and potentially do something where we pay too much in that process. So, Jeff, we'll continue to evaluate that. When we see opportunities that fit the criteria we'll pull the trigger. And we clearly want to grow long-term value to the shareholder, and that's probably the best way to do it. With that being said, you couldn't pass up in January. The stock price dislocated 20% from the peer group. I mean we jumped in on that and acquired $250 million in January at $51 a share. So we're going to be dynamic, we're going to be opportunistic, and we're going to grow shareholder value. If that means we find the right bolt-ons to do that, we're going to jump on those, too. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning. And also appreciate the additional detail in the disclosure today. It's helpful. Let's see. So first of all, Mike, how are you reconciling all of this discussion about commercial HVAC strong growth relative to what is pretty lackluster Dodge data, ABI, all these macro data points? Are you attributing it all to share, renovation, control, service? Just maybe a little clarity on that would be helpful. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's sort of all of the above, Steve, which is probably hard to give clarity on that. But if you take Latin America, we're up mid-teens in Latin America. That's clearly our people out in the street creating demand, making it happen. Mid-teens bookings growth in Asia. I mean Asia is not that strong. Again, our team is hitting the street. Europe, we talked about product development, and the pace of product development there is best-in-class in the company and product management, best we have in the company around getting exactly right on these product growth teams and understanding where we're competing, how we're going to win against very specific competitors in the market. These products launched, and they do exactly what they were supposed to do. That's a positive for us. So there's a lot of self-help here happening and the backdrop on the markets, with the exception of the Middle East, isn't bad. So you've got decent markets and really strong execution. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And how are you doing on \u2013 what's the growth rate on VRF in the quarter, progress, any developments there? Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Last year we were about 30% growth. This year we're about the same, Steve. We continue to do well on the market. We continue to sell VRF. We're beginning to also see interest in what's referred to as four-pipe chiller. So this is simultaneous heat and cooling around water circulating through buildings versus refrigerant. It's big in Europe, picking up a little bit of interest in the U.S. The idea here is we're going to have whatever products are demanded in the marketplace, and then we're going to work with our customers to figure out what the best solution is for the building. And that's why our business was up 30% last year. It's why our business is up about the same this year as well. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Operator : And that concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Miss Janet Pfeffer for closing remarks. Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations : Thank you. And thank you, everybody. Joe and I will be available for follow-up calls later today and it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. Have a great day. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

With that, please go to slide three, and I will turn the call over to Mike. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Great, thank you, Zac, and officially welcome to Ingersoll-Rand and your first earnings call with us. As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company, delivering 15% EPS growth, record operating margins, share gains, and strong cash flow, despite challenging industrial markets. We are seeing strong momentum in the operating system that we have been installing and developing in the company over the past six-plus years. As we did last quarter, I'd like to start out spending a few minutes linking this quarter's performance to the longer-term strategic direction of the company to help investors understand how we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company over the longer term. With our operating system, operational excellence and growth excellence have been cornerstones of the strategy from the beginning, with our goal of becoming the very best operating company within our diversified or multi-industry peer group. This quarter, we continued to deliver best-in-class operating leverage of 47%, and our goal is to achieve top-quartile organic growth for the quarter and for the year as well. There were a number of noteworthy milestones that showed clear progress in these areas during the quarter. Our Residential HVAC business had another outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability. We estimate that over the past quarter and 12 months we now have benchmarked profitability in this business and are seeing the benefits of a five-year effort to refresh the product line, align and reposition the channel and dramatically improve product management, manufacturing and supply chain. Our Residential business is also a model for the deployment of product growth teams who are delivering market share and margin growth. Our Commercial HVAC business in North America had record second quarter bookings and revenue. Similar to our Residential HVAC story, we have executed on a consistent strategy with a goal to have the freshest, most energy efficient and reliable product line in the industry, and have supported that with consistent operational improvements along the way. We continue to see double-digit increases in our controls business and high single-digit growth in our service business, consistent with our strategy to balance equipment with controls and services. In the second quarter, Trane Commercial led the industry with a strong pipeline of new high-efficiency products, many of which earn our EcoWise badge for innovation that improves energy efficiency as compared to legacy product platforms while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Examples this quarter include the North American announcement of the new CenTraVac Centrifugal chiller portfolio using next-generation low global warming-potential refrigerant. The product is for large buildings and industrial applications in the U.S. and Canada. We also announced a service program to retrofit the existing installed base for the next-generation low global warming-potential refrigerant, which protects and provides a viable option for our customers' past investment while achieving their own sustainability goals. In Europe, we announced another four new products. The Sintesis eXcellent, a new air-cooled chiller with nearly zero global warming potential using next-generation refrigerant. Airfinity, a complete new range of HVAC rooftop units designed to comply with the upcoming European Union Ecodesign regulations. They are light, compact and modular plug-and-play HVAC units that are compatible with wireless technology and designed to save time and money when retrofitting and improve the efficiency of existing buildings across Europe. XStream, a new range of water-cooled screw chillers now available in Europe and the Middle East. The efficiency and capacity ratings are unmatched by any other screw chiller in the market today. We hope this will become a preferred option for critical applications like data centers, hospitals, process cooling, and district cooling and heating. And finally, Trane's Balance, our second generation of innovative multi-pipe systems for high-efficiency simultaneous heating and cooling. The systems repurpose energy that is rejected and use renewable energy for heating. Within our Thermo King North America, Europe, and Middle East business, we are demonstrating that we have a more resilient business than the past, expanding margins 270 basis points in a low-growth environment. As we noted in our initial guidance, we believe that we could maintain or even grow margins with a 15% North American trailer pullback and flat overall volumes. Today, the Thermo King business serves the refrigerated truck, trailer, marine container, air container, bus and rail, telematics, and auxiliary power unit markets, and the completeness of the portfolio has added to margins and the overall resiliency of the portfolio. Also of interest, both our Residential HVAC and Thermo King North America, Europe, and Middle East business units have been fully deployed on the new ERP system for the past couple of quarters, and we believe we are now seeing the expected productivity throughout these business units. We continue to deploy new sites routinely in other business units each quarter. We continue to be pleased with the tremendous execution we are seeing in our HVAC and Transport Refrigeration business in Asia-Pacific and in Latin America. Both regions demonstrated substantial margin improvement and share growth. HVAC bookings in Latin America were up 36% on an organic basis for the quarter, a really outstanding performance by that team and that region. In Asia-Pacific, our Transport Refrigeration business continues to grow, with another 23% increase in bookings and 25% increase in revenue. Both are examples of finding pockets of growth within generally weak markets and then capitalizing on those opportunities. Turning to our Industrial Segment, I want to start by saying that I have tremendous confidence in our leaders running these business units and they're operating in a very challenging environment. Within Compression Technologies in North America, which is our largest market for equipment, the 250 horsepower contact cooled rotary market is down 20%, and all other size ranges are also down in the high single-digit range, with only small 5 horse to 15 horse compressors showing year-over-year growth. Against this backdrop, we are performing well and supplementing the business with service bookings of approximately 10% in the quarter. Remember, too, that the last time we emerged from a down industrial cycle we grew margins nearly seven full points in a 24-month period. Our fluid management business continues to perform well with modest growth, and we are seeing continued weakness in the tools business and no sign of recovery in our material handling business, which provides hoist and winches for the oil and gas industry. Club Car continues to broaden its strategy and reach outside of golf with small electric vehicles in the commercial and consumer segments. Turning to growth excellence, which encompasses the full value stream from strategic analytics, product management, new product and technology introduction, sales management, and service and support, this has been another cornerstone of our long-term strategy. We believe the product, channel and service footprint investments we've made over the past five years to seven years are paying off. It's clearly evident in the HVAC and Transport Refrigeration business units and we believe it will also be the case for our Compression Technology business unit that has been doing a similar investment program over the past couple of years, which will continue the next several years. Even as industrial markets are challenging today, we continue the investment in the Compression Technologies business because we expect we'll be rewarded as the market recovers. As one example, one of the product growth teams operates in the Compression Technology business and covers a specific product portfolio which equates to about 10% of the overall revenue of that business. Within the product growth team we're seeing year-to-date bookings increases of 30% and revenues increasing by 17%. Its strength in our Climate segment, capacity utilization, and our shared climate and industrial plants and operations and leveraging our technology teams that's allowing us the opportunity to stay the course on critical growth programs in our Industrial segment. We have continued to invest in strategic growth programs across the company through both good and difficult times and the benefits of doing so are clear. Our designated strategic growth programs, many of which are managed through our product growth team process, are growing at a rate three times faster than the underlying growth rate of the company. As another example, within the Commercial HVAC business in North America, Europe and the Middle East our strategic growth programs are growing at a 14% rate this year and for the company 80% plus of our growth is coming from investment and focus on these critical strategic growth programs, so as is our model will leverage the success and build and accelerate on the full deployment of this element of our operating system in the years ahead. Going forward, we see multiple investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth through innovation and differentiation of the product, software and services we provide. I don't think anyone on this call needs another presentation on the Internet of Things and the possibilities for how that will transform competition and opportunity. This macro trend is squarely centered on nearly every growth and productivity strategy in our company, whether it's connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and service, diagnostic and self-healing systems, telematics, consumer marketing and fulfillment and too many other digital concepts to list. We're funding a number of these ideas centrally within the corporate expense line and are likely to accelerate this incubation investment later this year. Incremental 2016 investment for this activity is already embedded in our guidance. Finally, building on the culture element of our model, high-quality teams and deep employee engagement are critical to any sustained transformation, and I'm pleased that we continue to excel in these areas. One source of great pride within Ingersoll-Rand is our ability to walk the talk on sustainability. To make the point, we continue to see benchmark levels for employee engagement; world-class safety performance for any segment of industry; energy reduction of 5% on an absolute, not volume-adjusted, basis; a 14% reduction in water consumption, also on an absolute basis; and similar reductions of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. So Sue will take you through the quarter in detail. I just felt it was important to align how today's results reinforce the strategy of the company, how we intend to keep delivering great results, and why you should believe we're building a more valuable, sustainable, and less cyclical company for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Sue. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide four. This is a summary slide that I'd like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us, and it shows through the financial results that we posted. In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year organic revenues higher by 3%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points with a leverage of over 45%, and adjusted earnings per share up 15% against the backdrop of a very slow growth environment and particularly challenged industrial markets. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.32 by $0.08 at the midpoint and $0.06 at the high end. Our $0.08 beat versus our midpoint was driven by exceptionally strong performance in our Climate segment, partially offset by challenged markets in our Industrial segment and about a $0.06 beat from a lower tax rate in the quarter. And as I'll discuss in detail later, we believe we'll maintain a 200 basis point lower average tax rate than our previous guidance of 24% to 25% for 2016. We also posted strong year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million, up $293 million from the prior year. We're seeing the benefits of our focus on working capital management and our business operating system, and with that we're raising our free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, excluding the proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. Let's turn to segment results. The Climate segment continues to exceed expectations, driven largely by outstanding execution in both Commercial and Residential HVAC with mid-single-digit growth and high-single-digit growth, respectively. Margins also showed healthy expansion, driven by strong volume, productivity improvements, and material deflation of nonferrous commodities. We also continue to invest in the business in order to drive sustainable growth. The Industrial segment's end markets are more challenged than previously forecast, and we experienced negative growth in all the major end markets except Small Electric Vehicles, which is our Club Car business, and fluid management, where we continue to see growth. Across Industrial, we continue to take measures to drive productivity, shift our mix further towards more profitable aftermarket services and parts markets, and to make prudent cost reductions in the business. We continue to be committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy focused on delivering high returns to shareholders over the long term. Our strong free cash flow generation and cash balances provide us important options as the markets evolve. And lastly, we've bumped up the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.05, and our current adjusted continuing operations earnings per share for 2016 is $4 to $4.10. This update reflects expected continued strong growth in our Climate segment and tailwinds resulting from a lower go-forward structural tax rate of 22% to 23%, partially offset by continued weakness in our Industrial end markets, where we're not seeing the signs of recovery we had originally anticipated in our prior guidance. Now, if you'd go to slide five, let's begin discussing additional details regarding the second quarter. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment, and we delivered against that objective. Enterprise revenues were up 3% organically, with Climate up 5% and Industrial down 3%. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by Commercial and Residential HVAC in North America. Thermo King North America and EMEA truck and trailer revenues continued to be strong in the quarter. Industrial markets declined in the quarter, consistent with the overall market. Club Car performed as expected, with mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. Our adjusted operating margins grew 80 basis points year-over-year, with operating leverage exceeding 45%. Our strength in margin expansion was driven through price realization, productivity gains, and direct material deflation. We've inserted a margin table on the slide, and that'll illustrate some of the items I just talked about. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016, for a gain of approximately $398 million. Let's go to slide six. Orders for the second quarter of 2016 were up 3% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global Commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, similar to the first quarter, led by low-teens growth in North America applied and unitary and strong growth of 36% in Latin America, which was against a relatively easy compare in 2015. Asia bookings continued to be lumpy from quarter to quarter and were down in Q2 overall, while China was up low single digits. We continued to see excellent growth in service, controls and contracting, with low-teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings were up low teens, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of bookings growth above 10%. Organic Transport orders were down mid-single digits with order growth in overseas markets offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with the expectations we set out earlier in the year, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer in the second half of the year, and this is built into our guidance. Transport orders in Asia were up 23% in the second quarter. Overall, we anticipated some recovery in the Industrial markets as we moved through Q2 and the balance of the year. But we're seeing continued challenges and market declines. Net orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw a high single-digit order decline in Compression Technologies and Services. Services continued to be a bright spot and were up high single digits as we continued to focus on the business with higher-margin product streams. We saw a low-teens decline in other Industrial products and a high single-digit increase in Club Car. Now if you'll go to slide seven, please. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 5% in the second quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and low single-digit growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America. We saw a decline in the Middle East, consistent with the contraction in the number of building projects planned, primarily in Saudi Arabia, and we would expect this to continue for some time as low oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Our Industrial segment performance in the second quarter, which was down 3%, is representative of the ongoing volatility and declining markets that continue across the globe in Industrial markets. Our regional Industrial markets declined except for Europe and Asia, which were up. Let's go to slide eight, please. Climate revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter were strong, up 5% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by 20% growth in North America contracting and upper single-digit growth in unitary equipment shipments in North America. Europe had equipment growth in the mid-teens and high single-digit growth in services, contracting, and parts. The Middle East revenues declined, largely due to a sharp pullback in Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier. Residential revenues were at record levels and up high single digits in the second quarter. Transport organic revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. Truck and trailer organic revenues were up high single digits overall, with improved revenues in North America, Europe, and Asia. We also had a high single-digit improvement in aftermarket volumes. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the second quarter, reflecting a soft first half at various box builders for 2016. We also had lower sales of auxiliary power units, reflecting the decline in the Class 8 sleeper market. Please go to slide nine. Our Climate operating margins grew 250 basis points year-over-year. Our strength was broad based, based on volume, price, direct material deflation, and productivity gains, and we continue to invest in the business for sustainable growth. Please go to slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $753 million, down 3% on an organic basis. Compression Technologies and services' organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year and Industrial Products were down mid-teens, with growth in fluid management and declines in material handling equipment and tools. Small Electric Vehicles, also known as Club Car, organic revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year from gains in equipment and aftermarket. Regionally, the decline in organic Industrial revenues was led by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas and the Middle East. Asia and Europe were up modestly, partially offsetting the declines. Please go to slide 11. Industrial's operating margin of 9.1% was down 250 basis points compared with last year. Lower volumes were the largest driver, partially offset by pricing, material deflation, and productivity. Despite the downturn, we continued to invest in the business for the long term. Additionally, capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development were reclassified to the income statement in Q2, which were a drag on margin of approximately $8 million, or 1.1 percentage points, for the Industrial segment. Excluding this adjustment, Industrial adjusted margins were 10.9% in Q2. Moving forward, we expect Industrial segment performance to trend with the market. We are planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through aftermarket growth, productivity gains, and cost controls. Please go to slide 12. Our June year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million was favorable to prior year by $293 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. Because of our strong start to the year we have raised our free cash flow forecast range to $1 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous range of $950 million to $1 billion. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 0.6 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter and we are well-positioned to serve our customers. Please go to slide 13. Our cash performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the year enable us to, one, continue to invest in the strategic growth programs that Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovation and differentiated product in such areas as connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few. Two, we will also maintain a strong balance sheet with a BBB credit metrics. And three, we will also maintain \u2013 we will also retain optionality relative to paying a competitive dividend, acquisitions to build the business and share repurchases. Please go to slide 14. As always, our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We have broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. North America Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC as well as European Transport and Commercial HVAC markets are generally positive while global Industrial markets are declining. We are forecasting Transport markets in North America to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volume has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid-single-digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-North America business for us; and a flat to small decline in Transport globally. We expect Compression-related products and other Industrial equipment to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits. Please go to slide 15. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up 2% to 3% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5% organically. For Industrial, we expect organic revenues to be down 4% to 5%. For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect adjusted operating margins in Climate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We expect adjusted Industrial margins to be between 10% and 11%, and for the enterprise we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12%. Please go to slide 16. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.47 to $5.57 and the adjusted range is $4 to $4.10, versus our prior guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain. Our full-year guidance reflects a tax rate forecast of 22% to 23% and an average diluted share count of approximately 261 million shares. The tax rate reflects a 200 basis point improvement versus prior guidance of 24% to 25%. For the third quarter of 2016, revenues are forecasted to be up by approximately 3% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q3 and Industrial to decline low single digits. Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.25 and $1.30, excluding restructuring charges of about a penny. For the full year of 2016, we also raised our free cash flow expectations and now expect free cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, excluding restructuring charges and proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. And with that, I am going to turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Okay, great. Thank you, Sue, and let's go to slide 17. So to conclude, we had an excellent quarter grounded in solid execution. I am proud of the many people within Ingersoll-Rand that continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. I am pleased with the progress and the momentum and the implementation of our operating system and the growing depth and bench strength throughout the company that makes the operating system come to life through continuous improvement. We're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand than ever before and it's exciting to me and leaders throughout the company to be part of that transformation and to help create a bright future with more individual development possibilities for all our people throughout the world. The results we reported this morning are a direct result of the strategic work, the persistence, the tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we're building. It is a strategic advantage and it is the toughest thing in any business for a competitor to copy. There are a few takeaways I want to point out to you as we head to the back half of the year and into 2017. First, the Industrial businesses are running effectively in a very tough market environment. The management team is aggressively taking and will continue to take the right actions to reduce the overall cost structure of the business and is committed to protecting the key product and service investments that will build long-term growth and margin expansion when the markets improve. Second, the Transport market is performing as we expected. As we said at the beginning of the year, we expected the first-half results to be up and the back half of the year would be down. The management team has done an effective job anticipating and seeing around the corners and is proactively taking the actions to ensure strong margin performance continues. Third, commodity deflation has been a tailwind during the first half of the year and it's going to moderate to neutral in the back half of the year. We have a long track record of managing the price-to-material input equation very effectively and we're going to continue to do so going forward. And finally, let me say we are proactively reviewing both prior restructuring considerations as well as new actions as our business, markets and even the input variables into our own models continue to evolve. Although we don't have any immediate additional restructuring actions to take or announce today, we won't hesitate to take additional prudent restructuring actions going forward. So with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning. Before I ask my question, I just wanted to clarify. Sue, did you mention the tax rate of 22%, 23% is now a structural tax rate going forward? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes, it's 22% to 23% and that's the ongoing rate. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. That's very clear. Mike, obviously very strong booking orders, bookings for North American Commercial HVAC in North America low teens. You mentioned a 25% number on the last call. I am not sure whether you're comparing apples to apples here, but maybe just clarify that 25% is the low teens that you actually booked and maybe if you could just dig into the health of the light commercial versus applied unitary markets. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes, Nigel, thanks for the question. Actually, I would expect two quarters of similar growth, two quarters of teens versus one 20-plus% quarter, so I think that's intact. The pipeline, frankly, has never been healthier than it is right now, and it is healthy through all the institutional large project work. Commercial is maintaining some resiliency that we are seeing here, and unitary, at the light levels, still strong for us. So Residential all the way up through light commercial still remains very strong for us across the board. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great, so no signs of weakness there. And then just on the Climate margin outlook, you have done 13.8% in the first half of the year. The low end or the mid to lower end of your margin guidance at Climate would suggest basically flat margins in the second half of the year, which seems pretty bearish. Maybe just contextualize why you see an outlook for maybe 14% at the low end. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So, Nigel, let me start out and Mike can add his comments as we go forward. So as I think about a Climate in the back half of the year, you're going to have a couple of different dynamics, the first of which, as we talked about, was that direct material was going to moderate in terms of its deflationary environment. So let me talk about that for just a second. What we expect to see in the back half of the year is we expect to see that steel, particularly in the fourth quarter, is going to turn more inflationary then deflationary. So that's part of what's happening with the flatter margins. We're also going to continue to invest in the overall business in the back half of the year. Again, we have got some significant product launches and we see this as an area that really sets us up for success. So it is really price, a little bit of mix that comes from us lapping the 14 SEER in Residential, and then investment in the business. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And, Nigel, I'd just say to me the biggest number on the page is we're putting half a point \u2013 50 basis points of margin back into investment, and it's a formula that's worked for us, it sets us up well for 2017, and we like what we're getting out of those investments. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Just on the Industrial margin guide for the second half, so it looks like you're looking at a margin of maybe 11%, 11.5% in the second half. The clean margin was 10.9% in Q2. So I thought maybe there'd be a bit more coming through to support margins from productivity or cost reduction. So I just wondered why maybe there wasn't a bit more urgency around getting the cost out. It looks as if the sort of margin decline is going to be similar second half as first half. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I'm sorry \u2013 Julian, starting I would say that again for me the most important thing that's happening there is they're really, say, 40% through an investment cycle there that there's just no reason to stop and go on that. And so that continues for the balance of the year for us, and that's something that I think is vitally important. There's a tremendous effort underway at reducing costs in that business, much of what's not just visible through what you'd say would be qualified restructuring. Much of that is just reduction in place and just other containment actions being taken in the business. So that really, when I say the business is being run effectively, I have no doubt that all the rocks are being turned over, with the exception of protecting this critical investment pool that is important to us going forward. And I use that one example for you because it happens to be the example of the product growth team is the one product area that we have launched in that portfolio and we're getting tremendous results with that. So, again, this gives us some confidence that although it's not a great story for the third and the fourth quarter, we're not running the company for the third and the fourth quarter. We're running the company for the long run, and we hope investors see that. And that's part of the reason I think taking good success around the Climate business, keeping utilization up through the combined factory structures that we've got, leveraging the network's excellence across the Compression-related businesses that we have, give us the opportunity to stay the course on these investments, and that's really important. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very clear. And then my follow-up would just be you touched on the input cost impact in Q4. I think the last numbers I have on the sort of COGS (37:02) are from 2010 or 2011, the last time materials were an interesting issue. Is there any update you could give on the breakdown of COGS in terms of sort of raw materials versus processed materials and components and so forth? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Sure. So if you think about \u2013 and what I'll do is I'll give it to you in terms of dollars. So if you think about direct material spend for the company, Julian, it's about, say, $6 billion a year in direct material spend. If you then break that down into the commodities that we're talking about, it's roughly about 10% to 12% of that. And as you think about then breaking that down even further, steel is going to be the largest component, with copper and aluminum following that. And so the price pressure that we're thinking about in the back half is on steel, because copper and aluminum are pretty much staying the course with what we've seen. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey, Mike, just thinking kind of bigger picture here strategically, you guys are actually doing a really solid job operationally, and I can't help but look at Lennox at 22 times earnings and Atlas Copco at 22 times earnings and just wonder if you're actually reevaluating the portfolio. I know you went through the exercise with Allegion and the businesses that you retain are air-oriented businesses, but do you have any thought or response to that question or that idea? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Jeff, it's a great question, and thanks for the opportunity to step back and look at it, because I look back over the seven years that I've been in this role and I remember when Industrial was the sweetheart of the portfolio, right, from 2009 to 2011, even through 2013, and we were expanding margins so fast that it afforded us the opportunity to do all the great investment we made in the Trane res and commercial businesses, which is really why you're seeing the numbers that you're seeing today in that business. And so now it's flipped. You remember that was all happening with no real commercial \u2013 certainly no institutional support coming from construction markets. And now that's flipped and it's allowed us the opportunity to keep factories fairly loaded. It's given us the opportunity to keep technical professionals highly engaged in development of product, and all that really just sets up where at some point when the commercial market in HVAC slows down, when institutional eventually fades, our hope is that we've got a strong, refreshed, energy-efficient, reliable portfolio sitting particularly in Compression Technologies. And we're going to leverage that, just like we did from 2009 to 2011 when it grew 7 full points. We are very leveraged here toward some of those fixed costs. Where we play in the market is in the big machine. It's not the Cameron \u2013 and when I talk Cameron I'm talking about Cameron plus all the 250 to 400 horse centrifugal air compressors, of which we're the leader now in that area. And we don't really participate much in the vacuum and blower business, which had some growth in it. So we have a product portfolio and a position in the market in these larger machines. That's what's getting hurt right now, and we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here on that, for sure. That's why in addition to \u2013 I had mentioned the product development, but the machining investments, I mentioned last call and this call, those are going to continue. And we will put $50 million into machining in this downturn, so that when we emerge out of this thing we're going to be more productive. The hope is that it's not just 7 points of margin. It's more than 7 points of margin coming back. So Jeff, I think I really have got my head around the value of what we have created around integrating the portfolio, and over the long run not really so interested in a flash in the pan around some multiple for short cycle. I'm really interested in building the value of the company over the long run. And again, step back to 2009, Jeff. If you invested back in 2009, you are a very happy investor and I thank you for all the Christmas cards we get to that effect. But it's because we've had the portfolio that we've had. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes, I had a heroic buyback in 2009. Thanks for that perspective. Also, then, just on the balance sheet, Mike... Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, Jeff, just before you do that, incremental margins every single year have been in the top quartile. Organic growth rates almost every single year have been in the top quartile. We've done that with elements of the portfolio firing and not firing at various points in time, and I just have to believe that there is value in that and there is industrial logic around what we are doing around the sustainability and energy efficiency fronts of the business. So go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I agree. Your performance has been great. You are not getting fully paid for it. The balance sheet, what is the plan for the year-end? Sue gave us the kind of a generalized color, but with the Hussmann proceeds and the strong cash flow, would you be opportunistically looking to step in share repurchase this year? I can't imagine the M&A pipeline is that active, but perhaps it is. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So Jeff, let me take a shot at that, and then I'm going to let Mike jump in. But I am going to kind of use some of the same passion that Mike had in his comments on the multiples and what we have built at Ingersoll-Rand. From a perspective of our cash generation and then our ensuing capital allocation, we're really trying to create longer-term shareholder value with the cash that we are generating. And so what we have seen that has been really successful for us is investing in our products and investing in areas like energy efficiency and sustainability. Those are proven for us in terms of building our growth excellence. If we look at operational excellence, all of the work that we've done and invested in the company, whether it is in our factories or in our overall processes with the business operating system, all of that has shown to be something that has worked very well for us. So our preference, as we think about capital allocation and your question, is to really invest and grow the company. So to be more specific than in terms of what that means, it means I want to continue to invest. It means I want to continue to do all of those things. It means we want to look at the M&A pipeline. But what we have is an opportunity where we can be patient, we can wait for the right opportunity and not just take the cash that we are generating and run out and buy something. So we're really, really thinking about investment. We are thinking about M&A. Dividends are extremely important to us. We understand that and we're going to continue to have dividends that are in line with our peer payout ratios, and we will also be opportunistic about share repurchase. I don't want to take that completely off the table, but if I set our preference up, it is going to be to build longer-term value through investments in the business and acquisitions. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes, I agree, Jeff, with Sue's comments completely, obviously. But I would tell you that the competitive dividend's a given and the fact that we are controlling dilution in the share count is a given. We don't want to dilute shareholders through that, so that's a given. The optionality beyond that, we want to be really smart allocators of capital and we want to have our eyes wide open on how we do that. When you get big dislocations in the share price, we want to be opportunistic and we were in the first quarter between $48 and $51 a share. Clearly, that was a good idea. And we have been opportunistic when we saw value in long-term creation through acquisitions. And so we will continue to do that. Now all that being said, I think we have less than $1 billion in cash, so that's not a whole lot of cash we are talking about for a company our size to be walking around with. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And welcome, Zac. Zac Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So my first question, maybe following up on Jeff's point there on maybe just the investment that you're making in Industrial, Mike. I am just wondering how much of it is playing catch-up versus really investing for future growth? And then, how do you balance that with the idea that we're kind of seven years to eight years into this economic recovery and could be in this kind of lower-growth environment for some time? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Joe, actually the efficiencies of the product launch, the 40% of the portfolio I told you about, are in the range of 9% to 13% more efficient than anything out in the marketplace. That's how we're going to market, around value, around total cost of ownership, and that's why that business is up in the high teens and bookings are closer to 30%. We know there is no purpose in us playing catch-up to a me-too. So every single thing we have done has been to leapfrog the efficiency and reliability of what's out there. And if you just look to the Trane portfolio, you would see that. In every launch we've made, not only is it more efficient than anything in the marketplace, but it is using refrigerants that go way past the HFC phase-out. So we're not meeting anybody kind of where they are; we are leapfrogging. And this whole strategic analytics piece of our business operating system of really figuring out kind of where to go attack, specifically. And then having those strategic growth programs outlined with the resources, the talent, the investments outlined and making sure that no matter what we do, we are committing to that, is why you get 80% plus of the growth happening through the areas we are focusing on. And that doesn't come from me-too catch-up. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That makes sense. How do the investments then, maybe thinking about it through the lens of Industrial, perhaps you can provide just some color there? Unknown Speaker : Well, I'm not sure, what the investments are specifically in Industrial, Joe? Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, just I guess just specifically around the investments that you're making in Industrial. You've been in like this really just this weaker-growth environment, probably expected to persist for quite some time. I'm just trying to get a sense for whether there is some catch-up to do on the Industrial side, whether your portfolio is better positioned than your peers. Just any color \u2013 any colors on the competitive dynamics in the investments that you're making. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I mean, the investments we're making are obviously in the areas that we're not leading, so any place we're not leading is a right spot for it. So if we're leading in 250 horse to 400 horse in the world, we'll keep that competitive and we'll make sure that we're not losing that position, but we're tacking in the other areas that we think are going to grow. That's sort of the general view. And you can understand why I'm not going to be more specific than that, because we would rather book it and have margin improvement versus just talking about it and really signaling where we're going competitively around this stuff. That's not been our style at all. But I'll tell you that it starts with the strategic analytics being right and the investments being very specific, and the product growth teams \u2013 so engineering, operations, and product management agreeing and working toward the one or two most critically important things to grow share and margin in a very specific product line or service line has been the formula for us that has been successful. We're going to continue to do that. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And so the other thing that I would add, Mike, just as a practical matter, Joe, for what you're talking about is the investments that are ongoing in Industrial are going to be in the same general areas, as you would expect. They're going to be in new products. They're going to be in operational excellence, so improving our operating results, and they also include some channel investments, particularly in the Compression Technologies business. So all the areas you might expect. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. That makes sense. And just one real quick one for you, Sue, on just the price cost breakdown this quarter. How much did material deflation versus price contribute? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So it was \u2013 so let me take you back to Q1 where it was about 50-50, price and direct material deflation. In the second quarter, it was a little more direct material deflation, but really kind of a 60-40 kind of look with deflation and price, and we were price positive in both segments. And so if you remember when we gave guidance and talked about the second quarter, we had originally called that at 110 basis points and it came in at 120 basis points. So again, it performed exactly as we expected it to in the quarter, and I'll repeat the Q1 comment of we didn't have breakage, so it was a good result. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Joe, I actually want to take you back to the Industrial question just for a second. I just had one more comment here. I made a comment about the strength of the management team, which ultimately I think is what really investors need to believe in and buy. And I look at our Industrial Segment management team, and I can tell you that the top five to 10 executives running that part of the business co-architected the entire business operating system with me since it began. I couldn't have higher confidence in our ability to win as the markets recover. So I want to make sure that that point is really clear. It is a very strong management team paying attention to the details in that business. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, all. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. It looks like you are certainly taking profitable share gain on the Climate side, but what's going on in VRF there? And then on the Industrial side, Atlas Copco Compressor Technique orders were up 1% in the quarter. I know they have got a different mix. I know they have got vacuum and also a slightly smaller North American presence. Maybe would that explain at all or is there something else going on as well that we should be aware of? Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, look, in no particular order, Steve, if you look at Atlas Copco's business, they are going to be strong in oil-free rotary and certainly in a smaller range than our large centrifugal machines. We have got great oil-free product and are growing that business, too, but obviously that's the bulk of what you see with Atlas Copco's business. Vacuum and blowers you called out, and that's actually still been a market growing. When you think about oil free or vacuums and blowers, you have to think about the industries that they go into, and those industries happen to be growing as well, as opposed to some of the heavier industries that would use some of the larger centrifugal machines, for the most part. So we do a very thorough compare with all public information that we can pick up from all of our various competitors, not just a single competitor, have a good understanding of sort of how that mix looks and then we're realists about where the opportunity is for us to self-help where we can. Right now, the self-help comes into growing the service businesses and they're doing a great job with that. It also comes into refreshing and developing the portfolio in sort of the smaller-range machines. And that's where we're going to play going forward. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, and on the VRF side? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : VRF, we're \u2013 very well. It is growing faster than the underlying unitary business. We continue to have a very high share; no slowdown there from us at all. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, and then just following up on your earlier comments around the balance sheet and whatnot, but I guess, Mike, in the past you have talked about there being kind of opportunity for consolidation within the overall HVAC market. Do you still \u2013 how are you thinking about that, given the dynamics of the industry going forward? Do you think there is still room in that? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I do. I think they are big moves and I think that you look at what we did with acquiring Cameron's compressor business, and we had synergies in the first year of 15% and we will drive it higher this year. So, look, I think great synergies exist and I think that these opportunities are happening, but I think they are bigger, more complex deals. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, all right, great. Thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys, good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So what exactly is going on here in Industrial? This just seems like relative to where you were it was viewed as kind of a high-quality business with pretty solid margins, and it just seems like every single quarter we are just getting deeper and deeper into a hole here. I guess you mentioned the end markets. How much \u2013 just remind us, including Cameron, how much is oil and gas? And then, how much would be in and around oil and gas? And maybe we're just kind of mislabeling some of the end markets, perhaps, and you guys, like everybody else, do have more exposure there than we would have thought initially. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Steve, so I'll save the oil and gas math for somebody at the end here, but if you look at the biggest market we're in on big machines, and I use 250 to 400 horsepower as being a big machine, down 20%. Actually as you go up between 250 and 400 and past 400, those growth rates start to look like minus 50%, okay, from where they were. These are the most capital-intensive sort of factories we have, and that certainly when we have those kinds of volume drops really adversely affects our mix. So you look at volume alone contributing 3 points of negativity on the bridge, you can see what volume does. And as a proof point, again, go back and look at 2009 through 2011, look what happened when volume came in after we had been effectively restructuring the footprint there, and that's where that 7 points came from. So we're heavily leveraged toward that any way you slice it, and that's the main reason for it. Now on the oil and gas side? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, so oil and gas is really going to be sort of a low single-digit percentage, Steve. I mean that's part of the issue because you don't have large projects, but it's really the derivative, so all the other projects just aren't happening, and so it sort of gets labeled with oil and gas. So let me step back and also add to what Mike was talking about. When I started talking about Industrial early in 2016 and I was sort of breaking it down into pieces for you, what I said was that Club Car was about 20% of the business and it was going to be up sort of low to mid-single digits, that the aftermarket was about 30% of the Industrial segment and that it was going to be up low single digits. Then I talked about the big machines being down in excess of 20% and some of the small rotary and small air being up slightly for the year, and then some of the other businesses, like the material handling business and the tools businesses, being down sort of mid-single digits for the year. If I take that and transform that now into what we're seeing in 2016 after two quarters, Club Car, the same spot. They're growing in the mid-single-digits range and that's on track. The aftermarket piece of Industrial is continuing to grow. So you have got sort of solid footing with about 50% of the business. However, when you get over into the other side where I talked about large machines being down 20%, as Mike said, they're now down 50%, so they are down way larger than what we thought. And even some of the smaller equipment is really much more pressured than I thought it was going to be, and instead of being up sort of low single digits it's going to be down. So you really just have a lot of dynamics that are going on there with the Industrial business, and to bring it back and wrap it around your question about oil and gas and projects, again, it's really the derivative effect for us in most of our Industrial businesses, where the large projects just aren't happening and the ones that are happening are much more competitive. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes, it's a bit of a Yogi Berra euphemism, but the business will turn when our customers start spending money on these larger plants, and so that needs to happen. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, I just don't know of anything like in my sector. I'm not blaming you guys at all. It is what it is. But just outside of \u2013 if you said, hey, it's down 50%, we can look at oil and gas CapEx and that's like, oh, that's obvious. I mean in fact in the market right now everybody's getting credit for a 50% increase in oil and gas-related spending next year, in some instances. So I don't know what in the economy, other than oil and gas, is seeing 50% year-on-year declines. Even things like big gas turbines out there, big-ticket items are certainly not seeing 50% \u2013 maybe 20% declines, not 50% declines. So I just \u2013 that's kind of the source of my question, you know what I mean? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : There's a spot between sort of small plants and energy production that is a large plant. Steel would be a great example of that, marine, these are heavy industries that use large machines for air and that's really kind of where we're suffering on that. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That makes a ton of sense, then. If it's that derivative type of stuff, that makes a ton of sense. One last question, Middle East you said was down. How much was the Middle East down in Commercial HVAC in the quarter? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : EMEA was down about 14%. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And, Steve, I'm going to add one point. Material handling, if you go back and bridge over a multiyear period, it was 2, 2.5 points of op margin that went away as that business went down 90% or so for us, okay. So you don't want to look at Industrial and kind of hang it all back on a comparison to Atlas Copco on compressors. You want to make sure you understand there's a couple of points of margin there, about a point in tools. Currency is a hit, and then you got the volume impact that we talked about on the bridge. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good afternoon. I guess I won't belabor the Industrial business. On Transportation, could you just talk as to what you saw in the quarter that your view has changed? Because before you were sort of saying how the North American truck cycle was decoupled from the reefer market, and it seems like you've changed your view. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Andrew, there's subtleties moving inside that, but the view has always been you're going to see a pullback in North American trailer, as much as 15% in flat TK, and the mix is changing slightly within that, but that's really what's happening for the full year. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And can we talk about cadence of Transportation weakening into the second half, third quarter versus fourth quarter decline, and any preliminary thoughts on 2017? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Q3 will look weak, because the compare was so strong last year that it sits the highest of high compares for us there, and then moderates a little bit in terms of the comparisons for the fourth quarter. But again, you take the first half of the year and balance it out to flat with no change and marine container being weak and really all the change coming with North American truck and trailer and a little bit coming, obviously, from APUs with just Class 8 sleeper production being down. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. And as we have reached the time allotted for our call, our final question will come from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So, Mike, just you changed your guidance in Climate from 4% to 6% to 4% to 5%, but just following up on Andrew's question, is the difference really APUs or is it marine or is it Middle East, or is it a combination of the three? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Middle East is much weaker than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, and as you can imagine, it is a large HVAC business, and so the drag on the Middle East is fairly material. We're seeing some growth in China. That growth was really around shipping product that was booked, but we really haven't seen the pickup in China, per se. If you look at China non-residential construction, it's still negative, but for the past six months or seven months it has been trending up. I think it has gone from negative 17% up to negative 2%, but it hasn't crossed over. We really would have thought at this point we would have seen more a pickup. The nice thing in China, buildings are built in about half the speed that we see in other parts of the world and our cycle times for delivery can be half of what they are in other parts of the world as well. So if we did see a China recovery on the HVAC side, you need to see that, say, within a six-month period, not a 12-month period, but as you get into July and you're not really seeing the bookings here, it's just a way of really de-risking the forecast. And really, that de-risking is the theme coming into the Industrial portfolio, too. At this point, if we haven't seen bookings on large machines or bookings on midsized, even rotary, machines to this point in time, the reality is you just call it lower and it's what we've done. And so we hope we've got to the bottom of this thing. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Mike, that's helpful. And if you look at European transport and refrigeration in general, and FRIGOBLOCK in particular, it seems like it has hung in there quite well. I'm sure \u2013 have you seen any changes post the Brexit announcement? What's the outlook for that particular business? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : We haven't had a lot of change relative to Brexit. I think, like a lot of companies, there is a lot of discussion going on, but not a lot of change, and our business really \u2013 U.K. business is not that big in general. It's more the knockdown effect about what might happen in the region with GDP being shaved in general. But the business has continued to develop well. It's holding in there and we don't see things turning there as a result of Brexit or other market factors here at least over the next couple of quarters. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A portion of the call. I would like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for any closing remarks. Zac Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. We truly appreciate your participation, and I look forward to meeting all of you in the future and reconnecting with many of you that I have worked with before. Thank you very much and we will be in touch soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm going to begin by discussing our strategy and how as a foundation our business operating system drives top-tier financial performance for shareholders. Sue will provide more details about the quarter financials and guidance, then I'll close with a few comments before we answer your questions. As a matter of strategy more than 90% of our product portfolio directly addresses demands for greater productivity and energy efficiency with lower greenhouse gas emissions in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. The strength and resiliency of our portfolio comes from our leadership in growing markets that are durable, because these markets are essential to addressing the global, strategic imperative to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve resources. Our business operating system is a systematic way our people work within the company to deliver against our strategy globally. It is a holistic approach that establishes strong baseline execution expectations, then builds on those expectations through continuous development of people and improvement of processes and standards. Respecting and engaging our people in the development and maturation of a business operating system, makes it sustainable and is a core element of what it takes to win over the long-term. Rigorous execution of the business operating system has enabled us to deliver consistent top tier financial performance across key metrics, including organic growth, incremental margins, EPS growth and cash flow conversion over many years. The third quarter demonstrated our consistent progress against these key metrics. We delivered strong organic growth of 3% across a diversified portfolio. We had record operating margins of 14.1% and drove leverage through the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 17% Year-to-date, free cash flow is more than 100% of adjusted net income, demonstrating our ability to convert earnings into real cash, a fundamental driver of valuation. Record margins in the quarter were primarily driven by continued strength in our Climate business, where adjusted operating margins expanded 90 basis points to 16.7% with particular strength in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses. We are also pleased to report that our Industrial business turned in a positive direction in quarter three, moving adjusted operating margins higher by 180 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Adjusting for the capitalized cost that we discussed last quarter of 1.1 percentage points, the business improved 70 basis points sequentially from 10.9% to 11.6%. The actions we've been taking to improve the business are taking hold and we believe we saw margins bottom in the second quarter. Improved profitability was driven by operational excellence and our continued focus on delivering innovation centered on energy efficiency, sustainability, system reliability, as well as disruptive game changing technological advancements in areas like controls and digital connectivity. In quarter three, our overall growth was led by our commercial and residential HVAC businesses in North America where we continue to see strong double-digit growth and market share gains. Our performance in 2016 is a direct result of a continuous long-term investment program prioritized around a clear set of opportunities and managed from inception to launch by focused and committed product growth teams. The net result is that our product growth teams' average to growth rate about four times higher than our overall average growth rate in quarter three. Continuously delivering innovation through our product growth teams is one way we produce strong financial results and stay ahead competitively. Another key driver is our commitment to being the leader in energy efficient and sustainable products. About 10 days ago, the 28th meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol was held. At that meeting about 200 countries agreed to an amendment that phases out hydrofluorocarbons beginning in 2019 and aims for an 80% reduction in their use by 2045. For several years now, we have been planning for the phase-out of hydrofluorocarbons and over that time we have been a leader in developing several commercialized next-generation lower global warming potential products that meet and exceed the transition requirements to help customers achieve their sustainability goals. Two years ago, we made a public climate commitment to a 50% reduction of refrigerant greenhouse gases in the footprint of our products by 2020 and a transition out of current refrigerants before 2030. We did this to help customers plan for the transition period based upon their business needs and system requirements. We are on track to complete our commitment goals and to-date have avoided approximately 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent globally. Another example is our EcoWise product portfolio, typically when an eco-friendly refrigerant is used in a system, it reduces efficiency and can sometimes compromise safety. For example the gas might be flammable or more toxic. With the introduction of our EcoWise product portfolio, we've not only developed a low global warming potential refrigerant product. We've also designed it so the product or system is more energy efficient. A prime example of this is our new line of Centrifugal chillers that have near zero global warming potential, do not concede safety and deliver 13.5% better efficiency than chillers using hydrofluorocarbons. So, now our customer is not choosing between being green or being efficient. Through EcoWise, they are able to do both. Growth with these products has been excellent. In Europe, for example the EcoWise portfolio growth has nearly doubled over the last year and we see a healthy pipeline, with high profile jobs coming in like the Chunnel Tunnel between France and the UK. After considering retrofit of their equipment, our expert technical team worked with Chunnel operators to install units from our EcoWise portfolio this year. With near zero global warming potential, the units will allow a savings of around 40% of the electrical energy used in the Chunnel's cooling system. And to give you some perspective, the energy savings for this project is about as much energy as the island of Aruba generates annually. It is a savings of 53% compared to the customers' former units that we replaced from one of our competitors. Vertical integration is another way that we drive growth and leverage technical know-how across our Climate and Industrial segments. Our vertical integration in compressor technology is one area of real competitive advantage because we engineer and manufacture our screw, centrifugal and the majority of our scroll compressors. We own the intellectual property and accelerated our time to market with these products. Through our energy efficiency strategy, the next-generation R-series air compressor that we introduced in quarter three incorporates the latest advancements in variable speed drive technology to increase airflow output up to 15%, reduce energy cost up to 35%, with an increase in system reliability. Customers are finding the product offering compelling, and we are outpacing the market growth rate as a result. These are just a few examples of how we're making investments in long-term innovation, energy efficiency and productivity to stay ahead of the competition and in front of an increasing regulatory environment. We are also tying in services, controls and wireless to our products, so they are leading-edge as technology continues to move quickly. We continue to see double-digit increases in our commercial HVAC controls business and high-single-digit growth in services. In Compression Technologies, we also realized mid single-digit growth in our aftermarket business. Our multiyear trend in aftermarket growth is consistent with our strategy to drive service penetration across our segments and create a more resilient portfolio. Turning to cash and capital allocation, Q3 was another quarter of steady and strong cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow was nearly $1 billion. Over the past five years, our cash flow ROIC has averaged 18% per annum. A top priority is to increase shareholder returns through high ROIC investments in our business that build a platform for consistent cash generation and investment in growth and innovation. Our long-standing commitment to organic long-term strategic investments is what has enabled us to perform well in both up and down climate or industrial cycles over the years. As an example, in 2016, we've invested heavily in channel investments that will improve growth by penetrating key markets over the next several years. In addition to fully investing in the business, we spent $250 million in 2016 on share buybacks. We've raised our dividend twice, 10% in February, an additional 25% in October, and we continue to have an increasing pipeline of interesting M&A opportunities. Our consistency in performance and a resultant strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to maintain significant optionality to move quickly across any or all capital allocation fronts as opportunities arise in this is uncertain and often volatile global economy. Before I hand things over to Sue, I want to hit on three key areas that we know are important for you to understand based on our conversations with many investors. Turning to slide four, I'm pleased with the progress of our Industrial segment in the third quarter, and we believe we remain on track to achieve our guidance for 2016 margins of 10% to 11%. The continuing actions we have taken and are taking to deliver improvement are taking hold. We continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives, restructuring and reducing cost, increase focus on parts and service, and here we are already seeing growth in the service business, but we believe we can step on the gas even further in this area. Segmentation and focus on growing markets like food and beverage, pharma and electronics, and continuing multi-year product, channel and machining investments to achieve strong leverage when the markets recover. It's important to note based on the actions we have taken and what we are seeing in the business that we believe Q2 marked a trough in operating margins for the business and we're expecting improved performance going forward in 2017, although the results may not be a straight line up quarter-to-quarter. If you turn to slide 5, the main takeaway here is that the Thermo King business is resilient. We saw this in the third quarter, when revenues were down but margins moved higher. For 2016, we continue to see the business being consistent with the expectations we set out in July. The team deserves a lot of execution credit there for improving margins on declining revenue, and for building a more resilient and valuable franchise over time. (13:22) is a great example, the transport business grew margins on a 12% lower revenue base. We do expect about a 20% decline in trailers next year but we believe we should be able to mitigate some of the downside by growing the business in other regions and in other TK products. Moving to slide 6. Another topic on the minds of investors is how the Dodge data for nonresidential put in place translates to Ingersoll-Rand. Here I think it's important to lay out where our business comes from, and what drives the market. I think the market overestimates our exposure. As the chart shows, the North American Commercial HVAC segment is about $4 billion and is split about 50-50 between services and equipment. Of the equipment, about 65% is replacement business, so not new put in place. The result is that our Dodge put-in-place data just covers about 18% of our business. Additionally, when you drill down further into the 18%, about 50% is commercial and 50% is institutional. Institutional is expected to show good growth in 2016, and even better growth in 2017. Our data says North American Commercial HVAC will be mid-single digits in 2016, and a similar number in 2017. So, we continue to see a healthy market going into next year. And with that, I'll turn the things over to Sue. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide 7. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continued to execute the core tenants for our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 performance, across the three pillars of growth, profitability and cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% on 3% organic revenue growth. Cash flow was 180% of net income for the quarter. Our performance was highlighted by record results in our North America Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses, where we captured additional market share, while at the same time expanding margins year-over-year. In our Industrial business, we drove 180 basis points of improved operating margin performance sequentially. We continued to take further actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased our commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service and added cost reduction activities to improve operating results going forward. The margin improvement was 70 basis points after adjusting Q2 margins for capitalized new product engineering and development cost that we highlighted in last quarter's earnings materials. We believe we are largely maintaining our growing market share across the portfolio, despite continued soft industrial end markets. During the quarter, we also extended our strong free cash flow performance by $644 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $992 million, up $527 million from the prior year. Given our long-term expectations for strong earnings and cash conversion, we also increased our dividend by 25% in October to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized, making our dividend highly competitive not only in our peer group, but across the broader market. Additionally, we now believe our free cash flow for 2016 will approximate $1.3 billion, up more than $200 million from our previous guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We've also increased our earnings per share guidance for the year given our year-to-date performance and outlook. Our revised guidance of between $4.17 and $4.22 is higher by $0.14 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow-through of our Q3 over performance versus our Q3 guidance midpoint, and an $0.88 to $0.93 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of $0.90 to $0.91 at the midpoint is consistent with our prior guidance. On the next several slides, I will highlight the key messages for this earnings call. Please go to slide eight. Our strong enterprise performance on organic growth, earnings per share growth and cash flow conversion was highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses and by sequential operating margin improvement in our Industrial segment versus the prior quarter. Organic revenue was up 3% as adjusted margins improved 30 basis points year-on-year with 30% operating leverage. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low growth environment and we delivered against that objective. Please go to slide nine. Organic orders continue to be solid through the third quarter of 2016 led by our Climate business and partially offset by soft industrial markets. Climate orders were up 4% organically, Organic Global Commercial HVAC bookings were up mid single-digits led by low-teens growth in North America unitary. We also continue to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings were solid, up mid single-digit. Organic transport orders were down low single-digits with order growth in Europe and Asia, offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with our guidance, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer. On balance the Industrial businesses were flat to down modestly and we are calling a broad-based recovery in the near-term. Please go to slide 10. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by regions. In our Climate segment, we saw solid performance in both North America and Latin America and low single-digit growth in the Middle East. In our Industrial segment overall performance was essentially flat with high single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa due to the shipment of large orders in the Middle East and mid single-digit growth in Asia, offset by declines in North America and Latin America. Please go to slide 11. Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 3% and adjusted operating margins up 90 basis points. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid single-digits, highlighted by exceptional growth in North America contracting up 17%. And unitary equipment in North America up low-teens. In Europe, business was unusually light, impacted by the slowdown in activity during the summer holiday season, driving mid single-digit equipment declines. Europe services contracting in parts were flat. Residential continued their outstanding year with revenues up low-teens. Transport organic revenues were down low-teens in the quarter, driven by weakening North America trailer and soft APU and marine markets. Despite lower revenues, margins expanded 110 basis points, with increases in both North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. This demonstrates the more resilient franchise we discussed. Growth in aftermarket parts and services, trucks and in Europe trailers drove higher margins and helped mitigate the impact of the downturn. Please go to slide 12. Climate reported operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Volume and mix were favorable across commercial and residential HVAC, partially offset by volume in transport. Price and direct material deflation and productivity also contributed to margin improvement. Additionally, we continue to invest in the business to drive innovation and growth. Please go to slide 13. Third quarter Industrial margins improved 180 basis points from second quarter trough margins on 1% organic revenue growth. Margin improvement was still solid at 70 basis points when accounting for Q2 2016 capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million that we discussed last quarter. Excluding those costs, Q2 margin was 10.9%. Industrial end markets remained soft in Q3 and are expected to be soft through 2016. Revenues were up mid single-digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket, oil-free and large machines with easier comparisons to the prior year. Other industrial products were down low teens with material handling showing the largest decline due to oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were down slightly in the quarter. Please go to slide 14, industrials reported operating margin of 10.9% was down 300 basis points versus prior year. Volume and mix were the largest drivers of this decline. Pricing offset materials, but given the continued low volumes running through our factories productivity did not offset inflation in the quarter. We continued planned investments in our products and channel and restructuring to improve our cost base. Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017 given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some variability due to cyclicality. Please go to slide 15. September year-to-date free cash flow of $992 million was favorable to prior year by $527 million. Strong operating income improvement and working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.9%. Our 2016 goal is approximately 4%. Based on strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in future cash conversion, we have raised our 2016 free cash flow forecast to approximately $1.3 billion. This is up more than $200 million from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We have a proud history of returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011 our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over that same timeframe we've retuned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buyback of $5.1 billion. You may have noted that we've referenced cash flow ROIC a few times today. Our definition is free cash flow divided by gross fixed assets plus working capital. Our goal is period over period improvement in this metric and we're doing well in 2016 with improved free cash flow and balance capital expenditures and working capital. Please go to slide 16. Our strong cash performance in the third quarter and our expectations moving forward enable us to; one, continue to invest in strategic growth programs as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems just to name a few. Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised the dividend over time. Over the past five years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In October, we announced a dividend increase of 25% to $0.40 per quarter or to $1.60 per share annually. Three, we will continue to purchase sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution, roughly $250 million per year. Four, we continue to see an increasing number of positive potential acquisition targets. And five, we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet with BBB metrics to provide optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through capital allocation, as we have consistently done for years. Please go to slide 17. Our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. Markets for North America commercial and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC are generally positive, while global industrial markets remain soft. We are forecasting global transport markets to be down low single-digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year, this implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid-single-digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-North America business for us; and a small decline in Transport globally. Please go to slide 18. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up approximately 2% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about one percentage point. We expect organic revenues to be up approximately 4% for Climate and down 3% for Industrial. Adjusted operating margins, which exclude restructuring costs are expected to be at the high end of our previous ranges for the enterprise at 12% and for Climate at 14.5%. Adjusted Industrial margins are expected to be at the midpoint of our previous range of 10% to 11%. Please go to slide 19. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.62 to $5.67 and the adjusted range is $4.17 to $4.22, up $0.14 to $0.15. At the midpoint, this represents a 12% increase in earnings per share over 2015. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain. We have raised our full year guidance for free cash flow more than $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion from $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued strong cash flows through 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% organically, while Industrial revenues are expected to be down 6% to 8%. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be between $0.88 and $0.93, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.02. The midpoint is consistent with or slightly higher than our previous guidance midpoint of $0.90 per share. With that, I will turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Sue. As we conclude, I want to emphasize a few points that I think are important for you to have as takeaways as we head into the final quarter and into 2017. First, we're performing well with a solid strategy punctuated with excellent execution over time. As a result, we have delivered consistent, reliable top tier financial performance on organic growth, EPS growth and cash flow over industrial and climate cycles. Second, our management team is effective in anticipating and seeing around the corners. Our commercial HVAC business is strong and focused on the right growth areas with equipment, controls and service. We believe we have turned the corner with our Industrial segment, and starting to realize margin improvement versus the quarter 2 trough. And our Transport Refrigeration business is resilient. Our team is capturing margin expansion, despite downward sales. Finally, we're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand. The results we reported today are a direct result of the strategic work, persistence and tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we've built. I'm proud of our people, who continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. Our momentum is strong as we conclude the year and head into 2017. And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question for today comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Nigel. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, obviously, very good execution in a really challenging macro. Were any signs of softening as you went through the quarter. And I'm just thinking here about North American Commercial, up 9% orders, obviously a very good number, but you'd pointed to double-digit for this quarter. And so, I'm just wondering if there was any tailing off towards the end of the quarter that maybe just caused you to slightly miss that 10% bogie? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, maybe like a tenth of a point, Nigel was the difference. So, the good people here would not allow me to round that up, as they should not have allowed me to round that up. But that's the difference. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And the kind of the frontload activity, you mentioned some larger projects in the hopper, maybe just give some color on that, Mike? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : They were largely institutional, but we're seeing them around the world, there are some large lumpier projects. So, it's difficult to always know the exact timing but the pipeline looks pretty strong going into 2017. So, the backlog 2016 ending will be greater than it was of course 2015 ending and then we've got a good pipeline coming into 2017. So, we feel like the earlier comment about 2017 looking a little bit more like 2016 with perhaps more institutional tailwind and if anything a little less of the commercial headwind will net out to a pretty good year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then a quick follow-up. TK for next year, you talked about North American trailer down 20%, but you think there is offsets, can you maybe just talk about maybe just round out where you see the offsets to that? And what do you think is the break point where perhaps it turns into a bigger headwind for higher. Thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Nigel. First, when you think about the TK unit itself, you've got North America down maybe as much as 20%, you've got APUs down, you've got global marine down, pretty much everything else is going to go up. That's North American truck, truck and trailer and Europe and Asia, air, aftermarket, bus and rail should all go up. So, there's a chance that TK pulls off something close to mitigating that. But when you back away and look across the company, institutional is going to be strong. We think industrial margins will recover. So, there's a lot of levers to pull inside the company and a lot of confidence in the teams that we've got across the company to make it work. We see EPS growth next year. So, that's how I would look at it initially. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks Mike. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Okay, Nigel. Operator : Thank you. And, our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa, from JPMorgan. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, Steve. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, just on the fourth quarter, Industrial, I think \u2013 just correct me if I'm wrong. Industrial profits are going to be essentially flat quarter-to-quarter? I know there is some moving parts around Cameron that changed the seasonality a bit. It's usually up. Anything to read into there. And then secondly, your free cash flow guidance of $300 million, I believe, for the fourth quarter is down pretty substantially from the third quarter. It's bounced around a bit, but last couple years, it's been actually definitely stronger than that. So, just curious as to why those two dynamics. And I have a quick follow-up. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So, Steve, let me start out with the industrial comment and the fourth quarter. So, you're correct that the operating income is about flat, but what you have is a dynamic in the fourth quarter where you really have more of the large compressors on a year-over-year basis. It's going to be a tough comparison. (34:58) going to be one of those areas, you have tools and material handling, which are high margin businesses that are going to be down on a year-over-year basis. So, in essence, you're going to have a volume challenge. You're also going to have some investments that are occurring in some of the business. For instance we're doing some investments in the Club Car business as well as in new products for the CTS business. So, it's really a story about volume and investment and a little bit less on the Industrial side with commodities, but also some impact there. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, on free cash flow? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes. Free cash flow, that's a great question. So what we've done in 2016 is we've really changed the way that free cash flow has come in. So every quarter as we've started out 2016, we've had positive cash flow as opposed to having everything really backend loaded. So again, I think where we're at at $992 million at the end of the third quarter, is fabulous. We brought it forward and we brought it forward by paying attention to things like terms on accounts receivable, making sure that accounts receivable is balanced with accounts payable terms across the globe, with working through inventories and making sure inventories were there to serve the customer, but not too much to have additional product on hand. So we've really managed this very, very carefully. And so what you see in the fourth quarter is really that instead of doing heroics to end the quarter, we've normalized it, which is really how we want to operate the business and how we want our cash flow to come in. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then Michael, as just a quick one. You mentioned EPS growth next year. I think in prior presentations this fall, you talked about top tier EPS growth, I know you had a bit of a low tax rate, that helped that growth a little bit this quarter still top tier even without that low tax rate. Is there something outside of the fundamentals next (37:17) the tax rate going back up or pension or anything else that kind of will keep you from getting to top tier and I guess with the fundamentals as they are with all that in, I mean, are you still talking that way or is this just hey the bogie is really just growing earnings given the headwinds that we have in TK et cetera? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I think Steve, it's a balanced and diversified portfolio, lots of service. We're investing heavily in the service channel as we've done all year long, and that's paying dividends. So, I think our eyes wide open on some of the challenges, but net-net, I'm talking about top tier growth from operations. Sue you might want to comment? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So, let me comment on the general business first. So, Steve, as we're going through and we're looking at the business, we still see strength in the commercial business for next year. We see strength in the residential business going into next year. We'll see improving margins coming out of the industrial business. So, we're going to get some good play on that. We're going to remain focused in terms of the price cost spread. We know we'll have a few headwinds on the steel side, but we'll still have a bit of deflation that occurs on the basis of copper that we already have locked-in and some of the aluminum that we have locked-in for 2017. We're also going to hit productivity really, really hard in the business, that's part of our hallmark of our operational excellence, and we're going to offset inflation. We're going to continue to press on corporate. So earnings per share growth next year on \u2013 I think is going to come from all of the different parts of the business, as well as tax. Now, tax is something that we're really proud of, and we're really proud of because it's \u2013 we started to talk about a low 20%s tax rate earlier in the year, we got there faster than we expected, but we got there by really doing what we call operationalizing tax. Which is basically we assign tax partners to each of our SBUs, they're working projects within the SBUs to actually work down the effective tax rate. Things like trading hubs, things like energy credits, things like really legal entity simplification. So, we've really operationalized that, I think it's kind of cutting edge. I still don't think our tax rate is going to go below the low 20%s, I think that's where it should be. So, yes, we'll get some tailwind out of that going into 2017 because I think the low 20%s is where we project the rate. But I think, it's operational also and something I think that's really good for Ingersoll-Rand. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. So, the low tax rate sustainable that \u2013 that's kind of the bottom line of that conversation, tax rate is feasible. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes that is absolutely the low 20%s tax rate is sustainable. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Awesome. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks a lot. So, I guess my first question would be on Thermo King. You sized that 25% of the business is North American trailer. I just wondered if you could give any further splits out of that business in revenue terms and also just focusing on Europe for a second, you sounded confident about Europe next year. A lot of the truck OEMs there have actually been talking about Europe slowing and maybe volumes falling next year on truck. So, maybe just give a little bit more detail on your Europe perspective for TK. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Julian. So, let me start with the quarter, that we've got in North America. You can add about 20% or so to Europe and the rest of the world in terms of trailer. Truck is a little less than 20%, aftermarket is a little bit less than 20%, APU in container are high single-digits, bus, air and rail are low double-digits. So, we've got North American trailer down, we feel pretty good about our plans, pipeline and the other businesses with the exception of marine container, which we don't think will recover much next year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then my second question just around the balance sheet. Your net debt has come down very rapidly, there was no buyback in the last few months and you talked a little bit about a fairly attractive M&A pipeline, it's been a while since the last couple of deals. So, maybe just give us an update on how you're thinking about sort of size of preferred acquisitions and any sort of financial criteria for them? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I think one of the things we wanted to highlight for you was that in the last five years and we could go probably a little bit longer than that, but 18% per annum cash flow return on invested capital, we're doing well. So, even with the timing on Cameron not being great, we didn't lose a beat last year and we're not losing a beat this year in maintaining a strong cash flow ROIC. The kinds of things that seem to populate the list for us would be channel investments and product extensions where we're selling products through existing channels that we have today with the sales force that we have today. There's a healthy pipeline of that, probably 50-50, I think across channel versus product and it's important to be patient there. They would be more accretive if they can be closed, don't say share buyback at this level. So, the optionality is important to wait it out to make sure that we do the right thing. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Two topics, first one, just back to Industrial, the comment broad based recovery. I truly want to understand what you mean by that, it would appear that you clearly mean controlling what you can control and improving operations internally. But are you also notwithstanding the pressures you still see in Q4, actually calling a turn in those end markets and see visibility of that happening? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Jeff, we're seeing flattening really, not improving markets, flattening markets and easier comps coming into 2017, but a lot of what we'll do in 2017 is improve margins to the op excellence restructuring and cost activity. And then, very good product launches coming in this quarter, fourth quarter and next year as well and that's really our game plan for Industrial for 2017. We are not counting on a broad based Industrial recovery though. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. That's what I thought. Thanks. And just back to kind of the institutional markets and what you're seeing in the project book. Are those skewed towards new projects or is there a lot of retrofit going on in the institutional outlook and maybe just in general, if you could speak to kind of the retrofit pipeline that you're seeing? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I'd say, it's largely energy efficiency retrofits replacing old antiquated systems with newer systems and those projects can get very large. So we'll see it from universities to healthcare to municipalities, state governments, federal installations. This is pretty much the market that we anticipate continuing into 2017. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. There's actually just one really quick one, maybe for Sue, just pension next year. Sue, any initial thoughts? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : It's Sue. Our pension I believe as we look at it at this point is going to be flat for year-on-year in terms of pension expense, so I know a lots of people are calling headwind on pension because of discount rates falling and of course obviously ours are down 75 basis points from year end also. But I think with the way that we have the portfolio setup with the asset returns that we've got, my expectation is that we are going to be flat. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Joe. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, my first question, Sue, going back to your comments earlier on cash flow, good job on the working capital. I'm just curious as we think through the bridge to 2017, are there any items that reverse in 2017 or is the right way to think about your free cash flow growth really EBIT growth should equal free cash flow growth in 2017. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : What we're focused on is really exactly what you said that the EBIT growth should be the free cash flow growth, and that's exactly what's happening in 2016 is, the operating income growth is falling through, our percentage on working capital is remaining true. We are not having to invest heavily in terms of capital, but we're also doing all of the projects and all of the items that our businesses bring forward that make financial sense. And so, if we can keep that rigor going, that is exactly the model we want which is see the EBIT flowing through. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That makes sense. And then, Mike, I just wanted to square some comments you made earlier on Thermo King. So, with North America trailer down next year, and your comments around hoping to offset with other parts of the Thermo King portfolio. Can you square that with what your expectation is for op income for Thermo King. Would you expect it to be up next year given that you think there is going to be some natural offsets on the growth side. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So, I'm going to punt that down the road here a little bit for us to be honest. We want to dial in what North American trailer volumes will be. We're going to probably set around a 20% down number, and make sure we don't do anything. In the event that it's only down 10% or if it's down 30% we want to optimize the cost structure to match it. So, I know that if it's down 15%, we're working a plan to be relatively flat. We'll see as we get closer and dial this in, but we need a few more months on this before we can really come back to you on that. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Bernstein. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning all. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey Sue just want to clarify the commentary around price cost heading into the fourth quarter. You've been talking about 20 basis point to 30 basis points spread for the second half, so given the 60 basis point this quarter should we be looking at flat next quarter, and then into 2017? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. So, let's talk about the fourth quarter first. So you are right if you do the math and you have an 80 basis point spread for the year it would get you to flat to maybe 20 basis point spread in the fourth quarter. But what we see happening and again the third quarter came out better than we had hoped at 60 basis points which was really about 50-50 materials equation and the other price. As we start to look at 2017, I think what 2017 does is it reverts to what we've said all along which is that we would have a 20 basis point to 30 basis point spread between price and cost and as you start to look at commodities for 2017, so steel has moved around a little bit. We saw an increase earlier in the summer to over $800 a ton. We currently see spot prices back in the $700 range. So, we have about a six-month time lag between when those prices move around and when we see it. Translated, that means I am going to see some steel inflation in the fourth quarter as well as probably the first quarter of 2017. However, I still continue to see tailwinds coming out of copper and aluminum going into 2017, helping us to offset that balance. So, we have line of sight to what we think the commodities are going to do and therefore we have line of sight to what our costs are, so that we can price per our operating model with top line margin expansion and get back to the 20 to 30 basis points for the year. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And Mike, lean obviously has been so important to your story for IR, but I am just looking at Climate in it and Industrial this quarter. Excluding volume and mix and 20 basis points on productivity versus other inflation for Climate and down 100 for Industrial. What's going on on a lean path here? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Really, it's the volume running through Industrial's so low on the large equipment, which is where the big heavy fixed costs tend to sit. So it's more volume dependent. If you look at what's actually flowing through there's good productivity on that lower volume. So, Steve, the long story short is volume helps productivity, cost reductions we've taken need volume to apply them to and that's \u2013 it needs to happen in the Industrial business. But look, fundamentally, you'll see us turning up the gas again in 2017, and we'll make sure the pipeline \u2013 we try to keep the pipeline 125% of what we think it needs to be. We try to calendarize that by quarter. So what we're doing now and we do every month is to make sure that we've got that pipeline lined up to be 125% of where we want it to be for our plan, allowing for things to break or timing to be different. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Mathematically, though, on 14, where you show volume separately in the waterfall chart versus productivity, you're actually saying, look, there's a volume effect running through the productivity as well as in the volume part of that chart. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Absolutely. Because we're trying to separate productivity on volume from volume at standards. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. And just, sorry, one last thing. You talk about the replacement market being so significant for IR. Are you seeing as a result of the new investments, breakeven paybacks coming in shortening for customers that's sort of driving a shortening of the replacement timeframe for specific end markets in any kind of big way? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I think the combination of the regulatory effect and the thought about getting in front of that when customers have the opportunity. Plus, from our point of view, there's a passion at the company around energy efficiency and sustainability. I think you hear that every time you talk to us. That combination I think is helping our people in the field make the story more compelling. And I do think it's led to why we're seeing share gain globally across the board. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Andy. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Mike or Sue, last quarter you gave us a breakdown of what your Industrial business looked like in its major sub-segments. You talked about Club Car aftermarket, large machines, small rotary, small air. You said larger machines, I think, were trending down 50% and smaller equipment was down a little. How would you characterize those segments, the sub-segments, in 3Q and do you see any improvement in your large factory exposed air business and do you have any initial thoughts as we head into 2017 on those sub-segments? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah you're seeing some of the smaller equipment growing, which is a good sign. You're still seeing really severe contractions in large machines. But we're ready to lap that, I think, next quarter and so that's why I think it's going to stabilize where it is. And you're seeing a still good growth in oil-free machines and contact cooled machines that would be supplied into pharma, food and bev in particular, markets which \u2013 again, the earlier comments I made, were really trying to direct more of that proactive activity into the markets that are actually growing. We don't see a lot of relief coming in iron, steel, air separation, those sorts of markets. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, Mike. That's helpful. And then on Climate, can you give us a little more color, I mean you said a marginal change in your guidance this year to 4% versus 4% to 5%. When I look at the sort of the pieces, it looks like the only change here is in transport, down low single digits versus flat to down last quarter was your guide. Is that North American trailers, just APUs and marine still being weaker than you thought or is it something else? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I'd say it's exactly that, Andy. It's exactly what you just said, it's North America trailer, APU and marine as being weak and not really a surprise. We've been thinking about this really all year. We thought it would actually be earlier in the year, it's actually the back half of the year. But certainly, that's the change really as you come through now the final quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. As you look into 2017 through, marine is very, very low, right? So, we really shouldn't have an impact from marine any more at this point? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I would hope not. We're trying to look at crop yields and other fundamental factors that determine if you're going to see produce and food and perishables move. So, structurally, you're getting to a pretty low level here. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, on the institutional improvement, not only in 2016 but you talked about 2017. When it first started for you, it seemed like it was mainly in K through 12 education, now it sounds a bit broader than that. Can you talk a little bit more about how that's developed and what kind of visibility you have into it? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. It's the typical way is it does evolve. It really is always kind of a K through 12 led institutional recovery, and then it moves up through higher ed, through healthcare and then eventually with state, city and federal projects. And a lot of that is based on just property values, the ability to tax against those values and have bonds pass local city vote. And so, you're into that cycle here now. It's still about 25% below where it was last time on a volume basis. So, there's quite a bit of room I think on the institutional side to continue to grow. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then, Mike, you were talking about some of the M&A in terms of channel investments, product extensions, which all sound like good places to go, but they also don't sound very big. The buyback you talked about over the last bunch of years was several years ago. Can you just maybe update us on your current philosophy around buyback? I mean, given where the stock has traded, obviously we talked about it for a while, but doesn't seem like there is big M&A in the pipe. So, maybe just update us on your philosophy on buyback? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Maybe to step back even one step further, I mean, the first thing we want to do is make sure that we are absolutely investing in the business fully and I can check the box and say we're absolutely doing that. I can check the box and say, we've now put the dividend in a good place relative to the peer group and we're proud of that. So, it really does come down to what do you do with the other pieces of this thing and if you think about it over the long run, roughly half of the cash going to either acquisition or share buyback. We'd certainly like to grow the company, but we're not going to do that at the expense of making a poor capital allocation decision. So, what you see right now is a large number of channel and potential product expansion investments that might fit the portfolio. If we could close, they would be worth the \u2013 the juice is worth the squeeze on those, so that's really why you're seeing us hold back here. Now, with all that being said, we've continued for at least seven years I guess now that I have been saying this, always controlling dilution of the share count, so Sue alluded to the fact that's roughly 2.5 million to 4 million shares and we'll continue to make sure it's part of the program going forward. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And I think what you're seeing, Shannon this is another point on that is, we're going to be patient with this and with the cash that we have, because we really want to create long-term value. We'd really like to invest in some of these opportunities, to your point some of them in the smaller size with channel investments, but also in new products. And so, it doesn't mean that we are going to just make an either or decision, we're being patient with the cash that's on the balance sheet and we're finding the best opportunities, but we want to let some of those M&A opportunities flavor a little bit and see if we can close them, because we think that's important too. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Josh. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So a couple of questions. First on Industrial margins. Mike, you talked about some of the initiatives there to get margins back up, obviously, some progress this quarter. But to see the kind of jump back to even 2015 levels for margin, 2015 levels. Does that require a particular mix to get there beyond just some productivity improvements and running the business more efficiently? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, mix matters, Josh. I mean, definitely, if you look at the high margin material handling and tools businesses, they matter a lot. But if you look at a normal mix that we would've seen sort of pre-downturn, about 70% of the downturn that we've seen has been volume related, the balance being some currency and then some mix. So fundamentally, we do need volume to return, but with that being said, if volume doesn't return next year, and we have the same mix of business that we have today. We have a healthy expectation to expand margins in 2017 in the Industrial business based on the actions we know we can take at these low levels of volumes. And we'll be bold about that and you'll see us commit to that probably in February. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. And then, just following up on some of your comments on institutional and some of the bigger projects that are in the pipeline. I guess that triggers off a little bit of an alert on performance contracting. So I'm trying to understand maybe some of the mix of orders that are coming in that are more project related and have some pull through revenue versus pure equipment type, and I guess it wouldn't be bookings shipped, but more of your own content type orders. And can you maybe help dimension some of that out for us? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Josh, I don't have an exact split for you, but I'm amazed at the size of equipment and controls orders that we are getting that are not performance contract based like the Chunnel tunnel and I can name a handful of sort of marquee projects like that. So we are winning a lot of that sort of work and we are loading up on that work as well. With that being said, performance contracting is an interesting place for us to play and there is a healthy amount of pull through that comes both not just in equipment but in service. Performance contracts always have a healthy service component that comes along with the guarantee. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And when we think about a more institutional mix in 2017, that would have that type of flavor to it? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : It's going to be large applied and performance contracting, and so it will be equipment and controls and service with and without an energy guarantee is the way to think about that. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. Appreciate it. Thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi good morning everyone. Obviously we've covered a lot here, but I guess the \u2013 I'll try on 2017 one more time. I mean Michael in the context of the last couple of years on the third quarter call, you definitely one year I think you provided a constructive range for EPS growth and then last year, you just talked about kind of the rhetoric around what you liked in terms of your overall HVAC portfolio. But do you think you have a good line of sight to 2017 on a forward basis versus previous periods in other words from 2014 to 2015 or are you \u2013 do you think there is more uncertainty in terms of the outlook this time versus the last couple of years when you were reporting 3Q? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Robert, I'll tell you, I don't have a public point of view that's primetime at this point. So, good try, I appreciate the last question is one more shot at it. But we're putting our plans together now and there is a pivotal process at all companies to put that together, so I don't want to sort of put an end here too soon on that, but we understand what top quartile will be, we understand what our goals are, what our operating system is set out to do. And so, there is not a lot of acrimony inside the company to understand what good performance looks like. That's what you'd expect for us next year, and I'll dial that in as we get closer into next year. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Zac Nagle for any closing comment. Zac Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Excuse me. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As always, we'll be available for questions today and over the next several days. And we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Zac, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2016 was another great year for Ingersoll-Rand, a record year, and we hit the mark in all the critical financial metrics. We'll get into some more detail on that in just a minute. I'd like to start this morning by talking about our business strategy, and how that has enabled us to deliver another year of top tier performance in 2016. Then Sue will discuss performance in the fourth quarter. We'll give some color on our 2017 markets and guidance, and I'll close with addressing topics we know are on the minds of investors before Sue and I take your questions. As I said, 2016 was a record year for Ingersoll-Rand. It follows a multi-year pattern of consistently strong operating and financial performance driven by our strategic framework of sustained growth, operational excellence, excellent cash flow conversion and a commitment to our winning culture. Our strategic objective is to drive profitable growth through leadership positions in growing markets that are durable because they address a global imperative, to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. Turning to slide four, in 2016 we extended our multi-year record of top quartile performance on organic revenue growth, incremental margins, earnings growth, free cash flow and total shareholder return. We delivered free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and 3% organic revenue growth and operating margin expansion of 60 basis points to 11.6%. Free cash flow was 121% of adjusted net income and more than $5 per outstanding share. Adjusted operating margin leverage was 44%. Adjusted continuing EPS of $4.13 was up 11%, demonstrating the strong leverage of the business. We also retained a strong balance sheet with good optionality, while at the same time returning significant cash to shareholders, paying roughly $350 million in dividends and executing $250 million in share buybacks. We continued our long history of raising our corporate dividend and in 2016 we raised our quarterly dividend by approximately 40% through two increases of $0.29 per share to $0.40 per share. We're now at $1.60 annualized per share. I'd said throughout 2016 that rigorous execution would serve us well, drive leverage in the P&L and deliver strong cash flow and margin expansion even in a low growth environment. We followed our business operating system to capture growth, improve costs and drive productivity, all of which translated into 60 basis points of margin expansion. 2016 growth was led by North American commercial and residential HVAC. The teams here are doing a phenomenal job of share gain and margin expansion and we anticipate this momentum to continue into 2017. While North American HVAC led the growth, we made deliberate choices in the selection of growth programs across the whole portfolio, and then we operationally led those programs to product growth teams. We see breakout results with this strategy. The average growth rate for our model product growth teams is more than twice our overall company average growth rate for the year. We also drove significant innovation, launching more than 80 new products and services in 2016, with introductions happening in nearly every business and region. We realized benefits of new product and technology investments as the offerings supported our 2016 growth, share gains and margin expansion. I emphasize this to demonstrate our commitment to organic long-term strategic investment and innovation to remain ahead of our customers' expectations, the competition and the regulatory environment. And heading into 2017, we haven't slowed down with our focus on product growth teams. A couple of weeks ago, we launched our personal transportation vehicle called Onward for the consumer market, resulting in a 10% order increase above our initial launch plan. Getting back to 2016, we also continued our multi-year trend of service, parts and solutions growth in both segments. HVAC aftermarket outpaced equipment growth annually with high single digit growth ex foreign exchange. In compression technologies, we also realized 3% growth in our aftermarket business. This consistent performance against our strategy to deliver higher service penetration across our segments helps build strong relationships with customers and a more resilient business portfolio. As anticipated, we continue to see more and more growth within our portfolio stemming from smart, wireless and digitally connected solutions in 2016 that are more reliable, more cost effective and energy efficient. Each one of our business units is executing a digital strategy and we are a recognized leader in this area. Our energy services and controls business, for example, is actively servicing 6,500 connected buildings, and we are one of the top providers in the space. Anticipated growth rate here is approximately 30% for 2017. The diversity of our business portfolio helps to mitigate cyclicality in our end markets, which has enabled us to sustain strong performance over time. Growth teams dedicated to our lines of business help us create real value using a wide range of technologies and innovation. Our objective is to take advantage of growth when the market is in an upswing and to build on our competitiveness in difficult markets. Moving to slide 5, the measure of our success is represented by our financial results and total return to our shareholders. Slide 5 demonstrates our consistent performance over time and the metrics that matter to our shareholders, whether it's revenue growth, adjusted EPS growth, cash flow ROIC or adjusted operating margin improvement. 2016 was another excellent year that extends this track record, a record year and one we're proud of. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sue to comment on the fourth quarter. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number 6. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, 2016 was a very strong year for Ingersoll-Rand and marked another year of continued top tier performance on free cash flow, organic revenue growth, operating margin improvement and earnings per share growth. While we recognize the fourth quarter contained more one-offs and noise than any of us would have liked and distorted our fourth quarter earnings report, fundamentally, it was still a strong quarter for the company relative to our core businesses. There shouldn't be any significant read through to our go-forward results. Free cash flow was more than $350 million in the quarter, bringing our 2016 free cash flow to $1.35 billion, which is up 37% versus 2015 or more than 120% of our adjusted net income. From a segment perspective, the combined Climate and Industrial segments' adjusted operating income results were solid and a bit better than our expectations for the quarter. Our bookings performance was very strong, with commercial and residential HVAC leading the way, with both at low teens growth. Residential revenues increased low teens. Operating margins also expanded in both businesses. We were pleased with our Industrial business performance which showed slow but steady adjusted margin improvement after hitting a low in the first quarter. We continued to take additional actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service offerings, and took additional cost reduction activities to improve operating results going forward. EPS in the quarter was negatively impacted by discrete items in G&A, negative other operating income and taxes, as I'll discuss on the next slide. Please go to slide 7. We've provided a bridge from the fourth quarter guidance range we provided on our Q3 earnings call to our actual Q4 results. As I noted earlier, our segment operating performance was in line with our expectations, actually about $0.01 better. We incurred higher than expected corporate costs, primarily due to stock based and other incentive based compensation, given our strong cash flow performance and stock performance in 2016 and from increased information technology, infrastructure and security expenditures. These items combined for a negative impact of about $0.04. We expect our corporate G&A expenses to come back down to a more normalized run rate of about $60 million per quarter in 2017. We also incurred higher than expected non-operating cost as a result of foreign exchange losses related to the balance sheet, given the strengthening of the US dollar, which had a non-cash impact of $0.01. Lastly, we had a higher than expected mix of earnings from high tax jurisdictions which impacted us by about $0.03. While this was a significant negative in the fourth quarter, our adjusted tax rate for the year of 21.4% was on the low side of the 21% to 22% range we updated on our second quarter call. I feel good about the effective tax rate. And more importantly, we expect the rate to remain in the 21% to 22% range for 2017 as well. Please go to slide number 8. Top-line organic growth of 2% was solid, highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses. Operating margins and adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization were both down, primarily driven by Industrial segment margin declines and the higher than expected costs we previously discussed. Please go to slide 9. Organic orders were very strong in the fourth quarter, up 7%, led by our Climate segment and partially offset by modest declines in our Industrial segment. Climate bookings were up in every region in business globally and up 10% overall. Organic commercial HVAC bookings were up low teens in equipment, with strong results from both unitary and applied products. We also continued to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings continued to be exceptional, up low teens. Organic transport orders were up mid single digits, primarily driven by growth in Europe, partially offset by declines in marine equipment and auxiliary power units. We also had mid single digit increase in North America trailer orders in the fourth quarter. On balance, the Industrial businesses bookings were flat to down slightly in the quarter, reflecting some stabilization in end markets. Please go to slide number 10. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, revenue was strong in North America, flat in Asia and down in Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. In our Industrial segment, overall performance was down low single digits, primarily due to difficult comparisons with 2015 on large air compressor shipments in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Revenues improved in Latin America and Asia. Overall, North America revenues were up mid single digits and international revenues were down mid single digits, netting a positive 2% organic revenue growth rate for the enterprise. Please go to slide number 11. Q4 operating margin declined 50 basis points, primarily due to headwinds resulting from material inflation in steel and higher corporate costs in the quarter. On a year over year basis, lower Industrial margins also contributed to the decline. Volume and mix was positive in the quarter. Please go to slide number 12. Overall Climate performance was strong in the quarter with organic revenues up 4% and adjusted operating margins up 70 basis points to 13.6%. Strong revenue growth in both commercial and residential HVAC was partially offset by transport revenues, which were down mid single digits in the quarter, primarily due to weak auxiliary power unit and marine markets partially offset by growth in aftermarket and in Asia. Climate operating margins expanded 70 basis points year over year. Favorable volume, mix and productivity was partially offset by material inflation headwinds and continued investments in the business. Please go to slide 13. Fourth quarter industrial margins declined by 220 basis points compared with 2015, while organic revenues declined 3%. Revenues were down mid single digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket. Other industrial products were down by high single digits with material handling showing the largest decline, more than 50%, owing to its significant oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were up slightly in the quarter from growth in golf. Industrial's operating margin of 10.5% was down 220 basis points versus the prior year, but in line or slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017, given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some quarterly variability due to cyclicality. Please go to slide 14. Excellent full year 2016 free cash flow of $1.3 billion improved 37% versus the prior year and was over 120% of net income. Strong operating income and working capital improvement were the primary drivers of the improvement. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 3.4% versus our 2016 goal of 4% and improved 80 basis points versus 2015. We have a proud history returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011, our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over the same timeframe, we've returned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buybacks of $5.1 billion. Please go to slide 15. Our strong cash performance in 2016 will enable us to, one, invest in our business as our number one priority. These include investments in innovation and in strategic growth programs as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as wireless, controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few. Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised this dividend over time. Over the past five years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In 2016, we raised our annualized dividend from $1.16 to $1.60 per share or nearly 40%. Three, we also spent $250 million repurchasing sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution. Four, additionally in 2016, we continued to develop and vet a pipeline of potential acquisition targets. And five, lastly in 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet, which provides stability and optionality as our markets evolve. We also maintain a BBB credit rating, which at this time we believe is appropriate for the company. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy as we have consistently done for years. And with that, I will turn it back to Mike to discuss our market outlook as we begin our guidance conversation. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Sue. And if you move to slide 17, we'll begin our guidance conversation with some color around our end markets. As always, our intention is to give you our best view as we know it today and how that translates to our revenue outlook for 2017. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. We expect North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC to show continuing growth. In North America, 50% of our commercial business is parts, service and controls, and we're seeing strong demand in all these areas as well as through upgrades and energy retrofits. Residential replacement, which makes up approximately 80% of the total market, closed the year on a strong note and we expect to see continuing growth next year in both replacement and new construction. Commercial HVAC markets in EMEA and Asia are expected to be flat. We expect Latin America to be up mid to high single digits. Transport markets in the Americas will be down from lower volumes for trailers and auxiliary power units, partially offset by trucks. North American trailer volumes are expected to decline by low teens. Transport in Europe is expected to be up based on truck and trailer sales and a bottoming of the marine container market. Asia Pacific was up high teens last year and we expect continued growth in 2017 on its smaller base. Global industrial markets are generally improving, but still remain soft. We believe we are seeing a bottoming trend in our general industrial markets in the US and the Eurozone as PMIs have improved over the last several months. We have also seen some order improvement in our short cycle industrial businesses. While this is a positive, the modest rise in industrial production for just a gradual recovery with bumps along the way. Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure due to excess capacity in many key industries. The large engineered compressor market is expected to show signs of improvement due to stabilizing activity in energy markets and heavy industry. While expecting year over year orders to be up, revenue will decline due to depressed 2016 order levels and the average lead time of 12 to 18 months for this type of product. Excluding these longer lead time products, we expect our Industrial segment to be flat to slightly up. Golf and utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up across all regions. Golf is expected to be flat and we expect to see some growth in our consumer and utility vehicle markets. All the growth forecasts shown are on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid single digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid single digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially a North American business for us, and revenues down low single digits in transport. We expect compression technologies and industrial products, which includes our power tools, material handling and fluid management businesses to be down low single digits and we expect Club Car to be up low single digits. With that overview as a backdrop, we'll move into 2017 guidance. Before Sue takes you through guidance, I know some of you know that we recently completed in-depth interviews with the investment community to better understand how Ingersoll-Rand is perceived and what we might do better to improve in our communications. We just received the results and we'll be incorporating changes that reflect investor feedback going forward. Thank you to all of you who participated. One of the changes highlighted in the feedback was investor preference for the timing of company guidance. Overwhelmingly, investors said they had a preference for annual guidance with quarterly updates versus quarterly guidance. So we have adopted this beginning with the annual guidance for 2017. Annual guidance is also much more aligned with the way in which we make decisions and manage the business internally with a focus on building a better business over the long term. For those of you who prefer quarterly guidance, we'll get through the transition together and make sure it goes as smoothly as it can. And now I'll turn it over to Sue for specifics on guidance. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Mike. Please go to slide 18. Moving on to our guidance, we expect total organic revenues to be up approximately 3% in 2017. We expect the Climate segment to continue to show good growth of approximately 4% organic. For the Industrial segment, we expect the markets overall to be pretty flat, but for our organic revenues to be down slightly given the high volume of large compressors we shipped out of backlog in 2016, which will make for tougher compares in 2017. The difference between our organic and reported revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of negative foreign exchange from a strengthening US dollar outlook. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of between 12.2% and 12.6%. We expect adjusted operating margins for the Climate segment to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, and in the range of 11% to 12% for the Industrial segment. Please go to slide 19. We expect continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2017 to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50 excluding about $0.15 of restructuring. The company also provides the following guidance. Share count is expected to be approximately 262 million shares. Target free cash flow is 100% of net income. The tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 22%. Corporate, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately $240 million and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million. Please go to slide 20. Relative to the company's plans for capital allocation investing, in the business is our highest priority, so we continue to make investments in innovation and growth in things like wireless and digital and connected capabilities, productivity, sustainability and in our employees just to name a few areas. Paying a highly competitive dividend is also a key priority for us and based on our most recent dividend raise last October to $1.60 per share, we expect to spend approximately $420 million on dividends in 2017. In 2017, we're also targeting spending approximately $1.5 billion between a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions. Maintaining a strong balance sheet also remains a priority and provides us optionality as our markets continue to evolve. Let's go to slide 21. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike to discuss a few of the key topics we know are on the minds of investors as we enter 2017. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Sue. The first topic to discuss is our US manufacturing base. I think you're all aware, we operate on a region of use philosophy. We localize manufacturing and the supply chain to help us achieve greater speed to market and implement local product preferences. 95% of Ingersoll-Rand products sold in the US are manufactured in the US. Regarding components, we're likely less exposed as compared to other diversified industrials, because of our focus on lean and in particular cycle time reduction. We've actually through the years been willing to sacrifice some price for faster delivery, meaning the source is coming from within the US. I think this issue is a bigger issue for companies that are importing finished goods into the US, such as consumer products or electronic companies. We are definitely a net exporter. The second topic is around the US corporate tax rate. As you know, approximately 65% of our revenues are derived from the US and therefore, we pay a significant amount of US corporate taxes. If there is a reduction in the US corporate tax rate, we would expect to benefit from it. Turning to slide 22. I know we'll receive questions on the status of Industrial. Fourth quarter was above the guidance we gave in revenue and operating margin. We saw growth in several vertical markets, including food, pharma and tech, as well as with our compressor aftermarket business, which was up 3% as I mentioned earlier. However, we continue to see soft markets on large compressors and in the energy markets. We have seen some bottoming with orders for our shorter-cycle businesses, such as power tools and fluid management, both up in the fourth quarter. As I indicated earlier, we expect the industrial markets to stabilize in 2017, although we cannot declare a definitive turning point. Excluding large compressors, we expect Industrial to be flat to slightly up, and we do expect to realize margin expansion through our operational excellence initiatives, new product launches, restructuring actions and ongoing cost reductions. Covering our transport business, you'll recall last year we had a better than anticipated first half and decline in activity in the second half, as we expected. For 2017 overall, we expect Thermo King revenues to be down low single digits year over year. The North American trailer industry is expected to be down low teens year over year. We're also expecting a continuation for a relatively soft market for auxiliary power units and marine containers. Those declines will be partially offset by gains in Europe, Asia and aftermarket revenues. Through restructuring and efficiency, we would expect only a minor erosion of record 2016 operating margins. Moving to slide 23, I'll touch on currency as a headwind for us in 2017. About 35% or $4.8 billion of our revenues are outside of the US. Our 2017 forecast has built in the continuing strength of the US dollar, which will impact us most notably in the euro and Asian currencies. Overall, we expect a 1% drag on our revenues from currency translation, which will have about a $0.10 negative impact on our EPS. And finally, we know material inflation is top of mind. We have 10 basis points positive price covering material inflation in our guidance, and of course we're working to increase that even further. We've been through various cycles and have a strong history of capturing price to material inflation. This long track record of managing price demonstrates to shareholders the discipline that exists with our people, systems and processes. So in closing on slide 24, we've built a stronger, more valuable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand. I'm proud of our employees who delivered a record 2016 performance and that make us a more sustainable company in every way. I'm confident in our management team to execute our 2017 plan. We will maximize growth and focus on productivity and costs where markets are not accelerating. Our commercial and residential HVAC businesses are strong and focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our transport refrigeration business is diverse and agile, and will execute their strategy as they typically do. Our industrial businesses are focused on margin expansion as markets stabilize. As a result, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver a top-tier financial performance. And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Shannon. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Mike or maybe Sue, on the free cash flow, just remind us why it was so particularly strong in 2016. I mean the working capital performance is great. It looks like CapEx was a little bit lower. You're bringing that up. Just maybe refresh us on the dynamics of why you see that still being strong in 2017, but not quite the conversion of 2016. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Shannon, that's a great question for us. Free cash flow was really strong in 2016 because we really focused on all of the basic fundamentals. What we wanted was we wanted our operating income to flow through to cash flow. So, we were very focused on making sure that on the accounts receivable side that our terms for our customers were balanced with our terms for our suppliers. We went after disputes. We went and talked to our customers that had past-dues. We worked with the supply base on accounts payable terms, and we also did a lot of work on our inventory processes as part of the business operating system. So we really, really focused on getting the operating income to drop through, getting the working capital to a level that was not only good, but also sustainable. And then our spending on other items, we didn't limit anything on CapEx, to your point. We didn't do anything like that. We asked for good investments as a part of the business. So, we actually used free cash flow in a very good way in 2016 and we had a very good result. And I think another point to give you on \u2013 not only was free cash flow excellent based on the performance of each of our businesses and the corporate folks, but it was also pretty evenly measured throughout 2016 as opposed to being a very lumpy free cash flow. So, I think everything came together for that in 2016. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Sue won't say this, but I'll say it. She did a great job and her team training the organization on something we had fun with called in the know on cash flow. We had everybody in the organization go through that with the purpose to explain that everybody in the company has got something to do with cash flow, and people got excited about its stories. We were really kind of pushing through, and I think that level of engagement is a factor, somewhere it made a big difference around people really exceeding this. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : And then, Mike, maybe on the strength in those Climate bookings, I mean up 10% organic, it looks like you're gaining share in a lot of new product investments. When you look across either the product type as applied, unitary, or the regions, any particular area that you feel you're particularly well positioned in terms of share gain? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Shannon, it was amazing in that it was across the globe, and it was across unitary, applied, controls and service. So I mean, it was just across the board. We didn't have a single pocket of weakness really anywhere in the world which is reassuring to us, and that's a broad-based approach. And that I think gave us confidence around the guide we gave for the year around pretty good growth continuing into 2017. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Great detail by the way, appreciate all the extra color in the slides. So, I just wanted to come back to Shannon's question on the outgrowth. It does feel like you're gaining share pretty much across the board, so a question that comes up a lot is, how sustainable is that dynamic. And maybe if you just touch on what do you think is driving that outgrowth in particularly within commercial HVAC? And then, equally it does feel like you're lagging your big competitor in compression. Maybe just touch on that as well, Mike. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, first I would say, Nigel, that you have to go back and realize that it's been investments sustained over time and product launches have been occurring at a high rate for some time. I think we've got the best channel in the world in terms of the people out there that are systems experts, capable of bringing stuff to the market. And we've got the largest that we know of field service force in the world around HVA systems, over 4,500 people out delivering that are employees of the company. And you combine that all together with investments in digital, and I feel like it's been not a flash in the pan around something happening in the fourth quarter. It's been good for a long time. And it's up to us to continue to innovate and to continue invest in the channel. Half the investments or more that we're making in 2017, again go back into the channel itself, not just into product. When you look at a compression technologies, similar investments happening there and we're seeing good growth on the service side. You had asked reference to Copco. You have to look at Copco, when there's a 5 point swing just in currency, Copco would have shown a 3 point gain. We show a 2 point headwind in currency, 5 point in net. When we back out and look at the organic growth, I think they were minus 5, we were minus 4. There's always subtleties in the business, but look, we're all I think in the compressor business looking forward to brighter days. I don't think there's a read through when you do the side-by-side math between Copco and us around a difference in performance. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That was really helpful. And then on the capital allocation, the $1.5 billion of the target, what does that mean? Does that mean that there's ambition to deploy that amount, but if there's an opportunity, you won't? And how do you think about that toggle between M&A and share buybacks? And this time next year, if you haven't deployed that capital, why would that be? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I think you had it right in your note this morning, Nigel. $1.5 billion is what we're saying we're targeting to deploy in 2017, and $250 million of that, we've already said look, that's going to control any kind of dilution in share count. Leaves $1.25 billion left, and we're going to be really smart about how to deploy that. So very patient, very selective around the M&A front. And we're going to be patient around share repurchase. But between the two, we expect to deploy $1.25 billion and we're just going to update you as you go through the year. It's difficult to forecast that on an EPS basis, because certainly on share count, it matters when and where you buy shares during the year as they're averaged back in. And M&A clearly on a GAAP basis, EPS accretion is difficult to see in a partial year, maybe even within the first full year. So it's difficult to forecast that. It's dependent on the actual target. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Steve. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just a follow-up to Shannon's question on free cash flow. I mean, you talked about how you kind of focused this year on all these moving parts. I guess, is 2017, was there some pull forward into 2016? 2017 is down. I wouldn't have expected it to be down that much. You've talked about the conversion rate as being sustainable and obviously above 100% is good, but just down year over year by the magnitude. Just curious if there is anything unusual about that 2016 performance? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : No. There was really nothing that was unusual about the 2016 performance, Steve. What I did as I looked at 2017 is I did a couple of things. One, on working capital, I was really allowing working capital to go back up to around the 4% level, and I'll tell you why. As our markets are a little bit lumpy, choppy, some of them recovering, I want to make sure that our businesses have the option to have inventory on hand so that not only can we meet customer requirements, but that we can meet on-time delivery requirements. So, I'm giving us room for a little more working capital and really I'm primarily talking about inventory in terms of 2017. The other part of that is our capital expenditures are actually going up a bit year over year. I gave you a guide of $250 million. And really the majority of the increase in the CapEx year over year is really in our factories, in productivity producing projects and things like primarily precision machining and in the factory. So, I gave a little room for all of that and that really takes it down to the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion level. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That make some sense. And then the restructuring you guys are doing, it's a bit of a step up. Just curious as to why you're stepping that up now given the strong kind of volume picture on orders. Where specifically is that going? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Steve, so fundamentally on that, we're really going to discuss sort of where that's going as we deploy it because we want to make sure that we're in front of that internally versus speaking to it externally. But in a lot of the cases where we've been sort of on the fence with doing some things, we've found opportunities within those business cases. Examples might be where real estate values would have changed on the underlying idea and so there might be an opportunity to consolidate a footprint that we didn't have in the past. So there's a fair bit of that going on as well. So we've got sort of ideas around that $50 million and we're going to update you as we go, but it's a good placeholder for now. And you know what, Steve? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And the payback on that? And the payback on that? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah so, yeah well on the $50 million, we'll probably see $10 million in 2017 and then we'll go to something more full run rate, probably $20 million in 2018 on that $50 million. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then one last question, just on the first quarter, maybe my clients are going to hate me because they don't want guidance anymore, but I think it's good to at least have a nice framework out there. Normal seasonality, at least how we calculate it, that gets me into the kind of the low to mid 50s from an EPS perspective. Is that too far off? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : From a seasonality perspective, Steve, we went back over five years and we're pretty much now I think dialing in. So first quarter usually is kind of 10% to 12% of the EPS for the year, and then we're kind of a front half/back half, 45%, 55% sort of company. You shouldn't get too far off with that sort of math going. Steve, before you're cut off too, I want to thank for spending as much time as you did at the ASHRAE show with our team. They really appreciated you stopping and spending time with them. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. I love HVAC. You know that. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : We do too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: First, so I guess my first question is that maybe just touch a little bit on price/cost, clearly a little bit of a headwind in 4Q. And talk a little bit about what kind of pricing you think you can get through across your portfolio in 2017, and to the extent that you can talk about cadence, that would be helpful as well. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Sure, Joe, let me start out and give you some basic parameters around this. So we knew going into Q4 that we were going to be in an inflationary environment for steel. Pricing did not offset the inflation in the fourth quarter, so we were down 40 basis points as you saw on the slides and heard from our commentary. As we look at 2017, we've got that currently pegged at price over material inflation at about 10 basis points. Really working towards trying to get back to our norm of 20 to 30 basis points. But let me talk a little about what's happening in 2017. So if you think about what drives the material inflation, it's really all around steel, the nonferrous, so the copper and the aluminum. First of all, we're locked about 68% on copper going into 2017, but those should be relatively flat, so neither inflationary or deflationary as we see it right now. Steel has two components to it, one of which is just the raw commodity that's there. And then an even bigger part of that is actually the Tier 2 materials that contain steel that become inflationary. And one of the questions that I ask our group and wanted to pass on as we think about that is, my question was can we just really negotiate with the supply base. And part of this is really on how we've done contracts and written in escalation clauses. So long story short, steel and components that contains steel are going to be inflationary in 2017. And like I say, we'll continue to work price as we go throughout the organization. Now, when you think about price and you think about different areas, we've been successful at getting price in both of our segments in 2016. And I think we'll get price in both segments in 2017. Asia is going to be tough. That one's an interesting market. Some of the others, again price is not for us just a catalog and a price on a particular item. We're baking price into every engineered to order type of project as we go along. So again, pricing is going to be a work in progress. I think there is going to be a little pressure on that as we go into 2017, but inflation comes from steel. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And Joe, recognizing you've been with us now a couple of years, but if you go back all the way to 2010, I know personally even late 2009, we put in place and have been adapting and in training to all the methods and tools for pricing and systems around the company. So there is a lot of rigor in the operating system around that. A lot of reporting and remediation around that, mitigation around that. So on a topic like this, you'd have to go back to a seven year record of every year, being able to deliver on that. I don't suggest that it's going to change in 2017. So it's a little bit here on the benefit of the doubt associated with the tools and the methods of training that we've done over the years. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, that's helpful, both you guys. I guess maybe my one follow-up, maybe just switching gears to like Thermo for a second. Orders turned positive this quarter. I know that you're calling for North America truck/trailer to be down low teens in 2017. Your largest competitor, who we just saw at the same conference, I think is forecasting down mid single digits. Is there any reason why there would be either a lag or a change in the trajectory that either of you see for 2017? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, there are two factors that always play here, one is around which set of customers are buying and which are not, and you will see anomalies quarter-to-quarter about kind of who came to the table. So in the fourth quarter, certainly our customers came to the table and placed orders, which is great. The second really piece of this thing is that it's awfully early to call ACT, (48:08) saying 43,000 units. We've got about 40,000. If you went right back to ACT (48:15), now you are sort of in that range that our competitor would have outlined for you. We tend to think historically, with the exception of last year, that they've kind of met in the middle somewhere. So, we're a little bit more conservative around a 40,000 unit ACT (48:28) number versus 43,000, and that's probably explaining the difference in how we're seeing the market. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's fair enough. Thanks guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, good morning guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Andrew. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question about the fourth quarter reinvestment on security and IT. A, could you just talk a little bit more about it? And second, I'm just really curious, what was the timing of the decision to make this reinvestment? And what I am trying to understand, we're starting to get a sense that companies are getting more comfortable with growth and actually for the first time in several years are choosing to put money into the businesses again. And I was just trying to understand if that's what's happening at Ingersoll-Rand or if there was something else. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. One of the things, Andrew, when it comes to infrastructure and cyber security, which are often related, I think once you have the idea that you need to do something or want to do something, I think that common thinking would be that sooner is typically better than later. If you think that you've got something you want to plug, that's generally sort of the thought process, the management decision to do that. It's also why frankly you should also always understand, we're trying to do the right things for the long run, not for the quarter. So that in and of itself may not have been the difference. I mean, it was more the other discrete items that are difficult, but not impossible, to forecast, stock-based comp, incentive comp certainly fit that, tax by legal entity as opposed to tax by geography or business unit is more nuanced. But that's one where generally speaking, if you need to spend it, sooner is typically better than later. And that's been our approach. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And I would add just a little bit to that, Andrew, in terms of if you look at the full year of 2016, we started out the year, and we obviously talk pretty regularly to all of the teams around the company. And we really said, don't let our costs get out ahead of what the revenue profile is. So if you looked at corporate costs for really the first three quarters of 2016, you would see that our run rate was actually under what would be typical for a $240 million year. That doesn't mean that because you're under, you should go out and do some things. But it also adds to part of the thinking, when you get to an area where you have some items that you need to spend money on, you go forward and say for the year, our costs, whether it's in IT, whether it's in legal, HR, finance, whatever part of our functional spending are actually flat from 2015 to 2016 and actually will be flat into 2017. So, there's also a little bit of a timing element that is a part of that too. Doesn't explain the difference in the guidance, but I also wanted to give you some context of what we were thinking as we went into the fourth quarter. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And just to be clear in what Sue said, so 2015, 2016 and 2017, the core functional costs have been absolutely flat, which has been our objective, what we're driving to. All the swing you see are in things like stock-based comp, pensions, adjustments that are really happening sort of around those core functional costs. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. The other thing, you made a specific commentary about seasonality on industrial in 2017. And you did call it out, and so what's different versus history on this quarterly variability in the industrial business? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Andrew, the only comparison I think we made was comparing Q4 2016 to Q4 2015, because Q4 2015 had that mammoth load of Cameron shipments, which drove the difficult comp for quarter four. Not a lot of seasonality in industrial beyond that, that we would call out, with the exception that for some reason with large compressors, the kind that are put into gas and energy applications, have tended to been more fourth quarter loaded. But I'm not sure that that's an actual seasonal phenomenon as opposed to sort of when we're booking and shipping orders. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So just to correct, I guess I misunderstood. So, there is nothing different about industrial seasonality in 2017? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : No, Andrew. I think the comment that we were actually making, and perhaps we didn't make it as well as we thought, was that what we didn't want anyone to do was to take and draw a straight line on margin improvement each and every quarter in the industrial business. We were saying that it could be a little bit lumpy from quarter to quarter, and would follow its typical pattern. So we just didn't want anybody to get concerned if there was some variation there. So, it was a pretty simple comment that might have been confusing. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thank you so much. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is now open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the residential bookings at up low teens, maybe some color regarding the product, the mix, where the SEER preferences look to be in 2017 and was there any pre-buy involved. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : No pre-buy involved, but yeah, I think you know that the res product is fundamentally 100% new over the past three years. We've got just a few little things we're tweaking. And we've found that as the mix has moved to 14 SEER and above, this is playing really well in our dealer base. So I think this is just going back to the commercial discussion. It's been long-term investment and getting the product portfolio right, long-term investment on repositioning our dealer base to be able to sell low, medium and high price point product, penetration into the residential construction market, penetration into the owner occupied but non-resident market which is another market that we've had some good success with. So again, just good hard product development, channel development and sticking to a strategy here over the long run. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And I think, Deane, from you asked the question on SEER. So as we went through 2016, the 14, the 13 and 14 SEER kind of combined for roughly about 50% of our revenues, and then the 15 SEER and greater was a smaller percent. So really, what you saw was the 13 SEER go into the 14 SEER product and the 15 SEER and above sort of stay the same. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, there was an interesting development recently with your primary competitor in golf carts, investing in Arctic Cat. So does that change your thinking in any way of how you want to be positioned? You did mention the new product launch of Onward. I went online just now and took a look at. Those just look pretty cool rims for a golf cart, but looks like it's an organic focus for you all with Club Cart. But maybe some comments there. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, it looks better with the lift kit too, Deane, so look at that picture. That's what you need is big wheels and a lift kit. That's what I'm going to get. Anyway, yeah, no, it's an organic focus, because we think the brand's got legs. We think that we've always focused on consumer on golf and utility, and it's a real concerted effort to penetrate the consumer low-speed vehicle market and personal vehicle market, not \u2013 this is golf and car communities, small vehicle communities, this is hospitality and recreation venues. This isn't 65 miles an hour running through rough country. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is now open. Seth Girsky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. This is Seth Girsky on for Andy. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, Seth. Seth Girsky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Last quarter you talked about expecting Asia HVAC market to be flat to down in 2017 and 3Q bookings were flat, but bookings in Asia HVAC were high teens this quarter. So can you talk about what your expectations are for Asia HVAC in 2017? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, it was a really great fourth quarter. I think that you're going to see sort of a more moderate view toward Asia, kind of mid single digit in Asia for the full year. So it just happened to be the opportunity to book a tremendous amount of orders with a small group of customers that are buying large, and it's going to be lumpy. But I still think it's going to be a cycle and you're going to see sort of mid single digit at the end of the day. Seth Girsky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. That makes sense. And then in the Industrial segment, material handlings seems to still be under pressure. But can you talk about your visibility to bottoming in the material handling market as oil prices continue to recover? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. It has to do with really the count of offshore rigs increasing. That's probably the biggest determinant. Land rigs have an effect, but the content that we provide in the land rig versus an offshore rig are going to be dramatically different. So, I'm pleased to see really utilization of offshore rigs. You're not going to see a full recovery in that business. Incredible margins, fantastic business, that's why it hurts when it's actually down. You really have a dramatic effect on the margins for the segment. Frankly, it's about 1 point in the fourth quarter, so small business, big impact. We love it when it's up; it hurts when it's down. Seth Girsky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for fitting me in, appreciate it. I'm over at ASHRAE right now, and one of the things that strikes me is no matter, most people I talk to, they are seeing growth in VRF in North America on the order of 15% to 20%, depending on how you count it. I know you've talked in the past about maybe I think it's 25% of that market volume going through your channels, but one thing that's been apparent is, a lot of that is non-Trane product really and the actual Trane (59:55) content sounds pretty low. So what I have seen other folks successfully transition to their own content or their joint venture content because they own part of it, et cetera, what's your plan and strategy here? It's one of the only places you don't really own it and not vertically integrated and seems like a big opportunity. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah Steve, look, one of the things here is, we have a very definitive plan of what we're doing. I'm not going to disclose it here for strategic reasons to do that, but I'll tell you that it's a source of investment in Q4. It's a large business in Asia, and it's growing and we make and co-develop our own product there with partners. Here, our growth rates are higher than the rates you're reporting. So we're seeing higher growth rates in our unitary business and higher growth rates than what you're seeing. Our focus really is on the VRF business, not on the mini-split business. We think that's where the value is. That's where controls matter. That's where hybrid systems come into play. It's where our channel works and where service is a possibility. So again, our focus is on VRF. You've seen Trane branded product there in the US. Mini-splits, we're a bit more agnostic to that. We serve the market. We're not as caught up in whether that says Trane or Trane and somebody else or somebody else going through our market. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And also on back to the cash flow discussion for 2017. So at the midpoint, it looks like that 100% conversion, Sue, you talked about 4% working capital target. But Mike, I think it's a decade now almost that we've been talking about lean conversion and much, much better inventory and other management. So maybe a little flavor here on why couldn't you keep it at a lower inventory level to still meet channel demand. Or is it just the shift in inventory from raws and work-in-process to finish goods? What's going on there? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I think that whether its 3.6% or 4%, and whether the inventory turns are 6.8 or 6.9 really isn't what we're trying to do. What we're trying to do is get 100% on-time customer shipment at cycle times that competitors can't deal with and pick up all the discretionary business that's out there to get. And we want a balance between the two, and so long as we're growing margins and growing share, we feel like it's a good formula. So the place to put the gas down isn't on creating a problem where you're inadvertently creating a situation where you're not competing in the area that you want to compete. So Steve, you know us as well as anybody that really that cycle time conversion and that compression in cycle time is worth something, not just on working capital, but on growth and operating margins. And so that's always been our focus. And so whether it's 3.6% or 4%, it's not as important to us. It's we know it's already, if not the best, it's certainly top quartile working capital, top quartile inventory turns and our return on invested capital last year was almost 24% for the company. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Cash flow. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Cash flow return on invested capital was 24%. I mean, so let's grow the company and let's grow margins. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, no, that's great. I just wanted to make sure that you've had tremendous traction in this area, I just want to see that the pedal is still pushed down, that's all. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : It will never let up. I promise you, as long as I'm breathing, it will never let up. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Excellent. All right, thanks. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for any closing comments. Zac Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call and thank you for your interest in Ingersoll-Rand. As always, we'll be available in the coming days and weeks to take any questions that you may have. So, feel free to give us a call and we'll also be on the road quite a bit this year, so we look forward to meeting you in person. Thank you, and have a great day.

Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Zac, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2017 is on track with a strong first quarter. Our results mark another quarter of proven top-tier financial and operational performance, and are indicative of successful execution of our strategy powered by our business operating system. Our principal approach and the values inheriting our culture have created a unique and lasting commitment to continuous improvement and focus on our customers. That focus and winning culture translates into the sustainable business results we expect for 2017, and I thank our people around the world for their dedication. While it's still early in the year, our first quarter performance gives us confidence in raising the low end of our earnings per share guidance range by $0.05, from $4.30 to $4.50 to $4.35 to $4.50. Our free cash flow guidance continues to be 100% of net income, or approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017. And as we indicated in our fourth quarter call, in January of this year we'll be sharing more color on our strategy and longer-term targets out to the year 2020 at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day in Davidson, North Carolina, on May 10. I know many of you will be able to join us at the event or via the webcast, and we look forward to doing a deeper dive on our business at that time. I'll start this morning with discussing our business strategy and how that enables us to deliver top-tier performance for our shareholders, our customers and employees over the long term. We'll also give some color on our outlook for our key markets in 2017, which is largely unchanged from the comments we provided on our Q4 2016 earnings call. Sue we'll discuss our first quarter performance in more detail and address some topics we know are on the minds of investors before we take your questions. Our strong first quarter performance underscores that our strategy continues to deliver results. We continue to deliver profitable growth through leadership positions in growing markets, that are durable because they address a global imperative to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, industrial processes, and transportation. Sustainability is central to our strategy, and we think of that as a lens on the business to identify opportunities to help our customers manage their sustainability impact. Our strategic focus of served us well in the first quarter. We followed our business operating system to capture growth, improve costs, and drive productivity to deliver adjusted continuing EPS of $0.57 and 4% organic revenue growth. We also expanded adjusted operating margins 20 basis points. Free cash flow was a negative $73 million, but consistent with our expectations given the normal seasonality for the quarter. Additionally, we paid $103 million on dividends and spent $417 million on share repurchases year-to-date. Growth was led by North American commercial and residential HVAC. The teams here are doing a terrific job of share gain and margin expansion, and we anticipate this momentum to continue through 2017. The residential business had record quarter one revenue and margin performance, combined with market share gains. Looking elsewhere geographically, we also had strong HVAC performance in China. Year-over-year organic revenue growth improved more than 20%. Our industrial businesses continue to maintain focus on delivering improved operating margins through increasing the service mix, new product development, and cost reductions. Our compression technologies business, for example, realized the highest mix of services to equipment in its history, with quarter one record revenue and bookings for global service agreements. Moving now to slide 4, I wanted to spend a few minutes providing some color on how we're thinking about our key end markets and businesses on an organic growth basis. So far 2017 is shaping up largely as we expected. The North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC businesses showed strong growth in the first quarter, and is expected to continue in 2017, driven by all areas of the business, including applied, ducted and ductless unitary, and residential equipment and building controls and services. Our focus on sustainability is a growth driver here, and our robust new product pipeline to provide highly efficient systems and expand our offerings for HVAC systems with next-generation refrigerants, for example, is having an impact on the business globally. It's allowing us to take share in regions like the Middle East, where we have district cooling opportunities, and in Europe, where we can offer customers products and services ahead of regulatory deadlines. For Ingersoll-Rand we continue to forecast mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, and mid-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially a North American business for us. Global industrial markets are generally improving, and we saw that in quarter one. We've seen more positive signs in our general industrial markets in the U.S. and the Eurozone as PMIs have improved. We've also generally seen order improvement across our industrial business. We have had year-on-year growth in orders in our compression technologies business for the past four consecutive months, which is encouraging. We continue to plan for a modest rise in industrial production and a gradual recovery with bumps along the way. The large engineered compressor market is expected to show signs of improvement due to stabilizing activity in energy markets and heavy industry, and we saw some positive signs of this in the first quarter. We still see year-over-year orders rising in 2017. Even with this, though, we're still planning for revenue to decline due to the depressed 2016 order levels and the average lead time of 12 to 18 months for this type of product. Excluding these longer-lead-time products, we expect our industrial segment to be flat to slightly up. We continue to expect the transport markets in the Americas to be down from lower volume for trailers and auxiliary power units, partially offset by truck volumes. Transport in Europe is expected to be up modestly, primarily based on truck and trailer sales. We expect continued growth in Asia Pacific on its relatively smaller base. Given the work we've done building out the transport business into a more diversified and durable business, we expect to mitigate the impact from North American trailer declines, and for revenues to be down low single digits. Golf markets are expected to be flat, and we expect to see some growth in our consumer and utility vehicle markets. The recently launched personal transportation vehicle I mentioned last quarter continues to perform well. Overall we expect club car to be up low single digits. And for those attending our upcoming Investor Day, you'll get a chance to experience one firsthand. I'd now like to turn the call over to Sue to discuss the first quarter in more detail. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number 5. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points I'd like you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we've started 2017 on a strong note, with continued strong bookings growth, organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin improvement, adjusted earnings per share growth, and free cash flow in line with our expectations. Our results are on track at this stage in the year, with continued strong bookings growth, and we're therefore adjusting our full-year earnings per share guidance up $0.05 at the bottom end of the range, as Mike discussed earlier. We have a detailed breakout of our guidance for your review in a few slides. Our bookings and revenue performance were both strong, with growth in both segments. Commercial and residential HVAC led the way, both with high single-digit growth in bookings and revenues. Adjusted operating margins also expanded in both businesses. We were pleased with our industrial business performance, which is demonstrating steady adjusted operating margin improvement. We continued to take additional actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service offerings, and took additional cost reduction actions to improve operating results going forward. We also drove strong organic bookings growth in the quarter on both equipment and services, which was encouraging. Earlier in the year we identified our dynamic capital allocation priorities for 2017, including spending $1.5 billion on a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions, and approximately another $415 million on dividends. Year to date, we can report we've spent $417 million on share buybacks and $103 million in dividends. We also made one modest-sized acquisition. We are continuing to follow the capital deployment plan we announced in January. Please go to slide 6. Our focus on execution of our strategy and operational excellence drove solid year-over-year performance. Net revenues were up 4% organically, and adjusted operating margins improved 20 basis points. Strength in revenue performance was driven by our Climate segment, while operating margin improvement was broad-based across our Climate and our Industrial segments. Please go to slide 7. Organic orders were strong in the first quarter, up 7% with strong results in both our HVAC and industrial businesses. Climate booking strength was broad-based with growth across the globe and up 6% overall. Organic commercial HVAC bookings were up low teens in equipment, with strong results from both unitary and applied products. Residential bookings again showed strong growth, up high single digits, and continued share gain. We also drove good growth in parts, service, and controls, which is helping us to build a more sustainable business by increasing our income from recurring income streams. Transport organic bookings were down low single digits, primarily driven by the expected decline in North America refrigerated trailers. Our diversification strategy enabled us to partially offset the decline in trailers through growth in truck and international bookings in the quarter. The Industrial businesses bookings were up 9% organically in the quarter, led by strength in compression technologies and small electric vehicles. In compression technologies, we saw solid growth in both the long-lead engineered-to-order business, which were coming off a weak first quarter of 2016, as well as in our small to midsize shorter-cycle products. In electric vehicles, we are seeing good growth in our new consumer vehicle, Onward. Please go to slide number 8. In our Climate segment, organic revenue was up high single digits in North America and Asia, and up mid-single digits in Latin America. Climate organic revenues were down marginally in Europe and down high single digits in the Middle East off a small base. In our Industrial segment, overall organic performance was up slightly. Modest declines in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa were offset by improvements in Latin America and Asia. Overall North America revenues were up mid-single digits, and international revenues were up low single digits, netting a positive 4% organic revenue growth rate for the enterprise. Please go to slide number 9. Q1 adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points, primarily driven by strong volume and productivity, partially offset by material and other inflation. We continued to make significant investments in business innovation and operational excellence to further improve our competitive positioning. Please go to slide number 10. Overall Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 6% and adjusted operating margins up 70 basis points to 10.6%. Strong revenue growth in both commercial and residential HVAC was partially offset by transport revenues, which were down mid-single digits in the quarter, primarily due to softening North America trailer and auxiliary power unit markets, partially offset by growth in aftermarket and in Asia. Climate adjusted operating margins expanded 70 basis points year over year, driven by strong execution across the Climate businesses. The impact of higher volumes, productivity, and price far exceeded headwinds from material inflation, ongoing business investments, and other inflation. Please go to slide number 11. Our commercial focus on aftermarket, operational excellence initiatives, and cost-cutting measures continued to drive operating margin improvement in Industrial in the first quarter. Industrial adjusted margins increased 60 basis points on slightly higher organic revenues. Aftermarket growth was solid, more than offsetting modest declines in compressor equipment. Adjusted operating income and depreciation and amortization was higher by 100 basis points. Please go to slide number 12. Free cash flow was negative in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and normal seasonality. Our guidance for free cash flow remains unchanged from the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range we provided in January. Additionally, our balance sheet remains strong and gives us optionality as our markets continue to evolve. Please go to slide number 13. Our expected 2017 cash flow continues to enable us to drive a dynamic capital allocation strategy, employing capital where it earns the best returns. In our 2017 guidance, we highlighted our capital allocation priorities. The first was investing in our business as our number one priority. These include investments in innovation and in strategic growth programs. As I moved through the earlier slides I discussed investment in the business multiple times, as it's at the heart of our innovation, growth, and margin expansion story. The secondary is maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're BBB rated today, and believe this is the appropriate structure for the company. The third area is our commitment to paying a competitive dividend. We've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised this dividend over time. In fact, the compound annual growth rate of our dividend is 20% over the last five years. The fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases, and not necessarily in that order. In 2017 we committed to spend $1.5 billion between these two areas, and year-to-date we've spent $417 million on share repurchases and a modest incremental amount on a key strategic acquisition in the Climate space. We intend to spend the balance of the $1.5 billion during the remainder of 2017. We will continue to create long term value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy, as we have consistently done for years. Please go to slide 15. As discussed earlier, while it's still early in the year, our first quarter performance gives us confidence in raising the low end of our earnings per share guidance by $0.05. We have largely maintained the other elements for our guidance for the year, so the next few charts will be similar compared to the ones we covered in January. The main thing I'd like to point out on slide number 15 is that our operating margin guidance targets have gone up somewhat, to reflect the new pension accounting treatment that moves a portion of the cost from the operating line to the other income and expense line below operating income. Net adjusted margins rise by about 10 basis points for each segment, and 20 basis points across the enterprise. We've provided current and restated numbers in our news release tables that outline the impact of the change in more detail. The difference between our organic and reported revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of negative foreign exchange from a strengthening U.S. dollar outlook. We continue to expect Climate revenue to be up approximately 4% organically, and for Industrial revenue to be down approximately 1% organically, which is consistent with our prior guidance. Please go to slide number 16. We've raised the low end of our continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2017 to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.50, excluding about $0.15 of restructuring. We had a large planned restructuring charge of $0.10 in the first quarter related to the consolidation of three plants to further optimize our footprint. We have a number of actions we forecast taking for the balance of the year, but we think approximately $0.15 for the year is still our best estimate at this time. Please go to slide number 17. There are two FASB accounting changes we adopted January 1, 2017, and want to make you aware of them. First, we were required to adapt accounting standard update 2016-09 in the first quarter. The primary change is to recognize in the P&L any tax windfall or shortfall from stock option exercises and stock vesting, where previous recognition was deferred to the balance sheet. Our planned adoption of the new accounting standard was built into the 2017 guidance we provided in January, and increases the effective tax rate volatility versus the prior accounting. In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized a non-cash tax windfall of approximately $15 million, which is reflected as a benefit to our tax expense and effective tax rate. Our full-year effective rate guidance of 21% to 22% includes the $15 million benefit recognized in the first quarter, and anticipates a much smaller benefit to be earned in the rest of the year. Excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized in December 2016 were also $15 million. This amount was reclassified to retained earnings as of January 1, 2017, with no impact to the P&L per the new standard. The second accounting change is related to pension and postretirement benefits. The new standard, ASU 2017-07, impacts where certain components of pension and postretirement benefit expense is recorded in the income statement. However, there's no change to net earnings or earnings per share. Under the new accounting standard, the traditionally more volatile components of benefit expense are now reported in other income and expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets, and amortization of deferred amounts. Service costs remain in operating income, as it represents the services rendered in the current period by participants of these plans. We adopted this accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017, and re-classed approximately $8 million to other income and expense in the first quarter. 2016 amounts have been revised for comparability and were approximately the same amount in Q1 of 2016. Our 2017 estimate of expenses to be re-classed from operating income to other income and expense is $26 million. Please go to slide number 18. Our Q1 spend for planned restructuring was approximately $33 million, related to consolidating three manufacturing plants and distributing their products to other facilities in the same region. Facilities were in both our Climate and Industrial segments. The actions further our region-of-use philosophy to localize manufacturing and the supply chain to help us achieve greater speed to market and implement local product preferences. We expect to spend approximately $0.15 per share for total restructuring expense for full-year 2017. Our corporate costs of $68 million for Q1 were generally consistent with our initial forecasts for the quarter, and were higher than last year due to planned incubator investments in technologies that benefit all businesses. These investments are heavier in the first half of the year versus the second half. We also had an increase in other employee benefits and stock-based compensation timing. We continue to expect full-year corporate spend to total $240 million for the year. Please go to slide number 20. As we've done for the last couple of quarters, I'll comment on a few topics that we know are of the interest to you before we open it up for questions. I'll first touch on currency as a headwind for us in 2017. About 35% or $4.8 billion of our revenues are outside the U.S. Our 2017 forecast has built in the continuing strength in the U.S. dollar, which will impact us most notably in the euro and the Asian currencies. Overall, we continue to expect a 1% drag on our revenues from currency translation, which will have about a $0.10 negative impact on our earnings per share. We also know price and material inflation is top of mind. Price was positive for us in the first quarter in both segments. Material inflation offset positive price, driven by steel and Tier 2 components. We have 10 basis points positive price covering material inflation in our guidance. We've been through various cycles and have a strong history of capturing price to material inflation. For 2017, we expect a negative first half price-to-material-inflation gap, and expect to recover in the second half. Please go to slide 21. Covering our transport business, we are on track with expectations. For 2017 overall, we continue to expect Thermo King revenues to be down low single digits year-over-year. The North America trailer industry is expected to be down. We're also expecting a continuation for relatively soft market for auxiliary power units and marine containers. Those declines will be partially offset by gains in Europe, Asia, and aftermarket revenues. Through restructuring and efficiency, we would expect only a minor erosion of record 2016 operating margins. And finally, I know we'll receive questions on the status of Industrial. Industrial drove strong first quarter organic bookings, up 9%, and organic revenue growth was a result of significant aftermarket growth in the compression technologies business and continued growth of Club Car. Looking at a regional perspective, organic revenue growth in Asia and Latin America was partially offset by declines in North America and Europe, Middle East, and Africa. As we indicated earlier, we expect the industrial markets to stabilize in 2017, although we cannot declare definitive turning point yet on large equipment. Excluding large compressors, we expect Industrial to be flat to slightly up, and we do expect to realize margin expansion through our operational excellence initiatives, ongoing cost reductions, restructuring actions, and new product launches. And now I'll turn it over to Mike for closing remarks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Sue. So in closing, on slide 22, we are executing on a 2017 plan and building a thriving, more valuable Ingersoll-Rand. I began today's call talking about our principled approach, the values inherent in our culture, and how that translates to sustainability of our business. I'm proud of our employees who delivered a strong Quarter One performance. I'm proud that we tackle challenging customer problems, and we solve them. We take on tough issues and applied some of the best minds in the industry to solve them. Within our company, we have some the most impressive emissions reductions and efficiency stories in the world. That's what we excel at. Looking ahead our strategy is unchanged. We will maximize growth through innovation and channel expansion, continue our focus on productivity and costs, deliver strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. Our commercial and residential HVAC businesses are strong and focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our transport refrigeration business is diverse and agile, and will execute their strategy as they typically do. Our Industrial businesses are focused on market share and margin expansion as markets stabilize. And our culture remains as strong as ever. As a result, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver a top-tier financial and operating performance. And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Hi, good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Hey. Just my first question would be, again, on that point that Sue just touched on around the Industrial business. So should we think about the long-lead-time business being about $200 million of sales, probably down high single digits this year? Is that about the right scale of the piece within Industrial that's offsetting everything else? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Julian. It's Sue. I think that's right, It's a little heavier than $200 million, but not significantly. So \u2013 and I think what you have to think about there, and I know you are, is that bookings in that area last year was really the largest point of decline in, especially, the compression technologies business. So we saw some positive bookings in the first quarter, but those are going to translate into 2018. But you've got the right order of magnitude. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Thank you. And then just my second question would be around the transport market. When we're thinking about bookings here over the balance of the year, they were down, as you said, in the first quarter, up a little bit in the fourth. Should we expect bookings, or are you expecting bookings to grow in that segment overall at any point in this year, and if you could just remind us of the lead time in Thermo King from bookings to billings? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So let me start out with the bookings and the expectations. So we talked about in Q1 that the bookings were down slightly. One of the things that I'd like to point out in that area is they were actually down about 1% year over year, which translates to about $6 million. So we knew that we were going to see the North America trailer markets down, we knew that we were going to have some strength in Europe in the truck markets. We also saw some strength in North America on truck, with the marine business being down. So there's a little bit of a mixture there, but we do still see that the biggest market that, I guess from a focus standpoint on North America trailer, is that that's going to be down for the year. We're a little bit more conservative than ACT with their 44,000 units, but we are calling that down. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Thanks. And then just the lead time of bookings to billings? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Julian, the timing there is typically going to be dependent on the customer, and what we're going to get there is sort of an indication of the order quantity for the year, and they're going to take those sort of as they would see their fleets needing to be replenished. So that varies. Varies dramatically. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That was sneaky. Rob McCarthy here. How are you doing? I guess the question I have is with respect to the performance across commercial HVAC and residential HVAC. Could you just cite areas of where you're taking outsized share? I mean obviously the narrative has been of structural share restoration or share gain over the past several years, but could you just give us some principal examples, because I think you called it out in your results? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I think it's broad-based again. I mean we looked at North American equipment bookings, up roughly 20%, we're seeing applied North America up in the mid-20s, successful in the Middle East in terms of bookings. China was up significantly, 20-ish percent in the quarter as well. Controls continue to \u2013 we're doing well with the controls business and services business, so really across the board, Robert, we're having success there. Anything specific you'd want to know more than that, feel free to follow up on it. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Then I just, could you talk about kind of your expectations for kind of incremental margin lift this year, and conceptually going forward, in terms of maybe puts and takes around incremental compensation expense, or any other items we should be thinking about as we think about margin conversion here? Because we're coming out of a shoulder quarter and we're kind of going into the back half, or the prime season, at least on the Climate side. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I'll start and let Sue finish. But if you look at, from operation's leverage around 25% of the business coming off last year's really sporty price-to-material-deflation mix, it was really good performance in the quarter there. We think good performance over the long run is leveraging incrementals at the gross margin of the business, and we would expect things to be in that 25% to 35% range, and have no difference in expectation this year. Of course, Industrial will leverage at a much, much higher rate, and you saw that in the quarter where we had a slight decline in sales, we had an increase in operating income in that business, and that'll continue to be an outsized leverage there. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The third and final question is basically \u2013 I hate to ask a banker question, but I'll ask the question nonetheless \u2013 I mean, you've executed very well, you've had strong growth on EPS revisions, but you do have this mix between Climate and Industrial. Maybe, Mike, you could talk about the commonality of why you can run the assets together? Because in this environment of conglomerates and deconglomeratization, an argument could be made you could sell or spin this entity into strength. And some of your peers have looked or actually done this. And it might be a value creation event, particularly given with respect to what pure-play Climate companies are trading at right now. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Rob, we'll cover that, really, I think in more detail, there'll be more time in May, first of all. So I don't want to absorb too much time on that. And clearly we believe that what we're seeing today through the operational integration, this is both the technologies that we would have, the networks of excellence that we would have around engineering across the business, the purchasing power we have, and even in the plant consolidation, some of which we did in the quarter, consolidating more of these plants together in larger scale, all lead to a pretty big dyssynergy number pulling it apart. But also the cash flow cyclicality inherent between the two businesses, and there's a bit of a negative correlation between Industrial and Climate, historically for us anyway, and I think that that is something that has bode well for the ability to continue to have strong cash flow, to allocate that toward investment in the business which is out of cycle, which you even saw I think today, we announced we've now launched that large rotary refresh of the oil-flooded air compressor business. That was the project that, I don't know, five quarters ago we talked about pulling forward into 2015 versus 2016 to accelerate it, because we had such good success with the small air compressor using the same technology. So that sort of thing wouldn't have happened, I think, in this cycle. And that again, if you flip it around and look back in the 2010-2013 timeframe, all the success in Industrial at the time fueled what you're seeing in the Trane business. So I think we look at that all the time, we try to understand some of the parts of the portfolio. When we apply a range of dyssynergies against that, it's not a value-creating idea. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Nigel. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I've got a few, I guess, modeling questions, probably for Sue here. So just thinking about, you mentioned no significant debt matures until 2018, and you've got a pretty big one, $750 million, at high cost, 6.75% and you could refi that at much, much low interest rates today. So I'm just wondering how you're approaching that maturity? Are you looking to refi early? And what kind of rate do you think you could refi for, because it looks like 6.75% could become 2%, so that's a significant savings. Any comments there would be helpful. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, so the maturity is August of 2018, and we're continually evaluating that, And I'll tell you what I'm balancing on that interest of rate 6.75% versus what we could get today, and I don't know if 2% is the right number, but let's assume that it's much lower than the 6.75% is. What's the right timing, in terms of the breakage of costs that go along with that? So in other words, if I want to refi now and do that, there is going to be a cost associated with that. And while I could easily disclose that to you, I sort of have a bias towards protecting shareholder value and saying, I'm not going to do that unless there is a really good reason to do that. So what drives a really good reason would be, is if I thought the rates were going to change dramatically, or I get more within the window. So continuously thinking about it, Nigel, but so far we haven't pulled the trigger on that, and we'll continue to look at it. But you're right, it would be lower interest than the 6.75%. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Nigel, last time we - Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : \u2013 looked at that was really not long ago, really weeks ago. We were upside down some $10 million in that equation, a couple, $0.03 a share. And the only argument you could make would be do you do it early and protect the deductibility of interest, on a scenario that you're guessing at around taxes. So really guessing at that scenario for $10 million didn't make any sense, but I want to give you some color, because you need to know we're looking at that all the time, and we wouldn't leave an opportunity on the table like that. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. And I would say it's a big \u2013 it's a big number. And then I guess, going even deeper, train, you \u2013 obviously you called out in the slides the impact of D&A on margins, and the train amortization starts to roll, I believe, in mid-2018. So I'm just wondering, is that about $100 million of intangibles that go away in mid-2018? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So, actually what is sitting there in 2017 in terms of the train amortization is about $105 million, which is about what you said. That actually does not start to roll off, Nigel, until like 2023. So it isn't going to start rolling off in 2018, it's going to be roughly the same $100 million. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So it's 15 years, not 10 years, I've got it. And then just quickly on the restructuring, makes sense to do the consolidation. I assume this is in the Industrial segment, I'm just wondering what sort of payback are you assuming? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, actually Nigel, it's across \u2013 it was three different sorts of ideas. One was taking a residential light unitary North American factory, and then putting that into four factories with open capacity. And so one of the things I think is a product of good productivity for a lot of years is opening pre-capacity in another location. So one piece of that would have gone to the HVAC side of the business. The second one was to the Industrial business and consolidating two plants in-country in Europe. And then the third was a plant in Europe which is going to be a multi-segment plant in Europe, and so we really hit all three. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And the payback, it's like two-, three-year paybacks on this? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : You've got \u2013 sort of GAAP under four years and cash under 2.5. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Steve. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for all the detail on the \u2013 in the presentation. Very helpful. Just a question around, I know you guys aren't giving quarterly guidance anymore, but you had said previously that 45%-ish of the year was going to be in the first half. Is that kind of still the right number? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Steve, I just won lunch, okay? So \u2013 and I'm not going to do any calculus or algebra on this one for you at all. I want to really stick to the guidance, we gave managing within that, and let you guys - Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So then I'll do the \u2013 so then I'll do the calculus. If you do 45% of the high end of the range, and you take the $0.57 you did in the first quarter, that's getting you somewhere in the range of a $1.45, which is about a 4% increase over the second quarter of last year. I guess I'll ask it this way, is there \u2013 I know there's the tax benefit this quarter, which is helpful, there's some other stuff. Is there anything else that you want to call out, year-over-year, that would unusually kind of depress that rate of growth? I mean, I would think that that $1.45, maybe that's a good number, it's still above the consensus. So just curious if there is anything on \u2013 from a comp perspective, because you obviously here this quarter absorbed a pretty decent hit from price-cost and some investments, but again the tax rate was favorable. So just curious as to, if there's anything you want to call out to make sure you kind of calibrate people on the moving parts, without doing algebra? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. To sort of maybe re-characterize the question in the way that I want to answer it, I would tell you that the way \u2013 the reason in which we took up the low end of the range was just confidence we had in the bookings, and really eliminating the risk on the low end of the range, and feeling like we had a stronger backlog going in. When you look at that mid-20s applied bookings that we had in Q1, look at the large plant there in process and Industrial bookings, which would have been mid-teens growth year-over-year, the Climate is probably six to nine months. It's interesting because that's based on the availability of the customer to have the project ready for it. We build chillers now in a day. We used to have chiller lead times of 10 weeks; we now could do that in 10 days. Give customers 10-day lead time from order to delivery. But if you go to a large plant there on process side, same thing, 12 months to 18 months. So those are largely pushing out to 18 months, but with that being said, some of the bookings will fall into the back half of the year and give us an opportunity to raise to the low end of the range. You had also asked a little bit about price and material cost, and I'll let Sue kind of give you some color on that. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. So I think, Steve, that would be one of the other areas that I would watch in the second quarter. So our material inflation in 2017 is coming primarily from steel and from Tier 2 commodities. As we go throughout the year, we've talked about the first half is going to be a tough compare to last year, where we had a very positive spread between price and material inflation. On the material side itself, there's been some volatility, really post-election, in both steel, which will start to show up in the second quarter, as well as aluminum. And aluminum has a bigger impact on our residential business than what some people might think, we actually use \u2013 I'll give you a first quarter kind of antidote, where we used about 15 times as much aluminum as we did copper in the residential business in the first quarter. So we're more impacted by that. Having said all of that, we intend to be price positive throughout the year. We're watching the commodities, and we're also really, really focused on productivity and really offsetting any costs that we have. So monitoring all of the different pieces, but I'd really watch on materials. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. And maybe, Sue, just a bit more color on that even. You look at the fact that we are getting positive price across the board. That's a good sign. Again, it's the steel, the Tier 2 components, the aluminum of which Sue said we buy 15 :1 pounds of aluminum to copper in our res business, for example. You get to quarter two, the spread's 120 basis points. We would still expect positive price and the same sorts of material inflation that we're seeing. Then you get out to the back end of the year, and it literally might take to the back end of the year to kind of flip that into that 10-basis-point positive there. But I do believe we've got the strategies to do that. We've also got some excellent value engineering ideas going on right now, testing out \u2013 we finalized this summer where we would both be able to change some of the alloys and be able to change some of the gauge thickness of the materials we're using. If those test out positively, then that's going to allow us to abate some of that material inflation toward the back end of the year. So we're working it and feel pretty good about getting there at the end of the year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Wait, what's the 120 basis points? Sorry, just a quick follow-up on that. You did 50 bps headwind this quarter. What is the 120 basis points again? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I think Q2 last year, we were 120 basis points positive - Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Positive. Tough comp. Got it, go it. Positive. Okay. All right. Great. Thanks a lot guys, I appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Your line is open. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Scott. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So Steve's question is a good one. I \u2013 if you're 120 basis points positive last year, and now it's 50 basis points off of that 120 basis points, so it's still 70 basis points positive, is that how I should read it? Or are we actually 50 basis points negative? Or am I just dumb, which might be the other option? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Scott, I appreciate the question. It's a headwind. I mean, we had to overcome a significant headwind in comps, and that's the point we're making. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, it's headwind in comps, okay, I get it. So you're not actually negative price cost and \u2013 explicitly, it's just a comp, okay. I did see you were out there with a fair number of price increases on January 1, at least in the resi businesses. Were you able to realize those on January 1, or was it just not enough, or not fast enough to offset materials as they continue to move? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Remember, Scott, the vast majority of our company doesn't operate on a price list, or a pricing. It's really the res business, some parts of light commercial, tools business to some extent; it starts to fall down pretty quick after that. Everything else is really putting a system together, a project together. And so you're really pricing more or less in real time with a customer on an order, and that's how we look at it. So, yes, we had price increases where we compete in markets where that's the norm. Where it's not the norm, that's where we've been working this whole top line margin expansion, pricing work over time to make sure we understand how to price out into the future, when we expect deliveries, and try to get on top of that. Of course, as you get to these large long-lead items, you're dealing with the fact that you're trying to price out and guess 9 months to 18 months out into the future. And in some cases, what's happened hasn't been so much demand related from a commodity perspective, but in the case of aluminum for example, it's very speculative in nature as to what's going on; it's more difficult to predict. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Okay. That's - Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : But now that \u2013 we get there at the end of the year I believe, and are marginally positive on price versus material cost, with price been actually quite positive. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Again, I totally get it. Your comps are tough, so. Can you guys just - Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Scott, if I can just inject for just a second. On the \u2013 on the second quarter, I still expect for us to be upside down on the price-cost equation. So, there is a very tough comparison to the price-cost spread from the second quarter of last year. But I do expect second quarter to look somewhat like the first quarter of this year, price positive, but still seeing a negative spread between price and material inflation. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. I totally get it. It just took me a while. Can you guys remind us what Thermocold is, I just don't \u2013 I'm not familiar with that asset? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Thermocold is a \u2013 it's a ductless variable water flow product that we worked with this company over time to kind of help develop it, get it into market. Got to a point where it was getting very interesting for us, so we acquired the business this quarter. Actually, bookings have doubled in the quarter since we've owned it. So, it's an early success around that. But what happens with some of the variable refrigerant flow systems is you're pushing refrigerant around buildings, and many building codes don't allow either a flammable or a high concentration refrigerant circulate in the building. Just for context, a VRF system might have twice the refrigerant charge than conventional system, and then you're pushing that at higher pressures, and you're pushing it through buildings where it's not pushed today. So in some places, the preference for when people want to go ductless is to have variable water flow versus refrigerant. So we're looking to really make sure that we've got a product for every application, and what we do is we apply products and systems to situations, and we do that through our channel, and that's why it's important for us to have all products for all applications. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Joe. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, I guess my first question is really on \u2013 sticking with industrial. It seems like your aftermarket business probably drove a lot of the kind of improvement. So maybe just help us understand a little bit the progress that you've made to drive aftermarket, and then what growth looks like, aftermarket versus equipment, going forward? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Compression technology specifically, and Club Car, would be the two parts of Industrial I'd call out to be the strongest. And when you look at what we can control in the compression technology business, if we can't control CapEx of large equipment, which was evident to us a year-plus ago, the move that we could make was to spend more time in the channel around the mix, pushing to service. And Todd and that team have done just an outstanding job of putting what I would consider to be the operational excellence discipline into the sales management and sales functions. And so the amount of connectivity that we have between customers and service, the share of wallet we have with those customers, has increased. And just sort of the whole pace and rigor around the sale management process has increased. So I couldn't be any happier with how they're kind of bringing that to the market. And then in Industrial, what you've seen here is Club Car with mid-teens bookings, and that's led by everything outside of golf, frankly. Golf is a business where globally we've got roughly 50% market share, so all the growth opportunities that sit in that small electric vehicle market spit out in utility and in personal transportation vehicles, low-speed vehicles, at the consumer level. And we're seeing good growth there. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And, Mike, maybe, if you can just touch on ex Club Car, regionally, your developed markets, both North America and Europe down. A lot of the reads we've seen just across the industrial landscape have been really good this quarter. And so maybe talk a little bit about the kind of regional disconnect that you're seeing in North America/Europe versus what you're seeing across other areas of the world. Because clearly, you've got better growth outside of the developed market landscape today. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I mean, again, I think when you see larger compressors come back into the mature economies, you're going to see great growth in leverage, and even without a high degree of revenue you saw good leverage in this quarter. But you got the China, which I consider to be a mature market, and here you saw really excellent kind of high single-digit, almost double-digit growth there in our compression technologies business. So China is an example where we really did see some strength and recovery. And it's supported not just by the reported GDP, but around energy use in the economy, and by some of the usage of commodities like steel in the market would tell us that. You're seeing something that appears to be a turning point in China, and hopefully it'll last. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So through April you spent $417 million in repurchases. Obviously you've ramped up repurchases, especially in April. You do seem committed to your $1.5 billion target. But can you talk about the probability of doing M&A versus repurchases? Are valuations higher to the point where the chance of doing bigger M&A are lower, or do you still see significant opportunity in your pipeline? And at what point in the year do you actually step up repurchases if M&A is little harder to come by, and is that happening now? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I have to start with \u2013 from the beginning, which says that the strategic plans that we put together in the company, would have isolated some ideas around targets that we want to go after, and that list of targets would have yielded some specific targets that we would have put on our list, whether they're actionable or not. And you could say, well, everything's actionable at any given price, but the reality is it's not actionable within the financial guidelines that we've put in place about what we think a good acquisition looks like. So when you start with that, you say to yourself from there, at any one given point in time in the pipeline, what do we feel is both actionable and actionable at a level financially that we think would be attractive to us? If I snapped the line today \u2013 and I want to be very careful about this, because it could change next week and it would have been different last week \u2013 but if I snapped a line today, I would say that there's between $300 million and $500 million of actionable M&A that meets our financial constraints and hurdles across the company. So that doesn't mean that it won't change next week. It wouldn't preclude doing much larger deals, if they fit the strategic plans that we put in place and the target lists that were in place at the time. So that's what we are today. And if you ask me next quarter, I'll snap a line for you and tell you where we are, I suppose. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Mike, that's very helpful. And then just shifting gears, can you talk about your commercial HVAC markets in EMEA and Asia? You mentioned last quarter your 2017 outlook was relatively flattish, but you did see strong 4Q Asian orders. You said they were lumpy last quarter, but you've continued to see good order growth in both markets really, and you did raise your forecasted debt for Asian HVAC. EMEA orders did (55:24) look like they accelerated a bit in the quarter. So can you see some upside on the Asian HVAC as we go through the year? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, the Middle East really accelerated for us, and was kind of a mid-teens bookings growth in the Middle East for us, so very different than what we're seeing in Europe. And in Europe, we're not bearish on Europe. We just think it's going to be sort of a flattish market, but the Middle East, we would think to be up for the year for us. And I think that's not the market, I think that we're doing some good things in the market, particularly around some of the district cooling plants and the newer refrigerants that we've launched into the market. China was also just a good story for us. And again, it's really a quarter at this point, and I'm not going to say that we expect that to continue through the balance of the year, but clearly the market in China specifically, I don't think was above 20% in the quarter, but we had strong bookings growth in the quarter. Again, a lot of new product introduction, more depth in the channel, and I think just solid execution across the board there. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You said the Middle East market, it was more you than the market. Did it stabilize, though, and that allowed you to outperform well in the quarter? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I would say \u2013 I was there just a month ago. At least where I was, okay, but specifically Dubai would be a point I would raise. I would tell you that it was booming, and really no signs of slowing down there. Obviously as you get outside of Dubai, you're going to reach different dynamics, but we would have seen our team there sort of feeling good about what they're able to bring into the market with new products and services, controls, performance contracting, and the capability of the team becoming I think stronger there, to the point where we can do more work outside of equipment. That's helping us to grow the market. We've got a joint venture we're starting there as well, soon. I think that will help us develop in the market further, so again I didn't see a terribly depressed situation in the marketplace, but I felt good leaving that trip, understanding what our growth plans were and feeling good about our ability to get growth where it's maybe flattish today, or down. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, Mike, I'd love to hear your comments about the build ahead of the cooling season, how does the inventory in the channel stand today, and maybe your sense about customer bias towards replacing versus fixing their units, just given sentiment today? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Deane, really detail about sort of the inventories, there is nothing unusual about inventories in the channel, I know some of the folks that are sort of more res-based and maybe singly focused on HVAC are looking at where they are in days' sales and so on and so forth, but honestly, we're not seeing anything unusual. Here we're seeing good strong markets, we're seeing the replacement market strong, we're seeing the new construction markets strong. In the couple of areas that we're really looking to penetrate, which should be areas like new construction or areas like owner-non-occupied, are markets that are really growing for us, and we focused the channel, we focused our work in those markets. So I think it's shaping up to be another strong, solid year for the res markets, and clearly we're doing well in those markets. And it's also you're seeing the nice market-share growth and margin expansion, it's not as if we're in there buying share at all. It's really a well strong \u2013 well-functioning business, strong management team executing well on its plan. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's real helpful. Can you just provide some color on where you think you're gaining share in the resi market, in particular product lines, or just where you think that that growth is coming? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Deane, we're in the last three years of about a 100% revitalizing. So there's nothing in the market that we've had in the market for very long. So, we're \u2013 who we're taking share from, we speculate internally, but I certainly wouldn't want to put a public proclamation around that hypothesis. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Of course. And looking forward to the Analyst Day. Thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey, thank you, good morning. Just a couple loose ends I guess here. Mike, what are you seeing, if anything, on the competitive response to your share gains? I think a lot of it goes to your \u2013 to the point you just made about you're winning on product. But is anyone else coming back on you on price, do you see anyone kind of acting out of line? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : We work in an industry with a handful of large players. It's probably going to consolidate over time. And we certainly don't discount any of our competitors' capabilities in these areas. It's a strategy, Jeff, that we've had for a long time about how we wanted to win, where to play; the product growth teams are very additive to what we are doing, and try to isolate opportunities or weaknesses and exploit them. So, yeah, I said the word culture, I don't know, five times on the opening script, and I could tell you that there's something about really embedding that pretty deeply in the organization, that we wake up every day thinking about market share and margin expansion, and we're supporting that with the field, with great service capability, with tremendous amount of investment in innovation and products control, services across the board. So we're just going to run faster, and we've got big strong competitors that are running fast too. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And just kind of a separate thought, we've heard a couple of times this earning season, just maybe some companies of over-restructured some pinch points in the supply chain, with things looking like it's broadly picking up. Is there anything in your supply chain that looks problematic, anything you might have to vertically integrate to kind of contend with such issues, or anything you're monitoring, would just be interesting? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Knock on wood, Jeff, we've had an excellent season. I think every season just gets better and better. And the first thing we do at the end of a season is we debrief every learning we had in the season at a very deep level, on a plant and product basis, and understand sort of what we would have done if we could have hit the replay button, and every year we get better at that. Which is why the profitability of the res business turned the corner in the first quarter, which historically I think forever had been in a loss-making position, is now in a good position in the first quarter with less inventory, high returns, better cycle times, lead times to customers, more product availability. So, we're not seeing anything here that we haven't planned for or thought about at this point, but again, this is not even May, and we've got to go through a few more months here to be confident about that. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I'll now turn the call back to Zac Nagle for any closing remarks. Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I would like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As usual, Joe and I will be available to answer your questions today and in the coming days and weeks. We look forward to seeing many of you are or with you via the webcast at our Investor and Analyst Day on May 10, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Zac, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Our first half results continue our strong track record of performance and position us well for the balance of 2017 and beyond, as we look ahead to the 2018 to 2020 targets that we laid out in May at our Investor Day. First half performance is running ahead of our initial expectations and gives us confidence in raising our full-year revenue guidance to approximately 4.5%, raising our adjusted continuing EPS guidance to approximately $4.50, which is at the high end of our previous range, and maintaining our strong cash flow guidance of free cash flow equal to or greater than 100% of net income. Today I'll start by discussing how focused execution of our strategy is delivering sustainable high levels of performance. I'll also provide comments on how our key end markets are shaping up for 2017. Sue will discuss our second quarter performance in more detail and address some topics we know are on the minds of investors. And I'll then close with a brief summary before we take your questions. Our overall strategy remains straightforward, and we believe our people and culture are a source of competitive advantage. First, our business model is rooted in anticipating and addressing global trends that impact the way we live, work and move. We focus on delivering outstanding products and services in durable growing markets. In our case, it's an orientation toward the importance of sustainability, enabled by technologies growing at exponential rates that will create new business models and sources of productivity in a world that will increasingly value the conservation of resources. We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers. It's what we do and it's what we're known for. We maintain a healthy level investment in our businesses to sustain leading brands, which are number one or number two in virtually every market in which we participate. Second, we excel at delivering strong top-line incremental margins and free cash flow through our business operating system. Our business operating system is continuously improving and underpins everything we do and enables us to constantly generate high levels of free cash flow, which powers our dynamic capital allocation strategy. Our strategy once again served us well in the second quarter. We followed our business operating system to achieve outstanding organic revenue growth of 7% and adjusted continuing EPS of $1.49, an increase of 8%. We also expanded adjusted operating margin 40 basis points and generated $414 million in free cash flow. Our very strong revenue growth gives us great optionality to balance ongoing business investments for the long-term, with meeting or beating our more near-term 2017 financial commitments. The larger categories of business investment include channel, infrastructure and new product development that position us in a way to continually improve our competitive position. In the second quarter, the company delivered strong top-line and bottom-line results. We realize continued strength in the Climate segment, which reported an organic revenue up high-single digits. Residential and North American Commercial HVAC led the company's growth. And as expected, we're also seeing steady and consistent improvement in our Industrial segment, which saw positive revenue growth and delivered strong margin expansion and order growth. This was the second consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth for Industrial, and it was also quarter marked by the launch of several product offerings. Compression Technologies and Services, for example, launched another model in the next-generation R-Series compressor family this quarter, and its variable speed offering is up to 35% more efficient than the industry average. We just recently received external recognition with the Environmental Leader Product Award for advances made in energy efficiency with the next-generation R-Series line of compressors. This is one great example out of the 16 new products we launched in the quarter that demonstrate the kind of innovative, advanced offerings we offer our customers to build on our leadership position for the long run. We enable our customers to be both environmentally responsible and productive at the same time, so customers are no longer obligated to choose one or the other. Moving to slide four. We changed our format a bit from our traditional market view to a mid-year update that provides insights in how we're seeing the markets and our businesses now versus where we saw them when we provided our initial guidance in January. Based on the questions we received leading up to this call, we believe you'll find the approach to be valuable. I'll touch on the primary areas that we've highlighted as areas to watch, so I'm going to keep it focused. It's not intended to be an update on every cut of the business here where we're seeing any element of change. So if we don't hit something here, we'll cover it in the Q&A session. The first topic is volume and revenues, which have been stronger than expected. The North American and China Commercial HVAC and our North American Residential HVAC markets exceeded our initial expectations. Our North American Commercial HVAC Building Services business, for example, achieved record performance in Q2, with its highest revenue recorded and 9% revenue growth. Combined with the market share gains we've enjoyed based on our product and service leadership and sales excellence, all critical components of our business operating system, we're seeing very strong revenue growth. While we see the potential for growth to moderate in the second half of the year, we forecast that we will continue to exceed our initial plan for the year. On an equally-positive note, with Industrial, we're tracking to exceed our annual revenue plan there, too. The next topic is the price-to-material inflation spread. Well before 2017 kicked off, we highlighted that we expected 2017 to be in an inflationary environment, that historically we've been able to achieve a positive price/material inflation spread of about 10 basis points to 20 basis points. As we moved through the first quarter, the environment became increasingly inflationary, but still looked manageable to a 10-basis point positive spread if cost and pricing held steady. As we moved through the second quarter, material cost inflation has continued to persist and it's moved beyond steel and Tier 2 materials to all metals and into refrigerants. Because our volumes have exceeded our expectations, which we're pleased about, we're purchasing a higher percentage of commodities at current prices versus locked prices, resulting in more inflationary headwinds. We did achieve a positive price-to-material inflation spread in our Industrial segment and within our Residential business, as well as in Transport in the second quarter. Our price-to-material inflationary headwind was in our Commercial HVAC business, and mainly this was centered in the Asia, Middle East and Latin American regions. Looking forward, it's important to note that we continue to expect to get positive price as we did in the second quarter. In fact, we expect to realize higher pricing as compared to last year, and we believe this will continue through the balance of the year. However, we are planning around the assumption that price realization will be below our prior forecast in the second half. We believe it's prudent to plan for a negative price-to-material cost spread similar to what we saw in the first half of the year, and this was built into our updated guidance for approximately $4.50 a share. The fourth topic is relative to our Transport business. At the beginning of the year, we indicated we believed the durability and diversity of the business would enable us to maintain modestly down revenues and margins based on expected declines in the North American trailer market, and this has not changed. But the way we believe we'll get to the same result is a bit different. We're seeing modestly better results in North American trailers and softer results in our European trailer business, as well as strong auxiliary power unit bookings, as well as truck unit bookings and revenue. So in all, this is netting out to a relatively unchanged outlook for the Transport business. The next topic is foreign exchange. Generally speaking, the dollar has been weaker than we originally forecasted, which has largely closed the gap between our reported results and our organic results, which is a benefit to us. It's meaningful to remember that operating margin currency translation historically flows through the P&L at a rate approximately half of what we pull through from operations. So overall, this is creating a modest impact to our leverage rates, primarily on euro-based revenues. Netting out all of these updates, strong revenue and share gain combined with positive price and productivity has enabled us to not only cover the cost of material inflation and other inflation, it's also enabled us to maintain high levels of investment in our business, which helps us maintain our momentum over the long term. We expect that we will grow our business and expand margins again in the back half of the year, which gives us more confidence to raise our full-year guidance to the high end of our previous range with the same expectation of generating cash equal to or greater than net income and returning significant cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and pursuing accretive M&A where we can create value. The future is very bright, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2017 and beyond. I hope that this has given you some important insights into how our outlook has evolved through the midpoint of the year. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Sue to discuss the first quarter in more detail. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number five. I will begin with a summary of main points I'd like you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we have exited the first half of 2017 on a strong note, with continued strong financial and operational results. First half bookings growth, organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin improvement, adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow are all on track or ahead of expectations at this stage in the year and give us confidence in raising our revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. Our bookings and revenue performance were strong, with growth in both segments. Climate organic bookings and revenue were up 3% and 8%, respectively. Residential HVAC led the way, with high-teens growth in bookings and revenues and improved operating margin. Commercial revenues were also healthy, up mid-single digits. Our Industrial segment continues on a path of steady improvement, with strong bookings growth, revenue growth and a 250-basis point improvement in adjusted operating margins. Excluding capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million, or 1.1 percentage points, that were reclassified to the income statement in the second quarter of 2016, margins expanded by 140 basis points. These solid results give us further confidence in our full-year guidance for the segment. In January, we laid out our capital allocation priorities for 2017, including spending approximately $410 million on dividends and an additional $1.5 billion on a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions. Year-to-date through today, we've spent $667 million on share buybacks and $205 million in dividends. We've also spent approximately $65 million on acquisitions. We are continuing to follow the dynamic capital allocation plan we announced in January. Please go to slide number six. Focused execution of our business strategy underpinned by operational excellence drove strong year-over-year financial performance. Net revenues increased 7% organically, adjusted operating margins improved 40 basis points and adjusted earnings per share was higher by 8%. Robust revenue growth, positive price and productivity enabled us to more than offset increased materials inflation pressures from metals and refrigerants while maintaining a healthy business investment. Please go to slide number seven. Organic orders were strong in the second quarter, up 4%, with increased activity in both our HVAC and Industrial businesses. We drove particularly strong growth in Residential, up high-teens, driven by a robust market and continued market share gains. Organic Commercial HVAC bookings were down low-single digits, impacted by a tough comparison to prior year when we booked a very large order in the North America Commercial HVAC contracting business, Excluding this order, North America bookings would have been up 4% in the second quarter. Outside of North America Commercial HVAC, organic bookings were broad-based with high-single digit growth in EMEA and Asia. Transport organic bookings were up low-single digits, with gains in North America, EMEA and Asia. Our diversification strategy enabled us to offset the decline in trailers through growth in worldwide truck, aftermarket and APUs in the quarter. Industrial organic bookings were up 5% in the quarter, led by strength in Compression Technologies and Fluid Management. Regionally, North America and Europe were flat, while we had strong growth in China, India and the Middle East and Africa. Please go to slide number eight. In our Climate segment, organic revenue up low-teens in both North America and China. Applied was up high-single digits and Unitary and Aftermarket were both up mid-single digits. In our Industrial segment, overall organic revenue was up 2%, led by high-single digit growth in North America and low-single digit growth in Asia. In our Compression Technology business, North America was up low to mid-teens in both equipment and parts and services, and Asia also delivered strong equipment growth, up high-single digits. Overall, North America revenues were up low-teens and International revenues were flat, netting 7% organic growth rate for the enterprise. Please go to slide number nine. Q2 adjusted operating margin improved 40 basis points, primarily driven by strong volume, productivity and price, partially offset by material and other inflation. We continue to invest in the business. For Q2, approximately 40% of our investments were in new product development, 40% in channel optimization programs and 20% in OpEx on process and productivity-related projects to further improve our long-term competitive positioning. Please go to slide number 10. Overall Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 8% and an adjusted operating margin of 16.8%. Strong revenue growth in both Commercial and Residential HVAC was partially offset by modestly lower Transport revenues. Climate adjusted operating margin was down slightly year-over-year. Significantly higher revenues, productivity and price were offset by headwinds from material inflation and a lower product mix of higher-margin Transport revenues. Please go to slide number 11. Our Industrial segment continues to show steady improvement in second quarter. In addition to organic bookings growth of 5%, the business drove organic revenue growth of 2% and adjusted operating margin improvement of 250 basis points. Our continued focus on improving the fundamental operations of the business through commercial focus on aftermarket, operational excellence initiatives and cost reduction measures is delivering tangible results. Please go to slide number 12. Free cash flow was $414 million for the second quarter, driven largely by strong profits. Working capital as a percent of revenue for the quarter improved 50 basis points versus the second quarter of 2016. Year-to-date free cash flow is $340 million. Our guidance for free cash flow has been raised to approximately $1.2 billion, which is the high end of our previous range, reflecting continued expectations for free cash flow to be equal to or greater than net income. Additionally, our balance sheet continues to strengthen, which provides optionality as our markets continue to evolve. Please go to slide number 13. Continued strong cash flows in 2017 enables us to drive a dynamic capital allocation strategy, employing capital where it earns the best returns. In January, we laid out our 2017 capital allocation priorities, and they remain unchanged. Our first priority is continuing to make high ROI investments in our business. These include investment in innovation and in strategic growth programs. These ongoing investments are at the heart of our innovation, growth and margin expansion story, and our performance demonstrates our strategy is delivering results. The secondary is maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're BBB rated today and believe this is the appropriate structure for the company at the present time. The third area is our commitment to paying a highly competitive, reliable dividend that grows at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised this dividend over the years. In fact, the compound annual growth rate of our dividend is 20% over the past five years. The fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. In January of this year, we committed to spend $1.5 billion between these two areas, and year-to-date we've spent approximately $667 million on share repurchases and approximately $65 million on acquisitions. We intend to spend the balance of the $1.5 billion during the remainder of 2017. Our pipeline of actionable and available acquisitions is approximately $300 million to $500 million at any given point in time. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy, as we have consistently done for years. Please go to slide 15. Our strong first half financial performance gives us confidence in raising our 2017 adjusted continuing earnings per share guidance to the high end of our previously communicated range of approximately $4.50 per share. We have also raised our organic revenue guidance for the year from approximately 3% to approximately 4.5%, reflecting very strong revenues in the first half and expectations for continued healthy market growth and share gains in the second half. By segment, we expect climate organic revenues to be up approximately 5.5% and industrial organic revenues to be flat, both reflecting improvements versus our prior guidance. Please go to slide number 16. This slide lays out our updated guidance versus our prior guidance in more detail. I'd note that our free cash flow guidance has been raised to approximately $1.2 billion, which is the high end of the previous rage, reflecting continued expectations for free cash flow to be equal to or greater than net income. Please go to slide 18. We've received positive feedback on the section covering key topics we know are of interest to you in our prepared remarks, so we'll cover a few such topics on the next couple of slides, similar to what we've done in recent quarters. The first topic is the expected impact of currency on our 2017 guidance. For the full year, we have been expecting roughly a $0.10 impact from a strengthening dollar primarily against the euro. At this point in the year, we're not expecting the dollar to strengthen as much as previously forecast, which has improved our currency impact from negative $0.10 to about a negative $0.02. We also expect currency to have a minor impact on revenues, which is reflected in our revised guidance. The next topic is our second quarter Climate segment leverage, which was lower than you might expect on the strong revenues we delivered. The primary factors impacting leverage in the second quarter in the Climate segment were : persistent material cost and other inflation, unfavorable product mix from a lower mix of Transport revenues, which carry relatively higher margins compared to the other Climate business, and lower overseas margins than expected, primarily tied to lower revenues. It is important to note that we continue to expect to see margin expansion in Commercial in the second half of 2017, and this is embedded in our guidance. Please go to slide 19. The last topic for today is the non-cash, non-economic negative discrete tax item of $33 million, or negative $0.13 earnings per share, we laid out in our earnings release this morning. This charge is related to the impairment of deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carry-forwards in Latin America. It is important to note that while these assets are impaired, the net operating loss carry-forwards remain available for future use if profitability exceeds our current projections, so there's no current or future cash or economic impact to the company. I'll now turn it back to Mike for closing remarks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Sue. So in closing on slide 20, we are executing our 2017 plan and building a thriving, more valuable Ingersoll-Rand. I'm proud of our employees who successfully executed our strategy and delivered another strong financial and operational quarter for the company. We expect to see continued top-tier revenue and operating margin improvement in the back half of the year. Our robust revenue and booking performance gives us the optionality to make continued investments in the business to further improve our competitive positioning for the long run, while at the same time raising our financial targets for 2017. To summarize, our Climate segment remains strong, led by our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses, which are focused on growth areas, with equipment, controls and service. Our Transport Refrigeration business is diverse and agile and will execute their strategy as they typically do. Our Industrial business is on track and is delivering steady, consistent improvement. We have a tremendous depth of talented people and our culture remains as strong as ever. And taken together, I'm confident that with this formula, we'll continue to deliver top-tier financial and operating performance. And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Your first question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good Morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, Mike. So the tone on price/cost definitely changed since the mid-May timeframe at EPG. So I'm wondering, has there been deterioration in the price environment? I understand you talked about it's Rest of World Commercial. But has there been deterioration in the price environment since that point? And on that topic, are you building a Section 232 impact into the second half of the year into your guidance? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I'd start by saying, Nigel, that as far as price goes, most competitive pricing is happening where you've got overcapacity of OEMs in areas like China, or there's some economic difficulty, like the Middle East or Latin America. So pricing there is definitely more difficult. We've watched inflation persist. We've watched it move into refrigerants, as an example, into the second quarter. The volumes that we delivered were much higher than the volumes that we had forecasted, so we ended up in the spot market to a much greater extent than we did the sort of the hedged view of the world. So our outlook for the back half of the year now looks a lot like the first half of the year. We would expect sort of a 50 basis point, 40 basis point, 50 basis point, negative spread. So we think we're not expecting any more price. It's about the same amount of price as we got in the first half of the year, and a fairly conservative view around where we think direct (26:21) material inflation goes. We're still going to raise margins in the back half of the year, and we're going to do that and still continually invest in the company. And Climate would be a great example, that even where it's holding through that price/material inflation spread is the same as the back half of the year. The investments are about twice the rate they were in the first half of the year. So I think the formula for continuing to invest in growth and invest in productivity is just another area of the income statement for us to go attack as we would normally do, not just the price/material inflation piece of the P&L. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And, Nigel, if I could add just a few things to what Mike said and then I'll get to your follow-up question. So the answer to your question on whether we've seen more inflation in commodities than what we expected for 2017 is a definite yes. And that inflation has come from steel, it's come from copper turning from what we thought was a slight deflation for the year to an inflationary metric. Aluminum has been slightly inflationary and refrigerants have also been inflationary for the year. And, in fact, refrigerants represent about 10% of our inflationary pressure for the year. Another thing that I would tell you, though, is that with the volumes that we've had in 2017 to-date, the increase also reflects some of the volumes that we've had where we've had to go out and buy at spot. So it's a good problem and it's a great thing, but it has caused us increased inflationary pressure. And I would add just one more point on what Mike talked about with the Commercial HVAC regions, where we're seeing not only pricing pressure, but also inflationary pressure with Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. These are some of our best businesses at managing the total P&L and productivity. So while these businesses are causing us some pressure on price/cost, they also do a pretty good job of delivering their commitments by working the entire P&L. And I think that's what we'll continue to do as a total company for the remainder of the year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then as a follow-on, just the North American Commercial, I think we understand the comp issue. But maybe just dig into the verticals in terms of where you're seeing the underlying strength and weakness. And specifically, we are picking up some signs of a slowdown in light commercial activity maybe on the tendering side. Are you seeing that, Mike? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : First, Nigel, we forgot to answer your 232 question. Just really quickly on that. Steel prices for us are fairly well set now for the balance of the year. So between inventory and pricing that's out there that rolls through the balance of the year, we think we've got steel fairly well set in terms of our outlook for the balance of the year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Now going to markets, our view all along is that at some point you would see a positive but declining growth rate in the overall Unitary market, particularly as it relates to commercial buildings. And I think that that is definitely still our outlook for the back half of the year. But offsetting that, we still think that we're more in the early innings of the Applied business in the Institutional markets and still have a nice pipeline moving through 2018 in that regard. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Andy. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Mike, so Industrial order growth was plus 9% in Q1, plus 5% in Q2. Revenue growth was also positive in both quarters. We know you want to be conservative, but why would organic revenue growth for the year just be flattish? I think we understand that some of the orders you're getting are for your large long-lead compressors that won't impact 2017. But is there something else you're seeing in the Industrial business that keeps you conservative about your forward forecast? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, for me, no. It's really looking at those large orders and the timing of that, and then just looking at customer deliveries. So we had, really a pleasant surprise in the first half of the year that the book-and-turn business was better than we had anticipated. And we saw it across the board in Power Tools, Fluid Management, even the Consumer Vehicle and Club Car. So, there could be some upside to that number if the book-and-turn continues at the same rate. But what really drives the big revenue for us are the bigger projects, and we've got those scheduled out pretty tightly. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And I wanted to follow up on the commercial HVAC orders that Nigel talked about. What was your internal expectations for the quarter? And then, how are you thinking about orders for the rest of the year? You mentioned the improvement in Applied. Does that accelerate as the year goes on? How should we look at that? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, we did great in the quarter. If you look back all last year, I think our bookings growth was double-digits. So we're really coming off tough comps. What you're really seeing here is last year at the same time we booked $100 million-plus single contract, and we have those in the pipeline, but you can't predict exactly when they're going to fall. We don't bake the business around it. We don't determine our cost structure and investment schedules around whether or not that stuff comes or goes. But the markets have been strong. They remain strong. The share data remains in our favor universally across all product categories, certainly in service, and across the globe. So we're happy with what's going on. We invested in growth and we feel like we're getting it, Andy. So I'm as optimistic as I was coming into the year about the back half of the year in our Commercial HVAC business. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, Mike. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Joe. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. So maybe touching on pricing for a second, the 50 basis points of negative/price cost you expect to occur in the second half of the year. I guess one question is, what constrains you at this point from pricing further in order for that to narrow into the second half, knowing that commodity prices have increased? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, again, I think, Joe, the tough part of all of this is really looking at we've got announced price increases out there. And what we're seeing move around is the inflation. But we'll also continue to see the price/cost pressure in those regions of the world that we talked about, with Asia, the Middle East, actually it's specifically China, the Middle East and Latin America. So we don't expect that to go away and we don't expect it to be able to influence, again, our steel is locked in for the back half of the year. The majority of our copper is locked in. So we don't expect to be able to change that dynamic overall. And so what we can do as a company when we look at that back half of the year and the price/cost spread is really just manage the entire P&L, make sure that we're really working on the productivity in the business, and you saw some of that in the second quarter, and also managing our costs in the right way. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Joe, remember, too, that every single part of the company, with the exception of Commercial HVAC, had price that exceeded material inflation. If you focus solely on Commercial HVAC, it's much easier to maintain that price/cost relationship in the Unitary business than, say, within the Applied business. We're out pricing today six, nine, 12 months out into the future. So if inflation shoots up dramatically, in the case of refrigerants as an example, which are used extensively in great volumes in Applied equipment, you're going to see that you didn't cover it. So it's really isolated to that Commercial HVAC business. But, again, to the markets that are most competitive and into larger equipment where you sometimes have a hard time getting in front of it when it moves up dramatically for really no reason. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. That's helpful color. Following up on that, Mike, you mentioned that that price was positive, really kind of across the portfolio, with the exception of Commercial HVAC. If you were to maybe give us a little bit more color on 2Q, specifically around the incremental margins within Climate, so specifically on Commercial HVAC, Residential and Thermo King, how did the incremental margins look for those different pieces of the business within the quarter? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, it would have been the highest in Residential, where we, again, are expanding margins, I think, dramatically there, and lowest in the Commercial HVAC business, where in parts of the world you might have had deleverage on growth, growth and volume with deleverage again. This would be areas, I'm thinking about China, parts of the Middle East where that would have happened. And then within the TK business, we would have seen even a mix swing where most of the growth in Europe happened in Eastern Europe, not in Western Europe. So you end up with a little bit of a regional cut there, which hurts things. Sue, do you have anything you want to add to that? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes. And I think that's exactly right, is that the top incremental leverage came out of the Residential business, followed by Commercial, North America and EMEA, and then offset by some of those areas where we've talked about that price/cost was definitely an issue. And then to Mike's point on TK, we did have a mix down in \u2013 first of all from TK, which generally has higher margins than the other Climate businesses, but also from some of their European sales, which were lower-margin type of sales and not in the truck and trailer, where we've got great margins. So just a temporary mix down on TK. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Joe, one thing, too, it's just interesting that we were talking about was if you look at the Parts business specifically, the Parts business is actually growing, but quite slowly, just above low-single digits, really low-single digits. And you're seeing just a ton more replacement, whether it's on the Residential side or even on the Commercial side of the business, where high-margin parts business people are replacing rather than repairing. That's happening across the portfolio, too. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thanks, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Steve. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, if you roll on a 12-month basis, the Commercial HVAC orders, you're in that mid to high-single digit range. I know you've talked about a slowing, given there is I would assume a longer lead time on some of these bookings in Commercial HVAC. And any color on kind of whether this quarter is a true break in the trend, or should we expect given that maybe it's an easier comp in the third quarter because of a large deal? Maybe there weren't large ones? Maybe there were? Maybe you could clarify that. Should we be back in that 4% to 5% perhaps mid-single digit type of range in orders in the third quarter for Commercial HVAC? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I think the market is actually going to grow in that mid-single digit range. So that's the market in North America as it stands. Again, I can see slower Unitary growth and accelerating Applied growth, with the wild card being these larger energy services projects that we do at times that can impact the data. So the mid-single digit growth rates, say a healthy growth rate. And if you can do any better than that, you're probably gaining share. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And, Steve, we did have one of the contracting bookings in the third quarter of 2016 also. It was about half the size of the one in Q2, but it was still good size. So you'll have a little bit of a tough compare. But as Mike said earlier, we'll have tough compares on the Commercial HVAC bookings all year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. But the quoting activity is holding up okay I guess is the messaging? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes. Particularly on the Applied side. Institutional side, absolutely, yes. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So if you look at the margin bridge for the second half you talked about, or at least for the year now to reset us, you said basically the rest of the year is going to look a lot like 2Q. So in the back half of the year up roughly 40 basis points. Is that the right way to look at it? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, that's exactly right. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then in the fourth quarter you had it wasn't like the greatest margin performance on the planet. I think they were down. And you did have some inflation kick in in the fourth quarter. It was a 40 basis point headwind. Why wouldn't that comp get a little bit easier, or is that just timing of raws coming in? And then why are you not getting more price in the second half? Why \u2013 you said you're going to put some things through. Is it just those markets are too tough in International Commercial? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Second half investments are about twice the rate of the first half investments we're making. We're really trying to set up 2018 and beyond, Steve. So really on the margin side, we could certainly squeeze more leverage out if we took that down. But we think we've got good ideas and good projects to do that. Sue, other part of the question, anything you want to add there? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. So you're right, Steve, as you get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons on price/cost are start to lap themselves, because that was the first quarter that we saw the negative impact in 2016. But for the entire year, which was the guidance we gave in the prepared remarks, we still expect to be down about 40 basis points for the year based on what we've seen in the first half and then what we're projecting for the second half. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Julian. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Morning. Just a question on the productivity and other inflation line within the margin bridge. Maybe just give us a sense of where you stand on the outlook for that. That had been a very big margin driver 2014 and 2015, sort of flattened out last year, back to being a good tailwind this year. So is that sort of 60 bps, 70 bps range what we should expect in the second half, or are you thinking about trying to step that up to offset potentially a price material headwind that could last sometime into next year? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, total productivity steps up in the back half of the year for sure, and that's programmed in. So those are projects that are in flight. So I feel that's near-in for us, a quarter or two out to go look at that. That's certainly part of how we're trying to ensure that we still grow the operating margin in the back half of the year, and again sort of 30 basis points to 50 basis points for the full year as well. But that's a good pick-up, Julian. That's exactly right. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. And then just a follow-up on my second question would be on the Industrial business. Very good margin performance in the first half. Guidance suggests a flattening out in the second half. So was there any kind of big timing of productivity efforts or particular mix tailwinds you had in Industrial in Q2 or the first half that you think doesn't sustain into the back half? Or is the margin guide in that division really heavily in the context of, look, you've had a few tough years there and don't want to get ahead yourselves on the recovery in margins? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, price/volume mix was all a little bit better than what we had thought. So that was certainly positive. But there's been a lot of productivity work over the last 18 months, two years in that business and we're seeing some of highest productivity now in the company coming through as a result of that. Some of that has been restructuring. And other elements have just been changes to the business model that we've made. So it's been excellent performance to-date. We think it'll continue, but what's a bit of a wild card is just where volume settles out for the back half of the year in terms of how much we can actually shift in the back half of the year. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And we did, Julian, in 2016, we did see the margins start to improve in the back half of the year in Industrial. So, again, the first half comparisons are going to be a little bit easier than the second half comparisons. But as I look at every line item for the business, they're continuing to improve in the second half of the year all the way down the P&L. So I think the business is doing exactly what we expected and want it to do in 2017. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And I've got a lot of just personal confidence in the way that that team is executing, too, Julian. They're delivering on exactly what was committed to in our May Investor Day. And as I sift through the operating reviews, you just see the cadence there and the delivery has been commensurate with that. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Good morning. Can you guys hear me? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Andy. Yeah. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes. Good morning. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, I just wanted to understand a little bit of volume mix in the second half. I guess if I look at the FX benefit for the second half and if I overlay it with your commentary on pricing, it seems that I think FX offsets most of the pricing drag. And I just want to understand the leverage in the second half just a little bit better. I know you said there's some uncertainty about volume. Is that what's driving it, or are you just being conservative on operating leverage? I just want to understand that. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, the leverage is not that different than the first half. It's marginally better in the back half than in the front half. But the largest difference really is in the investments area where, again, it's about twice the rate as the first half. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Gotcha. That makes sense. And just a question on pricing. I think one of the themes this earnings season was that some deflationary pricing in distribution channel from online. I know that online is starting to make inroads on Residential side. What has been your experience with pricing on the Residential side in the U.S. as online is growing? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So far so good. If you remember, in May we talked about one of the things that consumers really asked for was more transparency in pricing. And so we launched and were first to launch now nationally a model where we've worked with our dealers to be able give homeowners a fairly tight range of what an installed system would look like. And we're seeing uptake on that from the web. We're seeing close rates that are well above what they were in the conventional way. So, look, I think that simplifying the consumer experience and being more transparent around that is a good thing and it's something that we intend to lead and/or participate in with other leading companies that think that way. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, Robert. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Just a follow-up on the price question. I understand the international dynamic in Applied, but why not go for a meatier price hike in Resi, especially since the market there seems so strong? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, Resi is covering material inflation and expanding margins, and growing share. I wish we would have got 20 basis points more of growth. We could have said it was 20%. We had a heck of a good quarter. I don't think we need to do anything different there other than continue to do what we're doing and execute the way we've been executing. So I feel like that's in good shape and I think the industry is in good shape. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. And then just on the investments, 2x I think you said in second half. But if inflation continues to track even higher, outside of steel, which sounds fairly locked in, what are the thoughts on flexing some of that up or down versus accepting some lower margin near-term? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I think we need to manage the whole income statement to deliver on the commitment we gave at the beginning of the year. So we're halfway through the year. We're now at the top end of our guidance range, which is a good thing. And as long as we've got good investments for the long run, we're going to make those investments. I think it's happened to us before, where the fourth quarter's rolled around and there was an opportunity to do something good for the business in the long run, and we've done that. So we're not going to sacrifice a quarter to make a consensus number, that's for sure. But we are going to go deliver on the commitments we've made, which we're doing this year and hopefully we can top those. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And, Robert, I would add that one of the things that I think we do a good job of and are putting some tools in to actually continue to improve on the investment, is we look at the investment versus the financial criteria and the returns that they're going to give to us, not necessarily their impact. It does factor into the P&L, and we're very conscious of that. But we're looking at each of the projects for how it fits into the strategy and what kind of returns it's going to bring over the 2020 guidance that we gave at our Investor Day. So I think that's something we do very well and we're very conscious of how that all fits together. But it isn't just a look at the P&L it's also a look at strategy and the longer-term plan that goes along with that. So I think we do that pretty well. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, everybody. Good morning. I just had a clarification and then a question. Just on the share repurchase and the acquisition activity, the $1.5 billion that you talked about for this year, I just wanted to clarify that only the year-to-date numbers are actually in guidance. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Correct. The year-to-date is where we were as of today in terms of share buyback. The acquisitions of $65 million is where we are in terms of buyback. The $1.5 million (sic) [$1.5 billion] (50:24) is still the commitment on total deployment. The $300 million to $500 million of actionable and affordable M&A is still what we're looking at. Although there's been changes within the pipeline, it's still $300 million to $500 million. If I snapped a line today as compared to last quarter, I would tell you that the biasing would be much more close to the $500 million than it would the $300 million. That would be really the update I would give you here. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just on Thermo King, you've actually seen order growth in two of the last three quarters. And so is that business really at a bottom in your eyes? And against easier comparisons in the back half of the year and into 2018, can we actually start to see growth accelerate now in that business? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, it's a very diverse business. So you have to think about what part of Thermo King are you talking about. And what we're seeing right now is really excellent growth in areas like auxiliary power unit bookings, or in total aftermarket or in the total truck business. So remember that TK is not just a trailer business, but it's a Class 3 through 7 truck business. And that business is up high-teens for us, the truck business. We've got other in there, which is bus, rail and air. So there are a number of positives. And, again, you're comping at a little better. It's just a touch better North American market than we thought, a weaker EMEA than we thought, particularly Western Europe. A stronger Eastern Europe than we thought. Net, we're just slightly right on, slightly above where we thought we would be for the total year. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Good luck on the second half. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is open. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Mike, I'm going to skip the break-up question. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good, Robert. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, I figured you had enough of that one. Maybe a history lesson though in terms of bookings. Obviously, you've rejiggered the presentation effectively this quarter but just a context around the commercial bookings maybe first half of this year, what would the overall growth and complexion would be? Because I hate to be pedantic or didactic, but I just wanted \u2013 you had a very tough compare 1Q last year. Incredible growth. So just maybe some clarity around the first-half bookings to underscore still the strength there. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, so quarter one you had high-single digit global Commercial HVAC bookings. Quarter two, pull out $111 million single contract, you're up at 4.5% growth in quarter two. And then, look, the outlook for the balance of the year continues to be strong against tough comps. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, 1Q 2016, you had pretty explosive Commercial bookings, as I recall. It was in the 15% to 20% range, if memory serves, right? In North America. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Quarter one 2016. But, yes, as you got into North America, you got into a 12% growth number compared to quarter two of last year. So that's probably what you're thinking about is the 12% from last year in quarter two in North America. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. No, I think good performance on very tough compares. And then could you just comment a little bit about the volume assumptions you did have with respect to commodities? I mean, how did you outperform there in terms of what your volume assumptions were for the quarter versus what actual volumes were? Any kind of complexion around that? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Robert. I would say to go through the whole business that way would be difficult to do it probably on a call. But, again, we didn't plan on roughly 20% Residential HVAC growth in the quarter. We didn't plan on the Commercial Unitary business delivering at the rates that it did. So the strategy there is working across our Commercial Unitary business. We're growing nicely there. The North America Commercial Unitary business in the quarter grew double-digit again. So we weren't forecasting double-digit again off a double-digit growth prior year in the Commercial North America Unitary business. We're just seeing strong markets and well above our projections. The really exciting thing for me is that we were able to execute on that flawlessly. We took that volume, we worked with suppliers, we ran our operations in plants at meaningfully higher revenues than we had thought and executed well. The only downside to that was you're out in the spot market picking up steel, copper and aluminum. That's about it. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then finally, for 2018, thinking about the levels of investments that you've highlighted this year and, obviously, the price and material headwinds. If we go into 2018, obviously you're not giving guidance today, I understand that. But can we talk qualitatively about the factors that would suggest would you expect a return to kind of the incrementals on the Climate side of the house that we've expected to enjoy there if you see continued growth and we have a step-up in the spend? Or maybe you can comment on the R&D and overall investment spending you've been doing and whether it's going to level off in 2018. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : The long-range plans for the business is going out three years and capturing 2020. If you look at the growth side, led by product growth teams, the answer that we're always \u2013 the question we're asking is what do we do to grow share and grow margins at the same time? And projects that qualify for that by teams that execute well are going to be approved. So if you look at it from the growth side, the incremental investments look like the last three years. We still have good ideas to go execute. On the productivity side, we're making sure that the productivity investments are sufficient enough to create a gap over other inflation, including wage labor. So that's the operating system. That's our model. That's how we look at this. As we look out, there's not a lot of difference about how you would model that for us. It'd be incremental investment for growth and it would be incremental investment in productivity to offset other inflation. And then price material, whole different part of the operating system. This will be a tough year. It's a bit of an unusual year. But I just don't think long term that it's going to remain upside-down for us. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Congratulations on the quarter and the context of the continuing strong results. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Lots of ground to cover here. Just a couple things. Mike, the growth in Building Services, does that reflect the beginning of the execution of the big projects you booked last year? And whether the answer is yes or no, are you building backlog in that business? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, the main area actually was in all of the other service areas. That would be everything from planned service to break/fix to smaller turnkey contracting. And that's the return on investment for the feet on the street for all of the controls, people we put out in the marketplace to sell, all of the service technicians that we've grown. I want to say in North America, we're up 200 to 300 technicians, maybe more at this point, year-over-year. We're seeing industry-leading revenue per technician and margin per technician. So, again, it's a strategy of the business to continue to invest there at those higher margins. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : So on the bigger projects, you're not even really starting to see revenue on those? Correct? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, they're so long in nature and they are fairly linear in terms of how you execute something like that. Typically, if it's an 80-building project, you're doing that in phases and chunks. So it's squeezing its way through the income statement. And some of those projects were 24-month, 26-month, maybe longer, projects. So it happens over two years, two-and-a-half years. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Just kind of a technical one for Sue. I think you said FX only kind of half the fleet average margin rate. That sounds a little atypical relative to other companies I cover. Is there something with hedges working against that or some other technicality that drives that phenomenon? Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : No, actually it doesn't. What it really reflects is our in-region, for-region strategy. So in other words, your costs and your revenues are largely in the same currency. And so what that means is when you translate out the revenues, that you're really translating the income at the operating income level. So it includes the cost side of that versus just at the gross margin level. So a bit of a nuance, but nothing more than straight math. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : I guess first question, Mike, on some of the big performance contracting orders that you booked last year that set up the tough comp, I'm to understand those are fairly lower margin relative to the base business. Does that show up in an easier margin comp somewhere along the way that we should keep in mind as well? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : It shows up in lower gross margins. It should show up in contribution margin being about the same. So you tend to have all elements of cost set against that particular contract. So there's very little incremental. I mean, even the commissions and the sale are part of the cost structure of the contract. So we look at those to be accretive to the overall margins on a contribution basis. But it would put pressure on your gross margins for sure. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Is that something we lap here in the second half or is that just spread over multiple quarters? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : It's a little bit to Jeff's question. When you book these things at the $100 million point, you're getting a quarter a point, where it can really move your comps on bookings. But if you take those projects, over 24 months, 30 months, you're really seeing the P&L impact in 24ths or 30ths over the course of that contract. So it's very much sort of diluted coming through the income statement over time. Does that help you at all? Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, it does. That's helpful. To follow up on another one of Jeff's questions. On the currency front, a lot of companies we've seen have gotten pretty decent pricing over the last couple years in a stronger dollar environment. Is that some of what's going on with the tougher pricing environment internationally? Just maybe it's tougher to price through inflation given that you've already priced through currency? Is that dynamic playing out at all for you, or because it's purely translational that doesn't show up? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : We tend to produce and sell in region at those currencies. We do very little exporting around the world in various currencies. The only exception to that is there's some Middle East orders that will come out of the U.S., as an example. But generally speaking, you're operating in the same currency. So, to us, it's much, much more translational than transactional. Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Right. And I think, Josh, when you think about it, in some of the areas that we've been talking about in the world, you're going to have a competitive pricing environment. So that's a given. And then you're going to be buying your raw materials in that region, again. So you're going to locally source in China or some of the other countries. So you're getting both ends of that dynamic, whatever the region is telling you. So it's not really a translational or FX type of activity. It's really if you're manufacturing in the region, you're going to get the full cost side as well as the full revenue side. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. Thanks for the color. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Nagle for closing remarks. Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Great. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for today's call. We'll be available in the coming days and weeks for any follow-up calls that you might have and we look forward to connecting with many of you soon. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll-Rand's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on the website at, ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause results to differ materially from our anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. So participants on this morning\u2019s call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO, and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to Slide 3 and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I\u2019ll start this morning by discussing our focused execution of our strategy, underpins our ability to deliver sustainable high levels of performance overtime. We also provide comments on how we\u2019re thinking about our business and our end markets broadly, as we close out solid performance in 2017 and move into what we expect to be another strong year in 2018. So, we\u2019ll discuss our third quarter performance in more detail and address some key topics we know that are on minds of investors. And I\u2019ll then close the brief summary before we take your questions. As I said on prior calls, our overall strategy remains straight forward. We believe our business operating system, people and culture are source of competitive advantage. For us, our business strategy is grounded and anticipating and addressing global trends that positively impact many of world\u2019s most pressing sustainability challenges. We focus on delivering the most reliable, energy efficient and environmentally friendly products and services in durable growing markets. In our case, it\u2019s an orientation towards the importance of sustainability which is enabled by digital, another exponential technologies, growing at dramatic rates that are enabling new business models and sources of productivity in the world that will increasing value the conservation of resources. We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers. It\u2019s what we do and it\u2019s what we\u2019re known for. We maintain a healthy level investment in our businesses to sustain leading brands, which are number one or number two in virtually every market in which we participate. Second, we excel at delivering strong top line incremental margins and free cash flow through our business operating system. Our business operating system is continuously improving and underpins everything that we do. It enables us to consistently generate high levels of free cash flow, which powers our dynamic capital allocation strategy. One example of our capital allocation strategy is the acquisition we entered into this week that strengthens our telematics portfolio, an important component of our connected technology strategy. Sue will cover this within topics of interest later in our call. Our year-to-date results continue a strong track record of performance and position us well for a solid finish 2017 and strong momentum going into 2018 Sue will discuss the details of the quarter in a few minutes. So, I\u2019d like to turn my attention to discussing where we are at this stage in the year and how we\u2019re thinking about key aspects of our business going forward. Moving to Slide 4, we\u2019re going to follow the format we started last quarter and discuss how 2017 is shaping up relative to our expectations, so you\u2019ll get a feel for how the landscape is evolving. I\u2019ll touch on some of the areas that may read through to 2018, as we are in the midst of our 2018 planning now, but I want to be clear upfront that will get 2018 guidance with our Q4 earnings call. So I\u2019m not going to go into any specific detail on targets at this time. I know 2018 is on many investors minds, but it\u2019s important for us to complete our planning process noted provide you with the high quality of discussion on 2018 that we all expect. The key areas that are most important to investors in order to keep the discussion focused, so if we don\u2019t hit something here, we\u2019ll cover it in the Q&A session. The first point I\u2019ll make is probably the most important. We are on track to deliver against the revenue, adjusted EPS, free cash flow and capital allocation guidance that we set out at the beginning of the year. We're using all the tools in our business operating system to get there, and given evolving market dynamics, it is a bit different than what we envision when we gave guidance back in January. I\u2019m proud of the way our team has pulled together in some challenging market conditions to achieve these goals, which should yield strong revenue growth of about 4.5%, 9% EPS growth, and free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. In 2017, orders and revenues have been consistently strong. Our end markets on balance have been solid. The outlook for the market continues to be healthy looking into 2018. Our HVAC businesses are performing well with strong order and margin expansion in 2017. Our transport business is demonstrating the resiliency we expect with the modest decline in revenues and margins despite challenging markets. Our industrial business is recovering nicely with order growth in margin expansion ahead of our expectations. There are a lot of things working well for us. One area that we\u2019re not satisfied with and we expect to improve on in 2018 is our operating leverage. Our business model is rooted in our ability to drive margin expansion in low growth environments and we did not make enough progress expanding our incremental margins for the enterprise in 2017. We were negatively impacted by a few key factors in 2017 including higher than expected and persistent inflation, mix of business as we\u2019ve penetrated underserved commercial HVAC markets most notably in China, which at present carry a lower gross margins in our portfolio average but still are accretive to our EPS. This business is particularly accretive when you add in the highly profitable service tails from applied equipment sales in the mid-to long-term. The way our bridges and price versus class are compiled, the impact of moving into these newer markets shows up its price although some would probably categorize this as business mix. Rather than to confuse anybody, we\u2019ve kept the designation in price consistent for all of 2017, but I believe it is worth noting this distinction as it has a pronounced impact in how our price versus cost spread shows up in the bridge. We\u2019re seeing better than expected success in these markets in China with approximately 20% order growth year-to-date and low 30s order growth in the third quarter. This is for the increased pressure on climate and enterprise margins as China is experiencing impacts of both negative price and inflation rather than the majority of our businesses are seeing positive price. We\u2019re in the process of developing our 2018 operating plan and we\u2019re focused on accelerating productivity initiatives to drive higher leverage in 2018 and beyond. Increased focus here will drive more direct controls of the margin expansion irrespective of market conditions. We also see inflation moderating in 2018, as we begin to lap the inflation we saw throughout 2017, so we should see reduced headwinds here. Similarly on the China market penetration strategy, we begin to lap the lower gross margins for those markets in 2018, so we anticipate the pressure on leverage in the region moderating as well. Moving through the update, year-to-date our end markets continue to perform well with strong broad-based orders and revenue growth. Our outlook is for end markets to remain healthy to at least 2018. Execution across the business continues to be solid. The tragic unprecedented natural disasters in the third quarter took a toll on our 750 associates in Puerto Rico, our customers and more broadly on our markets. Our thoughts are with our employees, their families of all lives that are impacted by these terrible tragedies. Financially, these natural disasters had an impact on us in the third quarter. We estimate that the impact was between $0.04 to $0.05 of EPS, when we take into the account downtime at out Thermo King Puerto Rico manufacturing facility, the disaster release funds we provided to our sister employees, and the three days of lost sales in productivity in two of our large HVAC markets in Florida and Houston. Slide 6 lays out the main impacted areas and Sue will cover these in more detail in a few minutes. We think we\u2019ll see some recovery in the fourth quarter and in 2018, and likely it will be additional market activities over the next one or three years as building occurs in the effected geographies. So as laid out earlier, the impact of our strategy to compete in new markets in Asia and the Middle East is driving exceptional growth for us in these markets, but the impact to leverage the price versus cost equation was significant in the quarter. Again, we see these areas improving as we move into 2018, that\u2019s we lap 2017 inflation and gross margin headwinds. We are also driving aggressive productivity plans for 2018 to expand margins. The next topic is on price versus cost, as we see at this stage in the year. Things are shaping up fairly consistent with what we expected coming out of the second quarter earnings call, pricing remains positive in both climate and industrial. The areas that are impacting our price versus cost equation across both climate and at the enterprise level are predominantly emanating from Asia into lesser extent to Middle East, as we previously outlined. With regard to our industrial segment, this segment has been performing well in 2017 and ahead of our expectations. We\u2019ve seen strong bookings growth and margin expansion in the segment. In the last topic, there is an update on our climate businesses broadly. Commercial HVAC equipment businesses remain strong with high single-digit order growth in Q3. Our commercial pipeline and outlook continues to have healthy markets going forward. Our Residential and Transport outlooks are also on track with our expectations. Focused execution of our strategy will deliver strong performance overtime and we\u2019re excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2018 and beyond. So, hope that this is giving you some important insights into how our outlook has evolved through this point in the year. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sue, to discuss the third quarter in more detail. Sue Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide number 5. I\u2019d like to begin with the summary of main points to take away from today\u2019s call. As Mike discussed, we drove solid operating and financial results in the third quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, despite business disruptions from natural disasters in the quarter negatively impacting results by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.7% driven by the timing of the number of tax planning related discrete items that hit in the third quarter that were expected in the second half of 2017. We continue to expect our full year 2017 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 21% or the lower end of our previous range. Bookings growth was strong with growth in both segments and in every strategic business unit. On the climate side, organic bookings were up mid single-digits in both commercial HVAC and Transport and up low single digits in residential with another quarter of share gains. We also drove high-teens commercial organic bookings growth in Asia and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Climate organic revenues were also higher, up 3% in the quarter. Our industrial segment continues on the path of steady improvement and is actually performing a bit better than our guidance with strong organic bookings growth of 5% overall. Compression Technologies had growth across small and medium compressors and particular strength in large compressors. We also drove a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margins on essentially flat revenues. Flat revenues were also better than our expectations given to compares versus Q3 of 2016 as we discussed on our second quarter call. In January, we laid out our capital allocation priorities for 2017 including spending approximately $430 million on dividends and an additional $1.5 billion on a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions, and we\u2019re on track to achieve those priorities. We also discussed our objectives to grow our dividend at or above the rate of our earnings growth. In August, we\u2019ve raised our dividend by 12.5% to an annualized rate of $1.80 per share. Year-to-date through October, we\u2019ve spent $1 billion on share buybacks and $318 million in dividends. We also spent or entered into commitments for approximately $200 million in acquisitions Please go to Slide 6. During the third quarter, we saw positive and negative financial impacts from natural disasters, primarily the hurricanes that hit the Caribbean, Florida and Texas. We saw increased commercial rental activity and increased part sales in the third quarter, offsetting the positive financial impacts shipments for transport in our Puerto Rico facility, residential and small electric vehicles were also delayed and our businesses were down for several days resulting in low absorption productivity and other additional costs. We expect to regain some of the deferred business in the fourth quarter and we are currently assessing the potential impacts for 2018. If the recovery from these storms follows past experience, we\u2019d expect to see an overall strengthening in the underlying markets in the impacted overtime whether that a spike of activity in any given month. Please go on to Slide number 7. The focused execution of our business strategy underpinned by our business operating system enabled us to drive solid year-over-year financial performance. Organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share increased 2%. Adjusted operating margins declined 40 basis points year-over-year, impacted by the $0.04 to $0.05 earnings per share headwind from natural disasters. As Mike discussed earlier, our strategy of penetrating very large underserved markets in China in commercial HVAC is resulting in strong bookings growth with China commercial HVAC up low 20% year-to-date and up low 30% in Q3. In the short term, the negative impact of this growth is approximately 55 basis points of margin contraction at the enterprise level in Q3, although still accretive to our earnings per share year-to-date and it is expected to represent 75% of the negative price cost spread for the full year 2017. Please go to Slide number 8. As we\u2019ve discussed, organic orders were strong in the third quarter with increased activity in both our Climate and Industrial businesses. Organic Commercial HVAC bookings were up mid single digits. Q3 2017 North America bookings were up low single digits. Outside of North America Commercial HVAC bookings were broad-based with high-teens growth in EMEA and Asia and mid-teens growth in Latin America. Transport organic bookings were up mid single digits with gains in North America, Latin America and Asia. Bookings growth span the product portfolio with gains in trailer, truck, bus, aftermarket APU and marine. Industrial organic bookings were up 5% in the quarter with growth to cost all industrial businesses, regionally North America and Asia bookings gains were offset by declines in Latin America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Please go to Slide number 9. In our Climate segment, organic revenue was up low single digits in North America, up mid single digits in Europe, and up low teens in Asia. Globally, equipment was up low single digits and aftermarket was up mid single digits. In our Industrial segment, organic revenue was down 1%, we have large compressor shipments in Q3 of 2016 that did not repeat this year. Regionally, we saw a low single digit growth in North America and Latin America. In our compression technology business, North America was up low single digits in parts and services. Industrial products were up mid single digits and Club Car had high single digit growth with continued success in on more personnel vehicles. Overall, North America and international revenues were up low single digit, netting a 2% organic growth rate for the enterprise. Please go to Slide number 10. Q3 adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points primarily driven by volume, productivity improvements and positive price more than offset by natural disasters as previously discussed and material inflation including the negative impact of price versus cost largely driven by our penetration of underserved markets in China and competitive pricing in the Middle East. The impact of China and Middle East were greater than we anticipated earlier in the year driven by high volumes and forecast and higher than expected material inflation, which widened the negative price cost spread. Outside of these markets, the price versus cost spread was largely in line with our expectations. Please go to Slide 11. We covered the main points from this slide on prior slides. Performance in the quarter was strong on bookings in revenues. Excluding the natural disaster impacts in climate, margins would have been roughly flat. Margin declined largely attributable to our China strategy and the negative price versus cost spread in the Middle East which combined or approximately negative 65 basis points. Please go to Slide 12. We\u2019ve also covered the highlights of this slide on prior slide. Our industrial business continues to outperform our expectations and deliver strong improvement in bookings and margins un-relatively flat revenues. Our continued focus on improving the fundamental operation of the business is yielding as a result. Please go to Slide 13. Free cash flow was $408 million for the third quarter driven largely by strong profits. Working capital as a percentage of revenue remains on track to our expectations for 2017. Our guidance for free cash flow remains unchanged at $1.2 billion. Additionally, our balance sheet continues to strengthen which provide optionality as our markets continue to revolve. Please go to Slide 14. Continued strong cash flows in 2017 is powering our dynamic capital allocation strategy, employing capital where it earns the best returns. In January, we made out our 2017 capital allocation priorities and they remain unchanged. Our first priority is making high ROI investments in our business to drive productivity and to maintain our product leadership position. The second area is maintaining a strong balance sheet with BBB ratings and healthy optionalities as our markets evolve. The third quarter areas are commitment to paying a highly competitive reliable dividend that grows at or above the rate of earnings growth overtime. The fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. In January of this year, we committed to spend $1.5 billion between these two areas and we\u2019re on track to achieve these commitments. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve spent approximately $1 billion on share repurchases and approximately $200 million has been spent or committed to acquisition. By the end of 2017, we expect to have approximately $400 million to $500 million spent or committed for acquisitions. As we look forward to 2018 and beyond, our overarching strategy and priority remain the same. Please go to Slide 15. For 2017, we\u2019re maintaining our revenue, earnings per share and cash flow guidance. For modeling purposes, we also wanted to provide tax rate guidance which should come in at the lower end of our previous range or approximately 21%. For the full year, we expect fully diluted share to approximate 258 million based on share repurchases in 2017. Please go to Slide 17. We\u2019ve received positive feedback on the section covering key topics we know of interest to you in our prepared remarks. So, I\u2019ll cover a few of these topics on the next couple of slides. The first topic is HVAC order growth in the third quarter. Our HVAC markets remain very healthy. In the third quarter, orders were higher in all of our major geographic regions. We had especially strong order growth in overseas markets up by high teens. North America commercial HVAC continued to see good order growth against difficult comparisons with 2016. Residential HVAC order also improved compared with record activity last year and the business continues its steady market share improvement. Please go to Slide 18. The last topic for today is the acquisition pipeline. As previously discussed, we\u2019re expecting to close on or have signed agreements on approximately $400 million to $500 million in acquisitions in 2017. We are focused on channel and technology investments that add to our existing core businesses. Most recently, we entered into an agreement a telematics company. This acquisition will complement our 2015 acquisition of Celtrak and allow us to expand our expertise in telematics in addition to the many services it already provides for our small electric vehicles business today. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thank you, Sue. So on closing on Slide 19, we expect to deliver our 2017 plan for revenue growth, adjusted EPS and free cash flow, utilizing our business operating system and building a thriving, more valuable Ingersoll-Rand. To summarize, our Climate segment remains strong, led by our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses which have focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our Transport Refrigeration business is diverse and agile and is executing their strategy and delivering against the high expectations in a challenging market. Our Industrial business is improving ahead of our expectations for growth and margin expansion. 75% of our negative price versus cost spread in 2017 is expected to come from very strong growth in Asia from merely China. We expect both the inflation and pricing headwind to moderate heading into 2018. The balance of the markets should see moderating inflation in 2018 as well, as they lap 2017 inflation. Nonetheless, we\u2019re accelerating our 2018 productivity initiatives to drive more directly control over margin expansion irrespective of market conditions. We\u2019re also on track to achieve the capital allocations priorities we laid out at the beginning of 2017. We expect to deploy roughly $1.9 billion of cash in the form dividends, buyback and acquisitions. We have a tremendous depth of talented people and our culture remains strong as ever. And taking together, I\u2019m confident that with this formula we'll continue to deliver top tier financial and operating performance. And with that, Su and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, you gave a lot of color on your price versus cost issues and you talked about how most of the issues were emanating from China and the Middle East. I know you don\u2019t want to give detail on 2018, but as you kind of shift the overall company to little more these longer cycle applied HVAC orders especially in international markets. How difficult do you think it will be to get your arms around price versus cost? And what could you do specifically on these regions where competitions are significant and inflations still reasonably high? Mike Lamach : Andy, I think maybe it\u2019s best for us to start with what is our China strategy historically and how we're evolving. And I think that will answer a lot of questions for you. First of all, China is a country and Asia is a region would have some of the highest operating margin that we have across the HVAC space still today even this quarter. Historically, we\u2019ve been a Tier 1 and Tier 2 city focus company and largely on applied equipment, and we\u2019ve been very successful there. We\u2019ve penetrated those markets with very high share and often train as a basis of design in many of these projects. What we\u2019ve done over the last two years and you\u2019re seeing it this year in space as we\u2019ve extended to Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. We\u2019ve also launched both localized ducted and ductless unitary product nationally. We\u2019ve penetrated and are penetrating larger infrastructure projects in subways and airports, and the electronic verticals specifically which is applied. And those three things in Tier 3, Tier 4 cities help drive train as a basis of design in those cities as well. It\u2019s been a formula that we follow for years and it\u2019s been very successful for us. We know that that grow as a large service tail and we know that we grow our margins by leveraging the SG&A and manufacturing base around that. So, to put into context, the strategy has been very successful. We put a PGT in place about two years. We fully localized product portfolio. In unitary duct to ductless, we\u2019ve been there and applied sometime. We added a 178 selling and marketing people onto the street over the last 12 months. And a 165 of those, we put in just since January. So, the project pipeline we\u2019re seeing in China is up 211%, so just speaks for clearly it\u2019s three times larger than what it would have been last year at the same time around that pipeline. So year-to-date, we\u2019ve seen bookings growth in unitary, it\u2019s actually been 40% plus. We\u2019ve had mid 20s revenue growth unitary. Unitary is now 25% of the mix that we have in the equipment in China. We\u2019ve also then able to grow the apply business of twice the market margin rate year-to-date and we\u2019re seeing excellence service growth. So, again, it\u2019s become so successful that it really is -- we classified as price, but we\u2019re growing this accretively to the Company. And long-term is the right and most successful strategy that we know how to conduct. By the way, we would have a similar strategy -- there are nuances to what we will be doing in Europe or Latin America. But every region of the world, it's got a unique strategy and China has just been very successful for us. Andrew Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful color. And then just shifting gears to the North American Commercial HVAC booking. They were up low single digits against a tough comp as you talk about it. I think it's going to result compared to last quarter, but can you give us a little more color regarding what you\u2019re seeing in the overall North American HVAC market? It's been slowing like unitary. When you talk about applied HVAC improving there, do you still see a good runway in applied HVAC so North American Commercial HVAC booking should be up low single digits are better moving forward? Mike Lamach : Yes, I would say first to the starting point, nothing has changed that would make us less bullish in the end markets than we were five years ago when we talked everybody at Analyst Day. Outlook continues to be very positive that we see continued five months ago. Low single digits to mid single digit growth in North America commercial and that we\u2019re going to drive share gains. Our project pipeline is actually stronger today than it was last year at the same time. We also think inflation in 2018 is fairly consistent with what we expected five months ago. We think it's going to be much more copper related which is much easier for us to set pricing and costs into the factories about how to price and the cover that as opposed to steel, which is very difficult on the longer lead items. So, we think that would be more manageable for us. So saying with where we\u2019re five months ago, the CAGR of 4% to 4.5% that was a three year period, 11% to 13% EPS growth over that period would still very much encourage for us. We\u2019re very confident about that what they\u2019ve done in the fourth quarter. But a lot of that\u2019s underpinned that we\u2019re seeing strength not only in North America but across the globe and you\u2019re seeing that in even Latin America. Sue pointed out, mid teens growth rate in Latin America finally seeing some recovery there. And don\u2019t forget that\u2019s an important market for us too, that\u2019s a $0.5 billion in revenue in the climate space for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Hey, Mike. I just want to go back and visit the price cost. So, the 55 bps impact from Asia and Middle East you called out, so just give me your comments on China. Is that more accurately a mix impact as opposed to price cost impact? Mike Lamach : Yes, Nigel, it\u2019s a very specific definition we use and we say that if it's equipment coming out of the factory using, the same machine and assembly processes, that we mark that as price. But clearly what you\u2019re seeing in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities is even more discontented product, and you\u2019re seeing that generally those have done some of the local players that have done that market. So, it is max more than its price, but again for consistency of what we\u2019ve been talking about, we classify on the bridges prices just to keep it sort of straight for everybody at this point in time. But it is something that if you move past China, you look at say res for example. On the residential North American business, we grew margins considerably, we grew share considerably and we\u2019re managing that. If you go to the balance of the commercial business that\u2019s excluding the Middle East and Asia, but largely covering inflation there, and of course from the industrial side we\u2019re covering inflation there completely. So, it is really isolated to this penetration we\u2019re seeing in China. Middle East is a bit different. Here you've just this fact that you\u2019ve got the same number of competitors fighting over fewer projects there. And so, you\u2019re going to have a bit more competition there as well. Nigel Coe : Okay. Mike Lamach : In 2018, I think that we\u2019re clear that we\u2019ve got a moderating steel environment. We\u2019ve got a copper environment that we can lock a good portion with understanding at the beginning of the year. We feel like generally speaking, it\u2019s a more manageable year in terms of the global material inflation, pricing scenario. And specific to Asia, it\u2019s really a matter of just getting scale on some of these, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, getting additional service density in these cities. And we know how to grow margins from there. So, again it\u2019s a long-term view towards China. I think we\u2019ve seen improvement in 2018 in China leverage. Nigel Coe : Right. Okay. But, if you have to think about maybe just moving away from China because obviously that\u2019s -- it\u2019s kind of good problem to have, if you go into that kind of rates. But, if you think about North America, Europe, if you think about the pendulum of the competition and pricing, is it becoming more competitive, less competitive about balance? I mean, how would you say that pendulum is shifting? Mike Lamach : Yes, there is nothing structurally different about the competition in these markets. We\u2019ve had high-teens growth before in Europe. We\u2019ve had substantial growth in Europe over the last few years. It\u2019s really about new product introduction around next generating refrigerants, building out of controls portfolio or wireless portfolio or double-digit growth there, more digital involvements in connecting our businesses remotely, more service feet on the street. So, it\u2019s always been a competitive environment, but you are able to differentiate that business on total cost of ownership which is 90% of that equation is not the initial cost, it\u2019s -- the energy efficiency in the maintenance and the liability to product over the long haul, and nothing has changed about our value proposition there at all. Sue Carter : And Nigel, it's Sue. Let me add a little bit of color on the pricing to that, I think it is important and it really doesn\u2019t come out in all the detail that we\u2019ve got. So, we talked about the prices actually positive in both of the segments which it is. The other piece there is that the pricing that we have achieved in the year eventually higher than last year. Again, we know the inflationary pressures that we\u2019ve got, but we have really been able to build positive pricing in the areas of the world. And in total, it is positive in a dollar terms on a year-over-year basis and it\u2019s fairly significant. And it does have the headwind and there aren\u2019t price from Asia. So, I don\u2019t want anyone to think that the pricing is actually not strong and that we haven\u2019t achieved pricing in 2017, we acutely have and it\u2019s actually stronger than it was in 2016. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s an important point, thanks Sue. And just to follow on SG&A, you talked about G&A as an important area of productivity improvement. And Mike in the PR, you talked about ramping up productivity to offset some of these price material pressures. If we delineate between the S and G&A in that 5% inflation, are we starting to see the G&A good news coming through? But they're masked by some of the sales investments, so is that on the come? Mike Lamach : Yes, relatively to 2018, Nigel. I will tell you that we\u2019re going to generate $300 million plus in productivity like we do every year. It\u2019s going to be direct material, it\u2019s going to be PGT led with engineering and product management and operations, that will be both direct and indirect in that regard. I think what\u2019s going to be different for us as we spent a couple of quarters in excruciating detail understanding the G&A and sort of benchmarks and ideas around reducing G&A across the Company, which will show up strict on the G&A line overtime between 2018 and 2020 over a multi-year period, certainly starting in 2018 will have an impact. We also see opportunities with a lot of what we\u2019ve done around automation in lien around things like warehouse consolidations and logistics opportunities that we are able to take advantage. I think, yes, we\u2019ll start to see those in 2018 as well. So, what I\u2019m saying in addition to the normal high levels of productivity that we'd expect in the operating system, there are couple of projects that literally we\u2019re having to build program offices, and [succumb] very talented people into the program office to be able to drive, what\u2019s likely to be hundreds of projects that roll up into these two bigger ideas. But I think that we get more leverage in \u201918, \u201919 and \u201820 from those things. and I\u2019m pretty excited about it. We talked about at your conference in fact and I\u2019m glad you asked me the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : On the commercial side, last quarter you had mentioned the unitary markets on that slide as growing. What are you seeing in those markets? And ahead of this kind of regulatory transition in 2018, do you expect any kind of pre-buy? And then just what\u2019s your outlook for kind of the core unitary markets going forward? Mike Lamach : Yes, growth again in North America, you know in the quarter nice growth in the quarter there. So, I don\u2019t anticipate a pre-buy there for say. There could be some, I mean it will be great if there was, but we don\u2019t anticipate much of one at this point in time. But we are going to be sure that we\u2019ve built inventory and that we\u2019re talking to customers about what is stackable and in fact if they want to take that on. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. And then in residential, you guys also mentioned for the first time channel at least relative to last quarter. What do you -- I\u2019ve heard from the channel that you guys are kind of building out a bit of these store fronts like Lennox has. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s kind of an ongoing strategy that you\u2019ve been just doing under the radar that you haven\u2019t talked about a lot. Maybe if you could give us some clarity on what exactly you\u2019re doing in the channel outside of the digital stuff that you\u2019ve already mentioned maybe different relative to last year and the year before that? Mike Lamach : Yes, thanks Steve. We\u2019ve got about 260 part stores today. Generally speaking, we\u2019ve got them where we want them. We were adding up through last year but we\u2019ve got the coverage we generally need, and we\u2019re finding opportunities to transition some of that digitally. So, it doesn't all have to be brick-and-mortar but there are 260 brick-and-mortar stores that are out there. What you\u2019re finding on unitary books rather than commercial now is, there is this past year in particular much more of a bias with customers replacing than repairing. So, I do think that, that's put a little bit of pressure on mix. But for the right reason, you\u2019re really seeing people at this point in time doing wholesale replacements. Sue Carter : And Steve, I would also point out that in the context of our parts stores, the 260 that Mike mentioned that stores both commercial and the residential markets for as. And in fact, the commercial is a little heavier than residential in terms of overall sales for those parts stores. Mike Lamach : And as you know, Steve, a lot of contractors don't identify themselves as one or the other. Sue Carter : Right. Mike Lamach : So, it makes sense that we'd say one presence to our customers. Steve Tusa : That makes sense. And how fast this one last question -- how fast did that grow like over the last couple of years? What was -- how many I guess did you add in 2016 just a reference point? Mike Lamach : Yes, a 1,000 maybe and see, we\u2019ve been working at that for a long time. That\u2019s not -- this hasn\u2019t been something that you'd pull out of our company is being the large mover and shaker around the business. But, they are an important part of the business and we\u2019ve got a 260 to coverage we think we need. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Rich Kwas : Mike, just want to just get your thoughts on, as we big picture as we think of mix within climate for next year. You\u2019ve had very strong growth on the order side in China, you\u2019ve talked about the price that the mix headwind there that brings lower growth in the developed markets. How does that shape up as we think about a normal incremental margin for climate particularly in comparison to this year? Do we get -- do you think you get back into that 25%, 30% on a year-over-year basis with some of the initiatives you in place and given the mix changing? Mike Lamach : Yes, I have no doubt Rich, but the planning we'll do for 2018 will have us coming back to more normalized leverage in that business. And we\u2019ve built a portfolio that should be agnostic to the product specifically. I mean as you know applied has got a little lower margin, but great service base over the long period of time. And unitary gives you a little bit of the margin pop sooner, but this is not happening in the world and an up growth in the world that I expect again good growth in 2018. The pipeline supports that. We think we\u2019ve got a more manageable mix of inflation moving from steel to copper, easier to get on top of that from a pricing perspective. So -- and then the question I answered to the Nigel last, if we can do a bit more around some of the rooftop consolidation a bit more around the G&A leverage in the Company, no doubt that will get back to where we\u2019ve historically been. Rich Kwas : And then just on, as we think about the institutional given you\u2019ve seen some path micro wise, some moving numbers here with regard to forward indicator given Dodge and ABI et cetera. But generally moving in the right direction, I know you've emphasized no change versus five months ago earlier in the call, but just within the mix of the business. How do you think about that shaping up this year in terms of higher growth rate potentially for 2018 versus 2017 and the impact on the margin? I think you've touched on applied being lower margin, but is that meaningful enough to impact overall incrementals and how much would it be offset on the top line with regards to\u2026 Mike Lamach : Yes. So, one of the issues in top I know from an analyst to investors perspective is to take that Dodge where ABI data. And about it you can do is to take that phase value. But, I\u2019ve always said that Dodge data would really account for about 50% of what we consider to be the market, the visible market would be would Dodge is reporting about 50% -- frankly for the good 50% is the negotiated piece of that -- the negotiated retrofit of the performance contracting side of that. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve got the added benefit of looking at a pipeline and those pipelines are well done. It\u2019s a process that we\u2019ve been running in our company for a long time. It\u2019s a high level of confidence about what gets reported in there and how we assign close rates and probability to those projects. And so, when I look at, what I see for 2018, I see a good runway and good projects. There is a number of very large projects that have the possibility of going in 2018 for us, that we generally wouldn\u2019t put into a forecast. We generally wouldn\u2019t even put into our guidance. But similar to what happened in 2016, we\u2019re at historic \u201917 a little bit for us, we\u2019re going to have a little bit of that 2018 as well. These projects will range from $50 million to $200 million apiece, and so they\u2019re going to move the numbers a great deal up in fact they hit. But excluding those, we see a strong pipeline including those, there is a very strong pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just switching to the industrial segment for a change. So compression tech you had pretty good equipment orders growth in the last say three quarters. The sales though have been down substantially in the equipment year-to-date. So I just wondered within compression tech, how we think about the conversion of that order number into different revenues and when we should start to see the equipment revenue line accelerate? Mike Lamach : One really good data point for us that I\u2019ll tell you on this call is that you know we\u2019re very indexed towards very large compressors. We\u2019re number one is centrifugal compression technology in that space. And of course you know that that carries 40 to 50% pull-through on service along with that overtime. And that has grown in the mid-20s, booking growth during the year, and it grew in the mid-20s again in the third quarter. So we\u2019re feeling good about what that means for 2018 shipments and even beginning to formulate early 2019 shipments around some of the larger compressors. So that\u2019s an exciting change for us as it relates to backlog being built in large compressors, and it's exciting that it relates to the kind of leverage we expect to see from that. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you. And then just circling back on the productivity and other inflation line in your margin bridge. You know historically in years when that have been good, it was about a 100 basis points tailwind 2012 or 2014, 2015 when you\u2019re talking about more aggressive measures on productivity for next year. Is that the type of tailwind you think that we should expect about a 100 bps from that line? Mike Lamach : Julian, without setting guides being carefully here. That\u2019s sort of the general theme about how we think about setting plans would be to have about 100 bps of positive spread there. And then I take you back to my boxer analogy and that works great sitting in November and December, and then as you get into January and take a punch to figure out how do you use all the tools at your disposals to win the fight. So that would be our sort of going in idea, and then we want to make sure we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re putting some additional levers in place around ideas like rooftop consolidation in G&A that would be additive to that. Our in the event of that inflation, our pricing wouldn\u2019t behave the way we expect it to. We\u2019ve got some additional counter measures in place. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Mike, I want to come back just a little bit again to China and just the maturation as its Tier 3 and Tier 4 strategy. Just a couple of points I\u2019m interested in. Where are you on product development for those companies -- for those cities? I am sorry. You mentioned de-contenting product to serve those markets. You have a product refresh or product redesign that needs to happen that kind of effectively address this. And also I\u2019m just wondering, you\u2019ve talked about the opportunity for service capture. What kind of service capture are you actually seeing in those markets? Mike Lamach : Yes. And to be clear, Jeff, we\u2019ve got all of the product now in the market place, the ducted and ductless and applied and controls in the marketplace. So, we\u2019re fully functional there. What will happen is, we'll get certain feature sets there are often specified by others into the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities. You got and you try to explain the value and the total cost of ownership around that and overtime, we\u2019re pretty successful with that. But initially, you tend to find feature side that carry lower margins and perhaps something you'd find in Beijing and Shanghai typically. In fact, the product development going on now around the unitary space, if you take the unitary product that we have and actually go the other way with that, which is some high efficiency unitary coming back in Tier 1, Tier 2 cities around that. And again this is all in the commercial space, not on the residential space at all. So, it\u2019s a very thoughtful strategy overtime about putting manufacturing product management operation in place, product growth teams, feet on the street, incrementally quite a few as a result of all this. And then excellent execution on the ground by the team there, to the point where you just don\u2019t forecast for 40% plus growth rate as you\u2019re doing your plans. You set goals and objectives around those sort of things, but you don't sort of plan those things, but the team has generated sort of -- they\u2019ve been on top of even though stretch goals, which to me is really solid execution. In the long run, it\u2019s building out a strong base and it\u2019s not changed, but half of the world\u2019s chillers and the last five years have gone in the China, half the world is chillers going to go in China in the next five years. And it makes sense like it does everywhere for us to have a full unitary, applied, controls, service and digital footprint and for that to be direct on the commercial side. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Jeff Sprague : And on the service capture side of thing, how is that playing out? Mike Lamach : Yes. When I look back to 2008, 2009, it would have been in that 10% range compared to North America or Western Europe 50%. Today, it\u2019s in that 20%, 25% range, and it will continue to move up, and over the next say 5 to 10 years look alike Western Europe and North America no doubt about that. The equipments get more sophisticated, customers expectations around energy efficiency and around sustainability goals in China much more stringent than they have been in the past. All those things really lead more towards the OEM having the advantage in maintaining the equipment. Jeff Sprague : How much actual physical capacity are you needing to add to accomplish this? I mean there is certainly concerns that there is just excess manufacturing capacity in the space fairly your winning orders and growing your business and therefore they need some. But, how do you balance that risk reward? Mike Lamach : Yes, we don\u2019t have to need to build the additional factories in Asia. We\u2019ve got a substantial footprint today and we continue to lien it out. So, we\u2019re -- lines are running are faster and less space. And the more scale we get the faster we can run the lines and hypothetically the less space per dollar of margin we\u2019re going to need. So, I don\u2019t have the plan thus needing to build the factory in China at any point in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : So maybe going back to price for a second. We heard from Watsco this morning that some of its vendors were starting to advertise the pricing increases in the fourth quarter. Are you guys trying to pull forward price in 4Q? Or should we think about that as being like typical like 1Q type event? Sue Carter : No, I mean, Joe, I think we follow our normal cadence some of which might be in the fourth quarter and some in the first quarter, but there is no discussion that we\u2019re having about pulling any of that forward on a different schedule than normal. Mike Lamach : And Joe just to confirm, price and res is exceeding material inflation, and we grew margins again in the quarter. The hurricane impact to us was not in the res space, and in res space, we were able to move inventory into the market and we\u2019re well positioned there. The impact for us was really losing three weeks of time in Puerto Rico at the manufacturing facility. And they are just to skip to it, it wasn\u2019t the factory itself, we had the factory up and running with our own temporary power with plenty of diesel, plenty of water. It was the fact that it was so difficult for our employees in the market that many of them who lost the home, lost everything, will just enable to come to work or didn\u2019t have the means to come to work to be able to build products. So we\u2019re back up, we've been back up for couple of weeks, we\u2019re running at rate where we haven\u2019t missed a beat in terms of customers there. We plan ahead to build for hurricanes in advance and so we have stock there just waiting for the ports to open up a little bit to shift them back out. But just to skip to that, it really wasn\u2019t our res business for us and it\u2019s largely in the thermochem business. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s helpful color, Mike. Maybe my follow-up here and this is just perhaps refreshing my memory, but I thought you guys were targeting investments in the second half of the year that were roughly two times out of the first half. So, we were thinking it was going to be closer to like call it $40 million of spend in the second half. I think you did about 11 this quarter, so should we think about the fourth quarter as being pretty highly loaded with an uptick in investments or you\u2019re pulling back on spend a little bit? Sue Carter : Joe, that\u2019s an interesting area. We are pulling back a little bit, but let me tell you how that\u2019s actually coming about because this is not Mike and I going out and saying, we need to cut investments. So, I would expect the fourth quarter to be a little higher than the third quarter, but no more near what the math would tell you that you would pull in, it's not 30 by any stretch. But our businesses as we closer to actually going through the projects that are in the investment. And again our investments are mostly in new products development channel, and some IT type of investments are actually looking at the projects, and then return on those projects are not coming to the conclusion that the returns are not at the expectations that they have and we have as a company. And so, they\u2019re the ones pulling them off the table and perhaps going back to do some additional work on those business cases and maybe they'll show up again in 2018, but it\u2019s really SPU driven pulling down those investments in the back half of the year and we\u2019re very supportive of that on for those reasons. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hey, just a question on sort of management succession. You\u2019ve had some recent changes at the top. I think some has been scheduled like Didier and Robert, but I think Gary Michel was probably not expected. Could you just tell us as to what this means about sort of operational directional of the Company this transition at the top? And what\u2019s happening with Gary\u2019s role? Thank you. Mike Lamach : Yes, thanks Andy. It\u2019s a good probably opportunity to step back and talk about all the changes, some of which you mentioned and some that there\u2019ll be a good catch up on. Robert and Didier have been great partner to this company for a long time, both had plans for 2018 retirements, we begin to put pen and paper on January 2017, and we\u2019ve got Robert who will step out in January of 2018 and Didier in September of 2018. So, we\u2019re able to benefit from their involvement for some time yet. At that point, we begin to plan and then early September, the 5th of September, we actually pointed Dave Regnery as the EVP combining those two roles. And really what\u2019s happened here is we\u2019ve had very strong consistent leadership at the SP level for now long time. We\u2019re not at the same place we were five years ago and so the role has changed and I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in Dave and Dave\u2019s capability, 30 years for the Company, and obviously doing a great job with the HVAC business in North America and EMEA. Lived in different parts of the world and managed about every part of the Company at one point there or another. At the same time, we put Dave in that role. We moved Donny Simmons into Dave\u2019s role. Now, Donny, you all would have met at our Investor Day. Donny was leading fluid, material, handling, power tools. He led a large part of the commercial North America and trained organization before that. Before that, he was in finance both the climate segment and going all the way back TK. So, Donny stepped into that role. A couple of weeks later, Gary had announced his intention to retire from the Company at the end of September. Concurrent with Gary\u2019s announcement, we\u2019ve appointed Jason Bingham. Jason is the President for HVAC and Supply. He also spoke at the Analyst Conference, if you recall. Jason was running our controls contracting and digital business. It\u2019s been built into a $1 billion plus business for us overtime, and he\u2019s got a 26 years tenure with the Company going back to 1991, strong commercial, strong residential background. So, he is a fish in water, really in the res business. And then, we had also the planned retirement of Marc Dufour. Marc runs our Club Car business and Marc is going to retire in January of 2018. So, we announced Marc's retirement around the same time, 36 years with us over that period of time. And Mark Wagner who you would have all again met at [indiscernible] Conference, Mark was one of the speakers there is running our Club Car for us. So, it\u2019s really leveraging very strong total talent, very good communication by the senior executives in the Company around their succession plans and timing. The tremendous willingness with them to work with us around dates so that it could work for everybody and have a good continuity. We\u2019re very excited about the changes that we\u2019ve got and these guys have been in place now for a couple of months, good month at this point and its pretty exciting. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question on cost and I apologize I\u2019m sort of beating the dead horse here. Just so we have slightly lower spent in the quarter, slightly lower investment spent than we\u2019re planning on. I would imagine that China and Middle East strategy, you know you\u2019ve had that for awhile. So I\u2019m just still sort of a little bit missing, why you\u2019re going with this earnings shortfall? Is it because sort of China and Middle East and that up being more expensive than we\u2019re expected? Or is there something else on top of that below the surface that was weaker than we expect? And I apologize if I missed it. Mike Lamach : Yes, and if I put it really simply I would say that the Tier 3, Tier 4 strategy and some of the larger infrastructure projects are caring about five points lower gross margin. Let\u2019s say then the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities, historical applied market. And the fact that we\u2019ve grown that at a rate twice the rate of the other business has just put margin mix pressure there. And that again adding a 178 people into the mix, it takes awhile for those people to ramp up. But you know again 40 plus % growth rate sets the ramping up pretty quickly. Sue Carter : And the other element, Andrew, is that. Asia, China specifically has had material inflation that has escalated throughout the year. So when we talk about that being persistent, it is very persistent in fact if I look at where biggest impact occurs, it\u2019s a commercial HVAC and North America followed by Asia Pacific followed by residential. So, they\u2019ve also had that headwind that was bigger than what we thought earlier in the year and that also contributes to that dynamic. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. James Picariello : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for fit me in. This is James Picariello actually. So just on M&A, you mentioned 200 million commitment year-to-date, it looks like only 60 million has actually been spent. So, is it safe to assume that the telematics asset represents most of that difference? And then also, how do you bridge to this 4 to 500 million range? What\u2019s the timing between an actual agreement and close of the deal, so just trying to get a sense there? Thanks. Mike Lamach : Yes, James I think we've closed four transaction or will close four transaction by the end of the month. So I wouldn\u2019t assume that all to be in the telematics space and that would have been the largest of the group. But the couple of 100 million is really laid out and will have that close by the end of the month. The balance of that is our best guess of stuff in flight of which I would say between $50 million and $200 million. There is a number of things in flight there that the timing could be off slightly, it could be a quarter off here or there, but those are lining up nicely as well to. And it ranges between, channel and technology being added to the core portfolio. James Picariello : Okay. And then just last one on the Residential HVAC replacement opportunity. How has -- how have prior storms really pulled through that demand, and then typically over what timeframe? Just trying to get your early assessment of what the opportunity could be next year and maybe even beyond that? Thanks. Mike Lamach : Yes, the commercial is a little easier to predict than res. Commercial, you can -- we can predict a great rental boom and followed by immediate service requirement and we put people into those locations to be able to provide service from out of states. And then depending upon the criticality of what it is that you\u2019re conditioning space for, those things move really quick. Res, you got everything between the tip of the tail, which is people with insurance maybe a bit more fluent, who are able to step in very quickly without insurance and replace. You\u2019ve got actually the body of the bell curve which is folks are waiting for insurance that can take some time to process and it\u2019s probably at this point 2018 event, I should think about that. And you\u2019ve got sort of other part of the bell curve, people without insurance that may not be able to step in and buy that as well. So, that will take one year to three years before that happens. So, generally over one year or two years, you see growth as a result of us, so the net of it usually growth, but it usually takes one year to two years for that to show up. James Picariello : Thanks, guys. Mike Lamach : On the res side -- on the res side that is, on the commercial side, it\u2019s quicker. Operator : I will now turn the call over to Mr. Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Great. Thank you. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining today\u2019s call. As usual, we will be around to take any questions that you may have today or over the coming days. And we look forward to seeing many of you on the road in the coming weeks and into 2018. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll-Rand's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. This call is also being webcast on our Web site at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our Web site. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. The participants on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO, and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to slide four, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As I've said a number of times since we held our Analyst Day in May of 2017, I am more bullish about Ingersoll-Rand's position to execute on our strategy to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years that I've been at any other time in my tenure as CEO. Please go to slide four. I'd like to start this morning by reviewing the fundamental elements of our business strategy, because in the midst of any busy earnings season, it's easy to move directly to microtrends and quarterly pluses and minuses and to lose sight of the larger fundamental picture and trends that really drive value for long-term shareholders. First, our underlying strategic objectives continue to be to deliver profitable growth through leadership positions and durable markets underpinned by global megatrends such as sustainability and the need to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, homes, industrial, and transport markets around the world. We focus on innovation and delivering the most reliable energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly products and services available, enabled by digital and other exponential technologies. We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources, and generating productivity for our customers. We maintain a healthy level of investment in our businesses to sustain leading brands which are number one or number two in virtually every market in which we participate. It's important to highlight that we continue to invest to maintain the portfolio with superior breadth and depth in nearly every major product category in which we compete. In 2017, we continued our product growth team efforts, launching approximately 70 new major products throughout the world. We continue to strengthen our digital capabilities and creating value with customers and achieving competitive advantage. We launched TracKing, Thermo King's new asset management system through [ph] remote connectivity, best-in-class mobile apps, and data gathering, customers make their fleets more predictable and traceable, without taking assets off the roads, removing perishable goods. This ultimately strengthens their control and creates efficiencies. This month, we introduced the Club Car Tempo Connect, the first car available with standard digital technologies that enhance the experience for golfers and course owners. We also applied breakthrough digital technology such as Trane GO to strengthen our residential HVAC connection with consumers and help them make more informed purchase decisions. This has resulted in a 2017 increase of 30% in our lead in closure rate with consumers. In 2017 alone, we doubled the size of our EcoWise portfolio of products, significantly ahead of regulatory requirements. These are products that reduce the impact on the environment and meet regulatory requirements for the use of next-generation low global warming potential refrigerants without compromising efficiency and operating performance. This month, we introduced the latest addition to the EcoWise portfolio, the Trane Agility, a new water-cooled centrifugal chiller product line ideal for retrofitting existing commercial buildings. In Compression Technologies we continued to expand our products and service offerings. In 2018, we'll significantly expand our market coverage for contact coolant [ph] compressors to meet growing customer demand. On the services side, we'll be adding remote connectivity to rotary and oil-free equipment service offerings across North America. Our pipeline of innovation that solves complex customer problems is as exciting as ever, and we have no intention of slowing down. Second, our business model is designed to excel at delivering strong top line incremental margins and free cash flow through our business operating system over the long-term. Our business operating system underpins everything we do, and it enables us to consistently generate high levels of free cash flow which fuels our dynamic capital allocation strategy. In 2017, our business operating system enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.3 billion, which was 118% of adjusted net income. While the leverage in our Climate business we below our historical and long-term objectives, we overcame a number of headwinds during 2017, including persistent rising inflation, and more pronounced success in penetrating underserved HVAC markets in China than we had anticipated. We expect our Climate segment to return to historical leverage levels in 2018 and beyond. 2017 capital allocation was dynamic and balanced with healthy investments and organic innovation, and new acquisitions and partnerships in key strategic channels and technologies. We also continued to substantially increase the divided during the year, and repurchased over $1 billion of our outstanding shares. And finally, over the years we've built an experienced management team and a high-performance culture which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver strong results consistently over the long term. I hope this provides further insight into why I've never been so excited about the next few years for Ingersoll-Rand. We are extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns going forward. Moving to slide five, and turning our attention back to 2017, we met or exceeded the commitments we made in January, 2017, when we gave our full-year 2017 guidance. We exceeded the top end of the range on the core financial metrics; revenue growth, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. Importantly, we also delivered against our capital allocation commitments, deploying $1.9 billion between dividends, share buybacks, and acquisitions. We met the lower end of our guidance range on adjusted operating margins. As we move through the presentation we'll spend time discussing our path to delivering improved operating margin leverage in 2018 as this is a key area of focus for us. And now I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter and our market outlook and guidance for 2018. Sue? Sue Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number six. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points to takeaway from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove solid operating and financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.02, an increase of 21% versus the year-ago period. We delivered high quality earnings which helped drive 2017 free cash flow to $1.3 billion or 118% of adjusted net income. Organic bookings and revenue growth was strong in both our Climate and Industrial segments. In the Industrial segment we delivered low-teens bookings growth in all three industrial businesses. We also delivered the strongest organic revenue growth quarter of the past three years. Additionally, the business continues to make steady improvements in its overall operating performance. On the Climate side, organic booking were up high single digits in Commercial HVAC, with low-teens growth in North America and solid growth in all other regions, except for Latin America. Organic revenue growth was also strong, up 6%, and was broad-based across all of our Climate businesses. Our Industrial business continues to strengthen its operational performance ahead of our expectations, with 160 basis points of improvement in adjusted operating margins on 5% organic revenue growth. Organic revenues were up low single digits in Compressor Technology and low-teens in Club Car and Industrial Products. Importantly, we also delivered balanced capital allocation results while meeting the commitments we laid out for investors in our guidance in January of 2017. We deployed $430 million on dividends, and increased the dividend 12.5% during the year, consistent with our commitment to maintaining a strong and growing divided over the long-term. We deployed $1 billion on share buybacks as the shares continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. To date, we've also deployed or entered into commitments for approximately $460 million in strategic value-accretive technology and channel acquisitions, two of which we announced in January of 2018. Please go to slide number seven. The focused execution of our business strategy underpinned by our business operating system enabled us to drive solid year-over-year financial performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 6%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 20 basis points, and an adjusted earnings per share increase of 21%. Strong gains in volume, productivity, and positive price more than offset headwinds from material cost inflation. Please go to slide number eight. Organic order growth was robust in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was the fastest organic order growth for the enterprise in over three years, with broad-based growth in nearly all businesses. Commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits. Commercial HVAC bookings in North America were up low-teens, and EMEA grew high single digits, while Asia grew low single digits. Our Transport business continued to demonstrate its diversity and resiliency, posting modest growth in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia, and strong growth in APUs, truck, air, and in the aftermarket business. These gains nearly offset expected weakness in the North America trailer market, netting a low single-digit decline in total transport orders. Industrial bookings were strong, up 12%, with low-teens growth in all three of the businesses. Regionally, North America, Latin America, and Asia all posted strong gains modestly offset by softer markets in EMEA. Please go to slide number nine, in our Climate segment organic revenue was up mid single digits in North America, up high single digits in Europe, and basically flat in Asia, where low-teens growth in China was offset by softness in other countries in the Asia Pacific region. In our Compression Technologies business North America was up low-teens in equipment and high single digits in parts and services. Industrial Products, which includes our Tools, Fluid Management, and Material Handling businesses, and Small Electric Vehicles were both up low-teens. Overall, North America and international revenues were up mid single digits, netting a 6% organic growth rate for the enterprise. Please go to slide number 10. Q4 adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points primarily driven by strong volume, productivity improvements, and positive price, partially offset by material inflation, investments in products and services, and lower margin business mix from our continued success penetrating underserved markets in China HVAC. We discussed the impact of China business mix on our third quarter call, but we'll spend some more time discussing our underserved market penetration strategy in our Topics of Interest section towards the end of our prepared remarks. Please go to slide 11. Our Climate segment delivered strong broad-based revenue growth across the business. Operating margins were impacted primarily by material inflation and our mix of business from underserved markets in China. Please go to slide 12. As previously noted, operating performance in our Industrial business continues to steadily improve across the board. In the fourth quarter, the segment delivered low-teens organic bookings growth, 160 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and 5% organic revenue growth. Our continued focus on improving the fundamental operations of the business is making industrial a stronger, more resilient business which should allow us lever up nicely as the industrial markets continue to gradually improve. Please go to slide 13. Strong execution of our strategy and our business operating system continues to deliver powerful free cash flow. We continue to grow earnings, manage working capital to the right levels including having inventory to meet growth and on-time customer delivery and invest in capital expenditures to support our businesses. We delivered $1.3 billion of free cash flow in 2017, which enabled us to maintain our strong balance sheet and retain optionality as our markets continue evolve. It also enabled us to execute against our balanced capital allocation priority and commitments to drive long-term value for shareholders. Please go to slide 14. In 2017, we executed a balanced capital allocation plan and delivered against the commitments we made out at the beginning of the year employing capital where it earns the best returns. We maintained a healthy level of business investments in product, technology, and innovation to extend our market leadership and to help customers solve their most complex challenges. We made strategic investments in value accretive technology and channel acquisition that further improved long-term shareholder returns. We maintained a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve and retain a BBB credit rating. We executed against our longstanding commitment to a reliable, strong, and growing dividend. We also raised the dividend 12.5% which is ahead of the rate of earnings growth. Additionally, we deployed approximately $1 billion on share repurchases as the shares continue to trade below their intrinsic value. As we look forward to 2018 and beyond, we want to be very clear about how we are thinking about capital allocation. We are committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the best return on investment opportunities. Our overarching strategy and priorities remain the same as I just outlined and that we executed in 2017. We have a strong balance sheet and good optionality, and we don\u2019t anticipate a need to add cash to our balance sheet for the foreseeable future. We are excited about the future and the opportunities that are ahead to deploy excess capital to the best RIO investments, whether that be investment in the business, raising the dividend, repurchasing shares, or making value accretive acquisitions. Please go to slide 15. Let me take a moment to discuss the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In December, we booked the impacts of U.S. tax reform through the P&L on a provisional basis. We booked in largely non-cash benefit from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new rate of 21% versus the prior 35% rate. We also booked a liability for repatriation tax of approximately $160 million, which is payable over the next eight years. We also booked a few other tax related entries in Q4. And all tax reform and other entries are in the non-GAAP tables presented with the press release. We have had access to our cash through our tax efficient structure for many years. We have utilized our cash to invest in our business in energy efficient and sustainable products and have returned cash to shareholders through our competitive and growing dividend and share repurchases. Our actual cash repatriation is expected to be between 10% and 20% of our year-end cash balance. We will continue to utilize our tax efficient structure in the future. And our projected tax rates are expected to remain in the low 20s. Please go to slide number 17. I would like to begin our guidance conversation with some color around what we are expecting from our end markets. Overall, global economic activity was helping in 2017. And a majority of economic indicators point to a continuation of this trend in 2018. With a positive economic backdrop and our strategic product portfolio focused on global megatrend such energy efficiency and sustainability, we see positive momentum in the majority of our market in 2018. The setup for North America commercial and residential HVAC market looks positive. And we are expecting a mid-single digit growth in these core markets. In North America, approximately half of our commercial business is services and parts where we had good growth throughout 2017 and where the nature of the business generally tends to provide a more stable and recurring annuity stream than put-in-place equipment which would be associated with things like new building starts. We have also had strong demand for upgrades to connected buildings and for energy retrofits to capture the energy efficiency savings from new equipment, controls, and diagnostics. In the residential market, replacement units make up approximately 80% of the total market. And as you can see from our bookings and sales growth in the fourth quarter, this market remains healthy. We expect to see continuing growth in both replacement and new construction in 2018. Outside of North America, commercial HVAC markets are not expected to be quite strong with EMEA and Asia expected to be flat to up slightly. We expect Latin America markets to be up low single-digits. Transport markets in the Americas are expected to be roughly flat compared to 2017. Low teens declines for North America trailers are expected to be offset by growth in trucks, auxiliary power units, and aftermarket parts. Transport in Europe is expected to be up based on growth in truck and trailers sales and bottoming of the marine container market. Asia-Pacific transport continues to show significant opportunity with the challenges of getting fresh food in and around densely populated cities. This business was up low teens last year, and we expect continued momentum in 2018. Global industrial markets generally continue to improve gradually as economy stabilizes and CapEx budgets expand. We remain cautiously optimistic about demand and expect global industrial markets to continue to show modest steady growth in 2018. We had solid improvement in order growth in North America and Europe in our short cycle industrial businesses. The markets in Asia modestly improved during the fourth quarter, and we expect continued modest improvement in 2018. The large long cycle compressor market started to improve in 2017 due to stabilization in the energy and heavy industry markets. Large long cycle bookings were up a high teens per cent in 2017 and ahead of our initial expectations, which is encouraging. These orders tend to have a cycle time of roughly 12 to 18 months. Golf utility vehicles and consumer vehicles combined are generally expected to be flat to slightly up across the globe. Our consumer vehicle continues to grow at a nice clip. And utility vehicles are also expected to have good growth in 2018. We expect the golf market to remain roughly flat. Letting this all out, we are forecasting mid-single digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid-single digit growth in residential HVAC, and low-single digit growth from our diversified portfolio in transport. We expect our compression technologies business and our industrial products business including the power tools, material handling, and fluid management businesses to be up mid-single digits overall. Small electric vehicles are expected to be up mid-single digits. Please go to slide 18. I will spend a few minutes walking you through the details for our 2018 guidance. Given the backdrop discussed on the previous slide, we expect total reported revenues to be up 5% to 5.5% in 2018 with both segments positively contributing. The difference between our reported and organic revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of positive foreign exchange and about 1 percentage point from 2017 acquisitions. For the enterprise, we expect to see solid leverage from higher volumes, improved price, and continued high levels of material productivity and other productivity more than offsetting material inflation. At the midpoint of our guidance, we would expect to see approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the enterprise. Please go to slide 19. We expect continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2018 to be in the range of $5 to $5.20, excluding about $0.20 of restructuring. We have modeled approximately $500 million in share repurchases into our guidance, which translates into approximately 250 million diluted for 2018. As I outlined earlier, we are committed to dynamic and balanced capital allocation that consistently deploys excess cash over time. Net the actual allocation of excess cash will depend on where we see the highest ROI opportunities over the coming quarters. Our target for free cash flow is equal to or greater than 100% of net income. The tax rate is estimated to be between 21% and 22% after including anticipated impacts of the December 2017 U.S. tax legislation. This is consistent with our prior long-term structural tax rate, so our puts and takes, the bottom line result is that we are not expecting a change for Ingersoll-Rand. For modeling purposes, we also offer the following guidance. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $250 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million, up from approximately $220 million in 2017, primarily driven by factory consolidation and localization initiatives. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike to cover key investor topics of interest, and to close with a summary of key points. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Sue. I'm going to spend the balance of our prepared remarks discussing the topics of interest we\u2019ve received from many of you ahead of the call, and then do a quick wrap up summary before we open the floor for questions. Thanks to all of you who provided feedback to help us improve our focus on the issues that matter most to you in the section. Please go to slide 21. The first topic I\u2019ll cover is our China strategy. It's one of the topics that have garnered a lot of interest from investors. So we want to spend some time providing more detail in strategy and expected impact going forward. First, it's important to note that our strategy in China for Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities is a proven strategy we've been successfully implementing in Tier 1 markets and the applied space as we first entered the market. Our strategy is to enter underserved geographic and vertical markets by using a direct sales force selling the product the way we do in most mature markets at the total cost of ownership basis versus the way you would sell an undifferentiated commodity. This takes a talented network of sales people, and other infrastructure investments to deploy, which we've been doing for the past 18 months. Once the customer has experience with our systems and sees the value in the total cost of ownership equation, we aim to become the basis for design, whereby we are advantaged with system reliability, energy conservation, and greenhouse gas emission reductions. We fundamentally transform the market landscape to compete on total value terms and are rewarded for our quality, technology and innovation, and service support. Margins improve as they would in any market where a product or service is differentiated and has a unique value proposition customers are willing to pay for. With applied equipment comes the opportunity to rapidly grow our service business, which further enhances long-term margins. This strategy has been very successful for us, particularly in 2017 as we accelerated investments. The negative price versus material cost impact is primarily the mix impact of entrance into these new markets, compounded by material inflation which has been persistent in the region. It's resulted in an impact of more than half of our total negative price versus the material cost spread in 2017. So it's important to understand the strategy, the temporary impact from the shift in our mix in China, and the long-term end game. We expect a few things to improve in 2018. First, pricing should improve in these markets as we move through the year. Second, we expect a less inflationary environment in 2018 as we begin to lap 2017 inflation. Third, we've largely completed the necessary infrastructure investments to complete execution of our strategy in 2018. We believe investment should become less of a headwind versus 2018. And lastly, we are focused on growing our services mix in these markets which should enhance future margins. In summary, for the reason stated, we expect China to be EPS accretive in 2018, and believe our investments here will help build shareholder value for years to come. Please go to slide 22. Looking at 2018, we expect to deliver improved operating leverage through the P&L based on a number of factors. First, we expect to drive profitable volume growth based on the continued health of our core markets, as Sue detailed earlier. We also expect to see higher pricing in 2018 versus 2017, and have already put through price increases to cover expected inflation in many parts of our business which should improve our price versus material cost equation. In 2017, we had a negative price versus material inflation spread of approximately 60 basis points. We expect to narrow this GAAP considerably, which in and of itself would be a tailwind of margins in 2018. Additionally, we continue to drive material and other productivity through the P&L, which is always an important driver of margin improvement in our business operating system. Looking at the positive price we've seen, combined with the positive material cost productivity we've driven, which is a component of our productivity bridge. We had a positive spread versus material inflation of 70 basis points in 2017, and would expect similar performance in 2018. Additionally, we will see a reduction in headwinds from our China strategy, as I detailed earlier. And lastly, as discussed at our analyst day, we see good opportunity to deliver significantly higher levels of profitability in our large engineered-to-order compressor technology, and increasing demand for our higher-margin tools, fluid management, and material handling products, along with continued mix shift from golf to consumer, small electric vehicles. Please go to slide 23. This has been a key topic of interest in the past, so we wanted to include it in our prepared remarks as we close out the year. The bottom line is that our Thermo King business is resilient, and our 2017 performance bears this out. During 2017, we achieved a low-single-digit increase in total Thermo King revenues in the face of the North American trailer market decline, and we maintained relatively flat margins for the business at the same time. Our diversification strategy yielded results, with growth in worldwide truck, auxiliary power units, aftermarket, and with particular regional strength in Asia. Looking at 2018, we're expecting similar performance across the business. Please go to slide 24. As previously discussed, we have spent or committed approximately $460 million over the past 12 months on strategic acquisitions or JV partnerships. In January, we announced our JV with Mitsubishi Electric, which is pending regulatory approval. Once completed, the new joint venture will include marketing, sales and distribution support, a variable speed mini-split, multi-split, in variable refrigerant flow, heating and air-conditioning systems in the U.S. and select Latin American countries. We also announced our acquisition of ICS Cool Energy. ICS Cool Energy is one of the largest temporary HVAC rental businesses in Western Europe. ICS Cool Energy also sells, installs, and services high-performance temperature-controlled systems for all types of industrial processes. With a strong fit with our HVAC business, expands our sales and service channel in key Western European markets, and strengthens our growth plans. Turning to slide 25, I'll close our prepared remarks where I began. I've never been more excited about the future prospects in Ingersoll-Rand in my tenure as CEO than I am right now. The company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably, supported by global megatrends such as energy efficiency and sustainability. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We've experienced management and a high-performing team culture that breathes operational excellence into everything we do. And lastly, we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years. 2017 was a good example. We had balanced execution of capital deployment across a number of high-priority, high ROI areas, including investment in the business, a strong and growing dividend, value-accretive M&A, and significant share repurchases as the stock continues to trade below its intrinsic value. Going forward, these priorities remain the same, and our commitment to the deployment or excess capital is unchanged. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Winoker from UBS. Steve, your line is open. Steve Winoker : Thanks, and good morning all. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Steve. Sue Carter : Good morning. Steve Winoker : Hey, just first on guidance. Just want to understand again the relationship between the bookings that are trending, 8% organic and the 3% to 3.5% organic guidance on growth. Obviously there's a lag time on order to delivery in the industrial side, but maybe help us understand that. And also on the free cash flow conversion, I guess the CapEx increase. As there are inventory bill or are there other things that are kind of forcing that step-down versus prior year? Mike Lamach : Steve, I'll do the first one, which the bookings came late in the fourth quarter, and so the exact timing of some of the larger compressor and applied shipments would still be a question mark. So whether that's a fourth quarter '18 or first quarter of '19 delivery it's TBD, and we'll update that throughout the year. But the bookings were definitely much stronger, and that was a surprise really from where we thought we would be at the end of the year. Backlogs were up about 12% going into the year. So we'll update shipments as we go further into the year. And Sue, on CapEx? Sue Carter : Yes, so, on CapEx, Steve, as we look at it, so we guided $300 million for 2018. When we started out the 2017 guidance we gave you about $250 million, we came in at about $220. So in other words, $30 million was really CapEx that we didn\u2019t spend in 2017 that we're going to move over into 2018. So you have just a slight amount of increase. The other thing that I would say is when you think about the $300 million. The $300 million is primarily going to be new product introductions. It's going to -- the capital associated with that, it's going to be on factories for increasing productivity and increasing cost reduction ideas in our factories. So those primary objectives, when you think about them, are very clear with our growing operating margin and operating leverage. So we think that that $300 million is a good use of capital for 2018. Steve Winoker : Okay. And Mike, just at a higher level, if we go back to the time that you took over and all the changes that you've made, particularly in the product development and introduction front, you've clearly run ahead on share of a number of HVAC competitors over this timeframe. But now we're seeing some of these other guys actually stepping up their own product introductions, very aggressively stepping up their own channel investments apparently more aggressively. Do you see the competitive environment getting more intense at all? Any forward thoughts on how that might impact the broader environment pricing, et cetera? Mike Lamach : Steve, thanks. It's hard to look back now over nine years. It seems like it's a long time to look back. But one thing that we've been consistent about is just the level of investment that we've been pounding through every year on good ROIC projects. As Sue mentioned, stepping up on capital in those areas, the innovation pipeline looks solid. We had a lot of introductions, and 17 more planned for '18. So I think we do have a positive gap in the technologies and systems that we're putting out in the marketplace. And we've always known that we've got large competitors out there that are capable as well. So we intend to just continue to keep the drumbeat moving and keep innovation out in front. So we know where the competition is at relative to current launches, and we know what our pipeline looks like. And I would imagine that we're going to be able to maintain technology positive gap for some time. Steve Winoker : Okay, great. Thanks. Good luck. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good day everyone. I had just a couple of things if I could. Also, Mike, just on the sales outlook. You addressed Industrial, it also seems like it has the same question about Climate given the way you're exiting here. Is there anything particular in the tone of orders or the forward look that gives you some pause in the top line in Climate for 2018? Mike Lamach : Jeff, when you say some pause, just tell me what you're referring to there? Jeff Sprague : Well, I'm just looking at order rates that we seem to support maybe more than 3% organic growth in the business for 2018. Mike Lamach : Yes, I mean the thing we don\u2019t know, Jeff, is really the timing of fourth quarter and first quarter, whether it's '18 or '19. And these large bookings come in very late in the year, and we're really trying to assess at this point in time exactly when customers are going to need them. So it's difficult to predict. I mean clearly carrying 12% increased backlog year-over-year is a great thing relative to the revenue guidance that we've given. These are longer lead, large projects that we just need to work through a little more time to understand the exact timing. Jeff Sprague : And could you elaborate a little bit, Mike, just on your confidence on better China price in 2018. Does that reflect just the outright price increase initiatives or is it something that's happening in the mix of the business, a little color there to understand how that plays off? Mike Lamach : Yes, so Jeff, we've been increasing price throughout Climate globally including Climate throughout 2017, in the back-half of the year in particular. And so I'm confident that pricing increases, because we've in some ways priced those projects coming through to shipment in 2018. I think competitive dynamics there would point to rise in prices in China as well. So I think that markets there are recovering in commodities has been something that's been felt by all competition. So you're seeing pricing coming through in the marketplace. And I think we've got a pretty good handle on what's happening, at least early in the year from a commodity perspective. So I feel like that gap is certainly going to close across the company and China. Beginning in the first quarter, frankly the gap closes, and then throughout the year. It's not really a hockey stick at all. I mean it's not a first-half second-half equation. I think that the leverage frankly is fairly linear through the year for us. Jeff Sprague : And just a quick one for Sue, if I could, repatriating 10% or 20% of your cash, so are you suggesting that although you're on a Irish territorial system before some of your cash was stranded, and you're now pulling that back or was there some other nuance in that comment? Sue Carter : No, there was no nuance in the comment, Jeff. What that really is, is some of our international entities that roll up under the U.S. structure, so the entities report into the U.S., and where as previously we had access to our cash through intercompany loans and through other mechanisms. We've going to use the tax reform and the repatriation tax that we're going to pay over the next eight years to bring back a small portion of that cash to the U.S.. And so you can obviously calculate this is roughly about $300 million. And the only reason really to signal that is we did not have a lot of cash that we did not have access to or that was a big part of the repatriation. So I was just trying to give you context on what the amount would be. And the reason it's an approximation is we have to go through all of the detailed works now that we've figured out the amount of tax with what the in-country rules are, how you would go about doing that timing of doing that, et cetera. So it was nothing more than a nuance to give you an idea of how much cash would come back to the U.S.. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve, your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi guys, good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just give us a little bit of color on what kind of price you're assuming in the guide here year-over-year, just roughly for the company? Mike Lamach : Yes, Steve I'd really tell you that -- I'd start by saying that nothing changes around how we target and think about the operating system of the company trying to get a 20-30 basis point positive spread off material inflation. So, all the internal plans and all the incentive plans, if you will, are set to be able to achieve that. We've essentially thought about the year as being relatively flat in terms of price and material inflation. And we've set in place or in motion productivity ideas on a contingency basis that you could even handle, say, a negative 30 and still be able to achieve the midpoint of guidance. So we're really set for kind of a minus 30 plus 30 with spread roughly at zero is how I would think about that. Steve Tusa : Okay. And again, you're not assuming flat price, you're assuming some price to offset the commodity, just to be clear on that, right? Mike Lamach : Those absolutely priced, and on that of that there's absolutely material productivity on top of that, so absolutely priced. Steve Tusa : Is most of that material productivity, is some of that coming from copper to aluminum or has that kind of already run its course? I know you guys were kind of ahead of the game on that front, in resi at least, or is it just blocking and tackling around product design? Mike Lamach : No, so a number of things, but it's supplier consolidation to the preferred supplier program helps. That would be a driver. Material usage, so the quantity and gauge of material used. Material change, as you mentioned, would be another one. And then there'd actually be product design as well. So, all of that will contribute to a material productivity number. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just one last one, you mentioned that in the press release it sounded as if the China headwinds would be with you here in the first-half, although remedied pretty well for the full-year. You just mentioned that basically you're going to be linear on price cost over the course of the year. Should we think about the year as being any different from a seasonality perspective? And I think in the past you've said 45%-ish of earnings in the first-half, I think 10% to 12% in the first quarter. How should we kind of think about, at a high level, the seasonality of the year with these dynamics? Mike Lamach : Sequentially, on your first question, really around pricing material cost inflation, we improve Q4 to Q1. It improves dramatically. You could think about maybe 50 basis points would be something that we would be thinking about in terms of that. So there's an immediate improvement I think Q1 to Q4 from that point of view. As it relates to the seasonality, I think you're right. If you go back over our four or five-year average it runs, say, 10.5% to 12.5%. I would tell you that at least initially I would be guiding you toward the lower end of that as it relates to just making sure that we've got this all contained around price to inflation, and it flows through the way that it should. So we feel good about what we're doing, but clearly we fully understand the burden of proof is on the first quarter, and so we're prepared for that. Steve Tusa : Yes, well in the past you guys have smartly set a low bar and beat it, so kudos to you guys for keeping things reasonable here and not seeming to stretch. So thanks for the answers. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Mike Lamach : Hi, Andy. Sue Carter : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, in the past you've talked about having good visibility into North American commercial HVAC markets. And it looks like bookings accelerated again in the quarter. Was that just easier comparison, did you see any pickup from hurricane-related work, and can you talk about any differences you're seeing in applied versus unitary markets? Mike Lamach : Remember, quarter 4 last year for us was -- and in '16 was really strong. So I think that this strong quarter 4 that we booked is coming back-to-back really off combined healthy stack of bookings, so that, there's no easy comp there at all for us. There's larger projects that we have not planned in '18 that would dramatically change '18, and that would create a comp, obviously an issue for '19. But there are really no comp issues other than tough comps, '17 to '18 from that point of view. The visibility really hasn\u2019t changed much. Institutional projects take longer. They're something that we work on with customers to help design and specify, and then move through the process of tendering, and awarding, and executing. So we tend to have more visibility on that, and that continues. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, that's helpful. And then you mentioned the Industrial team is doing a good job on margin. But if I look at the income at the margin it was mid-30s in 4Q. It looks like you're only guiding to sort of mid-20s in '18. You talked about the large engineered-to-order compressors starting to ramp, which you know have been a bit of a drag on margins, so. And we know you've taken a lot of costs out of business. So again, is it just kind of conservatism, you've got to wait to see how this ramps up. But you could have pretty strong incremental margin growth in '18 if all things sort of step up the way they could? Mike Lamach : Well, we feel good about the variable cost leverage. And it really depends on how much of the shipments come through in the year and how much fixed cost leverage do we get on that volume. So it really is something that'll play out through the year for us. But clearly great 2017, and more confidence kind of going into '18, '19, and really confidence around the 2020 outlook that we gave some time ago, that this business is really ahead of schedule on that front, and performing well. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Great. Good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Mike, maybe going back to that commentary you made on price cost with plus or minus 30 basis points this year. If you think about the major inputs, typically you guys hedge copper ahead of the year. So I'd be curious to get any details on that. And then, last year, clearly Chinese steel was a huge negative impact, being, I'd call it, 40% last year. Seems like where we are today, it seems like that's a lot more manageable. And so I guess my question is, first, maybe some more details around your assumptions. And then secondly, what are the biggest swing factors in your mind to maybe even getting positive price cost this year? Sue Carter : Joe, let me start out on the material inflation side and what we're seeing in 2018. So one, there's obviously the Tier 1 commodities that are inflationary, Tier 2, and then there's also other components. So what I want to point out is that refrigerants are going to be inflationary in 2018, and let's call that about 10% of our overall inflation. We've also got some led that goes into the Club Car product that will be inflationary. After that, as I break it down, what we expect to see is inflation in Tier 1 commodities is going to be about half of the inflation that we see spread between copper, steel, and aluminum. And so when I think about copper, we do lock copper as we go forward. So we're going to enter any given quarter with about 70% of that locked. And we're entering 2018 just under 70% locked on copper for the year. But we do expect that to be an inflationary component. You're also correct, Joe, that when you think about the globe in terms of commodities and what happened in '17, and what we also expect to see in 2018, is that Asia is performing differently than prior expectations. So before 2017, i.e., they did take some steel capacity offline. They've done other things that have kept some of their material inflation actually pretty high compared to what you'd normally see. And then in the U.S., not having options for steel purchases offshore, and using what's happening is another large part of that. So we do expect to see inflation in copper, aluminum, as well as some steel perhaps in the later part of the year. But I also point out the refrigerant and some of the other components. Mike Lamach : Joe, I'd think about it as, and I've said before, that the nature of 2018 inflation seems more manageable to us than 2017. Some of that's got to do with the fact that copper is easier for us to take a look at and lock appropriately. And steel you get a little bit longer view, and it's sort of at a level right now where unless there's any trade policy shocks again to the system we feel that it's a more appropriate environment. So just in general, the nature or the profile of where the inflation is, is a bit easier for us to maintain, including refrigerants. Joe Ritchie : Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe just kind of switching gears, going back to Industrial for a second. I mean you're starting the year in such a better spot than you were last year just with your longer-cycle backlog, and clearly short-cycle trends remain good. When you look at the performance that you got this year from a margin perspective, it seems like you're being very conservative with your margin assumptions for 2018. And so to the extent you could comment on that, and then specifically around what are you getting from a pricing perspective as well on these orders, because it seems like your competitors are also putting through decent pricing increases. Mike Lamach : Yes, industrial pricing has been really good. It's been great, and so our productivity there has been less of a factor too. So you're dealing with good price, and material inflation is a bit more predictable than it's been on the climate side. That's all really positive. Restructuring that we're doing in '18, roughly let's call it, say, $60 million in restructuring there. Two-thirds of that really is completed early now in January. And it's about two-thirds of the total. And it's really geared in the industrial area. So really thinking about how that'll flow through during the course of the year, and what the paybacks might look like when complete, there's an opportunity there. I'd like to say there's an opportunity more than there's a risk there. But there's an opportunity there perhaps for us to maybe to do better. So I'm really optimistic about what's happened with bookings there, what's happened with the margins being ahead of schedule, and the fact that we've got an early start toward the productivity requirements that we need to have in '18 and '19 there. Joe Ritchie : Got it. If I can sneak one more in, Sue, ending share count for the year? Sue Carter : For 2018? Joe Ritchie : 2017? Sue Carter : 2017, the average diluted shares was about 253. Joe Ritchie : Okay, average. So what was ending for 12-31? Mike Lamach : Joe, we'll come back and grab another call. We'll find the number and\u2026 Sue Carter : Yes, I don\u2019t know off the top of my head. Mike Lamach : - another question. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Rich, your line is open. Rich Kwas : Hi, good morning everyone. Mike, on institutional projects you've talked about a couple or three projects that you thought could come online in '18. Is that embedded in the revenue forecast or are those pushed out a bit? Mike Lamach : No, they're not. They're not in the \u201818 forecast. That would be the upside of the forecast, but they are too big to throw in the number in forecast. I mean if they had done, they are going to be delivered really some in \u201818 but \u201819 and \u201820. They are going to be multi-year projects. Rich Kwas : Okay, all right. And then on M&A, with regards to the stuff done in \u201817, is there profit number or EPS number we can think about contributing the guide? Sue Carter : Yes, Rich, here\u2019s how we look at the M&A. So we talk about it, it would be about one point of revenue. We also are factoring in about mid teens EBITDA on those, which would equate to about $0.06 in 2018 and increasing in 2019 to $0.15 to $0.16 EPS increase. Mike Lamach : An EBITDA sort of in the higher teens closer to 20, really the difference in \u201818 is just a step up, but really good businesses. Rich Kwas : Right, okay. And then, last one on if you have some high cost that -- relatively high cost that\u2019s maturing in \u201818. I assume that\u2019s not factored into the guide, but are your kind of thoughts around refi-ing that, like you would be able to refi that at a pretty attractive rate at this point? Sue Carter : That\u2019s exactly right. So, our intention is to refinance the 2018 notes that come due in August 2018. You are also correct, it\u2019s at 6.75%. And obviously rates are much lower than that at this point. So, we do intend to refinance. We are watching the market and also being very conscious on any early break premiums and making sure that we have got the right mix there, but we do intend to refinance those. Rich Kwas : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. David, your line is open. David Raso : Good morning. On the price cost, it hasn\u2019t been positive year-over-year since 3Q \u201816. But, we are seeing for \u201818 given the first quarter, I suspect there is a quarter coming up within the base case that you see it turning positive again. Can you give us some sense of the cadence? How we think about? Is that kind of a post-China sell through? And then, it\u2019s more of a third quarter back half or to that even be on the table for as soon as 2Q -- at least as your base case guidance. Mike Lamach : Yes, I mentioned, Dave, that quarter four, quarter one, sequentially it\u2019s 550 basis points better in for the full year that gets flat. Quarter one would still be a negative relationship. So, it does imply sort of second, third, fourth quarter improving. You will see that improve throughout the balance of the year as shipments were made in Q2, Q3, Q4, and pricing already established and material cost that hopefully we have got a handle on the inflationary number. So, they sequentially get better throughout the year. David Raso : And just so we understand get comfort with the 50 bps improvement from 4Q to 1Q, so basically 4Q is down 80 bps. You are thinking of first quarter call it 30, how much of that improvement is what\u2019s happening in China, or how much is it your price actions you took to start this year and sort of what you are seeing year-to-date on price cost and the backlog? Mike Lamach : Well, it\u2019s all of the above, but it\u2019s a 50% of the whole price cost relationship with China. And if you throw the Middle East in there, you can say it\u2019s closer to 70% as China and the Middle East. And I would tell you that the China element really proportionally improved throughout the year as with the rest of the world. Pricing environment in China, we assume is getting better at that\u2019s been our experience so far. And as we have highlighted here earlier, we felt the material inflation part of that now is somewhat under control with capacity really being now rationalized in the marketplace and we feel better about that. David Raso : And not to push a little bit, but again of that improvement how much is that something you have sort of see in the backlog today domestically? And why it\u2019s still deteriorating, right? We have gone from 50 bps, 50 bps, 70 bps, now 80 bps. Even second derivative improvement will start to add some credence to, \"Hey, we are maybe getting to the worst of price cost.\" So I think your first quarter comment is significant, that\u2019s bps positive if it can develop. I am just trying to understand exactly the line of side on that. I mean how much is it\u2026 Mike Lamach : Of course, sure. David Raso : - so with the orders coming in today have a better price cost. Mike Lamach : Yes, in a commercial space, quarter one, we are shipping what we\u2019ve already booked. So, we feel like the price scenario is pretty well established at this point. There is book in turn. But where there\u2019s book in turn, it\u2019s typically dealt with by list prices. So talking about unitary product, it\u2019s going to have more list price than applied which is going to be very project specific. Well, the applied project specific was then quoted third quarter, fourth quarter, and shipping in the first and second quarter. The unitary had price increases going through as did our competitors. David Raso : Yes, it just seems that the unitary market is seeing a little bit of price realization to start the year. Mike Lamach : Yes. David Raso : And the applied as you said is already been booked. So I am just trying to make sure what framework here looks like. There clearly should be a second derivative improvement. No doubt price cost 1Q versus we just saw, but the line of sight, given you have to apply the unitary fields like what it's doing in the channel, China has had wildcard. We really should see hopefully this is a full 50 bps, right. I mean this doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s fake guesstimate. But it seems like something you have a good line of sight for the first quarter. That\u2019s fair assumption? Mike Lamach : Yes, David, something that really have to change in the first quarter here in the last couple of months for that to really change my guidance here. David Raso : Okay. Mike Lamach : And I don\u2019t know what that would be at this point. David Raso : Just real quick, on Thermo King domestic, I see you have North America trailer down for \u201818. Lately, you have seen -- I know they are lumpy -- but lately you have some better orders at the domestic market. Is Thermo King\u2019s trailer backlog right now not seeing any of that? Is there a bit of a tick up, but it\u2019s just too large a hole to kind of dig out of to be flat to up for the year. Just trying to understand that guide versus what we have seen of late? Mike Lamach : Yes, as we become less dependent around growth and margin for North American trailer, we are really just utilizing the ACT data here. So, we are not going to try to guess anymore than ACT on that. And it always comes down to which customer is ordering from who. And so, it\u2019s too hard to predict at this point, but ACT is calling the market down and we are just reflecting what they are saying. Operator : And your next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Joel, your line is open. Joel Tiss : Snuck on there, I wanted to ask sort of a little more structurally about the enterprise initiatives in I guess my thought is maybe that\u2019s running out of steam a little bit. But, I wanted to ask it more about the flexibility. Is there a way to increase the flexibility when you see changes in the market? And I am just kind of thinking about in the future maybe we are going to see some headwinds just from the cycle. Mike Lamach : Joel, there is a no quick that we are losing steam on the productivity idea that we\u2019ve got across the company. In fact, we are attacking parts that we hadn\u2019t attacked in the past. Warehousing, logistic, G&A cost where the profile of the company has changed over the years. Now we are catching up on some of those areas. So I don\u2019t -- in a short time we have got here. It will be difficult tell you about the all the areas we have got. But I have got confidence that we are not running out of any steam here at all in productivity. Operator : And I would now like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : We would like to thank everyone for joining us today. We\u2019ll be around in the coming days and weeks to take any questions that you may have, and I think Mike also wanted to make one closing comment as well. Mike Lamach : Yes, just one last comment. This is Joe Fimbianti\u2019s last quarterly call with us. And from all of us at Ingersoll-Rand and many the people that you have known over the years, Joe, on the call, thank you for 41 years, a 120 earnings calls beginning in April 1988. We wish you and your wife a great long healthy retirement, Joe. Thank you. Joe Fimbianti : Thank you, Mike. It\u2019s been an honor. Zac Nagle : Thank you everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Zac, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Please go to slide 3. We're off to a strong start for the year. But before I get into the details, I'd like to begin the call with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy which drives long-term value creation for shareholders. The first element of our strategy is to continually deliver profitable growth through leadership positions and durable markets. Our end markets are underpinned by global megatrends such as sustainability, and the need to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. We focus on innovation and delivering the most reliable energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly products and services available, enabled by digital and other exponential technologies. We excel at delivering energy efficiency, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers. We invest heavily in products and solutions to support our competitive edge here, and this continues to be a winning formula for us with our customers and our end markets. Our continued strong growth rates reflect that advantage. We also take the same advice we give our customers seriously. In 2014, we publicly committed to increase our energy efficiency and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions related to our operations and products. The commitment includes a 35% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations by 2020, which we achieved earlier this year, two years ahead of schedule. We conducted an energy audit of our own large facilities and upgraded air-conditioning systems, building controls and lighting, eliminated energy leakage from our compressed air systems, while measuring validating, and reporting the results. We are continuing to deepen our commitment with investments in renewable energy, both on-site at some of our large locations, and offsite through a power purchase agreement. We engaged our own Trane energy services business to provide a roadmap and how to be smarter about our energy purchases into organized investments that are responsible for the environment and good for our business. As it relates to energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we're proud to be walking the talk. Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at delivering strong top line incremental margins and free cash flow over the long term. Our business operating system underpins everything we do, and enables us to consistently generate high levels of free cash flow, which drives our dynamic capital allocation strategy. And finally, over the years we built an experienced management team and a high-performance culture which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver strong results consistently over the long term. As we consistently execute our strategy, we continue to build a stronger, more sustainable company for the long term, well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns. Moving to slide 4. I'd like to spend some time discussing how things are shaping up at this early stage in the year. It's important to note that given the seasonality of our business being heavily weighted towards Q2 and Q3, we are just a small fraction of the way into 2018. As I said earlier, we are off to a strong start and there are a lot of things that are going well. Our end markets are strong, and we are executing well as evidenced by our high levels of growth in both bookings and revenues globally in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Our Industrial segment continues to make steady improvement ahead of our expectations. All the hard work our Industrial team has done to transform the business commercially and operationally and to restructure the business to take costs out of the system is paying off. The Industrial end markets are also showing steady signs of recovery which is positive. Our China direct HVAC sales strategy that we've been highlighting since early 2017 is performing as expected with continued exceptional growth in the marketplace and with improving financials. We're also seeing positive signs the North American Trailer market will likely perform better than most had anticipated entering the year, based on tight industry capacity, regulatory changes in U. S. tax reform. Lastly, we're achieving positive pricing that is consistent with our expectations in targeted end markets to combat material cost inflation. On the other side of the ledger, material inflation across the industry and for Ingersoll-Rand is both volatile and persistent, and continues to be a headwind. We realized adjusted operating margin expansion of 20 basis points despite these increasing headwinds through strong volume and price. Commodity headwinds are broad-based across tier 1 and tier 2 markets and in freight where tight industry capacity is ratcheting up freight cost materially. We're managing the entire P&L to drive margin expansion in 2018, and are taking decisive actions across volume, pricing, productivity and our cost structure to help mitigate further impacts from inflationary headwinds. There are also a few wild cards in play including potential tariffs, potential for trade wars, and significant geopolitical uncertainty that challenge visibility into full year 2018. On balance, whilst it's still very early in the year, our Q1 results and our positive outlook for the balance of the year are encouraging and gives us confidence that we are well positioned to exceed the top end of our annual guidance ranges on both revenues and earnings per share. We'll provide a detailed guidance update after we have a couple of quarters under our belt on our Q2 earnings call consistent with our guidance cadence. Please go to slide 5. We've adopted a somewhat different format this quarter. We'll continue to provide transparency around the directional changes in bookings and revenue. Historically, the level of detail we provided combined with success of our strategic growth programs has offered a high level of specificity on our performance for investors but can create competitive challenges. Our intent is to provide additional insight into the key qualitative factors behind the numbers that are driving performance without providing a comparative roadmap. This format should provide investors a greater fundamental understanding of our business, which we believe is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders over time. So the sell-side analysts out there that follow the company, we really aren't trying to drive you crazy, but we are trying to be pragmatic on how we run the business. In the first quarter, we drove positive growth in bookings and revenue across the board as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Over the past few quarters, we have seen positive signs of a steady recovery in our Industrial end markets. Combined with continued healthy growth in the majority of our climate businesses globally, we saw positive growth across the board in the first quarter. Please go to slide number 6. This slide provides insights and color into the key drivers behind the chart in slide 5, and how're thinking about the outlook for the year albeit still at an early stage. In commercial HVAC, we're seeing positive growth in the markets globally with good growth in both equipment and services. North America growth was solid with gains in equipment, and particular strength in services, contracting and controls. Institutional growth was solid led by the education and healthcare markets. Europe, the Middle East and Africa commercial HVAC had solid growth across the board, and we saw additional growth in services from our rental service business, ICS Cool Energy, which we discussed on our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call, and closed early in the first quarter. Our direct sales strategy in China is on track with our expectations where we're seeing continued strong revenue growth and expect improving financials in 2018. Our outlook for total commercial HVAC remains healthy for 2018, and key economic and market indicators largely support our view. Turning to residential HVAC, revenues were also strong with continued share gain. Our market-leading Trane Go, our online total installed pricing transparency tool that we referenced during our Investor Day last year, is delivering well against our expectations with significant growth in leads and high conversion rates from leads to sales. Key economic indicators in this market also support continued growth through 2018, although we and the industry are lapping tough compares versus high growth rates in 2017. So that's an important factor to keep in mind. Transport continues to be a good news story for us. Our business remains diversified and resilient. We're also seeing improvement in the North American trailer outlook for 2018 fueled by tight shipping capacity, regulatory reforms and the benefit of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that allows for the immediate expensing of certain capital equipment purchases. We saw solid order momentum in quarter one. APU growth remained strong. The marine market is showing considerable strength through the first quarter, although we have a relative modest sized marine business. Bus and rail were mixed, again off a relatively moderate sized base for us. We're seeing continued solid growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa truck and trailer. We built this into a nice size business for us over time. Overall, the transport market should be stronger than we originally expected in 2018, primarily led by improvements in North America trailer and continued solid performance elsewhere. Compression Technology services is seeing continued signs of an industrial recovery, consistent with industrial production and other key indicators. Quarter one bookings and revenue growth was led by North America and China, with particular strength in services. For 2018, we expect to see solid growth in the majority of our markets and products. Small electric vehicle growth was healthy, driven largely by successful market penetration of our consumer vehicle, and we expect that to continue through 2018. We also expect to see continued good growth in our Industrial Products business, which is off to a strong start in quarter one. I hope this provides you with additional insight into our business and what we're seeing at this stage in the year. And now I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number seven. We delivered strong operating results in the first quarter, headlined by 23% year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth. Gains were driven by operating income improvement in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong volumes and supported by the realization of positive price on key products. Inflation was higher than we planned and a significant headwind to margin expansion. As Mike outlined earlier, netting out our Q1 performance and our visibility into the balance of the year, we are confident that we will exceed the high end of our guidance ranges on both revenue and earnings per share. We took $44 million in restructuring charges in Q1 driven primarily by footprint optimization in our Compression Technologies business as we continue to work to optimize that business for peak future performance. It's important to note that this restructuring was planned for Q1 as a part of our annual guidance of approximately $0.20 of restructuring. This is unchanged. Our Industrial business continues to perform well with good growth and 190 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. The investments we've made in fundamentally restructuring the business operations are paying off. Capital allocation was balanced in the quarter. We paid $112 million in dividends and repurchased $250 million in shares. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we anticipate regulatory approval of the Trane JV with Mitsubishi in the second quarter. Please go to slide number 8. As we've discussed, strong organic revenue growth coupled with adjusted operating margin expansion led to strong adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange and acquisition-related growth also provided tailwinds on reported revenues. Please go to slide number nine. Operating margin improvement was primarily driven by strong volume and positive price, partially offset by inflationary headwinds and continued investments in high ROI projects. Productivity in the quarter was low year-over-year but consistent with our expectations based on the timing of projects, and we expect improvement for the balance of the year. The 40 basis points negative price versus material inflation was largely consistent with our expectations for sequential improvement on this metric, despite significantly higher inflationary headwinds in the quarter. Please go to slide number 10. Strong operating income expansion in both our Climate and Industrial segments combined for approximately $0.14 of earnings per share, and were the primary drivers of our 23% earnings per share growth in the quarter. We saw a negative impact of about $0.01 from higher corporate expenses related to stock-based compensation primarily tied to time-based vesting. $0.01 from discrete interest expense associated with the company's debt refinancing in the quarter and $0.01 from modestly higher effective tax rate year-over-year. We also saw a $0.02 benefit from the impact of share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 year-to-date. Please go to slide number 11. Climate delivered 8% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins were lower by 50 basis points, impacted primarily by strong volume and positive price, more than offset by persistent inflationary headwinds in tier 1 and tier 2 materials and freight. Our direct sales strategy in China performed as expected, and we expect margins to sequentially improve as we move throughout the year. Please go to slide 12. Our Industrial business continues to make solid steady improvements in its operating performance. In the quarter, we delivered 9% organic revenue growth and 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Please turn to slide number 13. We maintained a strong balance sheet providing continued optionality as our markets evolve. Free cash flow was consistent with our expectations given normal seasonality in Q1, and we remain on track to deliver free cash flow equal to or greater than net income for the year. Please go to slide 14. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology and innovation, which are vital to our product leadership and market momentum. We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We will continue to make strategic investments in value-accretive technology and channel acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve, and we maintain a minimum commitment to repurchase shares sufficient to offset dilution. We also see value in share repurchases when shares trade below their intrinsic value. Please go to slide number 16. Moving on to our topics of interest section, we have one topic to cover that we know are on the minds of investors and worth addressing in our prepared remarks. Tariffs. I think the most important takeaway for the market is that we follow an in-region, for-region sourcing and manufacturing strategy. More than 95% of our products sold in the U.S. are sourced from the U.S. Net, the direct impact from U.S. tariffs on foreign imports should be relatively small. Additional tariffs have been proposed by the U.S. and other countries, but the details of those tariffs and the likelihood of their implementation is uncertain and negotiations are ongoing. So it's unclear how that will play out. We continue to watch this space closely. Over the long term, we are in an industry that recovers cost increases through price. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks before we take Q&A. Mike? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Sue. Please go to slide 17. We believe the company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably, supported by global megatrends such as energy efficiency and sustainability. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We've experienced management and a high performing team culture that breeds operational excellence in everything we do. And lastly, we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Steve Winoker of UBS. Your line is open. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks all, and good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, nice to see this level of growth. I just want to get a sense. Last quarter, you had talked about 1Q earnings contribution kind of being lower than seasonal norm. I think you talked about the low end of a normal 12% to 14% range for EPS. Should we expect that to still hold, or when you look at the changes late in this quarter, anything that would lead us to not believe in kind of normal seasonality now that we are hitting Q2, normally I guess, 32% \u2013 30% to 33%? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, Steve, the business over time has diversified in every way. We talked about that with Transport being more resilient, more diverse. The same thing is true in our commercial HVAC business globally, where service was a major contributor to us in the quarter, that's stripping equipment growth and that's through the form of contracts generally. So it's not just repair fix based on weather. Those sorts of things are helping smooth out a bit of the earnings. So it's hard to probably just go back to historical trends and say that that's the business going forward, because over time like we did with cash over many years, we've been working on smoothing out the cash profile of the company. So there's an operating side of the company to make sure that we are smoothing out between quarters as best we can. Even in the Club Car business, which has got it's own seasonality, the consumer vehicle strategy is a way of offsetting some of that golf seasonality that we normally see there. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : So what does that mean then in terms of what should we think about for the seasonality in Q2? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I think Q2 and Q3 will always be our strongest quarters. I just don't know that you can take 10% to 15% of quarter one and quarter two or 45% of quarter one and quarter two, and 55% in quarter three and quarter four anymore. I think at this point in time, we do know we're going to exceed the top end of our guidance. We don't know yet by how much. And we're going to get back to you in quarter two once we've seen quarter two, and I think we'll be more accurate at that point in time. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. On productivity versus other inflation, I think that's the first negative one I've seen overall in like 12 quarters. Maybe, is that just \u2013 and you've put investments elsewhere. So may be a little bit of clarity on that. What's your color on that one? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : There are a lot of major large projects that we invested in and executed in quarter one. And you saw that through structuring as an example. So we think we've loaded up the year and 2019 with good productivity to follow. So I expect to be our normal good productivity offsetting inflation for the year. It's just going to be heavier loaded on larger projects, meaning that there were probably fewer smaller projects we saw in the quarter, but it doesn't change the pipeline where we try to get 125% of what we think we need for the year into the pipeline, and the pipeline remains healthy. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And just on pricing. So you've already put kind of run pricing increases through parts of commercial resi. I mean, where are you relative to kind of the price increases given the commodity behavior already? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Pricing is really hitting expectations for us. We across the board achieved what we thought we would do in quarter one. We closed the gap quite significantly from quarter four. And believe that quarter one might look a little bit like quarter two, but what we've priced and will ship in the back half of the year and how we're thinking about price increases going forward throughout the year should lead to good performance in Q3, Q4. So the guidance we gave last time which was sort of a plus 30-basis point, minus 30-basis point and then biasing you towards the minus 30-basis point, we're really operating right within that minus 20 basis points, minus 30 basis points window. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. I'll hand it off. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Andy. Thank you. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Mike, this was the best quarterly Climate booking that we've seen in the last couple of years. If we go back to your guidance for the year, you had talked about mid single-digit accepted organic revenue growth for commercial HVAC. But it seems orders are trending a bit higher than that early. So maybe give us a little more color on the acceleration you've seen in orders. You previously mentioned that you can win some bigger applied projects or any of those in the bookings growth that you've had. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Andy. The nice news is there was nothing in the quarter one bookings that we would have called out are spiked out. That would be a difficult comp for next year. It was very broad based across the globe. And so if you think about going across the globe, North America is shaping up not the way we thought it would shape up, solid growth in equipment. And in institutional markets, education specifically would be around K-12 say versus colleges and universities, K-12 is strong typically with mid-year elections coming, we're seeing more bond issuances that are passing or on the dockets for updating aging school infrastructure. That's good news. Healthcare is strong. It's not so much in acute care. We're seeing that in a lot of the clinics and specialty hospitals there. That's good. There are more of them that's been positive. Other verticals are generally stable and positive. So if you look at ABI, auto sales, GDP growth, retail sales, non-resi fixed construction, vacancy rates, they all look good. They're all stable, are healthy, and they would point to low single to mid single-digit markets, and we would think that Trane will grow at or above the markets in North America. Europe is strong for us, particularly we're seeing that with a very high activity in our own sales pipelines. We're seeing obviously good contribution from the rental services business that we acquired in the quarter. Economic indicators there are positive around mid single-digits. Brexit is a bit of a wild card, but right now it's not showing up as much of an issue for us. Asia is led by China. Very strong for us, that's fundamentally the direct sales strategy we put in place. We are very pleased with what we're seeing there, including service growth that we had in the quarter. Realizing it's about half of Asia, other important markets for us like Singapore and Taiwan will be down just a little bit. India will be strong probably out mid single-digit. And Thailand is a nice market for us as well. We'll see modest growth. So anywhere across the world, and I probably would throw Brazil in there as well. Brazil was a good market for us in the quarter and we think that that's on the road to recovery. So just about every place we're running commercial HVAC operations, we're seeing good growth. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Mike, that's great color. So Mike or Sue, just shifting gears for a second. You previously mentioned that you could get 50 basis points of margin expansion overall for Ingersoll in 2018. Is that kind of margin expansion still possible in this environment given your price increases, and you're going to hit productivity projects harder here, or do you get to sort of the higher than your guidance previous guidance from better organic growth, and maybe some modest margin expansion? Like how do we think about that and specifically focusing on Climate margins as well? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. And it's early in the year. But I think that when you fundamentally boil it down to operating leverage, we'll see better operating leverage in the back half of the year. Some of this is price cost relationship. Some of this is the way that productivity and products are loaded into system. Part of it's based on the assumption that we see continued good volume and mix in the portfolio. So that goes the way it should go then I would say that we would see operating leverage for the company along the lines of what we guided to for the full year of 25%. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Usually my name is pretty easy to pronounce, but good morning, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Joe, we know who you are. Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, so it's a nice quarter. I want to kind of touch on the price cost discussion. Mike, 40 basis points of price cost headwinds this quarter. I know that you guys don't typically love to talk about cadence. But is the right way to think about it that like this is kind of the low watermark for price cost for the year just given the pricing actions that you've taken, or is 2Q going to look similar to 1Q? I'm just trying to get a sense for what your expectation is. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I think Q1 and Q2 will look relatively similar, but Q3 and Q4 will pick up. I think Q3, Q4 is relatively flat, particularly quarter four, meaning we're at that point matching cost increase. Now all that's predicated on us having an understanding of what's happening with inflation to the best of our ability. But from a pricing perspective we're layering in prices where prices are given to the market. So as an example HVAC will have a May increase as well. But on project specifically, which have unique pricing, it's factored into those tools as well for pricing into the market place. So I think the back half of the year is stronger, and that's how we kind of get to that minus 20 basis points , minus 30 basis points for the end of the year. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then maybe just I heard you talk about increased freight earlier. But maybe talk a little bit about how that impacted the quarter, and what you're seeing on the wage inflation side as well, and what you're doing to offset both. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, it's a double-edged sword, because if you think about our transport refrigeration customers, they are seeing a 30% increase in their rate per mile and great demand. And if you couple that with what they are doing in terms of taking advantage of tax reform, you're seeing growth in the transport refrigeration market. But on the flipside of that, if you think about the industry, and I'm not a comment specifically on what we've seen, but I'm going to tell you from an industry perspective on dry freight, it's up about 15% over the prior year. So what I would say is that sort of number in the marketplace that is out there, and it's a meaningful number to companies like ours. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Maybe one last one. And just thinking about the guidance for the year; historically, you guys have provided an update in 1Q. Is it really just a wildcard to play at this point, the tariffs and the trade wars on why you decided at this point to just wait until Q2 even though your commentary suggests that things are going to be better as the year progresses? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, there was a year Joe that we did give quarter one update. But generally speaking over a long period of time, we've always reserved for that until later in the year. To us, there are a lot of wildcards out there, inflation being one, but tariffs and trade wars is also something that's I think on a lot of people's minds. And we're seeing that, frankly, on larger industrial projects, decisions being made by customers there, where in that particular customer set, I think it's more concern about tariffs and the cost of input and the location of plants or lines that they would be thinking about either expanding in the U.S. or somewhere else as opposed to tax reform. So where in the transportation markets, our trucking customers have taken advantage of tax reform, as an example, not as worried about tariffs. We're seeing a little different response with our Industrial customers, I think delaying some actions. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you just talk about how that price cost headwind, I think you said negative 40 basis points in the first quarter, how that kind of trends throughout the year? How much worse that \u2013 I would assume it gets a little worse in the second and then recovers into the back half. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, price gets better in the second, so that's true. We think that inflation probably creeps up a little bit again in the second quarter. So you end up Q1, Q2 relatively flat, kind of think minus 40 basis points is probably a pretty good number there. As you trend through the back half of the year, there's a more meaningful increase in price. And you're really then offsetting which should be relatively flat inflation at that point, because you're lapping pretty high inflation numbers at that point as well. So I think that the back half of the year tends to look flat. The front half of the year tends to look at minus 40 basis points. So you're in that minus 20 basis points, minus 30 basis points range. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then when you \u2013 I'm not sure you gave this, but can you just talk about what your resi performance was in the quarter from a bookings and revenue perspective? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, very solid. Very solid. Continued share gain there, and that was consistent with our expectations. Replacement and new construction, both healthy for us, obviously driven by unemployment and GDP being stable and other indicators that are favoring that. The Trane Go platform, which is the whole total installed pricing transparency tool, is really delivering some significant growth for us, and we're seeing higher leads, higher conversion rates, that's again driving the share gain, I think, there for us as well. And you know this very well, Steve, the tougher market compares Q2 to Q4, but we still think the market will be up low to mid single-digits and we expect share gain to continue there for us. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Were you up double-digit in the first quarter? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Not going to comment on specifically there. But I would say that there was share gain in the quarter. And obviously, you all know that it was a pretty good quarter for the industry. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Your line is open. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. So two questions. I mean, I guess, one, Mike, as you think about making the turn, this puts a fair amount of pressure on your third quarter just to kind of stand and deliver, right? You become a third quarter team because the seasonality in association with your business. And I know you don't want to get into quarterly guidance or the quarterly cadence. But what will be the expectations for incremental margins in the Climate business in the third quarter to cause you to raise your guidance for the full year? What do you think is implied, the line in the sand for the margin conversion we should expect to see in the third quarter? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I'd start with there's really good visibility around Q3 as we stand here in April with half the business being service and the other half being equipment. Most of that equipment being in the backlog and really not relying heavily on book-and-turn to drive the business. So I think that the only wildcard we really have is, if you think about it, is inflation. Pricing will be set on deliveries that were going to be made. The backlog is being built. The service business is humming along. So I feel good about the ability to say that we're going to top the guidance that we gave at this point in time. I just don't want to be more specific about that until we actually see what happens in quarter two. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then turning just to capital allocation, any kind of update there of how you're thinking about things, particularly given stocks have pulled back there a little bit, cycle definitely looks like a little bit of concern. I mean any way you're thinking about underlying acquisitions or investments or your own stock through the prism of what is maybe a tougher industrial market? Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So Robert, as we think about capital allocation and we think about Ingersoll-Rand, the first part that I want to start with is that we continue to have a strengthening balance sheet. Our process around cash flow, around managing investment has been good and will continue to be good. So when we think about capital allocation, and we talked about this in some of the prepared remarks, I don't think it's different than what we've said before. We're going to continue to invest in the business and investing in the business can be CapEx, which we guided at $300 million for the year. It can be in new products, it can be in our sales force, but continuing to invest in the business and that is really important to us. It's having that strong dividend with growth in the dividend being equal to or greater than our net income. And then when you come to the remainder of the cash flow, I think what you think about is that we are going to deploy the excess cash flow, and how we deploy that last couple of pieces of it is highly dependent on what transpires from the M&A side and the timing of that. We don't have to do anything on M&A, but we do have a good active pipeline as you can tell from the last four months or five months we've had some technology, some channel, some other things come through the pipeline that have turned out well for us. And what I'd like to see on the M&A side is our ability to grow earnings and to grow a long-term cash flow stream out of the M&A. And on share repurchase, you're right. Shares and the intrinsic value are showing a positive, and we'll see how that turns out. We've committed offsetting dilution. We told you in the original guidance that we had modeled $500 million of share repurchase. But on that toggle between those two, I really would like to see us work the M&A side, work the earnings and cash flow growth side of that, and then be really smart on share repurchase and other aspects of capital allocation. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your answers. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Mike, you may have partially answered my question on kind of the project industrial comment. But I wonder if you could elaborate there, I was thinking Industrial orders could have been stronger in the quarter. Obviously, you had kind of a pretty solid back half and there's some lumpiness there. But how do you see the trajectory in the Industrial business playing out maybe kind of on the larger capital side of the business versus maybe some of the shorter cycle elements? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Let's first talk about two thirds of the Industrial segment, which is the compressor technology business. And here, we saw really strong growth in services and expect services to continue to grow stronger than equipment which is great to our focuses. We also saw a really good growth on short cycle compressors. We saw growth with some OEM work we do, selling components to other OEMs. And we saw a nice growth in oil-free rotary. So that was excellent growth, and I made a comment already about North America and Asia being stronger regionally. We do see lumpiness though in the very large centrifugal projects, and we're seeing some delays there. And it is driven by micro uncertainty related to tariffs and some of the risk associated there, but we do expect that to recover as well. North America manufacturing looks healthy. All the verticals there are strong. Processed gas and air separation are expected to be strong this year as well. Key economic indicators are supportive here. Industrial production is at a two-year high. Defense-related aerospace forecast is strong. So we think the markets there will be good. AP will be strong regionally, it's strongest regionally for us. We think that China probably is tapering a little bit from 6% GDP, but we're seeing that there's still good growth in the market there as well. On the other third, the other $1 billion of the Industrial market, really strong growth in small electric vehicles, particularly as it relates to the consumer strategy. And we saw good growth, if not excellent growth in the Industrial products, which for us is going to be material handling, it's going to be our tools and our fluid management business, which is a very high margin business for us. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just shifting back to HVAC and then probably really it's more of a resi question. But was there or has there been kind of pre-buying in the channel in front of kind of the next wave of price increases? Does that kind of distort things here as we kind of try to figure out Q2? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I don't think the price increase or the time they were given was that different than what the expectation would have been in the prior year. So there could be specific distributors that might have done more than they would have done. But as we look at inventories across the backlog, they're pretty appropriate for where they need to be at this point in time. So I don't see tremendous risk there. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And maybe just one other quick one. How about hedging? I mean, with materials whipping around the way they are, your strategy change, do you want to hedge more, do you want to hedge less? You obviously don't want to be kind of \"betting\" on these items. But any color there would be helpful. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Jeff, I think, you've got that exactly right. We don't want to be in the speculation business. But let me give you a couple of thoughts on what we're doing today, and maybe options for the future. So today, again, we've got visibility on steel. You can't lock, you can't hedge it. We've got visibility of about six months, three months on pricing and about three months on inventory. So we know what that looks like, and we know what we have to do in terms of price on the steel side of the market. On copper, we lock copper prices, and so we're locking in volumes with our supply base throughout the year. We enter any given quarter at about 70% locked on copper. Actually we're about 66% locked for the year on copper. But what happens on that lock, and I think this is important is, we're giving volume commitment and we're getting pricing commitment out of the supply base. So in other words, the fluctuations on that copper price are actually belong to the supply base, so any financial hedges are being done on that side of the house. Now, is there pressure for maybe us to take on a little bit more of that with the change in hedge accounting rules and things like that? The answer is perhaps, and in it's perhaps a way to do that. But I think what you would do even if we hedged the actual copper or aluminum, is you would still layer in your purchases so that you're almost doing $1 cost averaging type of move on buying in those commodities. I think you probably end up in about the same place with a financial hedge versus the locks that are out there. So we continue to refine our thinking around that. We continue to work on the processes, which is getting really good and projecting the volumes really good and projecting the timing of those, but I really do think it kind of works like it does today with us getting visibility on our costs so that we can react with pricing if need be. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning. Maybe the first question just on what's happening in your Climate business in China. That was something you called out a few times last year as being a pretty big margin headwind. I think you mentioned that the financials are looking slightly better there. So maybe flesh out that a little bit. And also just strategically, how you're progressing with that market share push? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, actually I'm going to answer your question and then I'm going to probably add on a little bit which gets to maybe a little bit of Steve Tusa's last question regarding specific kind of guidance or results in different businesses. But the strategy is going very well for us. There's exceptional equipment organic bookings happening there. Just to give you a point of color, the visibility that we have in our project pipeline that we would put all projects into a pipeline that are out there for us to pursue were up 100% year-over-year, meaning they doubled. So we have visibility to twice as many projects as the prior year. The number of proposals that we provided were up 130%. So the projects were actually finding or even better projects for us to go pursue albeit they might be larger or longer cycle, projects that perhaps distribution wasn't getting at, but our company-owned resources are our direct team is getting at. So very strong growth in bookings there, very strong growth in service there as well, and that is the most important thing. That is mapping how we wanted it to map, which means that the financial pressure there on the margin is getting better as it was planned and should be getting year-over-year. And I would say that, I've got high level of confidence that we'll see 2018 margins that are flat to 2017 margins on a much higher revenue base for the year. And I think in 2019 and beyond it will be a nice tailwind for us as the service business grows. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you for the color. And then secondly, I guess within the Climate business, you did see an acceleration in the organic bookings growth in Q1 from late last year. I realize you don't want to get into too much detail, but was that all about Thermo King accelerating or the overall transport refrigeration business, or did you also see some improvement in the commercial Trane side? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. One versus the other was not remarkable in terms of what drove the business. So there wasn't sort of an outstanding performance in one business covering up for another. And getting back to the question that Steve asked a little bit as well, over the last say five years, I've never seen a better linkage from strategy to execution as it relates to the ability for us to identify strategic growth programs, invest the talent and the resources into those, and then get really good results often a multiple of what the underlying growth rate is of the business. And they're mapping exactly to what we planned, and we provide so much detail on these calls, particularly in a tough pricing environment, all we do is put a bull's-eye into back of our salespeople out in the marketplace around sort of where we're penetrating and who we're beating. So it doesn't really help the company, which means it doesn't help the shareholder for us to be providing too much of that. It also invites a lot of short-termism into the way that people would think about the business because a quarter, whether we have a blowout number or don't, really doesn't change the long-term dynamics of what we're trying to do strategically around growing the business. And so again, we thought long and hard about that, I apologize for the sell-siders who really use that to model, but believe it's in the best interest long-term, certainly of the company's shareholders that we don't provide that much granular information on a go-forward basis. But back to your question, really good growth both in HVAC and in TK. The surprise to us has been the TK business, which is strengthening globally, but also strengthening in North America, specifically around the trailer business that we talked about. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. It makes sense. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Your line is open. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, Tim. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I just had a question maybe on just the order growth and backlog, and maybe this will just kind of help us a little bit with the back half of the year. Anyway in Climate to just kind of think about what the margins are in terms of what your booking for orders or what's in backlog maybe relative to what we saw 12 or 18 months ago? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, you think about backlog margins being higher because they're going to have higher price on the backlog margin. So if you think about standard cost being roughly the same first half to back half, we're not going to change standards midway through the year. What's different is the pricing coming into that, plus you're seeing, hopefully seeing additional absorption coming into the factory volumes on the higher revenue. So the margins in the back half of the year are better than the front half of the year, and that's sort of the outlook that we've got on why leverage and ultimately margin expansion for the full year happens. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just with some of the movements on the debt side in the quarter, any update in terms of how we should think about interest expense for the year? Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Tim the 8-K and the information that we put out there, so let me parse this into two parts, which is 2018 and then post 2018. So in 2018, the benefit on interest expense is about $11 million. On Q1, specifically, actually, our interest expense is up very slightly because of actually having interest on both the refinanced tranches, as well as the new tranches for a short period of time. If I look beyond 2018, the guidance that we gave was about $19 million of benefit 2019 and beyond. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Good luck on the rest of the year. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Tim Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just following up on one of the earlier questions around price cost. So at the beginning, there was a band of plus 30 basis points to minus 30 basis points for the year, Mike. It sounds like you're in the lower part of that range, but obviously comfortable with how the guidance is going to play out for the year and from an earnings standpoint? Is that the right way to interpret this? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. In fact, what we talked about was the fact that typically we'd be plus 20 basis points, plus 30 basis points. We said look, let's not be so precise because we've had so much inflation here and it's so volatile that, let's say, it's minus 30 basis points, plus 30 basis points. But within that window, we're confident at that point in time that we're going to be able to get the leverage in the business that we had thought about and communicated to you by managing the entire P&L. And that's the intent. Now within that, we said, let's bias it toward the bottom end of that range. Let's play it safe. Let's look at minus 30 basis points as probably being closer to the reality. And what we're seeing transpire in the marketplace with price is that we are certainly within the band that we've communicated, say minus 30 basis points. If you looked at a spot forecast, we could say minus 20 basis points today. Understand the volatility in that is moving quite a bit. So I feel good about being in that kind of minus 20 bps, minus 30 bps range at this point, and that will evolve over the course of the year as these wildcards play out. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And I know it's really, really early, but as we think about lap-over impact into 2019 from commodity at this point, and any early thoughts there, early reads there as you think about it. I mean, obviously, you have some time here from a productivity standpoint to execute some things. But just curious on how you're planning for this, looking out 12 months or so. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. As volatile as it is right now, we're certainly looking at what's happening for the year. So it's not that we're not thinking about 2019, but we'd be really stretching to prognosticate much at this point in time. We want to make sure we can call Q3 and Q4. So at this point in time, I'd hold back on comments there. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO. Your line is open. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, I made it. How's it going? Almost everything has been answered for me, but I just \u2013 can you break apart the pieces of Thermo King? You usually give us a little bit of a better sense of what's happening across some of the pieces, and I just wondered if you could do that again. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. And it'll take a minute because again it is a diversified business here. But let's talk first about North America trailer, which is where some of the news is. And here you've got tight shipping capacity. You've got tight labor supply in terms of drivers. All driving the 50% sort of industry increase that I've mentioned. You've got regulatory changes here which are also impacting. So this is electronic logging devices specifically. And then you got the benefit of the U. S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. So Act raised their outlook to 44,600. I think last time we spoke, we were kind of biasing around 41,000 and that was a little better than the original plan which is around 39,000. I think, frankly, it's somewhere between 41,000 and 44,600, which is what Act has. Act may not have thought through some of the constraints around cabs or even about inventory in the marketplace. And so perhaps in the number is 2,000 units or so less than that. It's all good news. Europe should be very solid for truck, for trailer as well broadly, some markets are stronger than others. Interestingly, Russia is about 15% of the market and it's growing a little faster than Europe as a whole. So there is a wildcard there on anything would happen there with further sanctions in Russia. But generally speaking, it's good growth. The APU market is strong and that is really tracking Class 8 sleeper cabs and then our bolt-on rate kind of where we measure the bolt-on from our units on to these sleeper cabs is increasing and that's looking like the plan we laid out for you at the Analyst Day over a year ago at this point in time. The marine market is strong. I want to say in the quarter, it was up over 220%. The market was up over 220%. It's relatively small business for us, but good growth there. And then bus, rail and air would be mixed. Rail is longer larger projects that are good for us. Bus is a lot of the city kind of transit buses and air is an interesting but small portfolio where we're seeing more biopharma moved through this route. You're seeing sort of 10% increase in the market for moving biopharma in refrigerated containers via air. So that's a strong sign around those businesses. But collectively, those bus, rail, air businesses are something like 10% of the portfolio, so not a large part of the portfolio. Good growth in Latin America, specifically Brazil, and continued good growth in Asia. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And are the prices of acquisitions high enough at this point that we should expect the overall share count to drop a little bit more or you guys are going to keep your kind of methodical approach and try to balance everything out? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : The methodical approach really is just keeping intrinsic value in front of us as we're looking at an acquisition and trying to make the right long-term decision around the acquisition. So obviously, as the share price drops, it makes the intrinsic value greater, it makes acquisitions little bit more difficult. But look, if what we see persists, the price of acquisitions should come down too as well. So look, let's just let this thing play out, but I think we've shown a very disciplined process over the past few years about why we buy and what we pay for. And I could tell you that what we've bought in 2017 is generating far greater EPS in 2018 and 2019 than share repurchase but that's because we looked at intrinsic value versus the acquisitions and made good decisions and integrated them well into the company. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Thank you very much. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is open. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah, I guess I just wanted to, on the margin walk, to get a sense of how you expected the investment spending to track as we progress, does that maybe stay at a 40, 50 basis point headwind through the year? Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I think on investment spending, let's call that similar to 2017 as we go through the year. I think what is important, Robert, on the investment spending itself is what that actually is going into. So we're continuing to work on new products. We're continuing to work on our operational excellence initiatives. There's a small amount of IT. But in terms of how we're going to do that throughout the year, it would look similar to 2017. And the changes that we may see as we go through this and this is an important part of our process is, we've got an investment review board that looks at all of the different components of investments that we do and make sure that we've got the right business cases, the right value creation for all of those investments and that's a really sound practice for us as part of our business operating system that may impact some of the timings somewhat, but I don't expect it to be terribly different. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got it, got it. And listen, I can appreciate if you don't want to say any more on this front, but \u2013 and others have touched on this. But you were guiding Climate up 3%, 3.5% and you started out 8% with orders up 11%. So I think we're all just trying to get our heads around like what, if anything, is so materially different or maybe your plan kind of factored something like what we're seeing or there is some shoulder season volatility in there. But just any thoughts on... Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : It actually gets, yeah, it gets very much to my point \u2013 it gets very much my point that strategy is mapping very closely the strategic growth programs and the product growth teams is a success in these markets. And in some cases, I think, we're surprising ourselves around the growth here and that's great. So, it was a very strong quarter delighted to have sort of book that and put it into the backlog and we're going to see how quarter two and quarter three progress. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got it. Okay, great. Well, congrats on the solid start. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Now we've covered a lot of ground here. I did have a follow-up question for Sue. In your answer to Jeff's question on inflation in steel, I think you said that you can't lock in the prices, but just if you could refresh us my understanding you engage in advance purchasing, so you basically pre-buy or commit 100% of the volume expect each quarter and then ladder that out. Is that still the same practice? But aren't you locking that in for the quarter each time? So is that really locked in or not? Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So Deane, great question. On steel, what my comment was meant to be is you cannot do a financial hedge or something of that nature on steel. However, it is a lot like a locking program where we get visibility from spot prices and commitments, contractual commitments from the suppliers on steel that will go out three months. So that we've got visibility to the pricing and then we've also got inventory. So we've got about six months of visibility to price increases or decreases. It's just a matter of there isn't a financial hedging mechanism that's out there on steel, which could be on copper and aluminum. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. That's helpful. And then for Mike, could you update us on the whole initiative around connected buildings. That was a big focus at the analyst meeting. What the take rate is, the number of buildings, the kind of investment you're making, but any color there would be helpful. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I'd say the whole digital strategy for the company is probably the largest investment when you look through that across the company if you look at the product growth. It is definitely in the results that we're seeing around why the controls business was up as much as it is. And then specifically on the connected strategy and growth rates there, we talked about sort of 30% compound growth rates and we're continuing to see that take shape. We just made an acquisition in the quarter around another company a small company, a lot of intellectual property and many, many hundreds of thousands of connections through smart meter technology into our platform. So there is more investment happening there as well and we're trying to extend and get a larger footprint. But the strategy is growing roughly 30%.

Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Please go to slide three. Like to begin with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy that drive long term value creation for shareholders. This is often a helpful starting point for those of you listening who may be less familiar with the company. First our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food and other waste of perishable goods and generating productivity for our customers, all enabled by digital and other exponential technologies. Our business portfolio positioning creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above average global economic conditions aided by the strong secular tailwinds that I've outlines. Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins and free cash flow. Our business operating system underpins everything we do and enables us to consistently generate powerful free cash flow which, when combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, drives strong returns for shareholders over the long term. And finally, over the years, we've built an experience management team and a high-performance, winning culture which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver strong results that are sustainable for the long run. Having a strong, winning culture takes years to build and cultivate and I believe this is one of the things that the market may underappreciate about Ingersoll Rand. As we consistently execute our strategy, we continue to build a stronger company that delivers reliable and consistent financial performance for shareholders over the long term. Moving to slide four, midway through the year, we continue to execute well against our long term strategy and 2018 is shaping up to be a very good year for us. Our end markets are healthy and we are executing well as evidenced by the strong growth we're delivering in bookings and revenues in both our Climate and Industrial segments across virtually all products, services and geographies globally. Our Industrial segment continues to perform well with broad based bookings and revenue growth and significant margin expansion. We're effectively managing inflation and tariff headwinds. We delivered a 10-basis-point positive price versus material inflation spread in the second quarter which reflects strong pricing discipline and efficiency. Our China growth strategy is performing well against our expectations with continued strong revenue and bookings growth and improving margins. As we look forward, we expect our end markets to remain healthy with consistent execution of our business operating system which gives us confidence in raising our full year guidance for revenues, EPS and free cash flow. Please go to slide number five. In the second quarter, we delivered strong growth in organic bookings and revenue across the board as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Enterprise organic bookings and revenues were up 15% and 9% respectively. Climate led the way with organic bookings and revenues of 17% and 9% respectively. And Industrial was also very strong with organic bookings and revenues up 8% and 9% respectively. These results represent continued healthy end markets and consistent execution of our strategy. A couple points to highlight. First, we did not see a significant impact from revenue pull-ins ahead of price increases or tariffs in the quarter, and Sue will discuss it in more detail later. And second, we didn't have any large performance contracting orders to call out in the quarter that would've skewed our results. The one minus on the chart was in small electric vehicle bookings, where results were only modestly lower. Golf was down with utility and consumer vehicles showing bookings growth as expected. Please go to slide number six. This slide provides insight and color into the key drivers behind the chart on slide five and how we're thinking about the outlook for the year. In commercial HVAC, we're seeing sustained growth globally in both bookings and revenue, with good growth in both equipment and services and particular strength in Asia. North America growth remained solid, with gains in equipment, services, contracting and controls. Institutional growth was particularly strong, led by education, and industrial HVAC strength was also notable in the quarter. Europe, the Middle East and Africa commercial HVAC remained strong with solid growth across the board in equipment and aftermarket, and we saw additional growth in services from our rental service business. China continued to have a very strong growth in the quarter led by the execution of our China direct sales growth strategy. Our outlook for total commercial HVAC remains healthy for 2018 and key economic and market indicators largely support our view. Turning to residential HVAC, bookings and revenue growth were also very strong, particularly against tough growth comps versus 2017. The replacement markets where the majority of our sales are derived showed very good growth in the second quarter and this is expected to continue through 2018. Our Transport Solutions business continues to be a diversified resilient business and the improving market conditions for North America refrigerated trailer have been a positive. North American trailer order growth was strong in the quarter and revenues were up as well. The Americas Commercial Transportation Research Company, also known as ACT, has taken up their forecast for North American refrigerated trailers to approximately 5% growth over 2017. However, the industry capacity by trailer OEMs is constrained, so it's not clear how much the industry will actually grow at this stage. Auxiliary power unit growth remained strong with good growth in both refrigerated and non-refrigerated segments. We're also seeing continued solid growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa truck which is a meaningful business for us. Overall, the transport market should be stronger than we originally expected in 2018, primarily led by improvement in the North American trailer market. Compression Technologies is seeing the continuation of an industrial recovery, consistent with industrial production and other key leading indicators. In the quarter, we delivered good growth in bookings and revenues in both equipment and aftermarket. All major geographies were solid with particular strength in Asia. For 2018, we expect to see solid growth broadly across key products, services and markets. Small electric vehicle revenue growth was strong, driven largely by successful market penetration of our consumer vehicle and we expect that to continue through 2018. We also delivered strong growth across our Industrial Products business, which are comprised of tools, fluid management and material handling. We expect to see continued good growth in our Industrial Products businesses in the second half of the year. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter and to discuss our 2018 guidance increase. Sue? Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number seven. As Mike highlighted, strong momentum from the first quarter continued through Q2. Revenue growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments is outpacing our initial guidance expectations. Margins and leverage are improving and the pull-through to EPS growth has been strong. As we look forward to the second half the year, we continue to see good opportunities for growth broadly across our end markets. We expect sustained, strong execution of our business operating system to enable us to deliver financial results that meaningfully exceed our initial full year guidance for revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow. Looking at our second quarter results in more detail, bookings and revenue performance were both strong with robust growth in virtually every major product category and geography and in both services and equipment. We delivered record enterprise bookings and revenues with organic bookings up 15% and organic revenues up 9%. Climate led the way with organic bookings and revenues up 17% and 9% respectively. Industrial organic bookings and revenues were also strong, up 8% and 9% respectively. Aftermarket growth outpaced equipment growth, up 12% and 11% respectively as we continue to focus on building out a greater mix of high margin, sustainable revenue and margin streams over time. There's been a fair amount of discussion on the Street recently regarding the impact of customers' pre-buying inventory ahead of announced price increases or the anticipated implementation of tariffs, so we wanted to spend a moment addressing this question with respect to Ingersoll Rand. While it is difficult to determine a precise number due to a number of factors, we are confident this was not a substantial factor for us in the second quarter given our channel structure and the visibility that we do have. We would estimate an impact of between $80 million and $100 million on orders spread primarily between commercial HVAC, residential HVAC and transport refrigeration. As best we can call it, this would translate into two to three percentage points of the 15% bookings growth in Q2. The impact of revenues was likely a fraction of this in the quarter and de minimis to the full year. Through the second quarter, we have continued to execute a balanced capital allocation strategy. Our first priority is always reinvesting in high ROI projects in our business. As we outlined in our original guidance for the year, we also have a number of high ROI capital expenditure related projects in 2018. These projects are aimed at simplifying our business through footprint optimization and at innovation through new product development related projects. We've invested in a number of these higher ROI projects through the first half. We've also maintained our commitment to a strong and growing dividend. We announced a quarterly dividend increase of 18% in the second quarter and have distributed $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in the first half of 2018. Share repurchases have also remained a good investment for us as our shares have continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. Through June, we have repurchased $500 million at an average price of $88.53. On the acquisition front, we closed on the Trane Mitsubishi Electric JV which is now up and running and our acquisition pipeline remains active. Through the second quarter, our total cash spend on M&A is approximately $280 million including the ICS Cool Energy acquisition and the Trane Mitsubishi JV which were previously announced. While it is still early days on the Trane Mitsubishi JV, we're already seeing good returns on the ICS Cool Energy acquisition. Please go to slide number eight. As we've highlighted, Q2 was a strong financial quarter top to bottom. We delivered 9% organic revenue growth, 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and EPS growth of 24%. Our operating leverage also significantly improved to approximately 20%. Please go to slide number nine. Focused execution of our strategy and operational excellence drove strong core business operating income contribution from both of our business segments, which combined for approximately $0.25 or the majority of the $0.36 of EPS growth in the year-over-year quarter. Lower share count from significant capital deployment toward share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 drove another $0.07 improvement. We also had modest positive contributions from lower interest expense associated with the company's debt refinancing earlier this year. Additionally, we benefited from a slightly lower effective tax rate year-over-year on higher pre-tax earnings. Please go to slide number 10. Strong execution drove 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Pricing discipline delivered greater pricing efficiency than we anticipated when we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter. Price versus material inflation improved 50 basis points sequentially in the second quarter to a positive 10 basis point spread. Higher revenue drove 80 basis points of margin expansion and investment spend was consistent with our targeted levels of approximately 40 to 50 basis points of incremental investment per year. Productivity versus other inflation was flat in the quarter but improved sequentially. We expect productivity to continue to improve in the back half of the year and particularly in the fourth quarter as programs and initiatives continue to ramp. We expect total productivity in 2018 to exceed 2017 levels. Please go to slide number 11. Our Climate segment demonstrated strong improvement in the quarter with flat adjusted operating margins, which was a 50 basis point sequential improvement from the first quarter driven primarily by volume, pricing, and productivity. We are successfully mitigating persistent tier 1 and tier 2 inflation, freight costs, and the known impacts of the tariffs that have been implemented to date. As you know, the majority of inflation impacts are to the Climate segment. Our China direct sales strategy continues to perform well against our expectations with continued strong growth and improving margins as we move through the year. Please go to slide number 12. Our Industrial business delivered another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 9% and adjusted operating margin improvement of 170 basis points. The restructuring and productivity actions in prior years are providing operating margin growth in 2018 and we continue to take further actions in 2018 that will benefit future years. Please go to slide 13. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI projects, which is helping to drive our strong growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments this year. We have also increased our capital expenditure investments that will have strong returns through new product development and footprint optimization. We maintain a long standing commitment to paying a strong and growing dividend and have increased the dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. In the second quarter, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of 18%, which reflects our ongoing confidence in our ability to drive sustained high levels of cash flow in the future. We will continue to make strategic investments in value accretive M&A that drives long term shareholder returns. We maintain a strong balance sheet that continues to improve through high quality operating income growth. This provides us with significant optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We also continue to invest in share buybacks when the shares trade below our calculated intrinsic value. Over the past year and a half, we've spent $1.5 billion on share repurchases and have reduced our outstanding share count by approximately 5%. Please go to slide number 15. As we touched on earlier, our strong first half financial performance gives us confidence in raising our 2018 guidance for organic revenues, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share guidance moves up significantly to approximately $5.50. Organic revenue guidance is more than doubled to a range of between 7% to 8%, reflecting very strong revenues and bookings in the first half and expectations for continued healthy end market growth and continued share gains in the second half. This strength is also broad based. By segment we expect Climate and Industrial organic revenues to each be up 7% to 8%, essentially doubling our prior guidance for revenue growth for each business segment. Please go to slide 16. This table lays out our updated guidance versus our prior guidance in more detail. We've talked to most of the data points on this slide, so we've included the table in the presentation for your reference and it includes some of the modeling related questions you'll want to have. Bottom line is that we expect 2018 to be a strong year for Ingersoll Rand. Please go to slide number 18. Moving on to our topics of interest section, we have one primary topic to cover : tariffs and inflation mitigation. The main takeaway is that we have incorporated all known direct and indirect impacts into our guidance from the Section 232 tariffs and the Section 301 tariffs related to the first $50 billion that went into effect in July. We're evaluating the potential impacts from the additional $200 billion in proposed Section 301 tariffs which are indeterminate at this stage. To be clear, we have seen a significant uptick in inflation from the direct and indirect impacts of the known portions of the Section 232 and 301 tariffs. At the same time, however, with the pricing effectiveness we're seeing and expect to see going forward, we believe we can maintain a flat price versus material inflation equation in the back half as we previously guided. We expect the better pricing we are seeing to offset additional inflation in tariffs in the back half of the year. Beyond the known tariffs, we continue to closely monitor the tariff proposals and discussions taking place globally in order to react quickly if and when additional tariff pressure comes into play. First, our global integrated supply chain team is continuously monitoring tariffs from the time they are proposed. Second, we are rigorously addressing the cost increases across the portfolio working through our supply chain team. And third, we are utilizing our business operating system to actively manage our pricing and productivity actions and pipeline throughout the enterprise. We anticipate that additional tariffs would be met quickly by pricing action across the industry. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks before we take Q&A. Mike? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Sue. Please go to slide 19. We believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably. Our products and services portfolio is at the nexus of global energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends, which provides a tailwind for growth above average economic conditions over the long term. So unless you believe the world is getting less populated, cooler, and less resource constrained, these secular megatrends will continue to create growth opportunities for Ingersoll Rand. We have experienced management and a high performing team culture that incorporates operational excellence into everything we do. Culture is so fundamental to a company's success yet it is often underappreciated in the short-term. For us, it is a sustainable competitive advantage that we invest in heavily to cultivate and maintain. And lastly, our business model generates powerful cash flow and we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital. We have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : We will now take questions. Your first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Impressive performance for sure. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Steve. Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning, Steve. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Morning. Hey. I just wanted to come back to a couple things. One is, I guess, the order pull forward and the second one's on Climate margins. On the order pull forward from Q3, could you give us a little more color around that and how we should expect that to materialize over kind of timeframe? And do you think this is just a one quarter phenomenon? Or you think there's going to be a little bit more of this? Just anything on that front would be helpful. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Steve, so half of it would've been really in commercial HVAC and then a small portion would have been residential, very small, balance being TK for the most part. So that would total something in the $80 million range. What I'd say to you is that, and I don't necessarily talk about sort of third quarter, but I will say we looked at what was happening with bookings in the first few weeks of July very carefully and they came in very strong. So I don't think that there's going to be an issue there for us with any hiccups in the quarter. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then on all the puts and takes around Climate margin performance, can you give us a little more color there too in terms \u2013 I know you walked through some of the price/cost inflation dynamics, but and tariff impact and all these other items. But maybe just a sense for investment, inflation. The pricing's already out there. Just something to help us think about that flat margin performance on the go forward. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Sure. I think for the full year 2018, Steve, the best way to think about that, the headline would be that I'd expect Climate margins to improve say 10, 20 basis points overall. And the pricing is then loaded in. And the productivity is something that across the company I always talk about the health of the pipeline. We look to make sure that 125% of what we need is in the queue. The calendarized version, or the part of the perpetuity pipeline that is being worked comes down to a monthly and quarterly view. And that monthly and quarterly view would support the productivity side. So I would say with bookings where they are and the health of the end markets with pricing, the effectivity of pricing being good, what I mean by that is the pace at which price was received and to the extent we were able to get the price that we were looking for, it's as good as I've seen. The productivity calendarization looks good. When you net that all it out, I think you end up with 10, 20 basis point improvement for the full year implying a pretty good back half. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : All right. That's helpful. And I could just sneak one more in, on the Trane Mitsubishi JV that launched, what kind of financial impact are you thinking about on that as you move forward? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : 2018, it's not necessarily that material to the company, but the early days has been, it's been excellent. It's been exciting and the teams are off to a great start. They're active in the market and its performing as we would have hoped. So, all systems are go and positive on that front. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Look forward to hearing more later. Thanks. Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning, Steve. You might be on mute. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hello? Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Go to the next question. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Oh, there he is. Steve? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Can you hear me now? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Got you. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Oh, great. Sorry. Yeah, I don't think I was on mute. So guidance implies some slowing in the Industrial margin expansion after really strong obviously results here. Anything going on there? Is there a mix impact or anything like that in the second half? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Actually, we think Industrial remains strong. Everything is pointing forward. We're looking at probably a two year high now in terms of Industrial productivity. We're seeing strength across the world. We're seeing services grow at about the rate of equipment. So no, I think for the most part we see sort of steady as she goes in Industrial. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And any reason why price/cost would \u2013 why would price/cost would decelerate in the second half if these price increases are going through? Is the inflation just that much worse in the second half? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, you've got a little bit of that first $50 billion in tariffs coming through in July and August on those two. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So I think that the safe view of that at this point would be the original guidance we have which is a flat back half. We saw great price effectivity in the second quarter. It was beyond what we thought. But yeah, I think we need to pace ourselves based on changes that happened with tariffs the dates of implementation as how those looks might change. But we think that we're managing it really effectively and that we've got a plan and contingencies around how to manage changes that we would get on the tariff front. By the way, it's not just tariffs; it's inflation. We really have a region for region strategy. And so if you think about the impact we're seeing, it's not so much on the actual tariff. It's on the derivative effect of commodities in the region increasing because they can as a result of tariffs. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. One last quick one on resi. What do you think the market \u2013 I mean Lennox was up nine, Carrier was mid-single digits. So the market's kind of all over the place a little bit here. What do you think the market's going to kind of shake out at for the second quarter for resi? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I think the market data was released already, Steve, so we grew share in the quarter. We know that. And if you look across the board, and I know you'd love the detail on this, but let me just tell you that on the Climate segment itself, when you think about the revenue growth rate for the segment, we didn't have more than one point of variance globally across HVAC or transport or residential. So it was really good uniform performance. And then North America specifically, when you look at applied unitary and service, everything there was say 15%, 16% plus growth. And so that was really strong across the whole range which probably tells you what you're asking I think at that point. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Wow. Okay. Great result. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning, Jeff. Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey Mike just a little bit more color on price. I think earlier in the year there was a lot of optimism you could get it in the U. S. but a lot of doubt, or certainly less certainty about rest of the world. Your results here do suggest that prices moving up pretty nicely now in those markets. But could you give a little bit more color on kind of the geographic differences around price, and if you're maybe still playing a bit more catch-up outside of the U.S.? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : There's not a lot of variability around price effectivity around the globe for us at this point, Jeff, and that's part of, if you will, the surprise here. So the margin improvement in China is going really well and that would've been the point we would've been talking about a couple of quarters ago, but that's going really well. And there's not enough differentiation globally to really kind of point out here in that space. Now, I mean, clearly we're covering and have been covering material inflation in every business with the exception of our global commercial HVAC business and what we're seeing there is that that gap is flattening and improving with the increase that have been put out in the marketplace. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And how about capacity, Mike? A good news result in year like this. I would assume you're sweating the assets a little harder than you thought. Any material change in investment or anything that you need to do to keep up with this? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Jeff, we're ready to build and ship more so send us orders and we'll get it to you. Yeah, no, it's a good time and we need to make hay when the sun's shining. We all understand that and that's what's happening. So we don't have any capacity issues at this point in time. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I'm sorry, just one other quick one. Maybe Sue has calculated this number. But if you're at price/cost parity, how much margin pressure just arithmetically does that create? Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I'm not sure I understand. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, revenues will be higher because of price, but profit's not up because you're neutralizing cost with price. So there's a arithmetic margin headwind. If you haven't done the math or don't know it, that's fine. Just curious. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I haven't done the math. But what I would say, Jeff, is when we think about this through the entire P&L is we're not just working off of that equation. We're working off of all of the different elements. And so as we point out to you on productivity, we're continuing to put productivity projects into the pipeline because there are other elements that are inflationary and moving around in the P&L, too. So we can certainly come back to you on that answer. But my general overall answer is I'm going to manage everything that is on the P&L to get to the guidance that we've provided and that we're going to hit for 2018. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Jeff, a good example here is that it's one of the better gross productivity years, if not the best in terms of the absolute dollars that we've ever had. So although the bridge shows that to be flat, that's absorbing 20 basis points of freight in that equation as an example that wouldn't have been planned which will show up a bit in price. So this stuff, to Sue's point, is moving around between price and productivity and it improves in the back half of the year. But to get to the arithmetic math, the arithmetic equation there, we'll follow up with you. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Morning, guys. Nice quarter. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Mike, obviously your intention in China has been to accelerate growth through moving to the direct sales model and you did mention that one of the highlights of your overall growth this quarter is China HVAC. Can you give us a little bit more perspective on that growth in the region? Maybe how much of it is coming from your own initiative here versus what the HVAC market is doing over there. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. The market's growing something in the 5% range so we're growing in multiples of the market there. And it's in the areas that we would expect which is the applied systems and some of the larger infrastructure projects and in some of the geographies that we weren't covering as deeply as in the past. So that is the strategy. That's what's being executed. It's being executed very well and the margin profile and linkage to service continues to improve. So it's been a great success. It's probably one of the greatest successes we've had in the past year or so has been that whole strategy and I would expect that to continue. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Got it. And you don't adjust and tweak that strategy given all of the tariff stuff that's going on between us and China, correct? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, same equation in China applies here. We build about 95% of what we sell in China in China and the supply chain's localized. So it's the same equation as we have here region-in-region. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Got it. And then, look, you delivered almost 9% organic revenue growth across the first half of 2018. You mentioned the 15% bookings tailwind. Maybe a little bit of pull forward as you talked about, but it's not affecting 3Q. So the implied organic growth for the second half, let's call it 6% to 7%. Is that just conservatism at the midpoint or is there anything that you would worry could slow down the second half, or it's just sort of steady as she goes? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, some of the bigger growers in the quarter would have been applied and it would have been Compression Technology's equipment. So in essence we're building 2019 as we speak. And I would say a lot of that is our view toward building a profile for 2019. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Got it, that's helpful. Thanks, Mike. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the Industrial segment if you could give any color within compressors, any specific markets or regions that you thought gave the orders a particular lift? And also on the Industrial segment in general, following up on an earlier question, I mean the margin guide implies sort of flat margins I think sequentially in the second half which is quite unusual in Industrial, particularly given the sales trends. So I don't know if there's any extra color you could give on why that's the case. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, in terms of the market, we called out Asia specifically and that's true. It was really across all of the oil free technologies which would be centrifugal and oil-free rotary combined. But also strength in some of the quick ship or the quick book and turn business short cycle compressors were strong as well. Service growth across the board is really stepping up. That team has done an outstanding job of taking the operating system for sales excellence and really putting that into how they manage for daily improvement. And so the coverage of the market, the activity we're seeing through that coverage in the market is much stronger than we've seen in the past. So that's part of the playbook that we actually saw from the HVAC China business if you will in terms of how we're thinking about covering the market more fully and differently there. So, but North America was good, was strong as well. We saw that in content coal as a (36:52) technology. We see that in plant there. Centrifugal, sort of going into general industry, that's been good as well. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. And then just on the margins sort of half-on-half in Industrial, is there anything particularly weighing on that back half in terms of higher investments, or at this point do you think you've raised the margin guide enough for now and we'll just see how Q3 plays out? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : No. We wouldn't do that. If we thought it was better, we'd roll that through but that's the roll up we've got at this point in time and some of that's going to be a combination of mix and timing of projects. So I think it's a good forecast where we think the year is going to end at this point. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Maybe just to clarify Jeff's question from earlier, when you guys made the comment around margin parity, price/cost parity in the second half of the year, you were talking about margins, not on a dollar basis, right? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Talking about margins. Right. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Absolutely. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. Got it. Yeah, I think that that probably clarifies it. Maybe talking about the growth that you're seeing specifically on Climate and into 2019, Mike, can you provide maybe some color on some of the orders that you're booking that could potentially be longer cycle that could start benefiting 2019 as well? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I mean, we're seeing, again, there's very little variability between unitary, applied, controls and service. It's just a strong healthy global environment for us really all regions of the world. There were no large performance contracts in there and something that would skew the results. That's really important to know. So because you're seeing such strength in applied, you're generally finding longer lead projects. And so if anything, there, again, you're building quarter one, quarter two of 2019 backlog, which we're already well into that based on customer timing. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Cool. That's good to hear. And then, I guess my follow-up there is really just price/cost is better than we expected this quarter. I was just wondering, did you benefit at all of from, Mike, the pullback that we started to see in copper? And then what are kind of like your assumptions for the key commodities into the second half of the year? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, really it's the best press price effectivity I've seen in 33 years I've gone through this, both in the urgency to get it done and in the ability to maximize what it was that we were asking for. So the combination of that got us a bit ahead of the curve which is great; further along than we thought we'd be in Q2. And then the ability to absorb the first $50 billion into the pricing that we've put out in the marketplace would be the success there. So it's the copper specifically. We ladder and hedge and so yeah, it's great that things are moving down, but as you enter quarter three in the back half of the year, a smaller percentage of the spend is really in the spot market. We begin to lock that in. So if it continues, we'll see some benefit, but that would be reflected in the locks we would be doing going into 2019 at this point. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I think that's right, Joe. And when we think about that, the goal that I would have is to get ourselves to the point where in 2019 that that blended rate gets through our locks and that dollar cost averaging that we're doing on a copper buy comes down overall. So we never lock, as we told you, to the full amount of the commodity, 75% at the beginning of a quarter. So we do get some benefits on any purchase that we're going to make from those prices coming down. But I would look at that as more of an opportunity for 2019 as we go forward. So it's always good because we are always buying all three of the commodities. So we'll certainly take advantage of any price drops that we get. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Perfect. Good to hear. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Oh, thanks. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Mike. Obviously you've covered a lot of ground here and you provided good detail so I haven't got huge amount here. But I imagine you're pretty paranoid about the sustainability of the strength and obviously 15% growth is not going to be sustained. But as you look beyond July and look at the front logs RFP activity, customer conversations, what do you think you see in the next six months or so? And are we still looking at a double-digit type order cadence here? I mean, any cause of concern? Any color there would be very helpful. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, I mean globally as we track proposal activity and we look at what's happening in the market, Nigel, things are strong all over the world for us. And it fundamentally comes down to in most parts of the world, it's a replacement business; 80%, 85% of most of what we're seeing in North America, Europe for sure and the Middle East is going to be replacement business. And even China and some of the newer economies are 50%-50% in terms of replacement, new construction. And so what's happening as when you can build an equation, economic value and a payback related to energy productivity energy efficiency, and if we're able to couple that with a story that helps customers achieve their greenhouse gas emission or sustainability goals, there's a demand creation opportunity out there that's really not factored into how people might look at particular put in place or market data across the globe. So it truly is a secular tailwind tied to this whole nexus of energy efficiency and sustainability. And I think that that's a long lived phenomenon. You heard me in my opening and close that really relates to the fact that I think as you see more urbanization, you see more pressure on energy and the environment and you think about what businesses we're in, where HVAC is such a major contributor to building efficiency and to greenhouse gas emissions followed by transport refrigeration followed by industrial processes, we're in the right businesses to have an impact. And so I think that's a big part of it. The product portfolio, the investments in controls and digital, the investments in the channel really just go to support that model that we think is the right model. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. That's great color. And then just on the service trends, we don't typically see service growing high single digits. And I know that a lot of that's due to your internal initiatives around connectivity, et cetera, and just obviously a lot of investments there as well. But is there any signal here that \u2013 we've seen utilization picking up, particularly in the Industrial side? And is there some sense here that we've got some Ace equipment out there which require more MR activity and then perhaps that could signal further activity on OE side. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, I mean, services was actually mid-teens and it's so unusual to see when equipment grows mid-teens, you get services growing mid-teens. But it really comes down to the wholesales ASO once (44:29) work being conducted across the company and that bearing fruit really over time. And even parts of the world, historically, places like China where, I can imagine in the next three to five years, you're seeing the same sorts of linkage parity that you're finding in Western Europe and in the U.S. And so, that is certainly impacting service growth. Rental is another one. We think that's an important part of the strategy to be able to backstop customers' uptime requirements, as well as an opportunity to provide seasonal equipment and to create service opportunities through the rental business. And so, that's helping us in that regard as well. As far as Industrial... Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. And Industrial... Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Industrial \u2013 yeah, go ahead. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Please. Go ahead, Mike. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : You might want to just ask the second part of your question, the point you're interested, it was industrial productivity? Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Just \u2013 no, more on the industrial compressors, whether we're seeing increasing utilization of those machines driving service or just more internal IR? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, you're definitely seeing utilization rates across most of the economies in the world increasing up to critical points where you're finding expansion opportunities. So, to me, what's really happening in the Compression Technologies business is the market coverage we're taking on and the investments we're making in covering the service opportunities in the market has taken on a whole different sense of urgency. That connectivity strategy that Todd talked about for really a couple years at this point in time is something that's showing up in the results in a meaningful way. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : And then, just a quick one, Mike, on mix in residential. One or two of your competitors talked about slight negative mix in U.S. resi. Did you see that at all in your business? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : No. Not at all. Simple answer, no. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thanks Mike. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey Mike, on the performance contracting project, so nothing this quarter. Earlier in the year you said some things could hit. But at this point is it fair to say that that's all going to come in 2019? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : No. I think that we could see Q3, Q4. I think these are sort of landing gears down on a couple of these. So I think that quarter three, quarter four would be my guess. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And would those have some sort of mix-down impact on \u2013 it'd be enough to have a negative mix impact on Climate on the margin side? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : No. No, it wouldn't. The contribution there is going to be just fine. In gross margins you'd see it a little bit, but contributions will be accretive. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And institutional orders consistent with overall Climate orders, growth, organic wise? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. I mean, really, you're seeing applied, which I would link to Institutional, growing at the same rate as unitary, growing at the same rate as service. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then two, just a question on M&A contribution. Earlier in the year you had $0.05 or $0.06 from deals done in 2017, in terms of the EPS contribution for 2018, and then something like $0.15, $0.16 for 2019. Are those numbers coming in better? Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, so what you did see, as we look at the M&A activity that has impacted cash flow in the first half, so $286 million, that is the announcement that, or the committed transactions, the ICS Cool Energy as well as Mitsubishi that we had committed at year end. But I think one of the things that I would do, Rich, just as you think about this is, I'll step you back to almost a capital allocation and sort of broaden out your question, which, as we think about capital allocation we think about investing in the business first, having a strong dividend second, and then having the remainder split off between M&A and share buyback, if the stock's trading below its intrinsic value. If you look at the first half of 2018 and I follow that along. So we've got heavier CapEx in 2018 related to some of the footprint optimization as well as the new product development that I talked about in the prepared remarks. So that's actually $163 million. We've got the dividends that we talked about of $222 million. We've also got the share buyback of $500 million and the M&A of $286 million. So in the first half of the year, we've actually deployed over $1 billion of the excess cash that we've got. And so M&A's a part of it. We're going to continue to look at the pipeline, but I just wanted to take the opportunity to point out how strong the capital allocation has really been in the first half. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Specifically on the deals done, they're integrating well and we're achieving what we thought we would achieve which had a high threshold. So I don't think anything changes with the guidance we gave you around 2018 and 2019 around contribution. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple quick philosophical things, if I could. First on Thermo King, based on the data we see, it doesn't really look like the fleets of trucks and trailers are actually growing that much which would suggest that what we're seeing here is kind of a technology upgrade and I know there's much better energy efficiency with the more recent units. But how long do you think that can last? I mean, where are we in the process of upgrading the fleet do you think? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, I mean from a U.S. perspective first, you've got tight shipping capacity, you've got regulatory changes, you've got the impact from U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and we'd expensing, all that's going to drive some opportunity. You're right, I mean, technology is a major difference. If you think about what's going across the road in refrigerated trailer really in a Class A tractor, the need to manage the diesel engine and reduce fuel consumption, to manage the refrigeration cycle, the energy and any greenhouse gas emissions coming off those units and to supplement that with auxiliary power units when the vehicles are idling, it's a big opportunity that I think continues for a long period of time. I mean, ultimately like you're seeing with consumer vehicles, you're going to see more electrification of that over time. And that's certainly what we're doing now with some of the hybrid applications as well as telematics investments that we've made across the portfolio. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then even maybe a little more broad picture. At some point, I suppose all these price increases we should start to worry about some demand destruction in certain end markets. And some of the pricing we're hearing, especially in the HVAC, is pretty impressive. And I guess I'm just curious how you think about when that starts to crimp growth, or maybe it doesn't. I don't know. Maybe these markets are consolidated enough now. But I'm curious how you think about that and how you might even sort of measure and monitor it? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, history would say that it doesn't happen, that there isn't disruption over time. And so, I rely a lot on history and I would also rely a lot on the discipline that happens within the industries themselves, and so the structure of the industry. It's something we do look at, but we're not seeing any changes to historical patterns here. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Please go ahead. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Ah, I made it. I just had one or two little ones. Can you break out the bookings in Industrial by the different product lines? Just because there've been a couple of questions around the edges of that. I think that would just clear a lot of things up. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Joel, Club Car was the weakest, just marginally negative and the strongest would've been CTS and material handling, albeit material handling being smaller business, but CTS would have been additive, Club Car would have been dilutive, and power and fluid management right in the hunt there. So that's the rundown there. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So you won't give us numbers. All right. And then and can you talk about... Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I probably gave you enough of the algebra there that a smart guy like you, Joel, handle that. So... Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Once I run out of fingers, I'm done. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : All right. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And can you just give us a little sense on the second half share repurchases that are baked into the guidance? And also are there any larger acquisitions that, over the next 18 months, like you can fuzz it up a little bit, but just a little color on anything bigger that might be percolating. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well, let me do the second part first. Sue can tell you about share buyback. But on the first part, nothing has changed with regard to our methodology, the discipline, about how we're thinking about M&A. I think about 80% of what we look at in M&A are assets that we know and think fit the portfolio. 20% are always the good ideas that come in from additional sources that get evaluated to see if we're missing something or there's a fit. So nothing's changed there with regard to how we look at the pipeline, how we manage it, how we think about it strategically, or how we compare that to other alternatives including share buyback. And Sue, you may want to comment on share buyback. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, on the share buyback, the way that we model this, Joel, for purposes of the guidance is absolutely consistent with where we started out the year. So we put a placeholder in for $500 million, which, as you know, we've completed. But that isn't the capital allocation strategy. The capital allocation strategy says we're looking to deploy the excess cash and that we're going to look at the M&A pipeline as well as more share buyback to absolutely finish out the capital deployment for the year. So, the model today with the guidance is consistent with where we started out the year with the $500 million. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So, going back to the trucking and freight shortage and issue, I think one of your competitors noted they had a pretty, a meaningful impact in June for resi HVAC. So, I just want to \u2013 did you guys see any of that? And can you just update us on how the costs in freight and shipping are tracking year-over-year? I think you said around 15% up previously. Thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : You know, I said actually refrigerated freight mile is up about 30%, which is great for our TK business and we were seeing dry freight at that time up in the market about 15%. I didn't actually say what our rate increases were. I did say earlier on the call though that there's a 20 basis point impact in the productivity other inflation bridge that we've got. So if you take that bridge which shows flat, there's a 20 basis point headwind associated with freight in that number. So that's the impact that we're seeing. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then... Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And then \u2013 hey, Andrew, and a lot of the productivity initiatives \u2013 not a lot, but a number of productivity initiatives in the third and fourth quarter are looking at ideas that we've got around freight and warehousing. And so, that's sort of an exciting thing that we're thinking about. We started that about a year ago. It's a bit fortunate, if you will, that we've got that kind of teed in for the Q3, Q4 of this year so that should help with that equation dramatically. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then on the resi, did you have any impact on just shortage of being able to ship resi units in this quarter? Or maybe in 3Q so far? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Nope. We'll ship all you want. Again, send us your orders. We're happy to do that and we've got no problem building them and shipping them. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up on the \u2013 back to the China HVAC strategy. Just with all the tariffs and say around in U.S. and China, have you seen any kind of blowback against the U.S. brands in general? Or is the value proposition still that they really don't care at this point? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Well we employ a lot of people in China. We've got factories and technology and product built for the market. And so in China, we think about ourselves as a Chinese company. In the U.S., we think about ourselves about it as a U.S. company. Fundamentally we're a global company and we've got to act that way in the markets that we serve. So to your question simply, no. We haven't seen any reaction to that one way or the other. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : Hi. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Morning. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : On the organic sales guidance increase, the 3.25% to 7.5%, how much of that was higher price than you previously assumed? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Have to think about that. There really was a second price increase which would have happened depending on the business kind of midway through the year. So we wouldn't have had a lot in there for meaningfully \u2013 I mean, certainly would have looked at material inflation and new news around freight 232 and 301 and we were trying to get on top of that as it was happening. So David, I'll probably have to come back and answer that. But it's not something meaningfully popping out on the bridge to say that that is a such a difference from where we were originally. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : No, because David, the way that I would think about that is with the pricing and generally again, your pricing realization in the neighborhood of 1% to 2% is going to kind of flow through. So it might move the growth slightly but it's not going to be the biggest factor in changing the growth. It's really coming out of the volume that's occurring out of the end market as opposed to pricing, or FX, or acquisitions, which basically are having about the same impact as the original guidance. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : David, I'd probably say, maybe a point to 120 basis points for the full year would be price. Everything else is going to be pretty well volume. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : Yeah, so that's not all new pricing from the previous guidance, right? That's full year, what you ... Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Right, all. That's right. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : I mean the reason I ask is when you look at the segments, and I don't know if it's conservatism or as you said a lot of the inflation's in Climate, but you just raised your revenue guidance for Climate $475 million, but you only raised the EBIT, $46 million right? So basically a 9.7% incremental profit on incremental sales you're now looking for. And that sort of begs the question, are we really seeing price versus cost maintains the margin? Or price of $100 offsets cost of $100? So just to be clear, we're saying price/cost does not erode the margin the rest of the year, especially in Climate or is it \u2013 no. It's $100 of cost get offset by $100 of price and yes that does dampen the margin but at least we're offsetting it in dollar terms. It's just the incremental margin on Climate just seems low on what you just raised the sales by. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Right, but I'm thinking out loud, David, as we go through this. But I think what you have to do with all of this is you can't just parse out a couple of pieces. And it really is important to understand that the majority of the big inflationary items are occurring in the Climate segment of the business and that as we're looking at the Climate segment, itself over the second quarter, you're actually seeing an improvement in the overall margins for the quarter. So we're offsetting the headwinds and continuing to improve margins in the business. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, David, I guess our math's a little bit different too, by the way. I mean, to get to a 10, 20 basis point expansion in Climate for the full year we're going to have to get something like 50, 60 basis points of improvement in the back half of the year. That implied leverage organically of somewhere between let's say 23% and 25%. So we'll at least take... David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : The incremental margin year-over-year, it is 23%, but I'm talking about literally what you just raised in sales and EBIT which you would think is incremental. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Ah. Well, (01:02:02) David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : Well, that's why I asked the pricing question. If it was simple, look, I raised revenue in Climate by you name it, the $475 million. But half of it was price and all I'm doing is offsetting cost, then I can appreciate why the incremental profit on that sales is modest. Right? We're just trying to understand is there conservatism in that number or when you look at Industrial, that same math on the way you raised the sales $114 million, you are dropping through 36% more profits. So is the messaging here that yeah, the inflation's in Climate. That price/cost might be a drag on margin but we're more than making up for it in Industrial and thus the whole company has price/cost, no margin drag. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, high level ... David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : (01:02:45) we're trying to figure out. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : High level, David, I'd say that, as Sue said to you, the 232 and 301 really hit the Climate segment much more, if not almost exclusively with the Industrial business. And so to my mind, you've got more headwind there to offset. There is more price in the back half obviously than there would be in the first half. You've got direct material inflation which continues in the second half to be a bit larger than the first half. But shoring up the math to the raise, we can work with you later on and kind of compare notes. Operator : There are no further questions at this time.

First, our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource-constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity of buildings and industrial processes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow in above-average global economic conditions, aided by the strong secular tailwinds I've outlined. Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at consistently delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins, and free cash flow. And lastly, over the years we built an experienced management team and a high-performance winning culture that makes our performance sustainable. When combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, we have a differentiated business model that drives strong shareholder returns over the long term. Moving to slide 4, exiting Q3 and moving into Q4, we continue to execute well and are on track to exceed the guidance we outlined for investors on our Q2 earnings call. First, our end markets remain healthy, and we have continued to deliver excellent growth in bookings and revenues in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Additionally, our growth continues to be broad-based across virtually all businesses, products, and geographies globally, and services growth continues to be especially strong. Second, our leverage and profitability are improving, as we are effectively managing all elements of the P&L to deliver results. In the third quarter, we achieved our second half 2018 leverage target of approximately 25% through strong volume and effective management of our price versus material cost and productivity versus other inflation metrics. We saw good margin expansion across the business, led by the Industrial segment, and healthy margin expansion in our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses. The second half of the year has become increasingly inflationary since we updated our guidance in July. We are embedding the impacts of additional material and other inflation, tariffs, and the knock-on effects of tariffs in our forecast. In spite of this impact, we expect to continue to effectively manage these costs as we have in the second and third quarters and to maintain our guidance of approximately 25% leverage for the fourth quarter. We have raised our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $5.55 and $5.60, up from approximately $5.50 for fiscal 2018. In October, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion, bringing our total available authorization to approximately $1.9 billion. This reflects continued confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flows going forward and gives us increased capacity as we execute our dynamic capital allocation strategy. 2018 is shaping up to be another strong year for us. As we move through the fourth quarter, visibility into 2019 is also improving. Based on virtually everything we're seeing, our major end markets look poised for another year of good growth. Strong bookings in 2018 are also setting us up with a solid backlog picture heading into 2019. And finally, we are managing material and other inflation and tariffs, enabling us to drive solid leverage through the P&L and further expand margins. We expect to use the same processes and tools in our business operating system to manage these risks in 2019. In summary, we're executing our strategy well, and this is enabling us to deliver differentiated performance in 2018. The second half is progressing consistent with our expectations, and we plan to close out the year on a strong note. Looking forward to 2019, we're expecting another good year for our industry and particularly for Ingersoll Rand. Please go to slide number 5. The third quarter was highlighted by continued strong growth across the board, as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Enterprise organic bookings and revenues were both up double digits. Climate led the way, with organic bookings and revenues of 12% and 10% respectively. Industrial was also robust, with organic bookings and revenues up 7% and 9% respectively. These results reflect continued strong execution of our business strategy, capitalizing on healthy end markets. The one minus on the chart was a bookings decline in Commercial HVAC in the Middle East, where orders can be lumpy, and there were a couple of large orders in the third quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in 2018. European HVAC orders continued to be strong in the quarter. Let's go to slide number 6. The next two slides provide insights and additional color into the key drivers behind the chart on slide 5 and how we're thinking about the markets for the remainder of the year and into next year. In Commercial HVAC, we're seeing sustained growth globally in both bookings and revenues, with good growth in both services and equipment. North America growth was strong, with continued gains in services, contracting, controls, and equipment. Institutional growth was particularly strong, led by the education markets. As we discussed on slide 5, Europe Commercial HVAC remained strong, with solid growth across the board in both services and equipment. China HVAC growth continues to outpace the market. Weakening economic indicators in China do not appear to be impacting the HVAC markets to date. Other markets in Asia continue to be mixed, as they have been all year. Our outlook for global Commercial HVAC remains healthy, and key economic and market indicators largely support our view, with increasing visibility into 2019. Turning to Residential HVAC, bookings and revenue growth continued to be strong. Replacement markets, where the majority of our sales are derived, showed continued strong growth in the quarter, and this is expected to continue through the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. Please go to slide number 7. Our Transport Solutions business continues to be globally diversified and resilient. We've seen good order growth for North America trailers in 2018, and the estimates for market revenues has improved from the beginning of the year as well. The Americas Commercial Transportation Research Company, also known as ACT, has taken their forecast for North American refrigerated trailer shipments to 43,700 units, which represents approximately 3% growth over 2017. Our capacity to ship refrigeration units exceeds the industry capacity to supply trailers, so we should have solid backlog heading into 2019. Auxiliary power unit growth was strong in both refrigerated and non-refrigerated segments. As with North American trailers, backlog will be strong going into 2019 as well. Overall, the transport markets remain healthy in 2018, and we expect this to continue heading into 2019. Compression Technologies growth has been solid, consistent with industrial production and other key leading indicators. In quarter three, we delivered good growth in bookings and revenues in both aftermarket and equipment, with particular strength in China. We are seeing some signs of pause with our large Chinese exporter customers, as U.S.-China trade negotiations continue and China economic indicators weaken, but it's too early to call what impact this will ultimately have, but we're continuing to monitor the situation carefully. Overall, we expect to see solid growth broadly across key products, services, and markets through the year end and into next year while maintaining optimism that the U.S.-China trade negotiations will come to a favorable resolution. Small electric vehicle bookings and revenue growth were strong, driven largely by continued success of our consumer vehicle. We're also seeing strong growth across our high-margin Industrial Fluid Management, Tools, and Material Handling businesses. Now I'd like to turn over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number 8. As Mike highlighted, Q3 was another strong quarter for us, with continued robust bookings and revenue growth, improved leverage, solid margin expansion in both our business segments, and 22% year-over-year adjusted continuing earnings per share growth. The third quarter was right in line with our expectations regarding how the second half would play out when we provided our updated guidance on our Q2 earnings call, which gives us confidence we'll continue to trend and achieve that guidance, with $0.05 to $0.10 of upside on the EPS line, or a revised adjusted earnings per share range of $5.55 to $5.60, up from approximately $5.50. Looking at our third quarter results in more detail, bookings and revenue performance remained strong, with sustained growth in virtually every major product category and geography. Services was once again a standout with 11% growth, outpacing 9% equipment growth, as we continue to focus on our growing mix of stable, high-margin, recurring revenue streams. We continue to target free cash flow equal to 100% of adjusted net income for 2018. Year to date, we've been able to sustain very high levels of revenue growth across the business at 9% organic for the enterprise. We've been able to maintain this growth in part because we've appropriately raised our inventory levels to keep up with the robust demand for our products and to meet the needs of our customers. As a result, we're sitting at a higher working capital level at just over 5% of revenue. This is consistent with 2017, and we expect this to improve as we return to a more natural 3% to 4% level for us in the fourth quarter. We maintain our commitment to a dynamic and balanced capital allocation strategy and to returning 100% of excess cash to shareholders over time, whether it be through our strong and growing dividend or through share repurchases as we've consistently demonstrated over many years, or through value-accretive M&A. Through September, we have returned over $850 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In October, our Board of Directors also authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program, bringing our total available share repurchase authorization to $1.9 billion, demonstrating our commitment to share repurchases as an important element of our capital deployment strategy and giving us good flexibility on how and when we execute the program. We also continue to have a healthy and accretive acquisition pipeline that presents opportunities for value-accretive M&A. Our year-to-date spend is approximately $280 million. This spend is primarily related to the ICS Cool Energy acquisition and the Trane Mitsubishi JV. Both acquisitions are performing well and ahead of our initial value-creation models. Please go to slide number 9. As we've discussed, Q3 was a strong financial quarter top to bottom. At the enterprise level, we delivered 10% organic revenue growth, 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement, and adjusted continuing earnings per share growth of 22%. Importantly, we also achieved operating leverage of approximately 25%, which is improvement versus our leverage of approximately 19% in the second quarter and consistent with our guidance for the second half of 2018, as we continue to manage through increasing inflation, new tariffs, and other inflation in areas such as freight and wages. Please go to slide number 10. Focused execution of our strategy in operational excellence drove strong core business operating income contribution in both of our business segments, which combined for approximately $0.28, or virtually all the earnings per share growth in the quarter. The quality of earnings for Ingersoll Rand remains high in that we had a very clean quarter with strong results across the board. Please go to slide number 11. Strong execution drove 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Price versus material inflation was positive by 10 basis points. Productivity versus other inflation was flat. We're effectively managing tariffs, material cost increases, and other inflationary impacts consistent with our guidance for the second half of 2018. Please go to slide number 12. Our Climate segment delivered a very strong third quarter with 10% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Results were strong across the board, consistent with our expectations. Please go to slide number 13. Our Industrial business also delivered very strong results with 9% organic revenue growth and 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Similar to Climate, the strength in the business was broad-based, and it was a very clean quarter. We continued to see strong leverage in our Industrial segment, driven by Commercial improvements, restructuring returns, and productivity improvements. Please go to slide 14. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments and high ROI projects, which is helping to drive our strong growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments this year. As we've discussed on prior calls, in 2018 we have also increased our capital expenditure investments, primarily related to a number of footprint optimization initiatives and new product development projects. These investments will help us make a more cost-efficient and resilient business. We maintain a strong balance sheet with significant optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We maintain our longstanding commitment to paying a strong and growing dividend at or above net income growth. We continue to invest in share buybacks when the shares trade below our calculated intrinsic value. And as noted earlier, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion in October to a total available authorization of approximately $1.9 billion. Year to date through Q3, we have returned over $850 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Please go to slide 16. One of the main topics of interest is how we are managing tariffs and inflation. We've discussed this topic a fair amount throughout our remarks, so I won't spend a lot of additional time on the topic here. This slide gives a good summary of how we are managing all of the associated cost risks, so we've included it in the presentation for your reference. Please go to slide 17. A second topic of interest is our visibility into 2019. As Mike highlighted earlier in the presentation, as we move into the fourth quarter, our visibility into 2019 is improving. We expect to continue to have healthy end markets, and our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above average global economic conditions, aided by strong secular tailwinds. Strong bookings in 2018 should also set us up with solid backlog headed into 2019. We're factoring in the expected impacts from inflation and tariffs into our planning process for 2019, and our objective is to effectively manage these impacts by managing the whole P&L to drive solid leverage, as we've done in 2018. We plan to provide full 2019 guidance when we hold our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call in late January. The last topic is restructuring. We have updated our full-year 2018 guidance for restructuring cost to $0.28, up from $0.20, reflecting recently announced initiatives related to the company's ongoing footprint optimization, which drives operational efficiencies and reduces cost. Until these footprint optimization initiatives were announced, it would have been premature to include them in our estimates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks. Mike? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Sue. Please go to slide 18. We believe the company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably. Our products and services portfolio is at the nexus of global energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends, which provides a tailwind for growth above average economic conditions over the long term. Unless you believe the world is getting less populated, cooler, and less resource-constrained, these secular megatrends will continue to create growth opportunities for Ingersoll Rand. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing team culture that incorporates operational excellence into everything we do. Our business operating system and our culture are a differentiated and sustainable competitive advantage. And lastly, our business model generates powerful cash flow, and we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital. We have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Your first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Jeff. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I was wondering if you would help us out a little bit more with tariffs. I understand that it's included in your guidance. But specifically thinking about this List 3 at 10%, can you give us some idea of what headwind you are overcoming there? And obviously, the follow-on thought, obviously, is then what we're going to think about what that means if we do go to this 25% and how you take actions against that. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Jeff, everything we know on Lists 1, 2, and 3 and Section 232 combined would have been a headwind for 2018 of around, say, $30 million, probably a little bit less than $30 million, but close to $30 million. And in 2019 it would be an incremental, say, $80 million. And our view toward that has always been we're going to cover material cost with price and we're going to cover productivity over other inflation. So we did that in Q2. We did it in Q3. We think it's flat in Q4. Price is still building through the system, and you've seen that and will see it through any of the engineered systems that we produce in the company, whether it's HVAC or air compressors, into 2019. So I feel like we've got a handle on it, managing the impact of that, can handle that with the strategies that we've had historically in the company over the last few years. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great, thanks for that. And then separately, there's been a lot of talk about consolidation and the like in the industry. I just wondered if you could update us on your thoughts on what your priorities are, whether you think the market is right for such a move, and what exactly you'd be looking for. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Our views haven't changed over the last few years, which would be fundamentally at the heart of it. We're in great shape strategically. We don't need to do anything. So anything that we would do would need to be very compelling from a shareholder's point of view. Having said that, we've played all the game theory that's imaginable on us and clearly know what would make sense for us competitively and how we'd react to all of the above. So on that, there's really nothing more to add on that at this point in time. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right, thanks. Solid quarter, guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve, your line is open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Steve. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I just wanted to follow up on Jeff's question just so we level-set ourselves. I guess this year, when all is said and done, your price material inflation equation is, I guess, like modestly negative here for in total, negative 40 bps in the first quarter and then flattish for the rest of the year. Is that correct for the year? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Fundamentally, it was flat for the back half of the year, and that's where we think we're going to track is flat through the back half of the year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So I guess just thinking about that $30 million from tariffs alone, there was obviously some pretty substantial just base inflation that you guys are covering with what, like 1.5% of price this year, something like that? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Roughly. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, so we should think about that $80 million in the context of what was in total inflation obviously a much bigger number than the $30 million of just the tariff-related stuff in 2018. And arguably, maybe that stuff is not as severe on a year-over-year basis in 2019. Is that the correct way to look at it? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : It is, Steve. I think again, the pricing that we've put in is what contemplated all of this. If anything has changed, it's been a little bit more around some of the retaliatory approach that China has taken to some of the U.S. imports. I think we've got a strategy to deal with all of that within the planning process. If we had perfect information on input costs for 2019 or if costs didn't change from this point in time, we would target the same 20 \u2013 30 basis points of margin expansion, price over material inflation, that we normally would put into effect in the planning process. I believe that that's where we'll land in 2019. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, including the $80 million, including the $80 million, correct, that you just talked about, what you know today? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Exactly. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sorry. Go ahead, Sue. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : That's right. So I just wanted to point out that if you were looking at the total impact on Ingersoll Rand, the dollars that we're talking about would be just under $30 million and in the $80 million are from the Section 301. So there's also the Section 232 impact that we built in, in the July guidance, which was about $38 million in 2018, and it's roughly $20 million for 2019. So I don't want to lose track of the fact that we were also trying to overcome the Section 232 piece of that in our pricing and our other mitigating actions for the price material cost equation. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, I just wanted to make sure that everybody \u2013 the $80 million \u2013 anyway, I just wanted to make sure everybody understands what the all-in dynamics are because you've covered a lot more than that in 2018 successfully, and pricing obviously remains strong. Just one other quick one, on the productivity and other inflation, you talked about it's been weak so far year to date, but you talked about a significant improvement in the fourth quarter. What is driving that significant improvement? Is that something that can carry through into 2019? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes, Steve, that's a good point. First of all, thanks for the clarification on the $80 million support, for people to know that we're covering that still expect to get 20 \u2013 30 basis points net of Section 232, Section 301, and all of that. As it relates to productivity, it's been the same discussion all year long, which is just the way that productivity projects will load into the year, there will be a substantial increase in the fourth quarter. Some of these were larger footprint moves or complexity reduction projects across the company that really bear fruit in the fourth quarter. So it is a step up in the fourth quarter. Those projects are underway. They're implemented. They're defined. It's a pipeline. So it's not that we're hoping that productivity comes into the fourth quarter. We've got the projects that support that estimate. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can that carry into 2019? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : We haven't done 2019 yet. But the key with 2019, just like price material inflation, what we'll do from a pipeline perspective is look at productivity offsetting all other inflation. Anticipating wage inflation, anticipating logistics pressure, anticipating all the Section 232 stuff coming in still, we'll cover that through productivity. And if you go back again in the operating system of the company, the question we ask ourselves is do we have 125% of what we need to do in the pipeline primed and ready for 2019. And that will be the emphasis here as we exit the year is making sure the health of the pipeline is going to be the 125%, which historically is what we've done and what we think we can continue to do for some time into the future. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right, great detail, guys. Good execution, thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven, your line is open. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning. Nice to see the progress, everybody. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Steve. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Maybe just going back, I want to just clarify. That 25% operating leverage that you're getting this year, that is inclusive of that flattish price material inflation in the second half, or not? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : It's all in, Steve. So we're saying that it's all in for the back half of the year. Q3, Q4. 25% is a good number, and that's mitigating anything coming in. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And maybe just on that $80 million that you just referenced and those headwinds, can you talk about the base that that's on? In other words, maybe just put that in context of the actual China import volume or dollar volume to the U.S. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Steve, probably not on this call going through that detail because we have to separate a lot of what is more opportunistic supplier pricing coming in from what's a direct tariff. It's a very difficult analysis to make. At the end of the day, the analysis of that isn't so important as to know what we think the right numbers should be and then how to offset that with productivity and price. So it would be difficult to pull out in the call and give you anything reasonable. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, fine. And then on the resi growth side, are you seeing any direct benefits from other supplier challenges in supplying their channels? And is that a meaningful amount for you guys? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, we don't really \u2013 as you know, we don't talk about this relative to any other competitor. But it's clear and last quarter was no exception that for the past four years there has been substantial share gain and margin expansion in the residential business, and that continued in the quarter. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, all right. I will leave it there for later. Thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian, your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. I'm just trying to stick to two questions. The first question just on the incremental margin point, you have more productivity in Q4, but you're saying the incremental margins stay in the mid-20s, consistent with Q3, so just wondering what's moving there. And allied to that, are 25% incrementals the right level for the current macro environment as you look out with high tariffs, high cost inflation, high volume growth? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Let me do the second part first, and Sue might come back on the first part. But I think with the volatility of the environment we're in today, we've always said that we think that incremental margins should look like gross margins, but we always guided you all to think about that as 25%, allowing some room for breakage, allowing some room for investment in the business, and all the things that create a healthy business for the long run. And that's what we're saying here. So I do think that leverage could go higher, particularly if we saw larger compressors coming back into 2019 as an example, continued mix toward services being higher than equipment. That's certainly supportive of higher leverage as well. But I think with the environment we're in, the volatility we're in, 25% incremental is pretty good performance. I think it's really good performance. And I think that that is something that we're committed to for the back of the year. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And, Julian, on the other side of that with the first part of your question, it's interesting as we go through the fourth quarter and all of the pieces that you see. So our pricing was in effect as we went through the guidance in July. We are adding in the impact of the additional tariffs that we didn't know in July when we gave that guidance, so you have a little bit of impact there. You have some additional productivity. But the other part when we think about the overall bridge and those overall incremental margins, we're also continuing to invest in the business. And when I look at fourth quarter spend, we're not trying to cut back any of those good investments in \u2013 whether it's new products or whether it was in the footprint in the fourth quarter. And so we've got some good investment spend also in the fourth quarter. Again, it's not an outlier compared to other quarters in the year but it is slightly higher, and we are continuing to do that throughout the year. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And then my second question would just be around Industrial segment demand. There seems to be more question marks around the sustainability of the backdrop for it. It sounds like, though, the only weak spot you have seen is some of those Chinese exporters around large compressors. If you could, just confirm that's the case, or if there are any watch areas that you're focused on. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Julian, let me take your question and expand it to a broader commentary around China just to give a sense for what we think is going on. And of course, we're trying to triangulate this not only with our own customers but with other companies that have reported earnings as well. The Industrial business versus the HVAC business are really two totally different worlds right now. Think about China's desire for clean air, clean water, and the fact that 15% to 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions happen with HVAC in buildings. Compound that with Transport refrigeration, where you've got a diesel engine powering a refrigeration cycle on a trailer or a truck. Compound that with process cooling and air compressors going into industrial factories. Now anything to do with the clean air, clean water, and retrofitting the economy, the built environment in China is going to be a good business and it might diverge a bit from the narrower industrial economy. On the industrial economy, what we think we're seeing, and this is before bookings. This is the pipeline. This is customer communications and contact that we have. Chinese customers that would have had a bit of a U.S. export model are pausing to understand what the rules of the game are going to be and whether they're going to be in play for the long term. These customers, though, with that supply are going to point that supply somewhere else in the world eventually. So midterm/long term, this excess capacity in China for exporters will find its way to other markets outside the U.S. Inevitably, that's going to happen. But there is a bit of a pause I think on that export model from China to the U.S. based with what's happening with the current negotiations around tariffs. And so we're just anticipating that that could impact in the short run some of that. But these are customers that make decisions very quickly when there is an opportunity, and so it's also something that could change very quickly for the positive. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Gautam, your line is open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hey, Gautam. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just to disaggregate the Climate bookings a little bit in Q3, first, do you still think that Q2 had a pull forward of about $80 million to $100 million? And how much did price contribute to the 10% bookings growth organically in the quarter? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Our pull-through estimate wouldn't have changed there. It was just really strong across-the-board bookings, and you really can't find a soft spot. The only one that showed up on the chart was a little red dash, which happened to be the Middle East off a really tough comp. But everything is extremely strong, whether it's Residential, Transport, Commercial across the world. If you pull apart Commercial and look at applied versus unitary versus services, everything strongly in the green there as well. So the color is good. If you go around the world, you're seeing nice recovery in parts of Latin America for us. We're seeing of course outperformance in Asia-Pacific, particularly with what we're doing in China. So all those things are contributing to a strong growth rate, but it's across the board. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And price on a net basis in that number, the 12%? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : So price remains strong in Climate across the board. Of course, the short-cycle inventory in residential or in light commercial, very quick there to have price effectivity. On the applied longer engineered systems, that's still building through the system. Of course, it's going to be shipping well through 2019. At this point, we built considerable backlog there, as well as building considerable backlog in the trailer market in North America and in the auxiliary power unit market for North America. So I think when those products ultimately ship in 2019, you're going to see more price carry-forward there as well. But price effectivity in Climate is the strongest I've ever seen it. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: One follow-up on your comments on consolidation. Just I noticed you underlined balanced allocation of capital on slide 4. Mike, should we expect that large acquisitions aren't really part of the plan here? It's going to be more of what you've been doing, the tuck-ins, or do you see it, in any case, for something larger to actually unfold? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I think maybe the bigger thing to talk about first is just making sure everyone knows that we're not changing the methodology and the discipline we've had around capital allocation for a long time now. Fundamentally, where we can invest organically in the business, we tend to see the highest ROICs and the quickest ROICs, and so that's evident with share and margin expansion that we've had over time. We believe in the fact that the dividend should grow at or equal to net income over time. So we're continuing to make sure that investors are seeing that come through with announcements that we make on dividends. Dilution, we like to control that, so there's always going to be a little bit of buyback there to control dilution. And then look, at the end of the day, it's looking at the available pipeline. And if we're seeing that we're able to generate return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital, that we're building economic value for the company, we've been disciplined about that, we'll continue to do that. And clearly we've bought back shares. I want to say we bought back $6.5 billion or 150 million shares since 2011. So that's been a big part of the equation. So we're looking to create long-term economic value, however we do that, through that allocation of capital. We're going to continue to do it the same way we've been doing that. Bolt-ons, certainly easy to do and less risk. And as I said to you, on the large strategic, more transformative things, we don't need to do anything. If it was incredibly compelling from an investor's point of view, we would look at that. I'm sure investors would want us to look at that and understand what our role in that could be. But at this point in time, it's all hypothetical, and it's not really worthwhile to discuss the details around those things for us. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: I appreciate it. Thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh, your line is open. Breindy Goldring - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Breindy on for Josh. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Breindy. Breindy Goldring - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. You mentioned that you've been gaining some share in Residential. And we know that one of your competitors had a recent outage that would have required some share shift in the industry. Is that part of where the share gain came from? And given that it should be a greater impact in 4Q, is that included in your current guidance, or could we see some upside on share gain there? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Breindy, we about five years ago, four or five years ago redid most of the product line in res. We entered the opening price point. We modified our channel structure to be able to make sure that we have a product for every home and a channel partner for every product, if you will. So all of that has led to a long-term share gain margin expansion story for the company. And then we just don't talk about the specifics of any given competitor and share shifts between competitors. We just think it's best for our shareholders that we keep that close to our vest. Breindy Goldring - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's fair. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel, your line is open. Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, good morning guys. This is Bhupender here filling in for Nigel. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning. Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, can you guys hear me? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah, we do, go ahead. Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, this is Bhupender here for Nigel. So I just wanted to focus on \u2013 I think Sue mentioned about the service strength here in the quarter of 11%. Could you give some color from what actually is driving that growth in services, especially the contribution from digital and some software initiatives that you have in place? Thanks. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes, it's a strategy. It's been a long-term strategy we've been executing for years to try to drive the mix of the company up in services. And if you go back historically, a decade ago that might have looked more like 30% for the company. And if you look at the service-related businesses, which would be HVAC, Commercial, and our Industrial air compressor business, it's much closer to 50% today, and for the company we're all into the 40s. So I think that it's been a long-term strategy. It's not a single event. It's a system of things. So it's the channel, it's a direct footprint, it's investing in people and in systems and tools because people are hard to come by at this technical skill set. We've had to \u2013 and it's been a good investment around technology to help leverage the ability for our people to get out and see more customers or to handle things remotely. So a lot of the diagnostic work in the background where the connected buildings or connected equipment has been very helpful to us in that. And then, of course, selling different value propositions, using the data and analytics out of systems to improve either building performance or industrial process has been well received. And one of the fastest-growing numbers that we have across the company is the number of connected buildings or connected assets today. It's a number that every time I report it it's up 500 or 1,000 buildings or customers the next time I report it. So that continues to be a really solid investment for us. We would say digital, but it's more than just digital. It's the whole connected experience. Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, that's great commentary. I just wanted to follow up here on the \u2013 you guys have given some commentary on 2019 visibility here. When you look at the backlog, would you be able to comment on how Commercial HVAC backlog actually look by geographical regions, puts and takes basically going into... Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : It's record backlogs coming in. What you see here is institutional backlogs that are very strong that are continuing. We've talked in the past about large projects flowing through. It's interesting, the numbers that we've been reporting all year haven't actually included any what we would think to be large projects. These large projects are still out there. We still think they're in scope for even this year, let alone 2019. That starts to set up very long-term visibility into 2019 and potentially even to 2020 on some of these larger projects. So backlog there is great. Thermo King, it's pretty clear that the industry is under-capacitized for trailers and for tractors. The demand is there. So as soon as a tractor needs an APU or a trailer needs a refrigerated unit, we're ready. We're able to meet that demand. So that's a definite backlog build going into 2019. And then large compressors, we'll wait and see what happens here for the balance of the year. We're coming off a tough comp, quarter four of 2017, as it relates to large compressors, but we'll see how that plays out. But that gives us great visibility into 2019 as well, these large engineered compressors that we sell. Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, just one more actually because you brought in the large compressor here. I just wanted to get a sense of China industrial compressor business, if you look at that. Do you think the margins would be comparable to the fleet average, or they would be like the segment average or below that? Just to get a sense of... Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : They're above. They're average to above. They're excellent. They're great. So China is important for the compressor business for us, and China is important for compressors globally in the market. About half the world's air compressors are sold into China. So it's important to keep an eye on China. And as I said to you, that capacity in China is going to go somewhere. Maybe it goes along one belt, one road, which you can think about that might be brilliantly timed in terms of where that capacity may end up. But these customers are aggressive. They'll make decisions quickly. That capacity will go somewhere. But in the short run, that's where I was cautioning that there could be a pause in some of that business. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott, your line is open. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Thank you for fitting me in, guys. Good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Scott. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : I want to back up a little bit. Obviously, the market over the last month or so sees something \u2013 thinks it sees something daunting out there. And you guys have come up with a pretty darn good quarter, one of the best quarters I think I can remember. How do you reconcile really what \u2013 you've seen homebuilding stocks drop 50%. You've seen anything that touches even non-res construction get hit hard. How do you reconcile that fear that you see out there with the fact that what you see is still a fairly healthy environment? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : When you think about the markets we're serving, again, 15% to 25% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are happening from HVAC systems in buildings. And if we've launched technology two years ago in the applied space that eliminates greenhouse gas emissions by 99.9%, that's going to be a great business. If you think about trailers with a refrigeration cycle running off a diesel engine that can be electrified using again a refrigeration cycle that eliminates 99.9% of those greenhouse gas emissions, and you walk in industrial plants, process cooling and air, we are center cut for a world looking to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And so I don't know that you can just lump us into an Industrial business selling machinery. I think you have to look at the businesses we're in. We happen to be in great businesses with technology that's differentiated and a channel that's differentiated, and a service model that's differentiated. I think this is a long-term great story. So when you see these disconnects in the market, we hope there's investors out there saying this is a great entry point in a company like ours that's got great businesses and a track record of executing very well, with smart capital allocation supporting all that. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : Got you, it's a fair point. And again, just to back up a little bit, do you get a sense, Mike and Sue, that it's easier to get price out there now than it has been in the past, partially just because of the front page news that tariffs have been and maybe partially just because of the answer you just gave, just some differentiated technology? Does it feel easier to you guys at least or seem easier because you seem to catch up to the price/cost curve pretty quickly? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : If you think about the engineered systems, it could be large applied systems, large air compressor systems. That's where 10% of the cost of the total lifecycle is the actual purchase price, 90% is the energy, the maintenance, the refrigerants, et cetera, used. It's easier if you've got a value proposition that allows customers to see the efficiency advantages, the refrigerant advantages and so on, and so forth to get price. So certainly that helps. But as you get sliding into more of the commodity products, you get into residential HVAC with standard SEER levels, this is where operational excellence matters and where the dealer and distributor matter and why it's so important for us to have the best dealers and the best technology and the most cost-efficient operating footprint that we can to be able to really survive in that model. So there's mixed models around price, but clearly, where you're able to differentiate on technology is an advantage. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : Sounds good. Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys, good luck. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning guys. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Mike, so I think you mentioned last quarter that the Chinese HVAC market you thought was growing in about 5% range or so, and that Ingersoll was growing in multiples of that. From what you could you tell, is the market still growing at close to that rate? And have you been able to actually accelerate your outperformance from that market given you now have obviously the direct service model in place for a while, but you also talked about that service pull-through beginning to kick in? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yes, I think you're going to find over time that HVAC in China and the built environment in China might differentiate from the industrial economy in China as it relates to this tariffs discussion. The built environment in China is 10 times larger than the built environment in the U.S. A lot of that environment was built not at the highest level of code, standards, or efficiency levels, and so enormous retrofit opportunities to go in, make them more efficient, and clean the air in doing this. So I think that that is going to potentially be a good market for a long time independent of what's happening in the narrower industrial economy. This is why we put the strategy in place to do what we did last year and made the investments that we made. And we're really pleased with what's happening not only with the penetration into the equipment side of that, but the linkage rates that are happening with services are very high, and it's giving us a lot of confidence that not only was it the right strategy, but the pace at which it's working is faster than what we would have thought. So I feel good about what's happening there, and I think we'll continue to outperform in China specifically. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Maybe a similar question on North America institutional HVAC. So when you look at that strength, obviously, some of the strength is just the market itself. But could you give us some more color on your performance in the markets in the sense that \u2013 I know you do performance-based contracting. Your digital came to $1 billion, your big applied jobs has improved. So has penetration there actually accelerated versus the market? And so as you look into 2019 and 2020, that's what results in this good visibility because you're really going to outperform the market based on what you see? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : If you take a $4.5 billion to $5 billion Commercial North American HVAC business and you just split it and said half of it is service and half of it is equipment, and of the equipment, 85% of that is going to be replacement, it's a real opportunity to go create demand around the installed base and go create demand around energy efficiency. What you're finding now in addition to that is the institutional cycle started last year probably in earnest, still I think relatively early to mid-cycle in that. And then some of the larger projects tend to happen later in the cycle as it relates to larger campus environments, larger customers that have got more complex solutions to put in place, take more time to get that designed, engineered, and implemented. And so I think we enter that phase here in the next year or two. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line is open. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, this is Evelyn Chow on for Joe. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, Evelyn. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Maybe we'll just start on the Industrial incrementals, have seen really nice progress on those incrementals throughout the year. If I think about it, it sounds like the mix of bookings of large compressors and service all seeming to grow. It seems like you're getting price. What are the offsets to get us from the mid to high 30% type incremental range we're seeing in 3Q down to that 25% number we've talked about for the enterprise? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Industrial leverage is higher than that. It's running in the high 30s, and it will continue to leverage into the 30s throughout fourth quarter. They're doing it across the board though. They're executing well at the plant and operational level. They're executing well at the service level as well, so in the field, and they're investing in the business. And so the investments really have been relatively substantial, in fact, as you think about what they've been trying to do to upgrade some of the product portfolio over the last year with that kind of leverage in place. So they're building it for the long run, and I think that this continues to get leverage well north of 30%, and we'd expect it to lever north of 30% in 2019. And we've always said is these larger compressors, if they do come back in at some point in time, we tend to get very high leverage off those, so larger fixed costs that we have in place. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's great, Mike. And then maybe just turning to the $80 million of tariff-related inflation and ways that you might mitigate, is there any thought on potentially pre-buying some of your inventory instead of letting working capital normalize into 4Q? And then maybe as an addition to that, Sue, if you could provide us any color on how much metal spend you either bought or hedged into 4Q and 2019, that would be great. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I think every time we look at fundamentals of lean versus pre-buying lots of inventory, it comes down to you want to really run the business as lean as possible and you want to make sure the supply chain is as short as possible. It tends to favor suppliers that are more localized than long-distance suppliers. And so I think we continue on the journey that we've been on around lean throughout the company and look at that, the supply base or the extension of our lean efforts there. So I won't on that front \u2013 I don't see us doing any pre-buys other than where there are constraints in the industry. So if there's a constraint around semiconductor boards or circuitry or a constraint around diesel engines, those are places that we buy ahead or make larger commitments. But for the run-of-the-mill stuff we buy and the bill of materials, we would continue to run that in the leanest way possible. Susan Carter - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : And, Evelyn, I think when you think about our strategy around purchasing materials and all that and the impact on 2018 and 2019, we're obviously doing buys each and every quarter for not only the commodities, but some of the Tier 2 components. So if you think about 2019, I would say that you might be 50% \u2013 60% bought or committed for the first half of the year and then less so in the second half of 2019. But I think the more important piece of how we buy, whether it's the commodities or some of our other materials, is I don't think you'd want to assume that because of where things are today that you would go and buy that, even if it meant that you were a slightly higher percentage of revenue. And why I say that is the tariffs and the whole discussion around inflation is a really volatile equation, and you can find yourself buying because you think it's a great idea, and then all of a sudden maybe something goes away or speculation comes out of a commodity, say copper, and you have a lower price. I think you're better off following a routine, following a process, and layering in your materials as you go throughout the year and making sure that you have the right blended rate for the materials that you're buying in, and that's exactly what we do as we think about that. And my comments around working capital and where it goes, the 3.5% to 4% is a really natural level for us to really be able to support on-time deliveries and to support our customers. So while it comes down from Q3 to Q4, it isn't because we're unnaturally forcing it down. That's really just the normal cycle of inventory for us. So if there is an opportunity to have something that would be different, we'd certainly look at that. But I really think that ratably buying and following our natural processes is the right way to go. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John, your line is open. John Walsh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Hi, John. John Walsh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So definitely a lot of ground covered. And I just want to make sure I understand or maybe put a finer point around the visibility into 2019. But we have talked about applied backlog being stronger, service growth, what's going on in Industrial around compression. Is there a way to quantify the better visibility you see into 2019 as of today versus maybe historically or even last year? It would feel like you would have more visibility just given the way the dynamics are playing out than you've historically had into 2019. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : The merchant services business being what it is, you get more visibility because you have to believe service is going to continue. And in fact, if there's a downturn, you're going to see service go up as people extend the asset lives. So I would think that service growth as it relates to visibility is a better way of thinking about the mix over the long run. That helps. And then if you take the equipment and systems businesses, nothing has really changed there other than the fact that you can see the backlogs building. And you can understand from a correlation of the metrics that we use to establish a demand forecast that they still tend to be favorable. So between what's in the backlog, what's in the pipeline, and the metrics that are before the pipeline that would be the leading indicators that we use, and there are different indicators for different businesses and different segments of the business and products even if the business, we're able to feel good about 2019 at this point shaping up. Unless there's a dramatic geopolitical event, a dramatic event that's not seen today, we feel like 2019 is shaping up to be a good year. John Walsh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. And then as we think about the energy retrofit business in the U.S., obviously that's driven by replacement, the age of the asset if it breaks, energy code or new regulations. But are you seeing any changes around customer demand due to new financing mechanisms as new money enters that market to fund some of these upgrades? Is that helping drive some of this growth, or is that not something you're seeing at all yet in the market? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : The vast majority is going to come through traditional customer financing, their own deals. Then there's performance contracting, which lends itself toward institutions that may not have the capacity at all times, plus this is an asset that they can \u2013 it's one of the few assets that an institution has that can have a return. If you think about the assets an institution will generally hold, buildings being one of them, it's fortunate that the largest driver of their operating budgets often is going to be utilities and some of the maintenance facilities. So that's always a great place that they would use financing in other areas and then use performance contracting as the way of getting at facility upgrades and improvements at their facilities. So no real changes though in how customers think about that today. John Walsh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Rich, your line is open. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning, everyone, just a couple for me, Mike. Mike, on the mix for 2019, knowing what you know now with your backlog and understanding there's still short cycle stuff in the business you can't necessarily predict, would you say the mix is neutral, better, or worse than what you've seen in 2018 mix of sales? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : We're pulling every piece together now. We haven't taken a look at mix yet. But what I'd say is it comes back to running the whole P&L, understanding that we want to get leverage, EPS growth in the business, cash flow ROIC to be where it's been historically, and we'll work with each of our business to figure out what that's looks like. But we don't have an early read on mix. At this point, if you're modeling anything, I'd model neutral mix. We wouldn't have any better advice for you at this point. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then institutional, I think you're thinking it will be probably be a better year 2019 than 2018, right? So does that end up having been a positive to mix with service or neutral? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Long run it's a positive because it's where the service business gets built is on the engineered systems. And then in the short run, you get a little bit of a gross margin hit, but overcome eight-fold over the long run with the service business that tails on top of that. So as you're modeling 2019, it's negligible, but it would lean toward a little bit more compressed margin. But as you lean toward the out years, the service starts, even in the warranty period, it tends to be a very good story. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then last one on Industrial, on compressors, can you level-set us on service? You noted that is growing, outpacing equipment this quarter on orders. Where are you in terms of percentage of revenues on compressor service? Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : About 50%, it's about half the business. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Half the business. Okay. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Yeah. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. All right, thank you. Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Zac for closing remarks. Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll- Rand Plc : I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. As always, Shane [Lawrence] and I will be available to take calls and questions today and certainly over the next several days and the coming weeks. We'll be on the road in New York and in the mid-Atlantic, so we hope to see some of you very soon. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference conference call.

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you\u2019ll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO, and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to slide three and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Please go to slide three. Before discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results, I'd like to begin the brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy that underpin our financial performance and create value for our shareholders. First, our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings and industrial processes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above-average global economic conditions, aided by the strong secular tailwinds I\u2019ve outlined. Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at consistently delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins, and free cash flow. And lastly, over the years we built an experienced management team and a high-performance winning culture that makes our performance sustainable. When combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, we have a differentiated business model that drives strong shareholder returns over the long term. Turning to slide four, focused and consistent execution of our business strategy enabled us to deliver top tier financial performance in 2018. We deliver top quartile organic bookings and revenue growth in each quarter and closed out full year 2018 with 13% organic bookings growth and 9% organic revenue growth for the enterprise. Adjusted earnings per share growth was also top quartile, up 24% for the year and up 29% in quarter four. Despite persistent material and other inflation and tariff related headwinds, our team successfully developed and delivered pricing and productivity actions that enabled us to effectively manage these costs and drive improved leverage and solid margin expansion throughout the year. Importantly at the end of quarter two, we set out to achieve significantly improved leverage of 25% in the second half of 2018 and the team delivered against that objective while at the same time delivering record organic bookings and record revenues. Additionally, we achieved 10 basis points positive price cost per full year 2018 with 60 basis points of enterprise adjusted operating margin expansion, while at the same time continuing our healthy pace of incremental business investment which is core to our ongoing differentiated operational and financial performance. Free cash flow for the year was 82% of net income which lagged our 100% conversion target. The largest component of the shortfall is related to funding working capital above normal levels through the end of the year in order to meet growing customer demand for our products and services. We also funded additional CapEx for high ROI projects beyond what we expected when we entered the fourth quarter. We've delivered an average of 110% free cash to net income conversion over the past four years and we expect to return greater than 100% in 2019. Lastly, in 2018, we also continue to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. After investing in the business including $366 million in capital expenditures, largely related to footprint optimization and plant consolidation, we deployed approximately $1.7 billion between dividends, share repurchases, and mergers and acquisitions. Turning to slide five, our performance against our initial guidance expectations was strong with the exception of free cash flow which I discussed earlier. We significantly beat on both the top and bottom lines and delivered strong margin expansion, while managing inflation and tariff related headwinds and making healthy investments in the business. Turning to slide six, focused execution of our business strategy is delivering differentiated results in the marketplace and for shareholders and we will maintain this focus going forward. Looking at 2019, we see the fundamental ingredients for another strong year. First, our end markets generally remain healthy and I'll address that in more detail on the next couple slides. Second, we're entering 2019 with record backlog in multiple business units after achieving exceptional bookings throughout 2018. This provides us with improved visibility into what to expect for 2019 revenues relative to where we'd have traditionally been at this stage in the year. Third, in 2018, we demonstrated our ability to effectively manage inflationary and tariff-related headwinds through pricing and productivity. Combined with higher expected volumes, we expect this to enable us to continue to deliver solid leverage, improving margins and strong EPS growth in 2019 as we did in 2018. For 2019, we're expecting free cash flow to exceed adjusted net income. We will continue to execute a dynamic capital allocation strategy that deploys capital where it earns the best returns. This includes organic investments, dividends, mergers and acquisitions, and share repurchases. On the M&A side, we have an active pipeline of attractive opportunities. It will be a strong fit with our core business strategy. If and when these become actionable and affordable, we're in a strong position to execute any transactions. We also continue to see value in our own shares which are trading well below calculated intrinsic value. Lastly, based on our performance in 2018 and our guidance for 2019, we're firmly outpacing the glide path to achieving our 2020 Investor Day revenue growth, EPS, and free cash flow guidance that we laid out during our mid-year 2017 Investor Day. Given the tremendous amount of inflation and tariffs the industry has endured over the last two years, moving along that glide path a bit differently than what we expected in 2017, we're well ahead of the curve nonetheless. Turning to slide seven, our end markets continue to show strength throughout the fourth quarter and 2019 appears to be shaping up as another solid year. In Commercial HVAC, the markets remain strong in virtually all geographies and we delivered strong bookings growth and revenue growth across the product portfolio. Europe has shown mixed economic signals over the past few months, but HVAC activity remains healthy there as well. China had a solid quarter in HVAC with good growth in both equipment and services. Our direct sales strategy in China continues to progress well against our expectations and we're making good inroads in a number of verticals including infrastructure, which has been a key focus for us, and continues to be one of the strongest verticals. The situation remains fluid with trade war uncertainty. But at this point in the year, we're still expecting to see modest market growth and market share expansion opportunities in China, outside of China, the Asian markets are mixed. In total our global outlook for the Commercial HVAC market continues to be positive with low-single-digit to mid-single-digit market growth expected. Turning to Residential. Quarter four was a very strong quarter for us with continued share gains, primarily driven by replacement demand and we expect the majority of the market growth to come from the replacement market in 2019 as well. This plays well into our business mix which is about 85% replacement. Economic indicators have softened modestly, but is still healthy and supportive of growth for the year. Turning to slide 8. Our Transport business continues to be a globally diversified and resilient business with good growth opportunities across multiple areas. In 2018, we saw exceptional order growth for North American trailers and auxiliary power units and we built a healthy backlog as a result. In 2019, our strong backlog position for these businesses gives us solid visibility into revenue growth for the year, as we work to convert this backlog to revenue over time. The European Transport markets are mixed with trailer a bit weaker and truck a bit stronger as Brexit uncertainty is impacting these markets. We think additional clarity around this topic would be a positive catalyst. Overall, we're expecting low single-digit to mid-single-digit market growth for transport refrigeration in 2019. Our Compression Technologies business had good growth globally in the fourth quarter with North America and Europe healthy. We continue to see trade war uncertainty impacting projects in China. Global services growth continued to outpace equipment growth in the fourth quarter which is a positive and is well supported by multiple service initiatives focused on increasing attachment rates of services to equipment and increasing our share of wallet of total services provided within accounts. All things considered, we expect to see low single-digit \u2013 mid-single-digit growth in the Compression Technologies market in 2019 with China being the main area to watch closely. Small electric vehicle growth continues to be powered primarily by our consumer and utility businesses. We expect to see healthy growth in 2019. Our Industrial Products businesses including Fluid Management, Tools and Material Handling markets remain healthy and we expect to see continued solid growth in these businesses in 2019. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter and discuss our 2019 guidance. Sue? Sue Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number 9. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove solid operating and financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, an increase of 29% versus the year-ago period. Our earnings growth in Q4 closed out a strong year in which we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth in excess of 20% in each quarter. Organic bookings and revenue growth was strong in both our Climate and Industrial segments. In our Industrial segment, we delivered 6% organic bookings and revenue growth. Organic bookings growth was healthy in the fourth quarter despite a difficult comparison of 12% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. On the Climate side, organic bookings were exceptional, up 20% including a large Commercial HVAC order that will provide revenue over the next three to four years. Excluding this order, organic bookings growth was still outstanding, up 13%. These exceptional organic growth rates accelerated despite difficult comparisons with very strong growth rate up 7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth was also exceptional up 9% and was broad-based across all of our Climate businesses and across building equipment and services. As Mike discussed, free cash flow was 82% of adjusted net income, primarily due to finding higher working capital to support our exceptional bookings and revenue growth and funding additional CapEx for strong projects in the fourth quarter. We continue to drive high-quality earnings and expect to deliver free cash flow in excess of 100% of adjusted net income in 2019. Leveraging our business operating system for operational excellence across the enterprise, we continued to manage direct material, tariff-related and other inflationary headwinds in the quarter. During Q4, we delivered our targeted 25% operating leverage and expanded adjusted operating margins 90 basis points. For the year, our 60 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement was towards the higher end initial guidance. Importantly, we also delivered on our dynamic capital allocation strategy in 2018. We deployed $480 million in dividends and increased the dividend 18% during the year consistent with our commitment to maintaining a strong and growing dividend over the long-term. We deployed $900 million on share buybacks as the shares continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. We also deployed $285 million on strategic mergers and acquisitions in 2018, the majority of which was committed to spend in 2017. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Please go to slide number 10. As we discussed on the previous slide, the fourth quarter was highlighted by continued strong organic bookings and revenue growth in both of our segments as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. These results reflect continued strong execution of our strategy, capitalizing on healthy end markets. One minus sign on the chart was a revenue decline in Commercial HVAC in the Middle East where orders and accompanying revenues can be lumpy. Last quarter we highlighted that there were a couple of large orders in the third quarter of 2017. These orders shift in the fourth quarter of 2017, creating a difficult comparison for us in the fourth quarter of 2018. European HVAC orders and revenues showed continued strength in the quarter. Please go to slide number 11. We delivered organic revenue growth of 8%, adjusted operating improvement of 90 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 29%. Strong gains in volume from ongoing investments in new products, channel and system controls are delivering results in virtually every business and geography where we compete. Consistent disciplined focus on productivity and pricing actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff-related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise. Please go to Slide number 12. The focused execution of our business strategy, underpin by our business operating system, enabled us to drive solid year-over-year earnings per share growth in the quarter. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth. Our Industrial segment delivered solid results with our Compression Technologies business in particular, levering over 40% in the quarter. Corporate productivity initiatives drove $0.05 of earnings per share growth year-over-year. Below the operating income line, other expenses related to legacy legal matters negatively impacted results by approximately $0.04. All-in, we delivered 29% earnings per share growth with strong results across the enterprise. Please go to Slide number 13. Strong execution drove 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Price versus material inflation was positive by 40 basis points in the quarter and positive by 10 basis points for the full year, reflecting strong pricing efficiency and a return to more normal price cost, despite the extraordinary inflation we were up against in 2018. Productivity versus other inflation was notably stronger in Q4 improving margins by 30 basis points. For the full year productivity fully offset other inflation. We also continue to reinvest heavily in our business with incremental Q4 investment of approximately 60 basis points, pretty evenly weighted between operating expense reduction projects to drive further productivity, footprint optimization, plant consolidation projects for Commercial HVAC and Compression Technologies and new product development and information technology investments. All these investments work in concert to make Ingersoll-Rand a stronger and more resilient business. Please go to Slide 14. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 9% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Consistent with our expectations results were strong across the segment. Please go to Slide 15. Our Industrial business also delivered strong results with 6% organic revenue growth and 40 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion with Compression Technologies leverage up more than 40%. Outside of Compression Technologies, the overall Industrial segment leverage was negatively impacted by discrete accrual adjustment and a legal settlement totaling approximately $5 million. We expect Industrial segment leverage will be strong moving into 2019 as it has been over the past several quarters. Please go to Slide 16. In 2018 we executed a dynamic and balanced capital allocation plan deploying capital where it earns the highest returns for our shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investment in high-ROI projects to help customers solve their most complex challenges. These investment help drive our strong growth in both segments during 2018. Beyond that we invested $366 million in CapEx largely on footprint optimization and cost-out programs which build a stronger more resilient Ingersoll-Rand. We maintained a strong balance sheet that provides us with good optionality as our markets evolve. We executed against our long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend. During 2018, we've raised the dividend, 18%. Additionally we deployed approximately $900 million on share repurchases as the shares continue to trade below intrinsic value. As we look forward to 2019, we remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the best return on investment opportunities. We're enthusiastic about the future and the opportunities ahead to deploy excess capital to the best ROI investments, whether that be investment in the business raising the dividend, repurchasing shares, or making value accretive strategic acquisitions. Please go to slide 18. I'll spend a few minutes walking you through the details of our 2019 guidance. Given the market backdrop Mike outlined earlier, we expect total reported revenues to be up 4% to 5% in 2019 with the Climate segment growing slightly faster than Industrial. The difference between our reported and organic revenue contemplates about one percentage point of negative foreign exchange impact year-over-year. With the enterprise, we delivered solid leverage and margin expansion in the back half of 2018. In 2019, we expect further margin expansion in each segment and enterprise adjusted operating margin expansion of between 30 and 80 basis points. Please go to slide number 19. We expect continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2019 to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35 excluding about $0.25 of restructuring. We've modeled approximately $500 million in share repurchases into our guidance, which translates into approximately 244 million diluted shares for 2019. As I outlined earlier, we're committed to a dynamic and balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash over time. Net the actual allocation of excess cash will depend on where we see the highest ROI opportunities over the coming quarters. We're targeting free cash flow to be greater than 100% of net income. The adjusted effective tax rate is estimated to be between 21% and 22%. And for your modeling purposes, we also offer the following guidance. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $250 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million, primarily driven by footprint optimization, factory consolidation, and new product development initiatives. Below operating income, we estimate interest expense to be approximately $200 million reflecting the debt refinancing we did in early 2018. Additionally, we estimate that pension-related expenses that are classified within the other income and expense line will be approximately $40 million for 2019. We did not plan other income or expense line items outside of pension. These items are truly other and not estimable in advance. Now I'd like to cover two topics of interest with you. Please go to slide 21. It's hard to keep track of what's happening with tariffs relative to what's in and what's out of guidance, so we thought it might be useful, if we laid out the assumptions that we're using. The guidance I just laid out includes, the known direct and indirect impacts we expect from the Section 232 tariffs, the Section 301 tariffs including Lists 1, 2 and 3 which is the full $200 billion and the expected China retaliatory tariffs. Relative to the Section 301 tariffs, we've included a planned step-up from 10% to 25% on March 1, 2019 at the conclusion of the 90-day negotiation period. As we've said a number of times during this call, we expect to be able to effectively manage the inflationary and tariff- related impacts in 2019 as we manage these types of costs in 2018. To be clear, however, if the step-up from 10% and 25% does not occur, you should not anticipate we'll see a windfall gain. We will implement the pricing actions necessary to cover the actual inflation we see. The next topic which is on the same slide is on 2019 restructuring costs. We thought it would be helpful to provide a little extra content beyond what we included in the main presentation. The restructuring we're doing in 2019 is largely aimed at proactively taking steps to build stronger, more resilient businesses in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Of the estimated $0.25 of restructuring in 2019, more than 80% relates to our ongoing footprint optimization and plant consolidation efforts. Each optimization project is expected to reduce our fixed cost base and improve operational efficiencies which benefits us no matter the economic conditions we encounter going forward. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks Sue. Please go to slide 22. We believe the company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years and our 2018 financial results bolstered our confidence. We'll be the first to recognize that 2018 was by no means a perfect year. There'll be a room for further improvement. However, our ability to solve complex problems and overcome escalating headwinds to drive continuous improvement results for 2018 is encouraging and gives us confidence our business operating system and high-performing teams are prepared to successfully navigate the evolving landscape ahead. I want to extend my full appreciation to our talented people throughout the world that are committed to delivering excellent results for our customers and shareholders. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably. Our products and services portfolio is at the nexus of global energy efficiency and sustainability mega trends, which provides a tailwind for growth above-average economic conditions over the long-term. Unless you believe the world is getting less populated, cooler, and less resource-constrained, these secular mega trends will continue to create growth opportunities for Ingersoll-Rand. Successful execution of this strategy enabled us to deliver exceptional bookings and profitable revenue growth in every quarter of 2018. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing team culture that incorporates operational excellence into everything we do. Our business operating system and our culture are differentiated and sustainable competitive advantage. And lastly, our business model generates powerful cash flow and we are committed to deployment of capital. We have a strong track record of generating free cash flow and deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning Scott. Sue Carter : Good morning. Scott Davis : Boy there's not much to pick on in this quarter at all. But you made a couple of comments I just wanted to dig into a little bit. In particular, really about the push to the right on some of the Commercial projects in China. Is it the opinion of your local guys that this is just more of a delay or maybe something a little bit more tied to the tariff outcome or what's really the color behind some of those comments? Mike Lamach : Yes, you have to separate the business a bit Scott. So, take HVAC where we saw again really strong bookings growth and continued momentum there in services as well. And in those markets, I think, it's less susceptible particularly on the government commercial side involving infrastructure institutional work that there's more of a bias toward producing greenhouse gas emissions and as I've said hopefully a thousand times, if you're going to go attack the greenhouse gas emissions problem anywhere, you're going to hit HVAC whether it's stationary or transport first because 15% to 25% of most economies' global greenhouse gas emissions. So, I don't think that China will let its foot off the gas around codes, compliance and regulations that would improve air and water quality. That being said, you look at the Industrial business and here I think the trends are largely the same. Interestingly, we saw good growth in some of the smaller compressors, some of our contract-cooled rotary and certainly in our rotary compressor line-up in general, but certainly all three would have been part of that. So that continues. What I get mostly from our suppliers and from our customers that are, in China exporting outside of China particular to the U.S. is, they are waiting to see, however some of them are moving more rapidly to put incremental capacity in Asia, outside of China. So Vietnam is a favorite spot for that right now. So I think that you're already seeing sort of actions taken by Chinese companies that export. I think you'll continue to see that going forward. And by the way, it's a positive Scott for us because you know it doesn't matter sort of where they set up shop, we're going to be able to support them. Scott Davis : Yes, that's going to be my natural follow-on is that are you a net winner or a net loser? I mean you have critical mass in China and some those other regions maybe you don't or do you? I guess is kind of... Mike Lamach : Yes. We have a strong footprint throughout Asia, so you really can't get to a part of Asia where we don't have a team on the ground, sufficient capacity of supply. So it will be good so long as that capacity is unlocked somewhere we would have opportunity. Scott Davis : Okay. I am going to pass it on. Thank you guys. Mike Lamach : Thank you Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey guys good morning. Mike Lamach : Hey Steve. Steve Tusa : Can we just dig into the bridge, the margin bridge a little bit? What was exactly in investment in other? And then could you maybe just give some color on how you see kind of that price material number kind of trending? And I think you said, no windfall if the tariff doesn't go through, but like you're already 40 bps ahead of the game here, definitely better than we expected in 4Q. I would think that, you know can get better on its own ex-tariffs next year, maybe just give a little bit more color on how you see both of those parts of the bridge probably trending in the 2019 guidance. Mike Lamach : Yes. Steve so when you say sort of walk through bridge, are you thinking about the 2019 bridge or the 2018 fourth quarter bridge? Steve Tusa : Yes. I am just in the context of what happened in the fourth quarter I guess 2019. So maybe just explain the 60 bps what was in there in the 4Q and then moving beyond the 2019 how you'd see that play out? Mike Lamach : Yes, I would start and let Sue finish. The price over material inflation was something that we had hoped to get back to say 0 for the full year. We got to 10 basis points, so roughly at our expectations there. That worked out, materialized as we hoped it would. One of the questions going into 2019 than is why is there not more positive price versus cost given some of the carryover and what I would say there as you've got to remember the 232 tariffs were implemented in April and May and the 301 were implemented in October, so the first half still sees headwinds from tariffs that didn't exist last year at the same time. We also would see commodity inflation in quarter 1 and quarter 2, still see steel is being the largest, copper is being next and of course the Tier II knock-on effect that --these metals would be inflationary in the first half of 2018. But by quarter 2 you start to lap the majority of price from 2018. Materials begin to get perhaps deflationary, but tariffs remain in our model, so you might see a wider spread in Q3 or Q4. But it's a pretty early to call all that looks, but our plan is laid out as I've just expressed in that regard. Sue, any of the bridge items? Susan Carter : Yeah. So if you think about, Steve your question on investments in the fourth quarter and going into 2019. So the investments in the fourth quarter were as we had planned them throughout 2018 and they're primarily investments in Operational Excellence and new product development and some of the footprint optimization that we were doing. And those actually do carry over and we continue to invest in the business as part of our capital allocation strategy in 2019. So nothing terribly unusual or unexpected, as you think about either the fourth quarter of 2018, or where we're going in 2019. It's that overall strategy of really providing for projects that make us operationally better, increase productivity and allow us to manage the business. Mike Lamach : Yeah. Sue, I probably add one point which is when you think about the productivity over a long period of time creating higher utilization and really opening up new capacities we've taken the decision over the years to slowly as projects emerge and you can consolidate reduce footprint we've done that. But you've seen in 2018 and 2019, a more aggressive view toward that. There was a step-up in 2018 not quite as high a step-up in 2019. That's at this point sort of the last of what we've see is the larger projects would entail for us. And we want to be clear that we're not thinking about a recession in 2019, but we wanted to get really in front of that final large restructuring now. And just really in the event that something would happen into the future around recession, we just can be that much more resilient around that. So that's another part of what the investments involved through 2018 and certainly in the fourth quarter of 2018. Steve Tusa : Historically that investment number is kind of a modest negative. Is that what we should think about for 2019 a more modest negative? Mike Lamach : Well, the total investment number on the bridge itself is always right around 40, 50 basis points and that's exactly what we're going to be modeling in 2019. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then one last one. Normal seasonality first half to second half next year, how should we think about seasonality for 1Q and the rest \u2013 and next year? Mike Lamach : Steve I love you're adapting your question, because I was expecting the one about quarter one. And so let me answer that one actually first, because I appreciate that you're taking a longer view on that. Quarter one is usually the part that I think creates the most confusion around investors. But historically, if you look at the three-year average we've been around 12.4%. If you go to a long-term average, it's been around 11.1%. So I think that when you think about the seasonality for us, it largely comes into the first quarter. And for models that are between 11% and 12.5% you're kind of in a safe range. If you're north of that, you're probably figuring out something that we don't know about. So that's how I would kind of give you some thoughts around quarter one. The rest of the year sort of works itself out. I don't think there's been that many situations where there's been confusion around the back half of the year or even quarter two. Steve Tusa : Well, you gave me more than I thought I was going to get. I appreciate that. Thanks guys. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe a first question around the free cash flow within that step-up of conversion in 2019. I think you're guiding for CapEx to drop almost 20%. But you're still guiding for operating cash flow to grow about 25%, so double the EBIT growth guide. Maybe just spell out, is that mostly coming from receivables, for example? And how quickly through the year do you think we see that improvement, given your cash flow tends to be pretty seasonal? Sue Carter : Yeah. Julian, it should be a good story for us in 2019. We really do expect to have greater than 100% of net income and free cash flow. And so as you take apart those pieces, let's talk about CapEx for a second with the approximately $300 million guide for 2019. That is lower than 2018. That was $366 million and there's a couple of components to that. We made a couple of decisions on projects in 2018. We had some carryover we had a warehouse facility where we were doing a warehouse consolidation absolutely a good project. We made a decision to lease versus buy. So long... Mike Lamach : Other way around, owned versus leased. Sue Carter : All right. Owned versus leased. Sorry, Mike. So as you think about the CapEx, it sort of normalizes back into our more 1% to 2% of revenues range in 2019. So that's helpful. As you think about working capital, working capital isn't going to change from an overall strategy viewpoint, which is that you're always going to be looking to balance out your customer terms and your supplier terms. So DSO and DPO always looking to balance those out. And on inventory, you're looking to make sure that you have enough products to meet the demand that we have, which is, of course, been quite strong. And at the same time, meet your on-time customer delivery. What I would expect to see in the free cash flow guide in 2019 is that, as we move through 2019 that the working capital as a percentage of revenue is also going to normalize back more into our 3% to 4% range of the long-term guide. So we're moving back into more of the longer-term metrics in the 2019 statistics and that's what gives us the additional bump in free cash flow for next year. Julian Mitchell :  Great. Thank you. And then my second question, maybe a bit more color on what you're seeing in Europe overall. I think you'd mentioned that in Thermo King you have some specific watch items which are understandable. But anything interesting changing in Trane or on the Industrial side in terms of customer spending appetite and so forth, and maybe split anything on Western Europe versus the Middle East. Mike Lamach : Well, we've had a very strong HVAC year in quarter four in Europe and so that continues. And again, here this is \u2013 this bifurcation between economies, very focused on energy efficiencies, greenhouse gas emissions and making the regulatory changes to make that happen. So the growth rates there are outstanding. And then, you're looking at sort of the Industrial side of Europe is slower than that of course, as you're really I think factoring in sort of sloppier Brexit and I think the economy is a little bit in a slower mode there. But all in all, it's not \u2013 it's certainly not bad in Industrial in Europe for us and it's been great in HVAC. The Middle East just been choppier with the way orders come in there. Generally, you're talking about district cooling plants that are extremely large and whether we build them or not or modify them or not can make a difference quarter-to-quarter. So, I think the environment there is good for us. It's just a matter of lumpiness in the orders. So, we're relatively optimistic on Europe and certainly the Middle East as well. In terms of transport refrigeration in Europe, it's a little bit mixed. You've got a slowdown in Western Europe. You've got continued growth in Eastern Europe. You see a little slower European trailer market and you see a little stronger European truck market. And, again, I think this is just really working through some of the general economic concerns, largely Brexit. And clarity on Brexit, frankly, sort of a good outcome there. Clarity would be sort of a baseline outcome. I think it's a positive for the market and for our businesses. Julian Mitchell :  Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Hi Nigel. Sue Carter : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Mike it sounds like you had that Q1 answer prepared. Mike Lamach : I didn't want to disappoint Steve on that one, so I got it. Nigel Coe : 12.4% that was pretty specific. So, the large commercials order, I don't think I've ever seen you call out an order of that size and especially in long-cycle. So, maybe just a bit more color in terms of that and how that progresses in. What's the market like for that kind of size of order? I mean are you seeing opportunities of scale out there? Mike Lamach : Yes, we actually had one in 2016 and I wished we would have called it out in 2016 because that created a little bit of confusion in 2017 when it lapped. I think it was in the $128 million range, this one's closer to $200 million. So, I think that we're going to see more of these where it's a holistic approach toward reducing energy use in facilities, campuses, buildings, reducing the energy intensity, maybe even getting some grid flexibility moving toward alternative power. We're seeing more of that. And so for us, we're seeing that it involves design, equipments, lots of controls, service moderating over time, and that's a subcontract that will go along with that. So, they're lumpy. I've been probably talking about this for three or four quarters. So, that's one of the larger projects that we thought we will close and I think these things will get spotted in over time. This particular project will last about 40 months and it will earn revenue in a pretty linear fashion. And we like that. We like the -- again, the resiliency over four years and having a nice base business to build on. The margins are pretty good and so it shouldn't really affect what we expect to be good leverage for the business going forward. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's really helpful. And then I think you mentioned your shares below intrinsic value for, I think, three or four times during the call. You also mentioned M&A opportunity. So, I'm actually wondering given that you consider your share price too cheap right now, is the needle for incremental dollars still towards buybacks? Or do you see opportunities out there to deploy M&A more accretively than share buybacks? Any comment there would be helpful. Mike Lamach : Yes, it's both Nigel. I mean you can expect that it would be both for us. And it's really looking at the affordability the ROICs of the M&A that's out there based on what we think we could do that for and then comparing that toward intrinsic value. Of course, the benefit on the acquisition is building a compounding base of cash over time, particularly if they're good businesses strategically fit the core of the company. So that's the focus. But as we're not going to let cash sit around for long and we're going to deploy it somewhere. And that's what certainly happened in the fourth quarter, where you saw actually stepped up the buyback in the fourth quarter. Balance sheet is in great shape, so plenty of capacity there and flexibility to work with the balance sheet going forward. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Joe. Susan Carter : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So just to clarify a couple of points on the cash flow Sue. So obviously nice step-up expected in 2019. You guys are expecting roughly 40% growth. Get the CapEx point, it seems like the delta is \u2013 half of it seems to be coming from working capital improvement half of it coming from earnings growth or EBIT growth, core EBIT growth. And so on the working capital side, are you assuming the turns get a turn better? Or how should we be thinking about that working capital piece? Susan Carter : Yeah. If I think about Joe and I go back a little bit with the working capital as a percentage of revenue, where we would have called that at year end would have been probably 3.4%, 3.5% somewhere right in the middle of our 3% to 4% range. And it ended up at 4.3%, so you actually do get to your point on about a full point of that coming out of there. And again, it is a process where it is not just making a decision of whether you're going to have inventory there or not. I mean, there's a series of levers that happen. As you see the demand forecast, as you plan what's going to happen in the factories and you plan how you're going to actually efficiently manage those factories going through time, in order to meet that on-time customer delivery. So your point to the right one, the inventory will probably come down over time and everything else remains balanced. But it does go back into that 3% to 4% of revenue range which is what gives you the uplift. Mike Lamach : And of course Joe, we delivered really outsized cash flow in a slowdown. So it's kind of a good problem to have as we're funding growth here. And it's not a worry in terms of what we think about everyday. The cash would be not a worry in terms of our ability to deliver that. We've done it historically. We'll do it in 2019 and it was good reason in 2018. The plan we always have is to increase turns. We usually plan at about half a turn, but we always throttle it back. The Trump card there is always on-time shipment, on-time delivery and when you've got sort of volatile order rates particularly biasing upwards, we want to make sure we've got plenty of safety stock or increased Kanban sizes to be able to handle particularly hard-to-get components and parts. And so we're just going to make sure that we're making hay while the sun is shining. So, Sue's point's exactly right, but we want to make sure to fulfill the growth and do it on time. Joe Ritchie : All right. So maybe said another way, if the quarter book looks good as the year progresses and you may have to build inventory again next year and that's just a good problem to have. Mike Lamach : Well, our growth rates the forecast probably half of what it was last year. So I think to Sue's point, you're going to see where the capital come down anyway there a little bit. I think we comfortably get above 100% just based on that. But it's a 12-round fight, so you need to think about how this is going to evolve over the year. And if we've got a good outcome on some of the stuff that's out there, whether it's the debt ceiling negotiations, or Brexit, or China-U.S. tariff discussions, if it's a blue sky scenario there, we're going to adjust as necessary to go fulfill that. Joe Ritchie : Yeah. No, that makes sense. And Mike, just to follow on your question, your comment earlier around talking about these large projects for several quarters. I recognize the lumpiness, but it'd be helpful if you can maybe talk about the pipeline, whether you see like the pipeline as being pretty robust today or you are starting to see some of these projects come through and maybe a little less full than maybe what you saw over 12 months ago? Mike Lamach : Yeah. Look, I think that these projects kind of go in sort of two to five at a time that are out there on the horizon. They take often two, three years to develop. We'll often put $10-or-more million into the development of the project, as you can imagine. And so, as we get closer and closer toward thinking we've got something, we can certainly do that this year. We knew that we had one or two turned out to be the one really large one, there's a couple of smaller but in the magnitude of $50 million to $125 million that are out there. Joe Ritchie :  Okay, great. Thanks guys. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Mike Lamach : Hi, Andy. Susan Carter :  Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, obviously, there continues to be some concern that resi HVAC for you will slow down at some point, given weakened new housing. But we know you're projecting a little bit -- single digit growth for the resi market in 2019 based on replacement demand. Was your resi growth in Q4 natural real climate growth in the high single digits? And do you think 2019 could be another year of share gains for Ingersoll? Or should we think Ingersoll growth more in line with the market in 2019? Mike Lamach : Are you talking about resi, Andy? Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes, yes. Mike Lamach : Yeah. So resi, really from 2013 to the present, and I would say 18, for sure, consecutive quarters in a row we've had share gain. We really changed the strategy in 2013 product distribution, the model, investments in digital. And so for 18 straight quarters without a hiccup we've had share gain there. It was the same in the fourth quarter of this year. And the markets there remain strong. You have to realize that, 85% of what we do is going to be in the replacement market, not the new construction market. So think about the context of Ingersoll-Rand, you think about Residential HVAC as being less than 10% of our revenue. So you could think about \u2013 obviously, you're talking about a really small number, 1% to 2% being new construction and if that fell off even 20%, it would be a negligible dip for us. We're really built towards the replacement market and I think that's going to continue to be strong. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. And maybe, Mike, if I can ask you about the U.S. Commercial HVAC market. Obviously, a lot of questions on the large projects, but even the 13% organic bookings growth in the quarter was very strong. Looking to 2019, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks to get better visibility here than you've had. Some people still question, how we're late to cycle. But if you look at the strength that you've seen, is it still broad-based between institutional supply markets? And the same markets, is institutional going to lead the way in 2019? And does this backlog that you have really start picking in 2020 at this point? Mike Lamach : Well a couple of things, Andy. One is certainly the applied business remains strong, but I have to tell you the strength of the unitary \u2013 commercial unitary market was really strong as well. And so this just gives us a general sense about underlying economic conditions in the U.S. are still pretty positive. It's got long legs to have had that kind of growth for this long, particularly the results we had in the fourth quarter in commercial unitary. The applied institutional work continues to move along nicely, education and healthcare about 50% of that mix, and we think that education continues to be strong. We think that the healthcare continues to be strong. No outliers there that we're seeing on that front. So we think we've got a solid backlog built for 2019. And as I mentioned earlier on the question regarding the larger contract that we booked that Nigel asked that thing has a four-year span. So I think this thing has got legs through 2019 for sure. Now recognize too, Andy, for people let me -- just to keep it in context. When you think about our Commercial HVAC business, you get to think about 50% equipment, 50% service. You get to the equipment piece of this thing, it really breakdown pretty quickly between Institutional and Commercial. But the large component of what we do there is still replacement buildings in the U.S. And so I think there's always an opportunity for us to have more energy efficient, more environmentally friendly ideas going into our customers, and so there\u2019s demand creation opportunity here as well. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Mike Lamach : Hi, John. John Walsh : Maybe just to circle back to the margin bridge into 2019 for Climate. Was just wondering if there is anything to call out in terms of mix. You, obviously, gave us the market growth rates for some of the sub-businesses, but is there anything Ingersoll-specific there? And then anything as it relates to the different growth rates between equipment and service as you think about the margin impact? Mike Lamach : So nothing remarkable jumps out to me at all on the year. It's pretty straight stick. I think that right in the ballpark there too of 25% of leverage that will continue to improve throughout the year. The mix if anything, I mean perhaps a little bit on the Res side or the TK side because we continually expand more of the opening price point for the product line. With TK there could be some mix with Europe being a little bit weaker and a bit more profitable than North America, a bit more maybe toward truck versus trailer in Europe. So little things on the edges, but I think it's a pretty straightforward year. The visibility around the backlog for TK particularly North American trailer units and around, obviously, power units is the most visibility we ever had in that business. I think we feel that way about the backlog in HVAC entering the year as well too. So a relatively straightforward plan here I think. John Walsh : Got you. And then as we think about these restructuring benefits rolling through from the $94 million in 2018 you, obviously, call out the $0.25 and them having a four-year here payback. I mean, how should we think about what's actually carrying over from earlier actions into 2019 and then even starting to think about '20? And what kind of tailwind some of these restructuring actions could have or is it going to be later than that? Sue Carter : So John, the way I would think about it is the bigger pieces of the restructuring that we've been talking about in the footprint optimization arena between 2017, 2018 and what we're projecting into 2019 is sort in the range of you know 5 to 7 factories and those less than 5 year paybacks over time. So you're going to continue to build. We started that process in 2017 and so you're going to build savings as you go through each of the years going out into -- there will be savings obviously in 2019, but there will be increasing savings in 2020, 2021 from these projects. And again, it is really about optimizing the footprint, building capacity and building a better Ingersoll-Rand in the catching locations that's there, but it does provide a good return and it does have a great payback. Mike Lamach : I'd say John, once we make these announcements into 2019 and as we think about extending the next round of long-term planning guidance that we do, you know this is something that will factor into improved margins and costs, of course lower fixed costs in the company going forward. And I think we can probably help recast that sometime later in the year for all investors to understand the benefit of what's happened. So we'll make a note to do that once we have announced our intentions. Sue Carter : And I think Mike you made the point earlier in part of the discussions is that, we're not looking at these opportunities as a way to get ahead of an economic environment. We're actually looking at these opportunities to actually operate really well regardless of the economic environment. And so the fact that you can get a great return off of that, in addition to making the company stronger is terrific. John Walsh : Great. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Josh Pok, good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Yes, close enough, right. I am used to it. Just on the Industrial business. Not that anyone should necessarily operate with a hard landing scenario, but thinking back to 2015 and 2016, I think some of the shorter-cycle elements of that and Tools and other Industrial Products caught you by surprise and some of the decrementals there were a bit abrupt. How are you thinking about inventory levels, customer tone and kind of distance from prior trough in the context of 2019? It seems like everything's fine and I'm not being overly alarmist here. Just trying to gauge what maybe the sensitivity looks like? Mike Lamach : Well, first I mean back to John's question, when you think about sort of where all this restructuring spend has gone, the bulk of it at this point has gone into the Industrial business, particularly into the compressor business. And so I think building a higher-margin more resilient business is certainly what they've been doing. The other piece of that, is that service orders continue to outpace equipment growth, certainly again in Q4 too and that has both service penetration and its share of wallet strategies for our CTS business. We believe that from what we're seeing here there is certainly a balanced view toward what could happen. I mean clearly if there is some certainty around China-U.S. tariffs, we think certainty no matter what the outcome of that could be, is probably going to lock a little bit of growth there. So, I think it's a balanced view at this point in time, but I think we planned for a lower fixed-cost base, the restructuring through higher service mix. And that business has been prolific around investing back into the business. I want to say gives a full 50 basis points going back into Industrial and I think that that is always a sign of healthy business investing. In a downturn, you can take share and we want to make sure if that happens, we're taking share in a downturn too. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, that's helpful. And then just thinking about some of these larger projects in Climate, I would imagine as the cycle wears on, you see more and more large projects show up. How should we think about that in terms of operating leverage when those ship? I'd imagine some of that especially in performance contracting is some pass-through revenue not just all your equipment. Is there a margin hit that comes in with that or a lower incremental or does it kind of feel like normal equipment? Mike Lamach : Yes. It can be Josh not particularly in this case, right? I don't think this one's going to be something that spikes out materially anything with leverage or incrementals. So, the margins on those projects are not bad. As we've talked in the past, you've got to look at the contribution margin to the entire business. Usually those projects have everything from an SG&A perspective loaded into the contract as well very little between contribution margin and operating income there are left to look at. So, I feel positive on that. Again, they're hard to do hard to forecast. We don't put them into base plans. And when we think we've got something that's got a high probability of closing, we might start to talk about it. And certainly when there's the magnitude of what we booked, we'll have to spike those out, so we get everything straight from a comp perspective. So, I hope that answers your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Sure does. Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Can you guys hear me? Mike Lamach : Good morning, how are you? Andrew Obin : Hey, I'm good. Just a question a lot of questions have been answered, thanks for including me. But just can you give us visibility on the institutional side because I know you guys look at state and local funding as foundations? How much visibility do you have for funding on the institutional side in HVAC in North America because it is a key market for you guys? Mike Lamach : There's a lot of metrics to look at there, Andrew. I mean certainly you all can look at ADI, GDP growth, non-resi, fixed construction, all those look good. We've got the benefit of looking at-- Andrew Obin : I was more interested in -- yes, you guys track bond issuance and sort of longer term metrics from local government and state government. Those tend to be useful, sorry. Mike Lamach : Yes, we do as well and you guys certainly can look at that. The most important thing we can track though is we put a lot of investment into the systems we use in the front end of the Commercial process. So, the ability for us to understand pipelines better really supports strong institutional growth going forward. And I could just tell you that the number of -- and size of the projects from the institutional perspective are very healthy. And this goes back to the question around 2019 in Climate, what confidence do you have? Or maybe even to the larger Ingersoll-Rand question, what kind of confidence do you have in the guidance you put out? And I've got a high degree of confidence in what we put out today on all of that. But I would say the heart of that is because I feel very strongly about what's happening globally around HVAC, compliance, and certainly greenhouse gas emissions visibility, around institutional growth in North America, and around the visibility we have in the TK business. Those are all very strong indicators that I look back over 10 years of doing this and I probably haven't had at least the visibility I've got now into the backlog. Andrew Obin : That's a great answer. Thank you. And just to follow-up on the industrial compressors. How much of a headwind is automotive for you? And if it is a headwind which industries are offsetting this in North America because the orders are quite good as well? Thank you. Mike Lamach : Yes sure. Andrew when you go back and look at sort of the pie charts that the business produces one we did at Investor Day and it shows the end markets that we serve, you ran out of colors and slivers on the pie chart. So, Automotive is a piece, but it's probably not more than 2% or 3% of what we do, electronics is a piece, it's not 2% or 3% of what we do, and pharma and food and beverage, and so on and so forth. So, automotive per se is not critical but it is indicative of a broader slowdown at times. It's indicative of the spending in the economy. So, we watch automotive and when we see automotive slow down, it can be a leading indicator for us for sure. Andrew Obin : But what's strong in North America? Are there any end markets that turned out as strong to you guys on the Industrial side? Mike Lamach : Industrial markets that remain strong would be food and beverage, pharma would be -- anything oil-free would certainly be strong for us. And then some of the weak-to-moderate markets are still going to be larger compressors where customers might be waiting at capacity to understand what's happening with trade. Operator : I will now turn the conference back over to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As always Shane and I will be available over the coming days and weeks to take any questions you may have. So, certainly reach out to us if you'd like to chat. And we look forward to seeing you all at the upcoming conferences in February and we'll be on the road in March as well. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and then a Q&A session. All calls are on mute. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you\u2019ll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to slide three, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks, Zac. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Our business portfolio creates a platform for the Company to consistently grow above average global economic conditions aided by the strong secular tailwinds that I\u2019ve outlined. This morning we announced the transaction to separate our Industrial businesses by way of a spinoff to Ingersoll Rand\u2019s shareholders. And then combining it with Gardner Denver to create a leading global industrial company and to maintain our climate control assets to create a premier pure-play climate business. Our pure-play climate business squarely focuses 100% of our portfolio at the nexus of sustainability and impact where our products and services can have the most significant impact on the global challenges I outlined earlier. The press release and presentation outlining the transaction in detail is on the Ingersoll Rand website under the Investor Relations section. We also held a joint call with Gardner Denver management this morning at 8 :00 a.m. and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website. So I\u2019m not going to spend any time discussing the transaction further on this earnings call. We will, however, be taking Q&A related to both our Q1 earnings and this morning\u2019s announcement during our Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Moving to slide four. We\u2019re off to a strong start in 2019. Focused and consistent execution of our business strategy enabled us to deliver top tier revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth in the first quarter. We saw strong leverage from both top to bottom on the P&L with 8% organic revenue growth levering up to 27% EPS growth in the quarter. We delivered another quarter of robust revenue growth led by our climate segment despite tough growth comps from the prior year quarter. Climate\u2019s 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter was as high as any quarter in the past 2 years and was compounded on 8% growth in the prior year. Industrial\u2019s organic revenue growth was up 3% offsetting good growth against the tough 9% growth comp in the prior year. Headline bookings growth for the enterprise and for Climate of negative low single digits is driven by a significant year-over-year decline of bookings isolated to our Transport business, which I\u2019ll lay out in more detail in a minute. In order to more fully understand the health of the portfolio, we believe it is constructive to look at the underlying bookings growth trends in each of our key business units. For example, our commercial HVAC North America, commercial HVAC Europe, residential HVAC and Compression Technologies North America business reach up in the mid- to high-single-digit range in the quarter. China had flattish bookings in the quarter but still healthy when you consider the growth comp in the prior year quarter was in the mid-20s growth range. As we expected, Transport bookings were significantly lower in quarter one after the extraordinary bookings growth we saw in every quarter of 2018. As an example, in 2018, we booked 1.5 years of North America trailer backlog and 2 years of auxiliary power unit backlog resulting in record Transport backlog at the beginning of 2019. With the record backlog and continued underlying market demand, our revenue outlook for Transport looks healthy into 2020 with the key constraint being trailer manufacturers capacity. As you\u2019ve seen, the ACT data is consistent with this view showing very high levels of demand through the forecast horizon, which goes out to 2020. As I mentioned earlier, margin expansion was strong in the quarter with adjusted enterprise margins expanding 90 basis points. We\u2019re very successfully mitigating tariff and inflation impacts through price with the price versus material inflation spread of 70 basis points. Operating leverage was healthy at 26% and slightly ahead of our guidance for 2019 of 25%. Overall, our end markets are healthy and performing largely as expected. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to monitor geopolitical uncertainties related to Brexit in Europe and tariffs and trade in China. In quarter one, we also continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. After investing in the business, we deployed approximately $380 million between dividends and share repurchases. Lastly, while still early in the year and with the cooling season on deck, we haven\u2019t seen anything through the first quarter that diminishes our confidence in our full year guidance. We\u2019re bullish on the effectiveness of our strategy, bullish on our end markets and bullish on our ability to execute in 2019. As a result, we\u2019re raising our annual guidance to the top end of our prior adjusted EPS range of $6.15 to $6.35 to approximately $6.35. Please go to slide five. As we discussed in the previous slide, we delivered robust revenue growth led by our Climate segment with organic growth across all business units. We also delivered strong bookings growth in virtually all of our key businesses with commercial HVAC North America, commercial HVAC Europe, residential HVAC and Compression Technologies all up mid to high single digits. These results reflect continued strong execution of our strategy, capitalizing on healthy end markets. Please turn to slide six. We\u2019ve outlined a number of takeaways for each major business in the next two slides and you can read through those for some additional color. The most important thing I\u2019d like you to take away from these slides, however, is that our outlook by key business is largely unchanged from when we gave guidance in January and we haven\u2019t seen anything that will cause us to change our outlook for the year at this time. Turning to slide seven. Again, we\u2019ve added some comments to provide additional color on the slides and you can read through those. The key takeaway remains that we didn\u2019t see anything significant in quarter one that would change our outlook for the year at this juncture. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Sue Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number eight. I\u2019ll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today\u2019s call. As Mike discussed, we drove strong operating and financial results in the first quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $0.89, an increase of 27% versus the year-ago period. Our Q1 performance gives us increased confidence in our ability to execute against our full year growth and margin targets. As a result, though it\u2019s still early in the year, we are raising our full year adjusted continuing earnings per share guidance to approximately $6.35 at the high-end of our prior guidance range. First quarter organic revenue growth was solid in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Bookings in healthy end markets grew 105% book-to-bill and generated record backlog for the enterprise. Climate organic revenues were very strong, up 10%, building on a Q1 2018 organic revenue growth of 8%. Organic revenues were particularly strong in commercial HVAC North America and Europe. Transport organic revenues were also strong. Residential HVAC and China HVAC were up low single digits and flattish respectively, against tough prior year comparisons of low-teens growth and greater than 25% growth, respectively. As Mike discussed, HVAC organic bookings were strong with mid-single to high single-digit growth rates for commercial HVAC North America and Europe and for residential HVAC. In our Industrial segment, we delivered healthy 3% organic revenue growth compounding on a 9% organic growth rate in the prior year. Organic bookings growth was healthy in the first quarter with Compression Technologies North America bookings up mid-single digits. China growth was flattish with demand strengthening throughout the quarter providing cautious optimism going forward. When we\u2019re with investors, we often get questions around free cash flow timing for the year. Consistent with typical seasonality, we are building inventory in the first half of the year to support the expected growth during the cooling season and we expect cash flow improvement to ramp in the second half of the year. Our free cash flow targets remain unchanged. Leveraging our business operating system across the enterprise, we continue to manage direct material, tariff related and other inflationary headwinds in the quarter. During Q1, we expanded adjusted operating margins 90 basis points and delivered 26% operating leverage slightly ahead of our full year expectations. Importantly, we also delivered on our dynamic capital allocation strategy in Q1. We deployed $128 million in dividends and $250 million on share buybacks as our shares continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% excess cash over time. Additionally, our offer to acquire Precision Flow Systems was accepted by the seller during the quarter. Expectations for regulatory approval for the pending acquisition remains unchanged by midyear, 2019. Please go to slide number nine. We delivered organic revenue growth of 8%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 90 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 27%. We drove strong organic revenue growth across all businesses and in virtually all products and geographies. Continued disciplined focus on pricing and productivity actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff-related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise. Please go to slide number 10. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth enabling us to drive solid year-over-year earnings per share growth in the quarter. Our Industrial segment delivered solid results that were negatively impacted by a supplier disruption in our small electric vehicles business. Excluding the disruption, Industrial adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points. Of note, our full year Industrial margin outlook remains intact. Although the operating income line other expenses included expected pension cost increases plus a legal settlement related to a legacy business, which negatively impacted results by approximately $0.05. All in, we delivered strong 27% earnings per share growth in the quarter. Please go to slide number 11. Strong execution drove 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Price versus material inflation was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter. Pricing expanded margins by 70 basis points, reflecting strong carryover price from 2018 and incremental pricing actions in 2019. Consistent with our full-year expectations, we delivered productivity to exceed other inflation. We continued to reinvest heavily in our business. Incremental Q1 investments of approximately 50 basis points were fairly evenly weighted between growth and operating expense reduction projects. Please go to slide number 12. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 10% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 130 basis points. Consistent with our expectations, results were strong across the segment. Please go to slide 13. Our Industrial business delivered solid organic revenue growth of 3% against a tough comparison of 9% growth in Q1 of 2018. As I mentioned previously, our Industrial segment margins were negatively impacted by a supplier disruption in our small electric vehicles business. Excluding the disruption, Industrial adjusted operating margins were solid, up 50 basis points. We expect the supplier disruption to be resolved during Q2 with full year Industrial margin expectations unchanged. Please go to slide 14. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We have a longstanding commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns like the pending PFS acquisition announced during the quarter. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and BBB rating that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We continue to see value in share repurchases when shares trade below their intrinsic value and in Q1, we deployed approximately $250 million. Please go to slide 16. With the extraordinary bookings in our Transport business in 2018, we thought it might be useful if we gave a bit of background on what drove the outsized orders and how to assess the impact to the overall enterprise. During 2018, high trucking capacity and the use of electronic driver logs drove strong demand for class 8 trailers throughout the year. Additionally, the tax law changes under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act further incentivized trucking companies to invest in their fleets. With such strong demand, OEMs experienced capacity constraints driving trucking companies to place orders months in advance. As the trucking companies placed preorders for trailers, they also placed preorders with us for trailer refrigerated units and auxiliary power units. As Mike mentioned earlier, we booked 1.5 years of trailer unit orders and 2 years of auxiliary power unit orders resulting in record Transport backlog at the end of the year. With a record backlog and an underlying healthy market, our revenue outlook for Transport is healthy into 2020. Please go to slide 17. Since Q2 of last year, we\u2019ve effectively managed both material inflation and tariffs delivering price cost margin expansions in each quarter. With that track record, we frequently get questions around our price cost outlook for 2019 and I\u2019d like to give you some background to understand how we expect the price cost to play out. First of all, we\u2019re off to a good start in Q1 with strong carryover price from 2018 and incremental 2019 pricing actions, price cost delivered 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. As we move into Q2, our year-over-year pricing comps get tougher and by the time we get to the back half of 2019, we\u2019ll be lapping our full pricing actions from the prior year. Any incremental price at that point will be mainly from 2019 pricing actions. For the inflation part of the equation, we expect continued commodity inflation in Q2. We expect moderating inflation in both Tier 1 materials and Tier 2 components in the second half of the year. During 2018, tariffs ramped throughout the year with the implementation of Section 232 tariffs followed by List 1, 2 and 3 Section 301 tariffs. As such, we won\u2019t fully lap current Section 301 tariffs until Q4 of this year. All in, we have successfully managed inflation and tariffs and we expect to continue to do so through purposeful active use of our business operating system. Next, we continue to expect 20 to 30 basis points of positive price versus cost in 2019. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Sue. Please go to slide 18. In summary, we\u2019re pleased with how 2019 is shaping up. We expect to deliver strong revenue, EPS and free cash flow in 2019. Looking forward, we believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world continues to urbanize. We\u2019re becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers all enabled by technology. We have been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and high-performing culture that breathes operational excellence into everything we do. And lastly, we\u2019re committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver strong shareholder returns over the years. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : So, Mike, I was on the first half of the first call this morning and not the back half. I looked through some of the notes. But I was wondering if you could just spend a minute or 2 to kind of talk about the range of kind of strategic comparatives for kind of new Climate company and obviously, not mentioning things by name but where do you see the portfolio headed? What are some of the interesting opportunities maybe beyond the kind of excellent organic execution that you had? Mike Lamach : Yes. Jeff, first, to you and all the folks on the call today, thanks. We\u2019re occupying a lot your time today. So, thanks for the coverage and for following us. The answer to your question really the strategic comparatives don\u2019t change for Climate. The strategic focus around being able to really pinpoint the strategy, the investments and really create the most agile structure that we can come up with from a customer perspective is critical. And then, we\u2019ll continue to invest like we have in innovation and into the channel. So nothing changes. It\u2019s just a sharper focus on running faster and being successful. Jeffrey Sprague : And just a quick nuance on the separation costs. It appeared when GDI was mentioning the $450 million costs to achieve, they mentioned a $100 million separation costs for IR? A little confused by that. Are they somehow eating or absorbing the stranded costs associated with your side of the equation? Could you clarify that? Sue Carter : Yes, Jeff. No. That\u2019s not what they were intending. So the $450 million is the cost to achieve the synergies and then they have an additional $100 million that is their advisers and their cost to actually separate the Ingersoll Rand and include the Ingersoll Rand businesses and all their stuff. So in other words, they\u2019ll have tax and all of those things as well and then it came out that way simply because they\u2019re taking the name. But that is their cost, onetime cost of the transaction and the $450 million is the cost of achieving the synergies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Mike, I know you want to keep this kind of more in the quarter and the outlook. But, again, I wasn\u2019t on the Q&A portion of the call this morning as well but a bit curious maybe I just want to see if -- when we look at the free cash conversion for the past 2 years, was there a significant difference between Climate and Industrial? And I guess, my question is, how does the standalone Trane free cash flow looks on a go forward basis? Sue Carter : So, the answer, Nigel, is there is not a significant difference between the Climate businesses and the Industrial businesses. So, what we challenged the businesses with and actually they deliver is achieving 100% of operating income as their operating cash flow. And then, as I look through that and convert operating cash flow into free cash flow, again, they\u2019re both in sort of that 1% to 2% range on CapEx. From a tax rate perspective, I would call tax for Climate to be slightly on the lower end of our range and Industrial slightly higher. But what you end up with as I parse through all of that is that both of those businesses deliver about 100% of net income on free cash flow. Mike Lamach : Nigel, I would say that once we get closer to the actual effect of the spend and ClimateCo giving some guidance, clearly, that quarterly working capital will change a bit because of the seasonality of the business but other than that, Sue\u2019s exactly right on point with 100% or better conversion, which is the goal. Nigel Coe : And then just switching to resi, you\u2019ve maintained a low- to mid-single-digit growth. It sounds like 2Q is still not okay. But if we maintain this kind of weather pattern through the summer, would we expect to be more in the low mid-single-digit zone? And then on top of that, have you seen any market share shifts so far this year? Mike Lamach : We\u2019ve seen a good market so far this year and even with the weather being less supportive, it was still a good quarter for us. So good revenue growth in the quarter, good bookings, good margin expansion. New regulations I\u2019m sure helping with that and also surprising opportunities on new furnished regs. In terms of share, really if you look at any rolling 12 month period, pretty much any quarter over the last 4 years, we\u2019ve gained share and we would have gained share again over the last rolling 12 quarters. So I think it will be for the fifth year in a row that we\u2019ll see pretty significant share gain again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : Just to -- I wasn\u2019t -- also was not on the call this morning. I\u2019m just curious as to the timing of this, I mean, I know that this is something that probably was evaluated several years ago when you split off Allegion. I don\u2019t know if somebody already asked it earlier in the morning but what was kind of the mindset around why now? Mike Lamach : Yes. I think that when you look at the company today, the dyssynergies that we see are about $150 million in terms of how we integrated the company from manufacturing and sourcing to engineering to shared services. And so spinning off a company without something of scale to merge with and develop synergies is a pure headwind. So when you find a situation like this, you got a $250 million synergy opportunity not including the growth side of this but $250 million on the cost side of this thing, it\u2019s really fully offsetting any headwind we have on the dyssynergies also avoiding that public company duplicate startup cost around that and then allowing us to really streamline the way we go to market in the Climate space, Steve. So it takes some timing, some valuations that work, the math has to work and it takes a willing and a good partner. It takes confidence on both sides that the management team going forward can execute on the strategies so that is our confidence in Vicente and the go forward Industrial company team as well as our confidence in the management team at ClimateCo being able to execute that. So all things point to the right valuations, right timing and the right partner to be able to effect a net positive versus a dissynergy number in the math. Steve Tusa : What\u2019s the -- what\u2019s your updated thoughts on the, I guess, the daily question around HVAC industry consolidation? I know that your view in the past has been you can\u2019t kind of narrowly define it as just U.S. markets. Do you see kind of an open playing field here on that front? Or after further review, there aren\u2019t a lot of opportunities? Mike Lamach : Well, nothing\u2019s changed in our view that we\u2019ve been talking about for 2 or 3 years around this in terms of the market and consolidation and what could happen between willing partners that want to do that. But I will tell you that strategically, it\u2019s the same place we were and we don\u2019t need to do something, we could if it made sense for shareholders. I think, we\u2019ve got great optionality either way it goes. But it does create a much sharper focus and ability for us to think about being just faster in everything that we do from a customer, and from an innovation perspective. And -- I mean to me, it\u2019s really exciting to think about what\u2019s possible going forward as a -- is a sharper focus to a Climate company. Steve Tusa : Okay. So one last one. Can you just -- I know you don\u2019t want to give quarterly orders guidance but just should we just think about like the comps for the rest of the year? And a model that out, I mean, it can be lumpy. Is there any unusual lumpiness that you want to get out in front of for the second quarter just to kind of set expectations? I know the negative 3% was a little bit weaker than I was expecting. But just curious as to how you see the pipeline kind of playing out over the course of the year, if there\u2019s anything we should think about for second quarter on the Climate order front? Mike Lamach : That\u2019s why we try to give a bit more color this quarter around the other pieces of this because when you think about the North American business both res and commercial, it was really an excellent quarter again mid- to high-single-digit growth rates. North America unitary particularly strong. We saw strength in office. We saw a strength in Industrial and a subset of that is really data centers driving that component. We see the manufacturing warehouses, labs as well. Applied, no surprise there that continues to be running incredibly well with great backlog and great order rates. Even China sequentially, and this would apply both to the Industrial businesses and the HVAC businesses showed sequential progress in the quarter where we came out of March with strong bookings and some healthy optimism around that. Europe was a little bit weaker but there\u2019s a lot going on and weaker -- I mean, Europe, and I think that from an HVAC perspective in Europe, we\u2019ll continue to capitalize on the mega trends that are driving growth outside sort of the general economy. But it has impacted things around Transport and some of the Industrial economy in Europe as well. The Industrial markets seem to be doing okay, as well. There again is some moderation in China, which we felt was positive. U.S. Industrial productivity remained strong. Capacity utilization\u2019s at record levels in the U.S. CapEx projections in the U.S. are low single digits so it supports our forecast there. In the EU, the PMI didn\u2019t decelerate further so that\u2019s I guess a bit of a win that had sort of plateaued, flattened. In China, PMI, it\u2019s still down again but it was up sequentially so things are looking better I think in China. Sue Carter : And Steve, if I can add a broad comment on top of the excellent color that Mike gave. If you think about Transport orders throughout 2018, they got tough comps going in all of those quarters. I would also say that if you think about the enterprise and where our growth came from in 2018, the second quarter, I don\u2019t care which business you have is a tough comp when you look at it. So again, that\u2019s not to indicate that we\u2019re not going to have great bookings growth but those tough Transport comps are going to be there and the second quarter was a particularly high enterprise type of growth in 2018. So tough comps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe a first question on the incremental margins firmwide. I think you said they were around 26% in Q1. The year is 25%. Included in the guide though is the sort of moderation from price cost tailwind to margin. So maybe just explain what countervailing factors kind of step up through the balance of the year to offset that diminishing tailwind from a price cost? Sue Carter : So Julian, as you think about it, what is going to happen in actuality is you\u2019re going to start lapping the price in the second quarter. So in other words, the great pricing that we saw carryover from 2018 into 2019, we should go throughout the year. And you\u2019ve got tougher compares on the overall pricing dynamic, which is why we talked about that price cost really sort of moderates as you go throughout the year and gets you back more into that 20 to 30 basis points spread type of environment. And again, you\u2019ve got a first quarter we\u2019ll see what happens as we go into the cooling season but it really is the pricing comparisons and the material inflation sort of staying where it\u2019s at. Julian Mitchell : Sure. But does the -- maybe the tailwind from volume mix or the tailwind from productivity, does that step up later in the year? And that kind of mitigates the shrinking tailwind from price cost? Sue Carter : Yes. It\u2019s always the productivity. We\u2019re going to get more ideas as we go throughout the year and it does ramp up. So it balances throughout the portfolio between price and material inflation and productivity and other inflation. Mike Lamach : Yes, Julian, too. I guess, last thing I\u2019d say is if there is place probably in the guidance where there could be opportunity, it\u2019s certainly in price cost, which we continue to surprise ourselves with what we\u2019re able to affect there and still continue to gain share in the process. So we\u2019re careful about that but that\u2019s going very well. Julian Mitchell : And then just the second topic. So you emphasized Transport order comps very tough throughout the whole year. That\u2019s very clear. And just on the revenue side of Transport, just wondered how you were thinking about that this year, maybe just parse out kind of expectations around the Americas and then I think EMEA, you\u2019d thought about a flattish market previously for this year. Sue Carter : Yes. So I guess I would start the conversation by saying that with the amount of backlog that we build in North America trailer and in APUs throughout 2018 and again in the first quarter of 2019, we\u2019ve got really solid footing on revenues going into 2020. So the only point on the tough comps was that there wasn\u2019t just one quarter of Transport bookings. So I would expect just as you said that we\u2019ll see strong North America revenues coming off of the backlog that we have in North America and APUs. Europe is going to be slightly impacted by Brexit and perhaps not as strong with the backlog and the overall orders. So now you say Transport\u2019s going to have a very good year in 2019 and 2020. Mike Lamach : Yes. Julian, I think one way to think about it is, it\u2019s a little bit like the Applied business. Right now, you\u2019re booking this -- in this backlog. You\u2019ve got great visibility into it, when you take out the noise of the compares on the bookings because of Transport, you end up with this mid-single-digit revenue stream, which looks pretty solid through 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So I want to piggyback on that price cost question, Sue. I just want to make sure I understand what\u2019s embedded in the guide for this year. And so at 1 point, I think even last quarter, you guys were expecting a step up of 25% on the tariffs side. So I wanted to make sure that that was still part of the guidance. And then secondly, what are you anticipating from a pricing standpoint given moderating commodity inflation this year? Sue Carter : Yes. So, as you think about how we thought about price costs going throughout the 2019 period is we obviously, had some tailwind coming off of the 2018 pricing. And we obviously, have left the tariffs that we put in the original guidance in. So they might have moved out a month and that might have created a little bit of less material inflation, if you will, in that guidance but it\u2019s not significant. So again, what we talked about when we gave the guidance and what we\u2019ve continued to talk about is that if the tariffs don\u2019t materialize, our pricing will adjust. If the tariffs materialize, or they\u2019re greater or there\u2019s more inflation we\u2019ll adjust as needed, but the pricing that\u2019s in there is our normal pricing for what we see. And again, if the tariffs don\u2019t materialize, we\u2019ll not do price increases to cover something that didn\u2019t actually happen, if that makes sense. Joe Ritchie : Yes. No, that makes sense. So I appreciate the clarification. And if I could piggyback on some of the order discussion that we\u2019ve had so far, Mike, you mentioned in your prepared commentary that China commercial strengthened through the quarter. I was wondering if you can maybe just provide a little bit more commentary around what commercial HVAC did regionally throughout the quarter as we exited. Mike Lamach : Yes. I mean, starting with China, its demand strengthened throughout the quarter and it\u2019s a maybe testament to what\u2019s been happening with the direct sales strategy to drive those above market rates. In China, generally, we saw acceleration in even auto and pharma. So that was a positive. And it was less concern both in HVAC and in the compressor business around exporter activity. So it\u2019s certainly a more positive constructive environment there. The rest of Asia with the exception of Taiwan is pretty good for HVAC. So India, Indonesia, Vietnam, all -- Thailand, all positive. Just Korea is a bit weak for us there. Europe continued to outperform the market. It\u2019s not really so much connected to GDP as it is connected to the regulations and around some of the transformation there. We\u2019re doing very well in Latin America but it\u2019s difficult because if you think about the currency translation there, you get hurt in a lot of places but it\u2019s a healthy business in Latin America from an organic perspective. And the U.S, continues to be strong and I think will stay strong for the balance of the year in all aspects of the HVAC business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Congratulations on the deal. Great quarter. Just a question on orders not to beat the sort of horse to death. But given how tough the comps get particularly in the second half, should we expect a couple of more negative comps on orders this year? Overall orders turning negative for the company bookings? Mike Lamach : Again, first, it\u2019s hard, Andrew. We don\u2019t really forecast sort of that way around orders, it\u2019s really around the pipeline. So Sue, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve done the math on that. Sue Carter : Yes. I think, Andrew, when you think about it. If you just did modeling with those comparisons, you\u2019ve also got a large HVAC order that was in Q4. So if I pull that out as well as the Transport pieces, again, you\u2019re going to get enterprise bookings that are going to average out. So I don\u2019t really see an issue with that in the back half of the year. So what I pointed out to you is that Transport had heavy orders throughout the year in 2018 and tough comps but the overall business had a really excellent booking quarter in the second quarter but also the fourth quarter had the large commercial HVAC order. So if you take that noise out of there, I think we have very good bookings. And if you think about Q1, I mean, you had Q1 bookings that exceeded our revenue, the 105% ratio, that bookings ratio, book-to-bill ratio that I talked about so I wouldn\u2019t get concerned about that. I think it\u2019s just more color for your expectation. Mike Lamach : Yes. Andrew, I think, to that point, add color, we\u2019ll just need to provide more color, so I don\u2019t think the story is going to be in the headline bookings, it\u2019s going to be understanding the health of the components and HVAC in a totally different trajectory and globally, on a different by region trajectory than it would be for Transport North America. We\u2019ve just gone through heck of a boom here in the \u201818 and early \u201819 timeframe. So we\u2019ll give more color to help you understand that. Andrew Obin : And as I said, I also missed the Q&A portion of the earlier call but can you talk about [technical difficulty] given the more concentrated portfolio from HVAC, what\u2019s happening with the HVAC JV, and is there anything in your [technical difficulty] market in North America? Mike Lamach : Well, it\u2019s been a great success, the JV itself. So, it\u2019s been something that I\u2019m glad we did. In fact, I\u2019m heading to Japan next week and look forward to sitting down with the CEO and going through the performance at this point but we couldn\u2019t be any happier with what has transpired at this point in time. But really in our view number one in the market particularly where we participate together, we\u2019re number one. And the dynamics are the same where you\u2019re seeing good ductless growth in the U.S, slightly above the ducted revenues and you\u2019re seeing ducted revenues outside the U.S. and typically ducted markets growing faster than ductless revenue. So it goes to the theory that at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to be companies and channels that can sell a full suite of products and services that are going to win. So I\u2019m very happy with that joint venture and I would say it\u2019s exceeding expectations. Andrew Obin : But effectively within this product category, you\u2019re going to do everything within the context of this venture within that technology, right? You\u2019re not going to do something by yourself? Mike Lamach : Well, we do a lot of -- by our self today. I guess that probably helps to put some color on that. For really sort of the premium end of the market, Trane Mitsubishi is what we\u2019re going with. For the entry-level point in the market, we\u2019ve got everything from making it ourselves, doing both variable refrigerant and variable waterflow systems along with ducted offerings in Europe, that we produce ourselves all the way through to some source product we use in various applications around the world. But when we think about the premium offering, that\u2019s going to be a Trane Mitsubishi offering for us. If there\u2019s a lot of segmentation here, which I appreciate the question because that is an important factor is understanding the segmentation of the market and make sure we\u2019ve got a product and a solution for every part of the world and every price point that we need to plan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Congratulations on the transaction announcement this morning. I guess, just thinking about the Industrial margin impact from the supplier disruption, should we put another $4 million in our model for Q2, or would you expect it to be less than that? Mike Lamach : No. We killed that in quarter one. So no, we\u2019re good to go. I wouldn\u2019t put anything in the model that\u2019s not -- that\u2019s -- if that one\u2019s complete. Run the ground. John Walsh : Got you. And then, just thinking about the good growth we\u2019ve seen in Climate last year, this year, over the last several years, I mean, how is the supply chain on the Climate side of the house? I mean, do you think -- are there pockets where things are stretched, or do you feel very comfortable that there\u2019s -- you have all that taken care of? Mike Lamach : Well, I mean, this has been a factor, I think, competitively and I think we\u2019ve been able to win by being able to have the capacity or at least change the playbook and have the playbook with different tack times to be able to hit different customer demand patterns. And so this was played out well and I\u2019m really proud of what our whole team has been able to accomplish there. And it\u2019s been tremendous growth and we\u2019ve wrecked the wall through that. With that being said, sure, I mean, you\u2019ve got suppliers that are stressed and some situations where we\u2019re needing to pay extra -- needing to pay extra close attention and in some situations where we\u2019re needing where we can to be able to carry more inventory. John Walsh : And to maybe just one last quick one. I didn\u2019t hear any commentary around controls and what that did in the quarter and the trend you\u2019re kind of expecting there? Mike Lamach : Yes. Services and controls are actually -- continue in both the CTS business and in the HVAC business globally exceed equipment growth rates. And the strategies there are working. And our controls growth rate continues to be kind of that the double-digit growth rate. And it\u2019s not unusual, I mean, everything you\u2019re seeing in terms of products and systems today going as a system controls in our view is really part and parcel to a system that we sell. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Tim Wojs : I want to extend my congrats on the deal as well. Just had a couple of cleanup questions here around Climate. So I guess, relative to overall segment margin expectations for \u201819, would you expect any of the sub businesses to have any sort of outsize margin performance in 2019, or do you think all 3 subsegments expand margins kind of similar to the overall segment? And then secondly, what was price realization in Climate in the first quarter relative to the 10% organic growth? Mike Lamach : Yes. I think Tim, you\u2019re saying for res, commercial, and TK, do we expect margins to increase? And we do across all 3 of the sub portfolios in Climate. To your second question, I think we\u2019re looking for an answer on that. Sue Carter : On price realization? Zac Nagle : Yes, I think price realization was good. We wouldn\u2019t provide a specific breakout of what -- exactly what our price number is. Tim Wojs : Okay. I guess, my first question was more of I think all 3 businesses will expand but is there any sort of outsize margin performance in any one of the businesses? Or should they all kind of expand at a similar level? Mike Lamach : Well, it\u2019s potentially, yes. If you ask the presidents running the businesses, they will tell you it\u2019s really outsized but from our point of view, they\u2019re all doing what they need to be doing and they\u2019re doing a great job. So no, there\u2019s nobody -- there\u2019s 3 gold medals, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to hand out at the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Steve Volkmann : Most of my questions have been answered but Mike, I\u2019m wondering just a very big picture question around cyclicality of the global HVAC business. Obviously, some investors are thinking we might be toward the peak of the cycle, things continue to seem pretty good. You\u2019ve mentioned a number of kind of secular changes whether it\u2019s Energy or regulations or anything like that. But just how would you encourage us to think about cyclicality of the remainder co as we go forward now with the next iteration of your life? Mike Lamach : Yes. Well, I\u2019d say cycles are not telling the story anymore, I mean, you\u2019ve got to look at the regulations and what\u2019s happening in various parts of the world. You\u2019ve got to think about 1 billion more people coming into the middle class and needing air conditioning and the demands on power in the grid and sustainability of all that. You\u2019ve got to think that 15-plus percent of greenhouse gas emissions are happening through HVAC systems. And if you fast-forward and we do nothing about it, 25% would be through air conditioning in homes and buildings by 2030 on that larger population urbanizing. So the way to solve that I mean, is to do what we\u2019re doing. I mean we alone with the technology we have today that can cut out 2% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions just by doing what we\u2019re doing today by 2030. And you can imagine if 50 other companies join that, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem or at least the problem would be totally recast. So I think this is totally different. And then if I take it down to sort of ground-level today, I mean, this is why the services businesses are so critically important and wants to help counter these mini-cycles around what happens with office building or institutional in one part of the world or some geopolitical disruption in the part of the world. We\u2019re left to deal with those but long term, whatever those sort of mini-cycles are, the trend is up into the right about what needs to happen in the world between now and say, 2050 for that matter. Steve Volkmann : Okay. That\u2019s good color. And then just 1 real specific one maybe for Sue. Is there anything that happens with respect to this transaction? Is there any impact on free cash flow? Or your ability to repurchase shares as we go forward? Sue Carter : So, the answer is no, there is no impact on free cash flow and no, there is no restrictions on our ability to buy back shares if the price is below our intrinsic value going forward. No. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just to follow up a little bit on some of the resi questions from earlier, understanding that there is a competitor out there who\u2019s kind of fighting to reclaim some share. How does that color your view on what pricing does over the balance of the year? And Mike, how do you feel about inventories in the channel right now? I know some of that is company-owned and you manage that but maybe from the independent side, what\u2019s your sense on loading levels versus normal? Mike Lamach : Yes. I mean, it is normal for us. If anything you might have seen, well, it depends on what competitor is launching the furnace platform when and when their pricing increases go into effect and you can get some disruptions from quarter-to-quarter. But the right way to look at that is not quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s over a long period of time, a rolling 4 quarters makes a lot more sense on that. With all that being said, I continue to like our strategy. We\u2019ve continued to penetrate the market with brands at various price points, with staying in front of regulations, with fully utilized, very efficient plant and supply chain structures. So, we\u2019re going to keep on doing what we\u2019re doing and competitors are going to do what they do. But frankly, through the first quarter, everything looked great. I mean, sort of price realization, cost position, bookings, revenue, there was nothing but positive news there from our point of view. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just shifting over to commercial. Obviously, some great order intake especially in 2018. I think some large projects you called out, particularly in the fourth quarter, if I remember right, should we think about those converting a little lower-margin -- at a little lower-margin this year just given there\u2019s probably some third party source content, et cetera. And if so, what does that look like? When does that happen? Any color around what that margin mix when those hit, would be helpful. Mike Lamach : Yes, the easiest way to think about that is those larger projects really have the kitchen sink costed into them. So on a contribution basis, we\u2019re making sure it\u2019s accretive with the margins that we\u2019re trying to post from an op income standpoint. So the gross margins may be lower but you\u2019re really -- talking about all-in costs stand to execute. So I don\u2019t think you see any dip on operating margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : So I guess, maybe starting off with Climate. I know you guys aren\u2019t updating your organic growth outlook for the full year but obviously, organic growth came in really strong in the first quarter and so 5% to 6% is looking a little bit conservative for the full year, particularly since the comps don\u2019t really get a whole lot harder. So if you could just comment on the potential for Climate just to price to the upside throughout the rest of the year. Mike Lamach : Well, there\u2019s a lot of the year left. When you\u2019re talking about something less than 15% in the quarter, I think there\u2019s a natural hesitation to go out on a limb. I think it\u2019s given us the confidence to raise the top end of our guidance but I think we\u2019d really need to see something more than the second quarter. You\u2019re really looking to see July and August to dramatically change that, Nicole. But I think the first leg of this is a lot of confidence in the first quarter to go to high-end of the range. That\u2019s not something we typically do. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Totally understood and definitely fair. And then I guess, the second one, just a tie-up question on the deal. So the synergy guidance that you guys have provided for the Industrial business, does that include PFS synergies? Or would those be separate? Mike Lamach : It\u2019s all in. It\u2019s assuming that PFS with our Industrial portfolio is merged into Gardner Denver and the total of all of the combinations is $250 million. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Add my congratulations. I just wanted to follow up on the question on PFS. And maybe this got covered in the Q&A earlier in the first call this morning. But is it fair to consider that PFS was the missing piece of the puzzle in order to qualify for the RMT? Mike Lamach : No. It wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the RMT structure. I mean, the way that 2 important issues that would be looked at, it had to be looked at independent. So when you think about PFS being something that for a long time, we thought was a great fit with our Fluid business. We had to be prepared in that process, in that process\u2019 timing and to be successful. And then concurrently and somewhat in parallel as we are having discussions with GDI around the RMT structure, you\u2019re thinking about, well, look, if I\u2019m successful one way or the other depending on timing, does it make sense in combination, if you will, the 3 businesses, GDI\u2019s business, PFS\u2019s business and our Industrial segment and the answer is, yes. So we felt like, look, we need to get after that asset because there\u2019s no guarantee that we come into an agreement with GDI and if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re going to still build a bigger Fluid Management organization and go forward. And if we did, then it\u2019s going to be even more productive in terms of putting that combination together, particularly with their Medical segment, which is a lot in common. So we figured we couldn\u2019t really loose in that so we had to work within the processes we\u2019re working in. Deane Dray : That\u2019s real helpful. And then, is there -- are there any contingent liabilities or any encumbrances on Climate Remain-co and doing the RMT? I would imagine that if something were happen to the tax pretreatment, that would come back to the ClimateCo. Is there any -- are you restricted on any asset sales? Or just take us through some of those nuances? Mike Lamach : Yes, it\u2019s a -- the answer to your question is no, there\u2019s no restrictions to us but it is complex and nuanced and to have a full sort of discussion on this would depend on the situation itself. And it\u2019s probably best left toward the end of the transaction or maybe in some disclosures. But to answer your question broadly, no, there is no encumbrances or restrictions about how we run the company going forward. Deane Dray : Great. Just last one just sort of a structural question for Sue. Is it fair to say there will be 3 segments reported in the Climate company? Sue Carter : TBD, we\u2019ll do some work on how we want to structure all of that going forward, Deane. So don\u2019t have a definitive answer on that but we\u2019ll come back to you as soon as we do have one of those. I\u2019d also like to add on your previous question, the tax-free nature of the spin is really a condition of the actual transaction closing, not anything that would impact the Climate business. And if the tax-free nature didn\u2019t happen, it would impact the transaction not ClimateCo. Just so you\u2019re clear. Mike Lamach : And Deane, maybe to piggyback on the segment question, I mean the way that we think about this is an opportunity to create an organization that is how we want to manage the organization, I mean how we want to lead the organization in an as efficient and agile a way as we possibly can. From that, some segmentation will pop-out of that but you\u2019ve really got to go through the hard work of looking at all the designs going forward. Frankly, that\u2019s the exciting part of what we\u2019re doing. We really can take a clean sheet of paper and think pretty boldly about that and then however the segmentations spills out of that would be the way we run the business. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining today. And, as always, Shane and I will be available in the coming days to take any questions that you may have. So, have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and then a Q&A session. All callers are on mute. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to Slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call. I'm proud of our team's performance in the second quarter. Once again, we delivered strong revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. We welcomed our new Precision Flow Systems team into Ingersoll-Rand and we\u2019re well underway towards a separation into two standalone businesses and our proposed strategic combination with our Industrial segment and Gardner Denver. With that backdrop, let's get started. Please go to Slide 3. I'd like to start with a brief overview of the global business strategy that we're executing to deliver consistently strong financial results for our shareholders. Fundamentally, our strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact, which are strong secular tailwinds for our business. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity of buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of foods and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Unless you think the world is getting cooler, less populated, less resource constrained as time passes, these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision. As we continue separation, integration planning and business transformation activities related to our strategy and combination of our industrial segment with Gardner Denver and move towards creating the premier pure play climate business in 2020, our aggressive pursuit of excellence in delivering solutions to mitigate the impact of these secular trends only intensifies. Our climate business squarely focuses 100% of our portfolio at the nexus of sustainability and global environmental impact where our products and services can reduce the impact of these mega trends and create a platform for the company to grow above average global economic conditions. Moving to Slide 4, I'll spend a few minutes discussing how 2019 has progressed through the first half of the fiscal year and what we're expecting to see through the balance of 2019. The key takeaway is that we remain bullish on our strategy, our end markets broadly and our ability to execute using our business operating system to deliver against our organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges for fiscal 2019. In fact, today we're raising EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $6.40. We expect to deliver top-tier financial performance again in 2019. Commercial HVAC globally and particularly in North America and Europe has continued to be very strong for us and our backlog, incoming order rates and sales pipeline give us confidence this business will continue to deliver strong results in the second half of 2019. Our residential HVAC business had strong mid single-digit growth in the second quarter and we expect this business to continue to deliver strong performance for the full year supported by a solid residential replacement market. In our Industrial segment, we saw healthy order growth and long cycle projects in our Compression Technologies business in the second quarter and we have a favorable outlook for continued long cycle growth in the second half of the year. Conversely, the short cycle market softened in the second quarter primarily impacting revenue growth in our core Compression Technologies and Tools businesses, which are both down low single-digits. We expect short cycle markets to continue to be challenging throughout 2019. The positive impact of healthy long cycle markets presents a positive setup as we move into 2020 when these orders convert into revenue and operating income given the long lead times associated with these projects. Price realization has been outstanding across our businesses and we're effectively managing all inflation and tariff-related costs with an 80 basis points spread in the second quarter. As we've highlighted before, we have been effective in managing inflation and we expect to continue to maintain a positive spread and our target range of 20 basis points to 30 basis points in the second half of the year when we begin to lap the strong price realization in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and when we began to see the full impact of the increase in List 3 tariffs on Chinese imports moving from 10% to 25%. Lastly, we continue to expect strong free cash flows in 2019 of equal to or greater than 100% of net income, which will further strengthen our balance sheet and enable us to maintain good optionality. We've deployed significant capital on dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases over the years and again in the first half of the year. We'll continue to follow our dynamic and balanced capital allocation priorities and we expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Please go to Slide 5. We've delivered solid bookings and revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions in the second quarter. On the booking side, our largest HVAC businesses continue to lead the way and delivers strong growth with North America and Europe HVAC up high single digits in the second quarter. China was also healthy with low single-digit growth against the very tough comp of low 20s growth in the second quarter of 2018. We also drove strong bookings growth of 8% in our Industrial Segment versus a tough comp of 8% in the prior year led by Compression Technologies and Small Electric Vehicles. Compression Technologies growth was driven by strong growth in long cycle partially offset by softness in the short cycle markets. Small Electric Vehicles growth was driven by successful execution of our consumer vehicle strategy. Transport refrigeration had a significant decline in bookings against very tough comps in 2018 for reasons we've discussed in detail on prior calls. However, as we've said before, these declines don't impact or negate a strong growth in our other transport businesses or impact their ability to grow revenues in 2019 and 2020. The transport refrigeration business had extremely strong bookings in 2018 and is returning to historically normal levels of bookings in 2019, but with backlog that is more than two times the historical levels with a strong backlog and solid bookings we're seeing in 2019. We expect this business to deliver solid revenue growth in 2019 and the prospects heading into 2020 continue to look promising. On the revenue side, our largest HVAC businesses continued to deliver very strong growth with North America, Europe and residential all up mid to high single digits in quarter two. Transport refrigeration also delivered strong revenue growth. Bringing all the pieces together, we're pleased with our organic bookings and revenue growth performance through the first half. We expect organic revenue growth rates to increase heading into the second half based on healthy backlog, deliveries and incoming order rates and remain confident at our 5% to 6% organic enterprise revenue growth target for the full year. Please turn to Slide 6. We've outlined a number of takeaways for each major business on the next two slides. Commercial HVAC continues to be very strong, particularly in North America and Europe. Our backlog, incoming order rates and pipeline of projects are driving confidence that we'll continue to see solid growth in the second half of the year. Residential HVAC had solid mid single-digit growth in quarter two and we head at end of the second half of the year expecting 2019 will shape up to be another good year led by a healthy replacement market. I've talked at length about transport refrigeration, which continues to be led by North America trailer, truck, APUs and aftermarket. Based on our record backlog and healthy incoming order rates, we remain confident that our transport business will deliver another solid year in 2019. Please turn to Slide 7. In our Compression Technologies business, we're seeing a healthy growth in long cycle markets and softness in short cycle markets. The long cycle business strength positions us well for good growth in late 2019 and in 2020 as these orders convert into revenue. Small Electric Vehicles is having a great year driven by successful execution of our consumer vehicle strategy. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Sue Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #8. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove strong financial results in the second quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.09, an increase of 13% versus the year ago period. Our Q2 performance gives us confidence in our ability to execute against the full year growth in margin targets we provided in our guidance in the beginning of the year. As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted continuing EPS guidance to approximately $6.40 up from approximately $6.35 that we communicated last quarter. Second quarter organic revenue growth was strong, particularly in our climate segment. We also saw strong organic bookings across most of our major businesses. When excluding our Transport business that saw outsized order growth in 2018, organic bookings were up approximately mid single digits for both the enterprise and our climate segment. In our Industrial Segment, organic revenues were up 2% compounding on a tough comp of 9% organic growth in the prior year. Strong revenue growth in CTS services and small electric vehicles offset the weakness in the industrial short cycle market Mike mentioned previously. Industrial organic bookings were strong, up 8% and compounding on an 8% growth rate in Q2 2018 fueled by long cycle compression technologies growth and small electric vehicle demand. Despite ongoing trade and tariff negotiations, CTS China bookings growth continued to strengthen in Q2 providing cautious optimism going forward. During Q2, we expanded adjusted operating margins 80 basis points and delivered 37% operating leverage, which is ahead of our full year expectations. We continue to leverage our business operating system across the enterprise to manage direct material, tariff related and other inflationary headwinds. As we look to the back half of the year, we anticipate we will continue to realize price to effectively manage material inflation and tariffs including the recent increase in List 3 tariffs on Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, but this spread should narrow as we lap the 2018 mid-year price increases. As Mike mentioned, we continue to expect strong free cash flows in 2019 of equal to or greater than 100% of net income. We exit the second quarter with working capital sufficient to support our ongoing cooling season demands and we expect working capital requirements to approach the long-term target of approximately 4% of revenues by the end of the year. Importantly, we continue to deliver on our dynamic capital allocation strategy. So far this year, we have completed the strategic acquisition of Precision Flow Systems for approximately $1.45 billion, deployed approximately $259 million in dividends and approximately $250 million on share buybacks. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Please go to Slide 9. We delivered organic revenue growth of 4%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. Organic revenue growth was led by strong broad based growth across our Climate segment. Continued disciplined focus on pricing and productivity actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise. Please go to Slide 10. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth, enabling us to drive solid year-over-year EPS growth in the quarter. Our Industrial segment delivered solid results. Our full year industrial margin outlook remains intact. In addition to good segment performance, second quarter corporate costs were lower than prior year impacting results by approximately $0.05. The cadence of corporate expenses is lumpy in 2019 driven primarily by the timing of stock-based compensation that is not linear as well as the timing of a number of other functional spending items. The full year corporate cost guidance of approximately $250 million remains unchanged. Please go to Slide 11. In Q2, strong execution drove 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement, price versus material inflation was positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Pricing net of material inflation expanded margins by 80 basis points reflecting strong carry over price from 2018 and incremental pricing actions in 2019. We delivered solid margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter. Margin expansion was tempered by softness in short cycle industrial revenues, which tend to have higher margins. Consistent with our full-year expectations we continued to deliver productivity in excess of other inflation. We continue to heavily invest in our business. Incremental Q2 investments of approximately 40 basis points were fairly evenly weighted between growth and operating expense reduction projects. Please go to Slide 12. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 5% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points. Consistent with our expectations we delivered strong volume growth, price realization and productivity. Please go to Slide 13. Our Industrial business delivered solid organic revenue growth of 2% against a tough comparison of 9% growth in Q2 of 2018. Industrial leverage was impacted primarily by the inclusion of the PFS acquisition midway through the quarter. PFS acquisition revenues lever at operating income margin rates instead of gross margin rates for the first year under our ownership. Additionally, as I mentioned previously, margin expansion was tempered by softness in short cycle industrial revenues, which tend to have higher margins. Excluding these factors leveraging the industrial was north of 30% in the quarter. Looking at EBITDA margins, the PFS acquisition was an immediate contributor to our EBITDA margin expansion of 60 basis points in the quarter. Please go to Slide 14. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high-ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We have a long-standing commitment to have a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We continue to make strategic investments in acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns like the PFS acquisition completed during the quarter. Earlier this year, we secured an additional $1.5 billion in senior notes taking advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continuing optionality as our markets evolve. We continue to see value in share repurchases when shares trade below their intrinsic value and we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Please go to Slide number 16. The integration of Precision Flow Systems with our existing ARO business is underway and is progressing according to plan. We expect PFS to contribute approximately $400 million in revenue on an annualized run rate. That equates to approximately $250 million of incremental revenue in 2019 with approximately $50 million already delivered in Q2. EBITDA margin expectations for PFS remain unchanged with percentages in the high-20s and adjusted operating margins are expected to be in the mid-teens for 2019. PFS is expected to be cash flow creative consistent with the EBITDA attribution in 2019. For your reference, we have also included estimated non-GAAP adjustments related to PFS for the year. Additionally, we completed a senior notes offering in March, which we anticipate will add approximately $60 million in interest on an annual run rate basis, $47 million incremental to 2019. For 2019, we expect the adjusted operating income of PFS to essentially offset incremental interest from the senior notes offering. Please go to Slide number 17. I want to take a moment to further clarify the impact of PFS on our full-year 2019 revenue guidance. As you can see on the chart, adding approximately $250 million of PFS revenues to our prior revenue guidance range increases our industrial reported revenue growth rates by approximately 7.5 points and our enterprise revenue growth rates by approximately 1.5 points. There is no other change to our revenue guidance ranges for 2019. Please go to Slide number 18. When we're on the road, we often get questions about the status of the strategic announcement we made at the end of April to combine our industrial segment with Gardner Denver. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating a premier industrial company as well as a leading pure-play Climate solutions company focused on HVAC and transport refrigeration. I\u2019ll give you a brief update today. One of the transaction closing conditions was recently satisfied. The HSR Act waiting period expired. We will continue working through the remaining regulatory and other closing conditions. We anticipate approximately $150 million to $200 million in separation and transaction related costs, including the estimated cost of separating legal entities. We also expect to mitigate the approximately $100 million in stranded costs by the end of 2021, this is unchanged from what we communicated last quarter. In preparation for closing, we have begun three separate work streams. The first work stream is focused solely on the separation of our Industrial segment. After years of leveraging across our Industrial and Climate segments we have tasked the separation team with separating Industrial segment business processes, systems and functions. This includes technical and financial operating processes, including taxed and systems, manufacturing operations and supply chain services, real estate, along with all business regulatory filings. There is a lot of work to be done and the team has a methodical roadmap to work this out. The second work stream center is on integration planning with Gardner Denver, given that we continue to operate as two separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction. The integration planning work must be managed under clear rules and anti-trust protocols. While integration preparation is underway and will continue over the coming months in compliance with these rules much of the work to integrate the two companies will take place after the expected close. The final work stream is focused on the transformation efforts of our Climate segment. As we plan and execute within the transformation work stream, we have the advantage of building on an incredibly strong foundation with great businesses, engaged and talented people and a distinctive winning culture and core values. Our strategy focus on reducing the world's energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions remains unchanged. We are focused on developing a new climate structure that allows us to better serve our customers and unlock value for shareholders. At this point, this work is early on and we will give more updates at a later date. All in we're well underway on this strategic transaction and we believe we are on track for closing in early 2020. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 19. In summary, we're pleased with our first half performance and we expect to deliver strong revenue and EPS growth and free cash flow in 2019. Looking forward, we continue to believe that company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Fundamentally, our strategy remains at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. Today 15% of the world's carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings and transport refrigeration creates another 80 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually, which can be eliminated through electrification over time. We are bending the global warming curve by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated cargo. New technology we've developed can reduce up to 99% of the emissions that come from heating and cooling of commercial building. And this doesn't include the substantial environmental benefit of increasing system energy efficiency to reduce both power generations at the source and storage requirements. We're continually working to innovate in this way to electrify heating, electrify diesel engines used to cool trucks and trailers that transport perishable goods and reduce the energy intensity in greenhouse gas emissions and residential and commercial buildings. We recently announced our 2030 ESG commitments to meet the challenge of climate change, while increasing access to air conditioning, perishable foods and medicines, and improving the quality of life for people and communities where we operate and serve. We are committing to reduce our customer carbon footprint by 1 gigaton of CO2 through our HVAC and transport refrigerant products and services. We believe this is the largest customer climate commitment made by any B2B company, and our math shows that this reduction could equate to 2% of the world's emissions. The size and scale that\u2019s equivalent to the annual emissions of Italy, France, and the UK combined. We continue to transform our supply chain and operations to have restorative impact on the environment including achieving carbon neutral operations and giving back more water than we use in water stressed areas. We are committed to increasing opportunity for all strengthening economic mobility and bolstering the quality of life of our people. This includes gender parity and leadership roles, workforce reflective of our community populations, maintaining a livable market competitive wages and broadening community access to cooling, comfort and healthful foods. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market position to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do. We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top tier shareholder returns over the years. Lastly, we're extremely excited about the proposed transaction and the strategic combination of our industrial segment with Gardner Denver. Combining two of the premier complimentary industrial companies offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies supported by secular growth trends and diverse end-market exposure. We're also very excited about creating the premier pure-play HVAC and transport refrigeration company with our existing Climate segment businesses. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage a simplified business model and structure and sharpen our sustainability focus with our investments. Our climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance and we see significant opportunity as a pure-play to build on this performance for our employees, customers, and shareholders. And with that Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hello. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : So just wanted to ask on HVAC? What are you seeing in resi so far in July? And also on the commercial unitary front, how are trends in that part of the business this quarter and what do you expect for the rest of the year there? Mike Lamach : Resi was strong in the quarter, bookings and revenue. While we think it continues for the balance of the year. We think the market might be low-single-digit, mid-single-digit. Steve, we think we'll be mid-single-digit for the year there, so that\u2019s progressing. Again, as you know it\u2019s 80% replacement. We're heavily indexed there and anything we do incrementally with new construction is actually an add. That\u2019s growth for us. So we feel like we're in a great position. With regard to commercial North America, we\u2019re seeing strengths in unitary, we seeing strength and applied and services. We are seeing particular verticals like K12 Labs and data centers that are growing nicely. So they'll let up there and then just to anticipate some questions, I think that people may ask, if you think about our backlog today across the globe from an HVAC perspective, we're up 21% year-over-year and even up sequentially from quarter one to quarter two. So that is, I think indicative of just continued strong markets and a solid pipeline going forward. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. And then so you think you guys are taking share, it sounds like some of the other guys that put up numbers that are obviously not as good as that? Mike Lamach : Well in the markets that we get really good data, third party which is the easiest to look at absolutely, that\u2019s a fact, yes. Steve Tusa : And then lastly, just third quarter. Can you just talk about seasonality? You expect normal seasonality here in the third quarter, I know things are moving around in the global economy and also orders. Do you think orders are going to take out another step down or how do that compares look so that maybe were more stable here in the low-single-digit type of number for climate? I know you don't like to guide that, but there's obviously a lot moving around in the economy. I was just curious as to how you guys see that playing out? Mike Lamach : Well, I don\u2019t see any changes in sort of HVAC globally. I think we've got a pretty good read on the global landscape. Most markets are strong and there's pockets for this weakness, but surprises where markets are strong. Example of that would be Mexico has gone through a couple quarters of negative GDP. It's a pretty big market for us. So that's a newer information but we\u2019re relatively strong in an equivalent market in the southern cone of Latin America. So it's that sort of thing on the edges that we're looking at, but the market's remained strong. There's a lot of focus on Thermo King and I think we've done a decent job explaining the constraints that exist in 2018 at Class 8 tractors and how customers lined-up in advance really to pull on that supply capability. It translated down to trailers and of course that all translated it those customers ordering either APUs or refrigerated trailers. The actual tab time of how the heartbeat of a plant runs and we match trailers and units to actual tractors or trailers, it\u2019s very smooth and that backlog generates just mid-single-digit revenue growth that's been pretty consistent. So the noises around the TK bookings, but again I think you just have to separate that from the 28 constraints with our customers, and think more about the HVAC market being strong and transport just generating solid revenue growth and good backlog and generally healthy markets. And we're still seeing good order intake rate at Transport. So it's not as if things are drying up even on the order input side there, just tough comps. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks, good morning. So maybe just sticking to the two question rule. My first question would just be around the industrial division. It looks like on Slide 17, you're still assuming maybe 5% organic growth this year. That seems to imply a step-up from the first half. So maybe just help explain why you think industrial organic growth should reaccelerate in the second half please? Mike Lamach : Yes, I think we've got our eyes wide open on the short cycle and we've accommodated that in our forecast. We had strengthen longer cycle, some of which we expect to shift in the fourth quarter a lot \u2013 we\u2019ll shift in 2020. We've had excellent growth and our consumer strategy related to a small electric vehicles. So \u2013 and Julian we just finished the five plus seven forecasts not even a month ago. We've had the opportunity to update that last month with risks and opportunities. I think that we feel pretty good about that forecast. When I look back at the beginning of the year relative to guidance, I would say that climate markets are trending toward maybe the upper end of that. And industrial markets may be \u2013 would be trending to the lower side of that, but not that we feel like great, where we need to be in terms of the guidance that we gave. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Then my quick follow-up would be around the climate division. You had about 7% profit growth in the second quarter, a bit of a step down from Q1 and then you're sort of guiding for a pick-up in the second half? Similar question I guess. What drives you think that slightly better EBIT growth in the second half? Maybe it\u2019s actually with the resi versus commercial versus transport or something on the margins around price material. Any color at all on that aspect? Mike Lamach : Yes. Juliana, I mean when you look at leverage, first of all in the quarter we actually had really good leverage. We had leverage above gross margins there north of 30% and we were able to be right about 30% for the first half of the year. So the question probably relates to what you're thinking to be a step down in the revenue. But again here, when you look at 21% year-over-year backlog and sequentially improving backlog from quarter one and quarter two, no deliveries and service business being about half the business. The amount of book in turn we need to do is actually is small as I can remember it. So again, feel pretty good about the revenue number and I think that segment in general leverages pretty close on the full-year at the 25% rate we guided to originally. So I'm not seeing a lot of weakness there. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, Mike, Susan. Mike Lamach : Good morning. Scott Davis : Sometimes when you are executing kind of a deal like this of the size, there tends to be a little bit of a letdown ahead of the closing and some companies we say they have to adjust compensation plans and such to prevent that. But have you guys \u2013 did you feel the need to do anything. Have you done anything? Is there a risk that there's a little bit of a distraction amongst the operating heads, walking into the back half of the year here? Mike Lamach : We've got over the years a wonderful operating system that in terms of the metrics and any of the early warning indicators that we would get, Scott feel good about seeing that. Of course we're seeing none of it today. The more important thing we're doing though is organizing ourselves in a way that we can compartmentalize, what needs to happen and then think about the interdependencies between things. So as an example, our Number 1 priority is to run the business and run it well every day and execute on the commitments we've made. The second priority is the separation itself. Of course, there is no integration without the separation. So there's a separate team focused on separation that does not involve the integration team, which is the third priority. Third priority around integration is to the extent we can under the rules of engagement is to support GDI\u2019s lead in that effort and so that continues. And the fourth thing that we're doing is using the opportunity, the value stream map, much of the company and core process to customers and use the opportunity to think about those core processes in a way that we can make sure that the maximum value added to customers is being delivered and how we might structure from that output and what that might mean of course with the cost structure and maybe speed the market in some cases, it's pretty exciting. But we've tried to make sure that the teams, our different people, to the extent we can. Of course a group like tax is going to be related to all four of those activities but we're doing a pretty good job of compartmentalizing that and running it and using the metrics that we've always used to run the business. Scott Davis : Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up and at this, I know this is always hard to answer a question around market share on the HVAC side. But sometimes, I mean it\u2019s clear that you're gaining share, but sometimes that's due to geographic mix or the types of projects that are growing. I mean, is there a \u2013 is there kind of a no-BS answer to that question of why you think you're winning not the usual or better than the rest kind of stuff. But is there any other explanation that you can give to be helpful in that regard? Mike Lamach : We've really designed \u2013 really our technology and go to market strategy around sustainability and around eliminating both emissions and reducing efficiencies. So this passion around having the most energy efficient commercial systems out there in the world today using the most responsible refrigerants that we can put into these systems of leveraging the analytics, the data, the controls around that to put more sophisticated service offerings together. The belief that on that commercial side, we need to be doing that ourselves. Not through independent distribution because of the complexity of what it takes to model cell, service, deliver against those plans, that's been our strategy and we've been consistent about that and just executing hard against that. I think from a goal deployment perspective, again another core part to the operating system, there's no mystery in the company as to what our goals are, what's expected, what we're measuring, so that \u2013 it just coming together in a way that has worked, Scott over a long period of time. Scott Davis : Yes, clearly. Well, good luck to you guys. Thank you. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning, John. Sue Carter : Good morning. John Walsh : So, I guess just going back to the price cost spread you talked about the 20 basis points to 30 basis points here in the back half. I guess I understand the tariffs, but just kind of looking also at recent price increases and I realize they're not all created equal. It does look like you've pushed through some kind of another round of healthy price here across the commercial parts of your portfolio. I mean, is that \u2013 should we view that as kind of a conservative placeholder for the back half or is \u2013 there's something else that would kind of make that decelerate further? Sue Carter : Well, wait John would \u2013 a right John what I would say is when you think about how we called price cost for the year, we're basically in line with how we called it. So we knew then we were going to have some great price comparisons on a year-over-year basis in the front half of the year. And we knew that in the back half of the year we were going to lap some comparisons to last year. So price is going to actually be \u2013 it's not a deceleration at all but the comparisons to pricing the back half of last year are going to result in a little bit less of a spread than in the first half of the year. But in terms of expectations, that's exactly what we would have expected. The prices are going through, they are sticking, they are actually being realized in the business and material inflation is actually doing approximately what we thought it would do for the year, which is we've gone the tariffs covered, we've got all of the elements of costs covered and we're seeing a little bit of material stabilization but again, stabilization to our expectations in the back half of the year and a little bit of deflation, but given the way that we buy materials, probably more of a 2020 impact. So when I think about the whole price cost sort of put it in a basket, I think the price comparisons are more difficult in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. Material inflation is doing about what we expected and that gives us roughly the 20 basis points to 30 basis points of spread for the entire year on price cost. I mean, maybe its [indiscernible] conservative, but it looks about like we thought it would look, which is the really good part of that. John Walsh : Okay. Thank you. And then I guess just as a follow-up. If we could maybe look at the Americas or maybe actually drill down into the U.S. versus China, just what you saw in terms of service versus equipment growth in the quarter? Mike Lamach : Yes, both are progressing well there, John. I'm always surprised at the degree of service penetration in China, how quickly that's maturing. So there is really no surprises there and from a service perspective we continue to do well there, so not much more to say. Obviously the U.S. and Europe are the gold standard around penetration and linkage and then China is quickly over the years coming to that point and over the next five years, I think it'll be at the same level as our North American European penetration. John Walsh : All right, thank you. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe or Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : I want to turn it back to Industrial and the \u2013 that the long cycle bookings growth that you call outs and, I mean I think rules sort of thinking CapEx kicked down the road, perhaps some of these projects push out. But where are you seeing the bookings strengths that would you call it any end markets in particular? And then switching to the shorter cycle pressure you're seeing? Would you say that's mainly inventory reductions or genuine end market weakness? Mike Lamach : Yes, Nigel, I would call it Asia on your first question, probably to be what we're seeing the long cycle bookings and here you are seeing a chemicals manufacturing energy? Their separation would be another for sure, so that will be the \u2013 what I point out there. With North America, with the U.S. in particular, there was a slow down. It seemed after there was a flurry in the U.S. MCA discussions between Mexico and the U.S. and the possibility of the U.S. imposing additional tariffs, if Mexico wouldn't secure the border from the Mexican side. Roughly after that we saw a slow down. I think it was certainly an end user demand and that obviously effected sell through of distribution short cycle products there. And it bounced around a little bit but off kind of that lower level. So hopefully all that I get cleaned up permanently and I think that'll have a restorative impact on short cycle and it does. I think it will be a nice bounce up when there's certainty around that. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. Thanks Mike. And then digging back to the North American commercial as a quick follow-on, I think some of the peers saw weakness within the commercial unitary markets and [indiscernible] on the replacement side and what impacts we call out there? Did you see there as well? Would you call out the light commercial as weaker in North America? Mike Lamach : No, I know exactly it was exceptionally strong for us. So, no, I would say it would be a highlight of the quarter as opposed to a weakness. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. Mike Lamach : I can't tell you why it would be different, but I can tell you it was a standout in the quarter. Nigel Coe : Thanks Mike. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning everyone. Mike Lamach : Hi Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, Mike you never like to mention whether Nigel threw it out. I mean, anything in the resi business that you thought was discernible and you run your inventories pretty lean, but is there anything kind of in the early set up in the third quarter that overhang from that \u2013 that would be of note? Mike Lamach : No, it was a little bit last year of some pre-buy; I think they got pulled in the second quarter. That's really the only kind of \u2013 it wasn't a big number, but it was a little bit of a compare \u2013 difference there. I think the number of companies had that happen, so no, not really Jeff that answer your question, I think it's just fundamentals remain strong. I think that consumer genuinely still feels pretty good \u2013 pretty healthy and we're not seeing any changes to that? Jeff Sprague : Then bigger picture, Mike. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on what you mean by transformation, right. I think the idea may still be kind of coming into view, but it seems like you've got a relatively crystallized view of where you want to take things. It'd just be interesting to get a little bit more perspective now kind of three months hence making the announcement, kind of what you're thinking about kind of pure-play transformation? Mike Lamach : Yes, the starting point, just to be clear, is something that we're all very proud of over 10 plus years. And so transformation does not mean, if there\u2019s something bad, it's something good that it means there\u2019s an opportunity here to really go think every \u2013 I mean obviously from a name and a brand all the way through to simplification of legal entities. The way that we might look at the way support services are performed across the company. We will apply the same value stream mapping that we would do in a manufacturing process to the way record to report or procure to pay or any kind of order the cash process would work. We'll look through our field organization and understand how that would pan out in terms of incentives and some of the metrics that are out in the field. And just to make sure that those are we want them to be. There is likely different structures that will evolve when you answer those questions. And I think with a goal toward customer focus, a goal towards simplification, being tighter on some of the investment focus on our core sustainability themes. All those things I think are exciting to people inside the company because we're building off a piece of a strong foundation. Jeff Sprague : Great, thanks. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Thanks. Good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Hi, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : Hey just a follow-up maybe on Jeff Sprague's question. You mentioned the year-over-year on orders with the pull forward last year, but just speaking about Q2 2019, did you see any difference on the resi HVAC side between your indirect and direct channels? And maybe if you can speak to \u2013 Lennox, on their call, talked about being over-indexed to some of the swing regions in the U.S. where it can be hot or cold, and so weather was particularly uncooperative given their exposure. I mean how does your footprint kind of contrast with that, if at all? Mike Lamach : Yes, I can\u2019t really contrast it to anybody else, but I can tell you, we're about 50 :50 direct and indirect. We really didn't see any difference in order rates there at all. I guess in 45 or so earnings calls \u2013 I can't remember, I don't think I've ever used weather as a strategy or as an excuse. I can tell you weather normalizes very quickly often within a year, with a bias toward a warming planet. There's more degree days in the future, not fewer. So it's a great place to be, and we like the footprint that we've got. Our focus is on market share and margin expansion as it is for every product growth theme we have inside the company. So those are two clear goals that we have, and that doesn't change. Gautam Khanna : That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a second question, maybe can you give us some color on your expectations for Thermo King growth next year, given what we're seeing in the truck market and what you have as offsets with the APU penetration, and like you said, the backlog running into next year? Any preliminary view on that? Mike Lamach : Yes, it\u2019s too early on that. I mean we'd like to see the update that's coming out around Class A. We'd like to see the updates coming out around refrigerated trailers to know that. My sense is there's no way to burn off all of the backlog we've got in 2019. I know we're into 2020, as it stands. Order rate is still healthy. So just a really early view, which was the same view we gave last time, is when you normalize the 2018 bookings over a 2019 and 2020 revenue cycle, I think you get kind of the steady tact coming out of the business of mid-single-digit growth rates. So I would have no reason to deviate from that at this point. Gautam Khanna : Thank you, guys. Good luck. Mike Lamach : In fact, Gautam, I hope, depending on how sort of Brexit really unfolds and unwinds, that next year, we're sort of getting through this low point in Europe. And potentially, we're seeing strength in Europe, which has been markedly slower than North America as a result of just what's happening with the broader European economy. Gautam Khanna : I appreciate it. Thank you. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hey, guys. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question. There's been a lot of articles. I think the Wall Street Journal had an article how the Europeans are still reluctant to embrace HVAC even despite sort of climate change and the heat wave that you're seeing in Europe. What kind of conversations are you having with customers in Europe regarding HVAC? And are you seeing any structural changes in adoption rates? Mike Lamach : Yeah, I think you\u2019re largely talking about what consumers might think. But if you think about any institutional building, any data center, any industrial building in Europe, they've got the same requirements that you've got all over the world. And I would say the booking rates there, for us, for multiple years have been extraordinary. We've said, I think in 2016, that we would double the business by 2020, and we're going to definitely do that. So I look at economy there, that even though it's modeling around kind of flattish, we've had bookings growth and revenue growth that's been in that high teens, low-20s range now for multiple years. But we're not focused on the consumer there per se. Although there is an extraordinary opportunity, I think going forward around the electrification of heat in Europe, as you'll see more of that application as opposed to the problems of boilers in Europe over time. When that happens, I do think we've got a business and a product portfolio that will benefit from that regulatory conversion in Europe to electrification of heat. Andrew Obin : No, I think I was referring more, if you visit office buildings in Europe in August, they certainly have a different idea of what HVAC is versus North America So I was wondering if requirements are changing. But we can take it off-line. Another question is on supply chain. Are you guys rethinking where and how you're spending CapEx, given all the uncertainty that's taking place? Mike Lamach : Are you meaning uncertainty in the economy? Uncertainty where? Andrew Obin : No, I am thinking about \u2013 I am thinking trade uncertainty. And are you thinking \u2013 are you changing where are you spending CapEx globally? And are you sort of having conversations with your supply chain about moving some sources? Mike Lamach : Yes, when we think about our CapEx, there's been a little difference to how we think about it because we want to make things where we sell things, and that's generally what we've always done. And I would say there's even a stronger concentration of that than it was five years ago. That's been our strategy. As it relates to the supply chain, it depends. Where there is an easy answer, yes, we'll look for an opportunity there if we can, and we've made some movement there. So the answer to your question is, from our own footprint perspective, we're continuing to do what we do from a supply chain perspective. Around the edges, there's things that we do to move supply where we can. Andrew Obin : Great. Always nice to have an HVAC company that doesn't blame weather. Thanks a lot. Mike Lamach : Yes, Andrew, just a bit on your question. I'm just going to follow up, I know you're off the line here. But it's interesting a, lot of the Chinese customers that we have that we're looking to move production away from China to maybe avoid some of the U.S.-China tariffs. We're thinking about Mexico as well. I think that some of what they've done and decided has changed over time, and I think we're seeing more in areas like Vietnam, as an example, as opposed to Mexico. So there are changes with our customers in terms of how they're working their footprint for sure. I will take the next question, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Martin from Seaport Global. Nathan Martin from Seaport Global your line is open. Mike Lamach : There is no Nathan on the call queue. I think you\u2019ve got the wrong person. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Joe. Sue Carter : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : All right, so maybe my first question, Mike, just focusing on Climate operating leverage for the quarter. And so, obviously, like price cost came through well. It seems like the leverage is maybe a little bit lighter than we expected. Was there anything that like just impacted Q2 just from a mix perspective on the Climate side? Anything out of the ordinary? Mike Lamach : So, Joe, I've got 32%. Were you expecting more than that in the quarter? Joe Ritchie : Yes, and then my assumptions on price/cost must be slightly different. Mike Lamach : Okay, I am just taking $40 million of operating income on a $124 million revenue rise, and that's what I'm looking at. Joe Ritchie : Okay, all right. Well, I can take it offline. I was trying to sort out the price/cost component and trying to really determine what the volume leverage was, and it seemed like it was a little bit lower than anticipated. But that's okay. And then I guess maybe just kind of sticking on the commodity, the price/cost question and see your comments earlier on it being [indiscernible] conservative in the second half of the year. I guess as you're thinking about commodity inflation in 2H, if you look at copper, copper still are going to be pretty depressed. You guys typically will buy ahead of it. And so I guess where were you locked in for copper for the second half of the year? And I guess, what are the kind of \u2013 what are the offsets, potentially, to a copper tailwind in the second half of the year? Sue Carter : Well, Joe, if you remember, we actually \u2013 when we gave our original guidance for the year, we had actually planned on both copper and steel perhaps having less inflation in Q3 and Q4, and that's basically coming true. So if you think about copper specifically that you asked about, we're about 75% locked for the back half of the year, which is typical for us. Where you'll see the benefit of those spot rates on copper that really have come down is really in 2020, as I said. So we're doing buys every month for whether it's for 2019 or for 2020, so you'll see the advantage of that appearing in the 2020 numbers. And pretty much the same thing on steel. We know what we're paying for steel about six months in advance. And with either one of those commodities, the highest spot prices were in Q1. They started to come down in Q2, and they'll \u2013 the spot rates that we see right now are down in Q3 and Q4. But again, that's more to our expectations. I don't expect that to be a huge tailwind in the back half of the year. On the other hand, the good news is, is it's not actually a headwind like we've seen for the last couple of years. So like I say we\u2019re taking advantage of it with our buying processes and with our supply chain each and every time we buy the commodities, but it actually is performing about like we expected and called for during the year. Joe Ritchie : Got you. Thank you both. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Mike, just following up on China HVAC. Last quarter, you basically were flattish in terms of order growth, and this quarter, up modestly against the tough comps you mentioned. As in last quarter, you were seeing China related demand improved throughout Q1. So did you see that improved demand level of at all in Q2 as other industrial companies are seeing, or do they generally stay steady or even improve in the quarter? Mike Lamach : I would say, in both Climate and Industrial, from March, forward, bookings have steadily improved in China, specifically. And \u2013 but the markets have shifted. As an example, electronics would be down, say, 15% as a market, but you're going to find other markets that have been compensating for that and some of the heavier industries that would have compensated, and steel would be an example there, something that's \u2013 or power generation, where there's a market both for Industrial and for process cooling in those markets. So that's been good. Yes, we're stacking quarter one and quarter two of 2019 against plus 20s kinds of comps in quarter one, two of 2018, so the stack in that is sort of still mid \u2013 kind of low to mid-teens growth over the two-year period. So we're happy with kind of what's going on in terms of the strategy there that we had around the direct sales force that we've put in place. And then we're happy with the linkage, the service there. China is slower than it was historically, but still a pretty good market. And there's a focus not quite as strong as Europe around sustainability, but certainly, as I've talked in the past, much more of focus in China around clean air and clean water. That's having a positive impact on what we do. Andy Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful, Mike. And then Mike, you gave us a good clarity on PFS. But could you give us more color on how it's doing as it entered the Ingersoll portfolio? Obviously, a fair amount of industrial and, obviously, more oil and gas exposure there. So have you seen any slowdown in that business versus your initial expectations? It will be helpful if you could just talk about how it's going in so far. Mike Lamach : Yes, let me start by saying, first of all, from a cultural fit and a performance mentality, from our goal deployment process, from \u2013 I feel like these guys have been here for years, which is fantastic. It's a great fit inside the company. And in terms of achievement of their management plan, they're on track with that. So the mix has changed a little bit, and you see that in some of the shorter cycle, but like the rest of Ingersoll-Rand, they've got kind of measures for how they're dealing with changes. So frankly, it's been positive. Sue, do you have any color on that? Sue Carter : Yes, it is actually a refreshing type of business because they do have several different brands that they operate under and several different end markets that they go to, and the management team is excellent at finding a real balance between the opportunities in the portfolio and the risks in the portfolio. And they are operating to the management plan that we use when we bought the business, which is great news, both revenue, operating income as well as cash flow. Mike Lamach : Yes, Andy, maybe some \u2013 just I give you one point of specificity here to the bookings growth in the quarter against if you think about sort of all the food management peers that are out there, that I think are booking negative. We are proud of that. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : And I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : I would like to see everyone \u2013 thank you everyone for joining on today's call. And we \u2013 Shane and I will be available for questions over the next day or two and then in the coming weeks. So if you are interested in having a call, please give us a call and we will schedule sometime. And we look forward to seeing you soon on the road. Thanks.

Fundamentally, our strategy as the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact, which are strong secular tailwinds for our business. The world is continuing to urbanize, while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. At our core, we are focused on and excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers all enabled by technology. Unless you think the world is getting cooler, less populated, and less resource constrained as time passes, these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision. As we continue separation, integration planning activities related to the combination of our Industrial segment with Gardner, Denver and transformation activities related to our move towards creating the premier pure-play climate business in 2020, our aggressive pursuit of excellence in driving solutions to mitigate the impact of these secular trends only intensifies. Our Climate businesses squarely focused 100% of our portfolio at the nexus of sustainability and global environmental impact, where our products and services can reduce the impact of these megatrends and further advance the platform for the company to grow above average global economic conditions. Moving to Slide 4, we continue to deliver strong financial results by effectively managing through an evolving global landscape. In the third quarter, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth, compounding on tough comps of 10% organic revenue growth and 22% adjusted EPS growth in the 3rd quarter of 2018. We remain bullish on our strategy, the opportunities that lie ahead in our end markets broadly and particularly, and our team's resilience and their ability to execute, using our business operating system to deliver against the top tier organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance targets we provided for fiscal 2019. We continue to deliver strong and differentiated performance in Q3 in our Climate segment globally. Climate segment organic revenues were up 8% against a tough comp of 2018. Our global HVAC business performance was particularly strong, with approximately 10% organic bookings growth and approximately 10% organic revenue growth. Our performance was also broad based with North American commercial HVAC, European commercial HVAC, and residential HVAC, all significantly to contributing to the growth. Our backlog pipeline and order rates continue to be solid and support healthy growth in the fourth quarter. This is reflected in our revised full year Climate segment organic growth guidance of 7% to 7.5% revenue growth, which is a four point above the top of the prior guidance range. Delivering strong climate performance has enabled us to effectively offset persistent softness and global short cycle industrial spending, which drove organic revenue declines in our short cycle industrial businesses, mainly in compression technologies and tools. In 2019 long cycle larger compressor orders are shown more resiliency and small to mid size short cycle compressors and we're building a solid backlog for these products year-over-year. However, the majority of these units won't ship or deliver meaningful revenues until 2020 and 2021. Despite revenue declines in our high gross margin compression Technologies business, the steps we've taken to restructure and fundamentally improve our operations and service mix over the past several years, enabled us to manage the leverage of the business within our gross margin target rate, demonstrating what we believe is a more resilient business, better able to weather economic downturns. In transport, we delivered low single-digit revenue growth in the quarter against the tough comp in 2018. We also expect revenues to moderate some in the second half versus the first half, again comparing a tough comps in the second half of 2018. Further softening of the European economy combined with ongoing Brexit uncertainty, has softened our European trailer outlook for the back half of the year for the region. But we expect this to be largely offset by strong North American revenues for 2019. Our outlook for mid single-digit organic revenue growth in 2019 for our overall transport business remains unchanged. We continue to effectively manage tariff and inflationary headwinds and deliver a positive price versus material cost spread. Volume and productivity are also strong nailing us to drive solid margin expansion. As always delivering strong free cash flow and directing capital deployment towards high ROI projects remains core priorities. Lastly, we're excited about the pending Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Gardner Denver, creating a premier industrial company, while simultaneously creating a leading pure-play Climate Technologies company, focused on HVAC and transport refrigeration. We believe both businesses have potential to unlock value for shareholders. Please go to Slide 5. This slide provides a visual depiction of organic bookings and revenue growth in the third quarter. As I discussed on the prior slide, we delivered strong broad based bookings in revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions and our Climate segment in the third quarter, and the business was up approximately 10% in organic bookings, excluding transport and up 8% overall in organic revenues. Asia continues to see the impacts of trade tensions and broader economic uncertainty, remains a stable market. Commercial HVAC Asia, organic bookings were up mid single digits in the third quarter. Climate Asia organic revenues were down mid-single digits against the tough low teens revenue comp in China in the third quarter of 2018. As I outlined on the prior slide, our Compression Technologies industrial products businesses continued to be impacted by the slowing industrial short cycle spending. Our small electric vehicle business has continued to deliver strong growth, driven largely by our consumer vehicle strategy. All in, industrial organic bookings and revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 6. We've encapsulated number of takeaways for our major end markets on this slide for your reference. I've covered much of this content already, so I'll just add a few brief comments before passing the call along to Sue. First focused execution of our business strategy is enabling us to continue to deliver a very strong global HVAC performance, particularly in North America, Europe, and then the residential business. Our end markets are largely healthy, and we believe we are outperforming the underlying growth rates in these markets. The transport market has softened a bit versus our view when we exited the second quarter, primarily really driven by the softening of the European market, which continues to be impacted by weakening economic fundamentals and uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Overall, we believe focused execution of our strategy is enabling us to outperform global transport market conditions and we are on track to deliver mid single-digit growth in transport for 2019. Lastly, have talked at length about slowing industrial short cycle spending impacting our quicker book and ship small and mid-sized air compressors, industrial products businesses. We expect this softness to continue through the fourth quarter, consistent with our updated 2019 guidance. And we expect to offset the softness with the strength we're seeing in global HVAC. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Sue Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide 7. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.99, an increase of 14% versus the year ago period, driven by strong performance in our climate segment. We continue to execute well in an evolving global landscape and remain on track to deliver against our full-year organic revenue growth, EPS growth, and margin guidance. Third quarter organic revenue growth was strong, particularly in our climate segment. Orders were also strong in our climate segment. When excluding our transport business that saw outsized order growth in 2018, organic bookings were up high single digits for the enterprise and approximately 10% for our Climate segment. In our Industrial segment organic revenues were flat versus a tough year-over-year comp of 9% organic revenue growth in the prior year. Strong revenue growth in small electric vehicles largely offset the softness in the industrial short cycle markets, we mentioned previously. During Q3, we expanded adjusted operating margin 70 basis points and delivered 25% operating leverage consistent with our full year expectations. We continue to leverage our business operating system across the enterprise to manage direct material, tariff related, and other inflationary headwinds. As we look to the fourth quarter, we will continue to leverage our business operating system to drive further margin expansion. As Mike mentioned, we continue to expect strong free cash flow in 2019 of equal to or greater than 100% of net income. Through Q3, we have delivered approximately $1 billion in free cash flow and are on track to hit our full year expectations. Importantly, we continue to deliver on our balanced capital allocation strategy. During Q3, we deployed approximately $124 million in dividends and approximately $250 million on share buybacks. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.  Please go to Slide 8. Taking a step back from the details for a moment, Q3 was a very strong quarter with top quartile performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 6%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 70 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 14%. Organic revenue growth was driven by global HVAC strength in our Climate segment, continued disciplined focus on pricing and productivity actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise. Please go to Slide 9. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth, enabling us to drive solid year-over-year EPS growth in the quarter. Our Industrial segment delivered $0.05 of EPS growth with solid small electric vehicles growth and the addition of our Precision Flow Systems acquisition that we closed in Q2, more than offsetting revenue declines in other industrial businesses. In addition to good segment performance, third quarter corporate costs were lower than prior year, due to ongoing cost management activities, lower stock-based and incentive compensation and the timing of unallocated corporate spending. We now expect our full year corporate cost to be less than $240 million, down from our previous guidance of approximately $250 million. Please go to Slide 10. In Q3 strong execution drove 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement on strong price versus material inflation and productivity versus other inflation spreads. During the second half of 2019, we are lapping strong pricing implemented in the back half of 2018. Consistent with our expectations, we delivered 40 basis points of margin expansion from price versus material inflation. This represents our sixth consecutive quarter of positive price cost. We delivered solid margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter. Margin expansion was tempered by mix pressure as we delivered outsized growth from commercial HVAC applied systems, as compared to other initially higher margin products like unitary or transport equipment. Over 20 to 30 year life an applied system carries high margin service and aftermarket parts, but the initial sale creates pressure on margin mix. Additionally, consistent with last quarter, we saw a mix pressure from softness in short cycle industrial revenue which also tend to have high margins. Productivity versus other inflation across the enterprise improved margins by 80 basis points in the quarter. In both our Climate and Industrial segments, we delivered strong productivity from operational excellence and restructuring savings. Reduced corporate costs also contributed to the margin expansion. We continue to invest heavily in growth and operating expense reduction projects with high returns on investment. Incremental Q3 investments totaled approximately 30 basis points. Please go to Slide 11. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 8% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 30 basis points. Consistent with our expectations, we delivered strong volume growth, price realization, and productivity. Please go to Slide 12. In our Industrial segment organic revenues were flat against tough comps of 9% organic growth in the prior year. Strong revenue growth in small electric vehicles largely offset softness in the industrial short cycle markets. Over the past several years, we have built a stronger more resilient industrial business. In our Compression Technologies business. for example, pricing. productivity, and restructuring savings partially offset volume declines to enable deleverage within gross margin rates for the second quarter in a row. Industrial segment adjusted operating margins expanded 40 basis points in the quarter. Our high EBITDA margin PFS acquisition continues to improve our Industrial EBITDA margins. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins 110 basis points in the quarter. Please go to Slide 13. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership, and margin expansion. We continue to make strategic investments in acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a longstanding commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. With the proposed transaction with Gardner Denver growing closer, I'd like to highlight that we expect to maintain our annualized dividend of $2.12 per share post closing and through 2020. This will deliver a very attractive dividend yield for the new Climate core. For 2021 and beyond, we will evaluate dividend increases in line with earnings growth, consistent with our longstanding capital deployment priorities. We continue to see value in share repurchases and we expect to consistently deploy 100% excess cash over time. Please go to Slide 15. When we are on the road, we often get questions about the status of the proposed transaction to combine our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating a premier industrial company, as well as a leading pure-play Climate Technologies company focused on HVAC and transport refrigeration. I'll give you a brief update today. First, the transaction with Gardner Denver remains on track for deal closure in early 2020. In reviewing our priorities between now and deal closure, our first priority is and will continue to be, running the business and taking care of our customers. To maintain focus on our customers, we have dedicated teams carrying out separation and integration planning, as well as Climate core transformation activities. Separation activities encompass separation of technical and financial operating processes and systems, manufacturing operations, and supply chain services, and real estate, along with all business regulatory filings. We have a detailed project plan and we are executing against that plan. When necessary, we are creating transition services agreements to support day one operations for certain processes and services. At this stage, we anticipate one time separation and transaction related costs to be at the high-end of our previously communicated range of approximately $150 million to $200 million. Given that we in Gardner Denver continue to operate as two separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction. The integration planning work must be managed under clear rules and antitrust protocols. We will continue to work within these rules as we progress towards day one of the new industrial business. Additionally, we expect to leverage this opportunity to further improve our Climate business to better serve our customers and unlock value for shareholders with a singular focus on reducing the world's energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions. We are building on an incredibly strong foundation with great businesses, engaged and talented people, and a distinctive winning culture, and core values. As I said at the beginning, we remain excited about the prospects of creating a premier industrial company, as well as a leading pure-play Climate Technologies Company. On another note, given the outsize transport order growth in 2018, we often get questions on the road about our order outlook. As we look at the fourth quarter. I'll remind you that we booked a large commercial order worth approximately $200 million in Q4 of last year. As we discussed when we booked this order, the revenues are expected to be recognized over the course of approximately 3.5 years. Excluding this large order, we have tough comps in the rest of the business where enterprise organic bookings were up approximately 11% and Climate segment organic bookings were up approximately 13%. Please go to Slide 16. As we highlighted earlier, we continue to execute well in an evolving landscape. All in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at approximately $6.40. Our enterprise revenues and margin guidance also remains unchanged. With our continued strong Climate segment revenue growth led by global HVAC, we now anticipate full year organic revenues to grow between approximately 7% and 7.5%, a four point higher than our original guidance. Our Industrial segment revenues have been impacted by soft short cycle investment spending. We now anticipate Industrial organic revenue to be flat to up 0.5% for the year, as we expect short cycle softness to persist in the fourth quarter. Our guidance for both our Climate segment and our Industrial segment margin rates remain unchanged, although we do anticipate delivering towards the high-end of the Climate range and towards the low-end of the Industrial range. We are increasing full-year restructuring cost guidance to approximately $0.30 from $0.25 primarily related to additional footprint optimization efforts. We have a couple of elements of guidance, we also recommend tweaking including reduced corporate spending to less than $240 million and a lower expected effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 21%. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks Sue. Please go to Slide 17. In summary, we're effectively managing the global landscape, as it evolves to deliver our 2019 guidance for top tier revenue growth, EPS growth, and free cash flow in 2019. Looking forward, we believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Fundamentally, our strategy remains at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. Today 15% of the world's carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings and by 2030, it's estimated that 25% will derive from these sources. Transport, refrigeration creates another 80 million metric tons of Co2 emissions annually, which can be eliminated through electrification over time. Earlier this year, we announced our 2030 ESG commitments, which included a commitment to reduce our customer carbon footprint by one gigaton of Co2, through our HVAC and transport refrigeration products and services. We believe this is the largest Customer Climate commitment made by any B2B company, and our math shows that this reduction could equate to 2% of the world's total emissions. Besides the scale, it's equivalent to the annual emissions of Italy, France, and the U.K. combined. At the Climate Summit last month, we also introduced the same challenge to like-minded companies. We are bending the global warming curve by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated cargo. New technology, we've developed can reduce up to 99% of the emissions that come from heating and cooling a commercial building and this doesn't include the substantial environmental benefit of increasing system energy efficiency, through optimized system designs, advanced controls, and data analytics. Ongoing system monitoring, and service and maintenance. These comprehensive solutions can also dramatically reduce power generation at the source energy storage requirements. We're continually working to innovate in this way to electrify heating, electrify diesel engines used to cool trucks and trailers that transport perishable goods, and to reduce the energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions in residential and commercial buildings. Our 2030 ESG commitments also included addressing a host of other important issues. We continue to transform our supply chain and operations to have a restorative impact on the environment including achieving carbon-neutral operations and giving back more water than we use in water-stressed areas. We are committed to increasing opportunity for all, strengthening economic mobility, and bolstering the quality of life of our people. Additionally, we are committed to gender parity and leadership roles. The workforce reflective of our community populations, maintaining a livable market competitive wages, and broadening community access to cooling comfort and healthy foods. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and a high performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do. We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top-tier shareholder returns over the years. Lastly, we're extremely excited about the proposed transaction and the strategic combination of our industrial segment with Gardner Denver. Combining two of the premier complementary industrial companies, offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies supported by secular growth trends and diverse end market exposure. We're also excited about creating the premier pure-play HVAC and transport refrigeration company, with our existing Climate segment businesses. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage a simplified business model and design, and sharpen our sustainability focus in our investments. Our Climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance and we see significant opportunity as a pure-play to building this performance for our employees, customers, and shareholders. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : I don't unusually suck up on these calls, but congrats to you guys for not getting over year ski dips after a good first half and staying conservative. It obviously is warranted in this environment. So kudos to you guys for that. On the businesses, resi, you're saying contributed to kind of orders and revenue growth. So that means there was kind of revenues up greater than a high single-digit and orders up around double digit. Is that kind of the messaging there on resi? Mike Lamach : The resi was strong Steve, I agree with what you said. We typically don't think about residential bookings, because residential bookings turn so quickly, but we did on in the quarter with a low teens booking number. So to the extent you can read a little forward in the fourth quarter. I feel it's going to be fairly strong again. Sue Carter : I'm going to also say, Steve, as you think about that our residential business in addition to having good revenues in the third quarter also had some tough comparisons to the third quarter of last year, where the revenues were also very high. Steve Tusa : Clearly you guys are taking some of this year that was lost by Lanex. What are the mechanics of kind of holding on to those customers. And is that - do you feel like that's now yours to lose or is they kind of try and come back after that there is a risk that that fades? Mike Lamach : Steve, I'll just say we're just executing our own strategy here. So this is building great stuff, having great distribution, working through all the technical and digital work that we've been working on now for a couple of years. So this is just really us executing against our own strategy more than it is anything else. Steve Tusa : And then just a quick one on the details on the productivity and other on inflation. Even ex - the corporate kind of benefits there, it looks pretty solid, like up 50 basis points. To me it was up 80 basis points reported. Anything specific to call out there and is that kind of the benefits of recent restructuring and is that something that you guys can pull lever on into - in the future if things get a little bit weaker on your revenues? Mike Lamach : I'll let Sue come here in a second. Steve, one thing I'd say would be on the corporate side, we worked really hard at reducing corporate cost and thought about this over the past year and a half 2 years now and putting the same lean tools toward benchmarking and executing against cost reductions there. So I'm happy to see that that's actually flowing through. And then Sue do you have any other comments? Sue Carter : Yes, I think when you think about the productivity in general, Steve, you're absolutely right. Some of the productivity in operations comes from normal productivity projects that we have on any given year, but it also comes from some of the restructuring that we've done over the past couple of years. And on the corporate side to Mike's point, we worked really hard at decreasing the functional spending over time. We know we've been successful at that, in that we've leveled down to spending as well as have offset any inflation that comes into the corporate arena. And just in case anyone is thinking about the less than $240 million. The fourth quarter is when all have different accruals and other things get trued up, so we didn't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that look like. But all in all, a really good productivity quarter for the entire company. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Maybe to pick up on that thread a little bit, should we view what we're seeing in corporate costs here kind of a running start on the stranded costs? And could you update us on what your view there is? And how that should play out maybe over the next couple of quarters? Mike Lamach : Yes, we - Jeff, we've done a lot of work on the blueprinting to this point, about where we think the opportunity is for all of Climate across the - all the Climate - I'm sorry, all the cost structure, whether that be at corporate or what's in the segments. Also rethinking what should be in corporate and what should be in the segments. But with that being said, there is probably 10 specific ideas we have kind of going forward into 2020 that we're beginning to execute on as it relates to the entire cost structure. And so, yes, you can think about this as getting a running start on 2020. Jeff Sprague : And then just the order and revenue performance, certainly impressive, I'll echo that. How are you feeling about backlogs now, Mike? I mean, did you have notable backlog depletion in this quarter? I think the commercial HVAC franchise overall was at something like 21% backlog growth last quarter, if I recall correctly. Just your visibility in Q4 I'm sure is very buttoned up. But how much further around the corner can you look? Mike Lamach : Yes, pipelines look very strong, coming in backlogs look still very strong. Jeff, I'll go back and look at the 21, you're talking on Q2 versus Q1, I'd have to go back and give you a number, Q2 to Q3. But my guess is we didn't deplete much of the backlog there. It was a strong bookings quarter again for us, so that all feels good. Even in the industrial compressor business and we've had backlog build on - engineered order compressor is backlog build on oil-free rotary, backlog on services, so there's goodness built up I think in the backlog going forward. The only place we saw a reduction of backlog would have been in Thermo King. It's fundamentally just a weakening Europe from the last view we had in quarter 2 and then also just some summer cancellations that occurred. But backlog there is still above where it was this year last time, it's just a little bit less than it was last time we spoke, if you heard the last quarter. Steve Tusa : And just, finally, on TK obviously your comments are around Europe weakness, but kind of all eyes are probably on kind of the ACT numbers into next year. I think you're trying to avoid 2020 outlook here today on the call. But how do you feel about your ability to kind of counteract kind of pressure in that part of the business potentially next year? Mike Lamach : Yes, I think the context to put it in, Jeff, would, to say that on a pro forma basis Climate Co would have about 5%, through less than 5% of its revenue is associated with North American trailer, which is really what we're talking about here. And if you took the ACT numbers at face value it would reflect something on the order of an 18% decline between the 49.9 units this year and next year is in the 41 in change range. So if you think about that, less than 5% revenue and 18% drop you end up with something less than one point of revenue headwind to the company. And I think that only TK has significant levers to pull with a lot of new launches and product innovation coming through in 2020. But I feel good about the HVAC businesses at large and the backlog that we're building there and what I still think is kind of early to mid in the North American institutional cycle as well. So I feel like without giving specific 2020 guidance, we've sized that we think we've got plenty of levers to pull to have a good year in 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : It seems like - and maybe I am over reading this that ESG has become a pretty big theme for you guys almost increasingly every quarter. And just what I'm wondering is, how much does this narrow or widen the lens I guess when it comes to M&A for once that deal is done? Meaning, are you more likely to stick to HVAC or think more broadly? Is ESG as a theme overall, kind of afford you at least the mindset to think a little bit more broadly? Mike Lamach : Well, I think you about - I think you think about it as a funnel, really if you think about the enormity of the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets, and businesses first, that's obviously, what the go forward company is very good at. And then you look at that in the context of any innovation or idea that we would have that would make sense from a reducing energy intensity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions point of view, it's going to be additive to that. So I think you look at those in combination as opposed to independently. Scott Davis : I guess that kind of answers it. But I'll move on to the next one. When do you think about... Mike Lamach : Yes, Scott, I was just - Scott just to be really clear, because I wanted to be clear on this, we've got plenty to do in our co space. And so we're not opening the lens here to think about a third leg of the stool from a sustainability perspective. We're building the company on its HVAC and refrigeration routes, and to the extent we find things that lower energy intensity and lower greenhouse gas emissions within that, that's sort of a double check for us. Scott Davis : And just one of the things that sometimes tough to analyze is the mix of non-resis as you think about your order book. I mean, is there a mix change as far as complexity and size of projects, and things like that, that we should think about for 2020 or something in your backlog? Mike Lamach : In the mix really wouldn't be size of projects. The mixes that come into play here are going to be things like applied systems versus unitary systems, which applied carry a lower initial gross margin. But over the long haul we're pretty agnostic to the margins because service margins really accrue to the applied business. And then as we're growing the HVAC business faster than the transport business of course the transport margins are higher than the HVAC business. Those are the general issues that we see. But as we look at the business regionally, the EBITDAs from the three businesses regionally are fairly close. And so we're somewhat agnostic to where in the world the growth is, but certainly the actual product or systems or services can change the mix for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to focus on the Climate revenue guidance a little bit. So you took up the guide I think for the year, just over a points organically for Climate. I just wanted to confirm, if that's mostly resi related and you took up your resi market guide for the year. Just when you're thinking over the next 18 months or what have you - any perspective you could provide on the longevity of the resi replacement cycle in the US, understanding that resi is only 15%, 20% or so of the Climate piece. Mike Lamach : Yes, Julian. We took up Climate really based on just universal strength across the globe and pipeline bookings and backlog in general. So it would have been commercial and residential across the board. The point you made about residential going up, I think it might have been related to last quarter, I think we had a bit of a typo in the deck, we might have said low-single digit to mid-single digit. We didn't mean to do that. It was always mid single-digit. Zack, is that about right? Zac Nagle : No. We actually put low single-digit in the deck, instead of low to mid single digit, which is what we've always intended. Mike Lamach : Yes, okay. So we don't really feel different about Razzall year long is playing out the way that we thought it would. And then really to comment on the cycle, we've got over the years pretty good sources of data and analytics that are proprietary to what we use. And because our business is so dependent on replacement, it's well north of 80% replacement for us, we're watching it very carefully. But we really don't see anything here in the near future that would change our view toward a strong 2020 in the residential business for us. Julian Mitchell : And then just my second quick follow up would be around, just if you could give some more color on the Climate business in Asia. It seems quite choppy. Some of the construction trends there, you've got some tough comps. But you do have the benefits, I guess, of a lot of share gains from that distribution build out you did a couple of years ago. So maybe just give us some context as to how you see growth there in your non-res climate business in Asia and anything on competitive discipline as well. Mike Lamach : Yes, I think that we're still seeing Asia in general, in China specifically to your question, is being a good market over the long run. You're seeing a change within China around end markets themselves. And so if you think about the three largest markets in Asia, the retail, leisure, and office, all three of those markets are down significantly. Retail is down - am talking about the market, down about 15%, leisure down about 11%, office about 6.5%. Those are big markets that are down. Interestingly, industrial markets are up, that's good for us and things like education and transportation are up double-digit even though they're smaller markets. But those are the markets that we wanted to focus on from an applied perspectives being longer cycle but core to the economy, core to the 5-year plan in China. So we will continue to, I think, see good markets there and continue to see benefits of the direct strategy that we put in place in China. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : So I just want to go back to the productivity buckets and the 80 basis points. How does that land between the two segments? I know you've been restructuring in both segments, so I'm just curious whether it was heavier in one versus the other? And then maybe just touch on the industrial business, what's changed since 2016 where we saw a lot of deleverage in that business. And I know that was partly due to the fact you just acquired Cameron. But what's changed today versus three or four years ago to kind of hold in margins a lot better through a choppy environment? Mike Lamach : Productivity was about equal between both segments, there is nothing remarkable that we're seeing really there. Inflation would have been higher on the Climate side. So the net would have been a little bit stronger toward industrial net productivity if you think about total productivity over non-material productivity, industrial would have been a little bit stronger. And there there's been really good progress over the years, just to congratulate all our leaders in the industrial space. Todd has done a very nice job, specifically, in the Compression Technology business around looking at some of this footprint there. And we've essentially gone from a number of larger compressor plants down to a smaller number and if executed that without missing a hitch. And so there's a very strong market work there. I would tell you within the Club Car business they're doing an outstanding job and they have grown this consumer vehicle into a meaningful part of the business. And every time we sell a consumer vehicle versus a gol fleet vehicle we mix up in terms of the margin. Pleased with what's happening in our tool and material handling business. And even material handling in particular has been back to the black, after pretty strong declines over the years in oil and gas. And then our fluid management PFS business, really had a record Q3 for them, and so we're proud of what's happening there. Coming out of private equity, it's always a challenge to improve margins. But the team managed to improve margins in Q3. So just across the board good performance and to us, it's a test of the resilience that we talk about and stress testing our business to make sure that when we do see negative revenue growth that the deleverage can be maintained inside of our gross margins and we get that question a lot from investors. And so it's important point out that when we see this, and we have leverage inside that sort of 30% margin number, it's indicative of the fact that we think we're executing well against the plans. Nigel Coe : Mike, that's good detail. And then just on the - you pointed out in the slides that big $20 million project you booked in 4Q. What's the outlook for, number one, the funnel for commercial globally? Maybe just touch on that. But specifically these large mega projects, because I'm assuming in NGL net wealth, we will see a lot more of these large projects, maybe rip and replace type projects. So maybe just touch on that please. Mike Lamach : Yes. It's almost normal now for us to see large projects in the pipeline. It's difficult to predict when they close and what they look like when they are complete. We've got a number in the backlog. I would say not as large as that. But maybe collectively some of the large projects would total that. So we are seeing see more of that. It is more of a sort of base business for us at this point in time in terms of our ability to execute against that. And we're set up to do that, so we've invested heavily in that business, and we do have a pipeline of larger project sitting in that backlog. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about what you saw in service for both the Climate business and the industrial business as well, a little more granularity around those growth rates? Mike Lamach : Yes, I mean service for both - there has been a strategy for both, I mean, so there is nothing new in terms of our focus on the services business there at all. Service is for us spend something that's grown kind of in the high single-digit range, particularly in the Climate business over the last decade or so. That continues to clip along at about that level consistently as we're going forward. And then, as you've seen in the Industrial segment from the reports we did here that we continue to see good service growth there - differentiated service growth there to the mix. So maybe a little bit less than what we've seen in climate over time, but again it's been a healthy mid-to-higher single-digit growth in industrial services over time. And really when we're talking about Industrial Services, it's really in our compressor technology business, and that's generally going to be based off our largest and tropical, and engineered order or larger oil-free compressors as opposed to some of the book in turn smaller compressors, which don't have the same sort of service opportunity. John Walsh : And then going back to kind of the M&A question. I mean, I think a lot of time we focus on the larger deals, but you did get the smaller deal done here in September? And I was just kind of curious what kind of made this particular company and interesting property for Ingersoll, was it something on the technology side, was it something to do with where their service and sales reps were located? Any color around these smaller kind of single that are out there to do in the industry would be helpful. Mike Lamach : I appreciate you actually for raising that. We've done about 18 or so of those last few years, a lot them are sort of that size, maybe a little bit smaller. But typically it's going to be a technology that we think is nobel, it's innovative, it's not part of the portfolio today. It may come with a channel, it may not. But generally speaking, if we can take an innovative product and then move it through the dedicated train commercial channel, it's a home run for us. In other cases, there is also strategy to maintain a second channel through independent reps and that's an important element where we might go to market the train for some of the portfolio, and in this case Arctic chiller for another part of the portfolio, so that multi-channel strategy can work for some of this as well. This is just a nobel idea around a modular smaller chiller design for modular small applications and it just adds to our portfolio in that regard. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Just going back to Slide 10, if you look at volume leverage, anyway you can decompose it between Climate and Industrial. And specifically what I'm trying to get at, you cited applied impacting volume leverage at Climate and I'm just trying to figure out how bad it was and when does it go away? Thank you. Sue Carter : So. Andrew, I think as you're looking in at volume in total, I think the volume - that you're talking about the volume leverage is going to come out of the Climate segment, which is what we were talking about with the markets, a little flatter on the industrial side. That isn't going to be the piece of it. And as we were going through on the different areas, in constructing the slide what we wanted to look at was not only what it was contributing, and then the comments around mix that we've given throughout, the commentary with that being more to the applied side than to the unitary side. But it was more on the Climate side than Industrial. Mike Lamach : And Andrew on that. I mean, I'm looking I'm seeing volume kind of flowing through pretty much at the 25% level. For Climate it was the mix that kind of pull that back a little bit from there. And if I go to the deleverage the organic side of the deleverage in Industrial, it delevered at about the gross margins of the business, hard a little bit on mix. But again this is where the productivity and imagine, then that productivity equation and price helped that out quite a bit. Andrew Obin : Yes, that makes sense. And just a follow-up question. I know institutional market is quite important to you, seem to be constructive. If you look at construction put in place data, institutional markets, education, healthcare, it seems to be a mixed at best. So what gives you confidence that this market continues to grow into the year-end and into 2020? Thank you. Mike Lamach : Well, thank you. What I would say is, when you look at put in place you really only get about half the visible market and the other half of the visible market is the market that you go out and create demand with by putting offers to customers that would reduce their energy intensity or improve operations in their buildings. And so, notwithstanding what you said, what I would tell you that in quarter 3, from a vertical market perspective, the strength we saw was in higher education and in health care. We saw that and continue to see that going into the fourth quarter, and in 2020 just by virtue of the pipeline that we're chasing. Commercial and industrial, we saw strength there in energy, food, beverage and interestingly even in retail, which gets to be national accounts and some of the brick and mortar out there. So that was again really strong for us as well. But we're seeing a very good pipeline going forward in these markets and that put in place data really tells only about half the story. Now its indicative of what we're seeing in the marketplace. Andrew Obin : And do you guys track bond issuance in those markets, do they tell you anything in terms of visibility? Mike Lamach : Yes. They - well, they do. They get - that's a very long leading indicator toward visibility in the marketplace. Generally speaking, when we know that a school district is going about or applying for bonds, we know generally than what they're trying to do or construct with those bonds. And so we're doing some preliminary work with schools as they're going out for bonds to get estimates for what things might cost and sort of what it might take from an operational basis to maintain those facilities. That of course is predicated on that bond actually passing and then once that bond passes it can go through a fairly traditional cycle of detailed models and designs, all the way through procurement. So again it's a very early indicator on a bond. But generally speaking, if we know a school district or a hospital is going for a bond vote, we're going to be working with that customer to understand what the scope of the project might look like. Operator : Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : So I just want to start on the climate margins, just to take that a step further. So understanding that you guys did 25% incrementals on volume growth. The 4Q margin assumption seems to embed a bit of a stronger performance versus 3Q. Is that all accountable or attributable to the mix headwind going away or are you anticipating stronger incrementals on volumes as well? Mike Lamach : Nicole just to be clear, is it - there is another call in the line, right? Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Mike Lamach : Yes. Okay, good. I wasn't sure if I was first on the line. So are you quarter 4 Climate leverage, specifically? Nicole DeBlase : Exactly, yes. Mike Lamach : Sue, what's your view on that? Sue Carter : Well - so if you look at the volume leverage in Q4, it is straightly - slightly stronger than it is in Q3. But again the environment is roughly going to be the same as what we were seeing in Q3. So in other words, growth in all of the end markets, a probably same slide towards applied versus unitary. But there really isn't a huge amount of change that comes out of the volume leverage in Q4. But again all of our businesses are going to continue to grow in Q4, residential, the commercial businesses, etc. Mike Lamach : Nicole, when you look at total leverage for quarter 4, Sue, is absolutely right on the volume piece of it. What I would tell you is that the mix will hurt us a little bit more there. We think about more applied, less transport, we would expect less price than we would have in Q3 sequentially just because we're kind of lapping price there again. So I would think that we'll manage the full year for the enterprise with the same 25% we talked about. But I would expect that quarter 4 will look a lot like quarter 3 for Climate, probably not any better. Nicole DeBlase : And then you brought up price cost, it seems to me that because you're lapping tougher pricing comps and 4Q price cost impact to margins probably comes down a little bit. But thoughts on that, and then any early thoughts into 2020 just specifically on the price cost front? Susan Carter : So if you think about Q4, I think the back half of 2019 is similar. So I think you'll see about the same thing in Q4 that you saw in Q3. And as I think about 2020 - so I am going to give you an answer and it's not going to be what you want, which is what our guide is. But when I think about 2020 and I think about tier one materials on steel, copper, aluminum, should all be on the surface deflationary. So in a good spot, we see the spot prices coming down, we're seeing it in results. And that should be a really nice tailwind, if you will, going into 2020. However, is that - as we look at this, we want to watch this play out over the upcoming months, because we just do not know what the tariffs and all of those pieces are going to mean to 2020. So in other words you could have deflation on those base materials and you could be offset by tariffs. You could have a change in the tariffs and that's just something that we're not comfortable with trying to give that outlook on. So I can tell you what I see on spot prices and then what we're doing on early buys of material going into 2020. But we'll just watch the environment and then as we get closer to 2020 give you a guide on what we think it looks like at that point in time. Mike Lamach : Nicole I'd say that there has been so much as you know volatility around news and announcements coming out around tariffs that unfortunately, we've gotten pretty good at being able to react to it. It takes us about two days to get from an announcement or a change to having that flow through and understand from a growth perspective, what the impact is and it takes us maybe a week from that point in time to understand what we think we can do from a net perspective around mitigating some of that. And therefore, then we know at that point in time, probably a week or so later, what we need to do from a pricing perspective and so volatile. That I think, we're comfortable with our ability to react and change and understand and push sort of pricing through and mitigate what we can, that at this point in time, we're not trying to guess where things go in 2020 there. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Mike, just to follow-up on, I think a couple of questions trying to get at maybe kind of the shift and climate over time toward more sustainability and energy efficiency. It seems like a lot of your competitor\u2019s talk more about selling boxes and you guys are talking more about selling solutions. Can you give us a sense for how that mix has evolved in terms of just kind of straight away product sold through traditional channels versus something that, is this more kind of comprehensive sustainability path? Mike Lamach : Yes, I think two things have happened I mean, one is that obviously the world is looking at regulations differently around greenhouse gas emissions, understanding the impact of refrigeration systems on the environment that's one. Two, as these systems become greener, if you don't do anything to the fundamental underlying system, the refrigerants tend to be less energy efficient. So you're on your end up using more power to generate the same level of cooling and heating in the system. And so from a system level, it's really making sure that you can reduce the energy intensity while using next-generation refrigerants. And so there's a lot of innovation that goes into that. It also feeds right into how we think about the need to have a direct a very high-quality sales force at there. It's typically engineers or professional engineers selling to professional engineers and our customers in the commercial space in that model exists for us all over the world, because these are complex trade-offs. And then as you think about 30 year lives on many of these systems. Any innovation you have an advantage you have and what the cost of maintaining those systems will be, it can be a very meaningful sort of a kicker to total cost of ownership. And so, it's just the way we go to market, it's our model and when we think about creating demand. It was the earlier question about put in place. And I said about half of it is put in place and half of it is going out and creating demand. The half that we go out and create demand with are looking for those kinds of customers that understand this technically and are wanting to do something about it and may have systems of age, a variety where there is a particular opportunity to go have a high return on invested capital. And so, it's just a more sophisticated sale and way to market and that's what we train people to do. I mean we train them technically. And then we train them financially around how to go make the case. Josh Pokrzywinski : So it's really all the mix has shifted toward this. It's kind of getting away from how you need a box for the top of your strip mall and we'll sell you one. Mike Lamach : Well, it's really - time it's - you try to move away from responding to quotes to creating specifications, creating opportunities and creating your own demand and that is the control element of what we do even in a downturn. Right, as opposed to sitting back waiting for something to be built and asking you. So we asking you for a price, there is plenty to do in the world today, to go out and create an opportunity for return on investment for somebody. I think two as in a downturn and I said this very often, we fully expect both our service business and our performance contracting business to increase, because you have to maintain or extend asset life and a few - we no longer extend the asset life. We've got a way of paying for these assets through the energy savings that we're willing to guarantee as part of the asset swap. Operator : There are no further questions queued up at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Thank you, operator, I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. I apologize to anyone who is not able to answer - or get a question asked in the queue. However, Shane and I will be available all day today and obviously in the coming days and weeks to answer any questions that you may have. And we encourage you to call and we look forward to seeing on the road soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and then a Q&A session. At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com where you will find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. Also joining today's call is Chris Kuehn, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, who we recently announced will be succeeding Sue Carter as Chief Financial Officer after her planned retirement post-closing of the reverse Morris trust transaction with Gardner Denver in early 2020. With that, please go to slide three and I will turn the call over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks Zac and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. Before we begin today, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Sue for her many contributions to Ingersoll-Rand over the past six years as CFO. She has bee a terrific business partner and a leader of the finance organization and while we will miss her when she retires in the upcoming months, we certainly wish her well in her well-deserved retirement. I would like to welcome Chris Kuehn to the call as the future CFO of Trane Technologies. Chris has been a strong business partner and leader at Ingersoll-Rand since he joined the company five years ago. Execution of this succession plan is well underway in order to ensure a smooth transition and he is well-positioned for the role. Sue will be with us through the close of the RMT transaction and we are happy to have both Sue and Chris participate on the call today. Turning to slide three. I would like to start out today's call with a brief overview of our global business strategy that's enabling us to consistently deliver strong financial results for our shareholders. As we continue to progress toward the close of the RMT transaction and prepare a transition to a pure-play climate company, our strategy remains unchanged. At its core, our strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact, which are strong secular tailwinds for our business. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. At our core, we are focused on and excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Unless you think the world is getting cooler, less populated and less resource constrained as time passes, these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision. As we look back over the past several years, these secular tailwinds are only growing stronger and have a greater sense of urgency. Moving to slide four. Fiscal 2019 was a great year for Ingersoll-Rand with strong execution against all elements of our strategy. We delivered top quartile performance with organic revenue growth of 6%, 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation of $1.8 billion or 118% of adjusted net earnings. We established a leadership role in tackling the world's environmental and sustainability challenges by putting forth our aggressive 2030 sustainability commitments and we issued this challenge to like-minded companies in order to amplify progress towards a more sustainable future. We invested heavily on our core business, acquired Precision Flow Systems, entered into a game changing RMT transaction with Gardner Denver, repurchase $750 million in shares and continued to pay a strong dividend to our shareholders executing against all elements of our capital allocation strategy. The RMT transaction creates a leading industrial company. It also creates a world-class pure-play climate control business, which squarely focuses 100% of our portfolio on our sustainability strategy. Finally, we maintain very high employee engagement despite a rapidly changing environment with additional economic and geopolitical challenges ensuring Ingersoll-Rand remains a great place to work for our people. I am very proud of our teams for delivering these strong results for our customers and our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, our global end markets largely continued to be healthy with solid revenue growth across North America, Europe and China. We have highlighted North America commercial HVAC's growth as a standout all-year long and the fourth quarter was no exception. Year-over-year revenue growth was up high teens in the fourth quarter alone despite very tough comps in 2018. We have talked about the extraordinary transport business bookings growth in 2018 and the normalization process that's been occurring in 2019 with steep rates decline in transport bookings in every quarter. This has been a drag on topline enterprise bookings all year. So we have been providing bookings growth numbers excluding our TK business to help you understand the real underlying bookings of the enterprise or the climate business. I hope this information has been helpful to the investment community. In the fourth quarter, enterprise bookings were extremely strong excluding TK, up high civil digits. Climate bookings, excluding TK, were even stronger up low teens. Net, our underlying business remains very healthy. Our fourth quarter enterprise and climate leverage was lower than our guidance at the end of Q3. The lower leverage in the quarter was a result of three factors. First, revenue in our higher margin transport business declined high single digits in the quarter roughly $50 million deleveraging in line with gross margin rates. In addition, the combination of very strong commercial HVAC growth coupled with transport declines drove incremental negative portfolio mix. The second impact is a good news, bad news story. On the positive side, we had exceptional free cash flow in the fourth quarter that well exceeded our forecast. So on the flipside, we needed to accrue a substantial increase to our full year incentive compensation plans as a result, which impacted operating leverage. And lastly, we had some unplanned inventory adjustments in the fourth quarter. We know from your pre-call questions that the transport markets are in many people's minds, so we devoted a fair amount of discussion of this topic throughout the presentation and have a slide near the end. Throughout the year, we have talked about the significant declines in order rates expected in 2019 balanced against a very strong backlog we carried into the year. We expected that the net of the two factors combined with increasing cancellations in summer and fall will lead to a mid single digit revenue growth for 2019 and year-end backlog that returned to more normal levels. We highlighted that Europe was soft throughout 2019 and that we were largely in agreement with the ACT data, which was showing a correction in 2020 in North America trailer and that November and December 2019 and early 2020 market conditions and order rates are going to be important to really understand how the end of 2019 and 2020 might play out. We closed out 2019 with 3% revenue growth for transport. Overall market demand in November and December did not pick up as much of anticipated and fourth quarter revenue was weaker than expected as a result. This knocked a couple of points off our full year Thermo King growth. We believe the fourth quarter marked the first quarter of what ACT and others believe will be a relatively short-lived down cycle as the booking anomalies of 2018 and 2019 reset positioning the market for a flat or slightly positive growth profile for 2021. Our industrial businesses continued to execute very well in the fourth quarter. Our leaders remain focused on running the business and employee engagement remained strong, a testament to our culture and the strength of the businesses that will combine with Gardner Denver. In the fourth quarter, our industrial business saw strong margin expansion and a low single digit revenue decline. Good growth in small electric vehicles was offset by soft short cycle demand in compression technologies and industrial product. We are seeing excellent payback on the restructuring, operational and commercial investments we made in the business over the past few years as evidenced by our strong margin expansion in the quarter. We believe the business is well-positioned moving into 2020 and for combination with Gardner Denver. We continued our balanced capital allocation strategy throughout 2019 and in the fourth quarter. The strong free cash flow we are generating continues to provide us with good capital allocation optionality moving forward. Please go to slide five. We exceeded or delivered towards the high-end of the range against all of our guidance commitments for 2019 and delivered top quartile performance. Again, I am extremely proud of the entire Ingersoll-Rand team for their hard work and perseverance navigating through a very dynamic economic and geopolitical landscape in 2019. Please turn to slide six. As we continue to move closer to the close of the RMT transaction with Gardner Denver, we are excited and well-positioned to debut as Trane Technologies. 100% of our portfolio will be strategically focused on global megatrends and at the intersection of sustainability and advanced technology and innovation. All of our products and services are uniquely positioned to have a real and significant positive impact on reducing carbon emissions. We continue to compete in largely healthy end markets globally and our strategy provides tailwinds to grow faster than GDP. While we expect the transport markets will move through a short-term correction period, we believe this is a great business to be in over the long term. We expect the new Trane Technologies to continue to drive top quartile performance and we expect to deliver approximately 25% leverage in 2020 despite headwinds from our transport business. We are excited about the new Trane Technologies business and expect to host an Investor Day in the fall to lay out our long-term strategy and targets. Please turn to slide seven. This slide provides a visual depiction of organic bookings and revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The underlying climate business remains very strong with broad based bookings and revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions. Our compression technologies and industrial products businesses continued to be impacted by soft industrial short cycle spending while our small electric vehicle business has continued to deliver excellent growth. The headline enterprise bookings decline of negative 6% does not accurately reflect the underlying strength of the business. Enterprise bookings were up high single digits and climate bookings were up low teens respectively when you exclude transport and the very large quarter four 2018 commercial HVAC order. Please turn to slide eight. This slide combines our quarter four growth performance with our preliminary view of our major end markets for 2020. I have covered the main points regarding fourth quarter growth on the prior slide, so I will focus my comments on our preliminary 2020 market outlook. Our global commercial HVAC outlook continues to be positive. Leading economic indicators remain largely supportive of continued market growth in 2020, albeit slower growth than in 2019. We are expecting to see low single digit market growth for global HVAC with North American office, government, education and industrial markets, all healthy. In the residential HVAC market, which is the North American market for us, we are expecting to see low single digit market growth led by continued growth in the replacement markets, which is approximately 80% of our business today. Economic indicators are also largely supporting continued growth. As I discussed earlier, ACT, other data sources globally and our internal estimates point transport markets moving through a relatively short term down cycle in 2020 and more stable market in 2021. I will cover this in more detail later in the presentation. Relative to the industrial markets, we continue to see impacts of soft short cycle CapEx spending in the fourth quarter, partially offset by solid growth in small electric vehicles. We expect this to continue through the first quarter of 2020. Through focused execution of our business strategy, we expect our businesses to grow faster than each of the major market growth expectations just outlined. I now turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Sue Carter : Thank you Mike. Please go to slide number nine. I will begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, fourth quarter organic revenues were particularly strong in our climate segment with consistent focus on sustainability and energy efficiency for our customers. Our climate segment delivered organic revenue growth of 7%, compounding on 9% growth in 2018. Climate orders were also strong, up low teens, when excluding our transport business that saw outsized order growth throughout 2018 and the approximately $200 million large commercial HVAC order that we specifically called out in the fourth quarter of 2018. In our industrial segment, organic revenues were down 2% on a tough year-over-year comp of 6% in 2018. Small electric vehicles delivered continued revenue growth, which was offset by revenue declines in the soft industrial short cycle markets we mentioned previously. Our team delivered exceptional free cash flow in 2019, up 118% of adjusted net earnings. We have delivered free cash flow in excess of adjusted net earnings consistently over time with a five year average of 107%. Adjusted earnings per share was up 6% versus the year ago period building on 29% growth in 2018. EPS growth was driven by operational performance in both our climate and industrial segments. Importantly, we remain focused on deploying excess capital on our best ROI investments for our shareholders. After reinvesting in our core business through expense in capital in 2019, we deployed $510 million in dividends, $750 million in share repurchases and entered into or completed four acquisitions totaling more than $1.5 billion including Precision Flow Systems and the pending RMT transaction with Gardner Denver. Moving into 2020 and beyond, we expect to continue to generate powerful free cash flow and execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy, deploying 100% of excess cash over time. Please go to slide 10. Stepping back from the details for a moment, Q4 was another strong quarter capping of a year of top quartile performance. In the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 10 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 6%. Please go to slide number 11. As mentioned previously, our industrial segment delivered strong margin expansion through productivity, operational improvements and restructuring savings. When coupled with the strong revenue growth in our climate segment, we delivered another quarter of strong operating income and EPS growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter corporate costs were higher than prior year, primarily due to two impacts. First, the timing of functional spend was higher in Q4 2019 than in 2018. Second, we achieved stronger-than-expected free cash flow performance in Q4, which increased our 2019 free cash flow conversion beyond our already strong forecast of 105% of net earnings to our actual results of 118%. Free cash flow conversion is one of our most important long term financial metrics for a healthy company and it plays a central role in our incentive compensation design. Net, the strong performance is great to see and a testament to the hard work by our employees globally. On the flipside, it costs just a little more in incentive compensation and it was a full year true-up, taken as a lump sum in the fourth quarter. Lastly, our effective tax rate in the quarter of 20% was in line with third quarter guidance but up versus the low 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Please go to slide number 12. Before discussing the elements of our margin bridge today, I would like to highlight that we made one modification to what you have seen previously. We have separated volume from mix and combined mix with price, material inflation and tariffs. We believe this is a clear way to visualize the margin bridge. As this is a bit different than you may be accustomed to, I would like to take a couple of minutes walking you through the modification and why combining mix, price and material inflation and tariffs is a positive adjustment. Since late 2016, we have seen tremendous amount of material inflation and tariffs that have been fast-moving and volatile. To offset the massive material inflation and tariffs, we have realized price increases in the neighborhood of five times historical levels. At the same time, our business has been growing at very high rates and we have a large percentage of business that is not driven off of a price list. The line between mix and price and inflation is thin already and it has become more difficult to break mix and price apart at the level we have been providing on these bridges. For example, when we create a configured system for high-rise in New York, that system is unique to that building. Since we have detailed tracking of input costs to calculate inflation, when gross margins on the project are better than the project on the street, the question we must answer is whether the margin improvement is because we priced the project better or if it's better mix because we utilized higher margin components in the system. To be clear, we are confident we delivered strong price cost in the quarter completing our seventh consecutive quarter of positive price cost. We also delivered strong margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter. Negative product mix more than offset price cost as we continue to deliver outsized growth from our commercial HVAC equipment as compared to revenue declines in higher margin products like transport and short cycle compressors and industrial products. Productivity versus other inflation was flat in the quarter. Our segments delivered solid productivity from operational excellence and restructuring savings. The savings were offset by the previously mentioned incentive compensation increases and climate segment year-end inventory adjustments following an ERP implementation and footprint optimization projects. We continue to invest heavily in growth and operating expense reduction projects with high returns on investment. Please go to slide 13. Our climate segment delivered another quarter of solid organic revenue growth. Consistent with our expectations, we delivered strong volume growth, price realization and productivity. As previously mentioned, operating leverage was below expectations, primarily due to the deleverage on transport revenue declines and the year-end true-ups we mentioned on the previous slide. Please go to slide 14. In our industrial segment, organic revenues were down 2% on a tough year-over-year comp of 6% in 2018. Strong revenue growth in small electric vehicles was offset by revenue declines in a soft industrial short cycle market we mentioned previously. Over the past several years, we have built a stronger, more resilient industrial business. Despite organic revenue declines in the quarter, our industrial segment expanded adjusted operating margins by 240 basis points through productivity programs, operational improvements and restructuring savings. The combination of our operating margin improvement efforts with our PFS acquisition expanded EBITDA margins 350 basis points in the quarter. Please go to slide 15. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We continue to make strategic investments in acquisitions that further improve long term shareholder returns. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. With the proposed transaction with Gardner Denver growing closer, I remind you that we expect to maintain our annualized dividend of $2.12 per share post-closing and through 2020. This will deliver an attractive dividend yield for Trane Technologies. For 2021 and beyond, we will evaluate dividend increases in line with earnings growth and consistent with our long-standing capital deployment priorities. As we look forward to 2020, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy. We remain enthusiastic about the future opportunities to deploy excess capital to the best ROI investments, whether that be reinvestment in the business, a strong dividend, making value accretive strategic acquisitions or repurchasing shares. Please go to slide 17. Anticipating the reverse Morris trust transaction will closed early this year, I will spend a few minutes walking you through a high level 2020 outlook for Trane Technologies. After the proposed transaction closes, we anticipate the newly combined industrial business to provide guidance, including our industrial segment. Given the market backdrop Mike outlined earlier, we expect total reported and organic revenues to be up 3% to 5% in 2020 and broadly healthy HVAC end markets. During 2019, our climate segment delivered 40 basis points of margin expansion. In 2020, on an apples-to-apples basis, we expect to further expand segment margins between 30 and 70 basis points. In the first quarter, we anticipate solid revenue growth in our HVAC business offset by steep declines in our transport business creating continued mix headwinds. Mike will outline our transport outlook in more detail later in the presentation. Apples-to-apples unallocated corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $260 million including stranded costs previously allocated to our industrial segment. I will explain more about our stranded cost outlook later in the presentation. For modeling purposes, we also offer the following items. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $300 million. We estimate interest expense to be approximately $240 million reflecting debt retirement of $600 million in the May timeframe. We are targeting free cash flow to be greater than 100% of net earnings with capital expenditures approximating 1% to 2% of revenues. And we have modeled $500 million in share repurchases. And now I would like to cover two topics of interest with you. Please go to slide 19. We often get questions about the status of the proposed industrial segment reverse Morris trust transaction. We have covered most of this slide throughout the presentation so I will cover a few points here. Entering 2020, we anticipate one time separation and transaction costs to be at the high-end of our previously communicated range of $150 million to $200 million. During 2019, we spent approximately $95 million and we expect to spend the rest in the next few months. We continue to execute our detailed project plans to carry out all of the separation and integration planning and transformation work. Given that we and Gardner Denver continue to operate as two separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction, much of the integration and transformation work ramps after the deal closes. Last month, we announced that our pure-play sustainability focused climate company will be named Trane Technologies, pending shareholder approval. We expect Trane Technologies to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as TT and we plan to host our first Trane Technologies Investor Day in the fall of this year. In contemplating the timing of our Investor Day, we recognize that 2020 is the third year of the three-year financial targets we set at our Investor Day in mid-2017. Today we are giving guidance for the final year, which will complete that three-year plan. Additionally, between now and the time of the Investor Day, we will close the transaction, begin operating as two separate companies, file the appropriate historical financial statements and give you a chance to analyze a couple of quarters of reporting under our new segment structure. With those tasks complete and 2020 performance well underway, we will be in a position to give long term financial targets and further outline Trane Technologies' continued strategy at Investor Day. Please go to slide 20. We also get questions about the stranded costs associated with the RMT transaction and how to model the savings for new Trane Technologies. With that in mind, I will walk you through the math illustrated in the chart at the bottom of the slide. Starting from the left, our 2020 unallocated corporate cost guide was $250 million at the time of the agreement. At the time we also estimated approximately $50 million of allocated corporate costs were being absorbed by our industrial segment that were not specific to industrial. In addition, we are targeting $50 million of cost reduction for a total of $100 million of stranded costs. To make the math simple, we have shown a rebaseline totaling $300 million that includes both the unallocated costs and the cost currently allocated to the industrial segment. Our guidance for 2020 unallocated corporate cost of $260 million reflects a $40 million reduction in stranded costs, netted against the $300 million rebaseline corporate costs. To be clear, these cost reductions may come from corporate or from the climate businesses. We are presenting guidance in this way to give you easily comparable climate margin and corporate cost targets for modeling our 2020 outlook. As we move to 2021, we plan to remove an additional $60 million from either corporate or the climate businesses to achieve our full $100 million stranded cost reduction target. To realize these stranded cost reductions, we expect to spend approximately $100 million to 150 million. We will provide quarterly updates on our stranded cost reduction progress. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks Sue. Please go to slide 21. The last topic of interest is related to transport refrigeration. While this is a preliminary view based on available forecast and our internal estimates, I will cover both what we are currently anticipating for the major end markets for the transport business and what we expect to see for our Thermo King business specifically. Given the complexity of this topic, we have significantly expanded the level of disclosure on our TK business for the purpose of this discussion. We hope this will be useful in better understanding our outlook for the market and for our TK business. We expect the transport markets to move through a short-term correction period in 2020. We are expecting to see steep declines in North American trailer and APU and mid single digit declines in truck. These businesses account for approximately 40% of our TK business. We currently expect the decline to be most significant in the first quarter where the market faces tougher comparisons to solid growth in the first quarter of 2019 which remains challenging throughout 2020. We are also expecting to see a high single digit decline in our European, Middle East and Africa trailer business with a steep decline in the first half of the year and recovery in the second half. The truck business in EMEA is expected to be lumpy but flat for the overall year. What's shown as the all other market for TK reflects aftermarket parts, marine, bus, rail, air in a few of the relatively smaller regional markets where market forecasts are not as robust as North America or Europe. However, for these markets, we are currently expecting modest growth of low single digit to mid single digit growth in 2020. We believe we have the opportunity to outperform the overall markets in 2020, in part by leveraging the 40% of our business that is in markets where modest growth is expected. We believe we have opportunities to significantly outperform in areas such as aftermarket parts where consumption increases in a down cycle and in APU, where we continued our successful strategy to improve our bolt-on rate beyond current levels. We also anticipate outperforming the overall trailer and truck markets in both North America and EMEA through innovation and new product launches and where we see opportunities for share growth. The situation is obviously fluid in transport refrigeration and we are closely tracking order rates and other market indicators to improve our line of sight into 2020 moving forward. At the present time, however, we are guiding for quarter one TK revenues to be down somewhere in the 20% range and for 2020 TK revenues be down in the 5% to 10% range. Please go to slide 22. 2019 was another year of top quartile financial performance with strong revenue growth, EPS growth and free cash flow. Looking forward, we believe the company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Fundamentally, we excel where global megatrends and sustainability intersect with our innovation and capabilities. Today, 15% of the world's carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings and other 8% comes from global food loss. And these numbers are growing. We are continually innovating to bend the curve on global warming. By 2030, we will reduce our customers' carbon emissions by one gigaton by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated food, medicines and other perishables. We have been heavily investing for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do. We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top-tier shareholder returns over the years. And lastly, we are extremely excited about the pending RMT transaction and the strategic combination of our industrial segment with Gardner Denver. Combining two of the premier complementary industrial businesses offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies supported by secular growth trends and diverse end market exposures. And personally, I couldn't be more excited about creating a premier pure-play HVAC and transport refrigeration company as Trane Technologies. Our climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance and we see significant opportunity as a pure-play to build on this performance for our people, customers and shareholders. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning Steve. Sue Carter : Good morning. Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Just a question on the kind of timing of everything that's happening here. I think you might have touched on an update but when would you expect to kind of have a little bit of a deeper dive on the new TT business, from an Investor Day perspective? Sue Carter : So Steve, it's Sue. And Chris can join in with that. The first thing we are going to do is, finish off the very detailed work that's going on right now on the separation of the industrial businesses and then start building off of the base that we have got. We will have to go through and issue some historical financial statements and then transition into that. But Chris, your phone? Chris Kuehn : Sure. Hi Steve. Good to meet you here virtually over the phone. To Sue's point, I think there is a fair amount of effort still left to get done. We are on track for the RMT closure to be completed here in early 2020. But right after we do complete separation, we have got some requirements to restate some prior year financial statements and I would expect around that time, we would provide more information around the historical view of Trane Technologies at that point. I think from Investor Day perspective, we are targeting kind of that September timeframe with respect to giving us a chance of having a couple of quarters of closes under the new Trane Technologies structure and then be ready to walk with a little more details here in the fall. Mike Lamach : Steve, this is Mike here. Just one second, Steve. I would say that just from an internal planning perspective, once we filed all that we need to file around the restated financials, targeting something like a five to 10 day period after that, after you have digested it, to come back and provide more guidance. And so, we will likely structure our call, put a presentation together and lay out the 2020 guidance. And then we will reserve until the Investor Day, report back on the last three years and then restate going forward likely another three-year view for Trane Technologies through 2023. Steve Tusa : Okay. And thanks for the color on all the TK moving parts. When will you expect the orders comp to get easier? Is that kind of a -- just remind us when you would think these order should bottom out? Mike Lamach : Yes. Steve, the way our revenue bottoms out, first I would say that you are probably just going to see the bottom in both Europe and North America in the first quarter and then it's going to still be negative obviously as you can see from the graphs we have on slide 21 of the deck for the balance of the year. But from a bookings perspective, you recover obviously a little bit quicker than that. Although there is a fair amount of book in turn, I think that will happen in the business and so the comps get easy third, typically fourth quarter. So second, third and fourth quarter, you get to see bookings. I think, improving. Revenue progressively improves throughout the year in both regions. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Mike Lamach : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning and thanks Sue for all the help. Maybe just a question around the climate revenue growth. Just wondered, within that low single digit commercial HVAC market assumption for 2020, what are you assuming for Asia given orders were down through most of 2019? And how much of a jump in the U.S. do you think you will have this year after such a good 2019? Mike Lamach : Yes. Julian, I want to be very careful not to mix market expectations versus our internal businesses. So the market, I think that North America remains very healthy. We will see growth across the board equipment, parts and services. I think that we feel good about what will happen in institutional, particularly education and healthcare. We expect industrial and commercial also remain healthy. And then if I translate to our internal view in North America as an example, we end the year at 17% high teens kind of backlog over the prior year. So the setup for us and the setup for the market look pretty good. In Europe, where you have got the sort of flattish expectation in 2020 and still some lingering Brexit execution uncertainties, we will continue to outgrow the market as we have been really based on the whole sort of sustainability focus and the go-to-market strategy that we have had there. So we expect to grow the market at least a multiple of two or three there, I would assume, off a very slow growth in the underlying market in Europe. Middle East, Africa HVAC is going to be positive but the patterns are always lumpy because particularly in the Middle East, these orders tend to be large district cooling plants. And so they are very large orders when they come and so you get a little bit of an anomaly there. And then actually healthy growth in China and for the AP region in general. And again here, the backlog that we have got in China, fourth quarter versus prior fourth quarter, is up low double digits. So a good set up for us coming into 2020. So we feel pretty good about what's happening in the commercial HVAC space. And residential, similar view, 80% of the market for us is replacement. Underlying markets still look good. Consumer confidence still remains relatively high. U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. Unemployment is low. GDP is stable. So pricing remains healthy. I think the market there appears to be pretty solid going into 2020. Julian Mitchell : Thanks, Mike, for all the color. And then just my second question around climate margins. Just looking at your margin guide for the segment for 2020, backing out what you are saying for Thermo King or transport, it implies the non-transport piece margins are up maybe 80 basis points or so in 2020. Just wanted to check that was roughly in line with what you were thinking and to what degree you think that number is backend loaded, again excluding transport? Mike Lamach : Yes. I mean, at starting point I will let Sue and Chris chime in, but you really end up with a pretty low quarter four to comp that we just completed when you think about most of those impacts really were center hit on the commercial HVAC markets. And so the roadmap we have got here is still a strong pricing environment, probably a moderating materials environment. Our productivity pipeline looks robust. It should cover all inflation. Volume should drop through to gross margins. We don't see anything there. And we don't see a repeat issues that would done in the fourth quarter. I mean obviously we talked about the silver lining perhaps and the cash conversion, but some of the inventory adjustments were partially result of just an immense amount of the factory consolidations that were done starting in 2018 and through 2019 and those don't repeat. That smoothes out as well. So I feel like we are in great shape on commercial. I think residential continues to hum along. A good data conversion there. I don't see any changes there. And even in a market like Latin America, we had great success in 2019. It appears to be recovering, particularly Brazil I would highlight. Margins there are good for us and I think that can help contribute as well. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning John. Chris Kuehn : Good morning. John Walsh : And I will echo the sentiment. I thank you too, Sue, for all the help. Sue Carter : Thank you John. John Walsh : Sure. I wanted to maybe get a mark-to-market on where we stand with kind of the controls and the connected buildings platform. You know, I know last time I think we got update on that revenue base. It was north of $1 billion and you guys used to throw out some metrics around the number of connected buildings or the portfolios of buildings that you are monitoring. Can you kind of mark-to-market us on that? Mike Lamach : Yes. John, I would start with the caveat that if a company can actually tell you the revenue generation from a digital business, they probably don't have a digital strategy because the whole strategy really hits every bit of the value stream from the way that you design and develop systems to not fail all the way through to the way you monetize offerings in the service business through to the way that you utilize fixed service contracts, fixed service agreements to deliver service in more creative and better ways for the customer. So you put that all together and it's in everything that we are doing. So it continues to be the norm. I would say, 100% of what we are shipping out in the applied space today is absolutely communicating. If not inside the customers' firewall, it's coming across to us with important data. We are acting on it. At last count, I think we monetized in our commercial space alone about 20 different offerings that we put together in that space that use digital to monetize. Same thing will hold through to TK. Interesting with TK, I am just going to kind of maybe skip to this as there is a little bit of a story here. When you look at ACT's 2020 forecast of 37,500 units, we look at the replacement of units on the road today in North America and we get to a number of about 35,000 units. I mean you can think about more than 90% of the market ACT is representing could be counted just through replacing units. Well, natural part of the reason that we know where these units are and whether or not they are a candidate for replacement would be through things like the telematics that would tell us how systems are operating. And so that's is a great example of how the game really changes when you have a got a complete digital strategy across these businesses. John Walsh : Got you. Thanks for that color. And then, you know, just looking at the investment in other line, obviously you covered a little bit in the prepared remarks. But you know that's been a long time since we have seen that flat. You have the comment saying gross investment spending remains at high levels. As we think about 2020 and beyond, does that flip back to be a headwind? Or are you kind of plateauing right now on how you are thinking about your investment spending? Mike Lamach : Well, we are coming through some really major platform investments and a multiyear investment for Thermo King, let's just say in particular. That's going to tend to kind of flatten out there but likely not in the Trane business, particularly with some of the regulatory changes that will happen between now and 2023. So it's at a very high rate. A good estimate for 2020 is probably you know as low as 20 bips of incremental and maybe as high as 50 bips of incremental that will go into the Trane Technologies portfolio for 2020. Sue Carter : John, I will also add that as you think about those investments, that's such a huge part of the capital allocation strategy and what we do with the business that we are a great generator of cash. We have processes throughout the company with investment review boards looking at various and sundry things. We want our businesses to bring us great ROI projects that continue our growth and continue the great capital allocation strategy that we have got. So as you think about Trane Technologies going forward, I see that great cash generation as an opportunity and a way to really do great capital allocation with investing in the businesses. And I think that should continue and I think you would want that to continue. Chris Kuehn : I will just affirm here, Sue, this is Chris, that it will continue that way knowing that we have a strong free cash from generator in Trane Technologies and we will be following those similar priorities for capital deployment. John Walsh : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks and good luck, Sue. Sue Carter : Thank you. Jeff Sprague : I appreciate all the help. Two questions on TK. First, just aftermarket in general. Has it been your experience historically that when you get into OE equipment downdrafts that aftermarket actually does grow? Certainly we have seen in machinery and equipment markets that aftermarket doesn't turn out to be quite as countercyclical as people would have hoped. So I would imagine, it would typically decline less, but as a question is, does it actually tend to grow in those down cycles? Mike Lamach : Yes. Jeff, there is a number of things that I think that we can count on and in some ways try to control even with a trailer decline forecast for 2020 and that's one of them. So if the standard aftermarket growth rates would be something kind of in the normalized 3% to 5% range, as an example, if all 35,000 North American units that are probably up for replacement wouldn't be replaced which would be an extreme view, you would likely see something in the high single digits. Our experience has been something maybe 8% to 10% if that were to be the case. So that tends to always pan its way out. The other thing that is interesting, when you look auxiliary power unit bolt-on rate, I think in 2016 we were talking about something in the 10% to 11% bolt-on rate there. And we said, look, we think we can move this thing and for every 2.4 units of APUs we sell, it equates to one trailer unit. That was a strategy to help us through 2016 and 2017. We actually have increased that bolt-on rate by 10 points. So we ended the year in the low 20s. The remarkable thing about that is that's with the denominator, right, increasing dramatically in terms of the what was built in terms of OEM tractors put out into the marketplace. Other interesting thing there is the replacements factor that we see out there for APUs going into 2020 is roughly 102,000 units that are available. That's compared to a 99,000 unit market. So here you have got a replacement rate opportunity that's actually bigger than a new complete. So you know by taking the same experience we have around bolt-on rates moving three, four points a year, with even a more aged APU fleet out there, that's an opportunity for us. The NPD launch as I have I talked to the new platforms should be good and we have worked three years to get these things ready for the market. And as I said in my remarks, truck, bus, rail, those will all grow too. Small truck in particular. Bus, rail, all will grow too. So those are sort of factors that we can count on I think in 2020. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then just a follow-up on slide 21. I appreciate you trying to help us here and that you are noting the scale isn't exact. But the position of the plus 20 and the minus 40 looks pretty proportional to where the zero is, right. And so everything on that chart with the exception of APU looks like it's down less than 20% with all other actually positive. So just a little unclear how or why you would be guiding Q1 down 20% in aggregate? Mike Lamach : I can't speak of the scale. Maybe Zac or Shane, who drew the scale can talk to that. Zac Nagle : Yes. I mean, Jeff, the market will be down close to 30% for trailers in the first quarter, North America trailers. Europe trailers, a similar number. APUs would be down 35% to 40% range. So that's really how you get there. Balance of the market being the other 40%. So it's really the decline in the areas that really outgrew in the fourth quarter of 2018, which were trailer and APUs. And those are down right now. That's the reason Jeff Sprague : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. Sue, thanks for all your help. Sue Carter : Thanks Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, you have been talking about your focus on sustainability and improving efficiency for a long time now. But given the continued strong bookings, especially North American commercial HVAC, are you just seeing more awareness and acceptance of your HVAC systems capability, especially in markets like office and education to help meet your customers' sustainability goals as they look to replace their equipment? And is that allowing the business to increasingly look better than the macro data that we see, like construction starts? Mike Lamach : Yes. I mean first of all, it's a passion inside the company. What I am telling around company purpose is something that gets deeply ingrained and even how investments and projects get evaluated because that's how we think we are going to win the marketplace. And so it's very tied out in terms of how we deploy goals and how we look at products going forward. So that, for sure, I think is a critical factor in all of this. When you look at some of the Dodge data as an example and the Put-in-place which people look to, it's interesting and I am just going to talk obviously about North America here which is where the Dodge data is more relevant. You take our commercial business and you split it right down the middle 50-50 between equipments and services, the 50% that's equipment you get 60% to 70% of that which is replacement which generally is not ever going to be reported on Dodge Put-in-place because we are negotiating service agreements, service contracts, retrofits. So that really only has the Dodge Put-in-place data addressing about 15% to 20% of the business. And so as folks try to read through that to our commercial business on Dodge data or ABI data, you are probably only predicting 15% to 20% of what that looks like. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, thanks for that. And then just following up on some of the comments you made on China commercial HVAC. If I look at the bookings, they look like they turned down a little in Q4. But you mentioned backlogs up low double digits. So was it just kind of timing? Can you give more color on China? I assume you continue to grow service penetration. What particular end markets are helping you in China? Mike Lamach : Well, first of all, when we talk about Asia in particular, we have to remember that China sort of half of the business and the rest is the rest of the region. China was actually relatively strong. Bookings looked okay. Backlog, as I mentioned, up double digit year-over-year. And so a lot of weakness was outside of China and I think in some ways you see those markets recovering. You can think about electronics in South Korea. You can think about those sorts of markets which were pretty tough. But we expect healthy growth in China and for the region in 2020. Strength in healthcare and we think a rebound in some of technology segments, where we have been a big player historically. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congratulations to both Sue and Chris. Sue, you will be missed for sure. Sue Carter : Thank you Joe. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Joe Ritchie : So maybe just my first question just following up on that China question. Mike, clearly you guys have done a great job growing into Tier 3, Tier 4 cities and the attachment rates. Obviously a lot of concern right now, given the virus outbreak. I am curious, as you look forward and you think about like previous times, whether it's SARS impacting your business. Have you seen any impact at all at this juncture from the virus? And how has this kind of played out for you guys historically? Mike Lamach : Well, first of all, we have no impact yet to employees, which is fortunate. I think we have sent 650,000 masks, is what I saw, to China. So we are trying to do our part there on that. I would tell you that what we believe, we know today is that best case would be China essentially going back to work on February 10. This is sort of the market in general and sort of our business as well. So if that's the case, I mean you are talking about really a week of production and that's just going to get pushed. I mean that demand is there. It will get pushed out. Maybe it will get absorbed in the quarter if it's possible to do, if not it will get pushed to the second quarter. So it's fluid. We are watching it closely. We are looking at the supply chain as well. We generally have strong supply chains. We generally tend to work in region for region. But to the extent we have got any Chinese components being imported, say, into the U.S. or Europe, we are generally keeping those cases eight to 10 weeks of inventory on hand. So again, a one week or two week issue is not going to be a problem for us with regard to that. But Joe, it's fluid and I am hoping that this thing contained and best case looks to be people are back to work February 10. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That's helpful color, Mike. And then maybe just my follow-up here. Slide 21, super helpful. So nice job, Zac and Shane. Just curious, as you kind of think about the climate business ex-transport, is there anything we need to be aware of from either growth and margin standpoint as you think about cadence for 2020? Mike Lamach : None that I can think of. Guys, anybody have any color on that? Sue Carter : No. The way I was thinking about, Joe, is as think about the markets, when you think about HVAC with commercial and residential, it's going to follow the same cadence that it has historically followed with Q2 and Q3 being our stronger quarters. So I think that stays in line with what we are doing. We do think that Q1 is going to be a quarter where the volume is tough in buildings. So I think that one is an area where you can think about Q1 maybe not quite being at historical levels of contribution. The other thing that I would say and I sound like I just think about cash, but I think as you think about climate in Trane Technologies, we talked about this at the time of the standup, we believe that we are still going to generate 100% or greater than net income over time in the climate business. It does tend to be a little more back half loaded than what we have seen. Although I am sort of laughing because we did have such a huge fourth quarter for cash flow this year. But I think that's one of the impacts that you might see. So revenue sort of following normal patterns other than the TK guide that we have already talked about and cash flow more backend loaded. Mike Lamach : Yes. And I will say, Joe, is that, going back to commercial with North America which has been just incredibly strong and it's strong across the board meaning that even the unitary and services growth have been double. Units have been in the teens. But the applied growth has been extraordinary. The winter rates there, the pull-through of systems has been excellent. Now that does initially book and ship at generally lower margins than the unitary business, but of course you get the long service tail on the applied business. So in the long run, it's a great business. It's a win. But it does put a little bit of mix pressure within train and commercial and that again as one is those mix pressures we saw in quarter four as well. And so historically I usually get the question and I didn't it so far. But I will talk about it. We end up historically something in the 15% range of Q1 EPS for the total year and last three years has been that. Six years has been a little bit lower than that. I would tell you, sort of a safer guide here would be something between 14% and 15% just as a result of that strong mix differential between applied unitary and between the TK and Trane. Joe Ritchie : Yes. Twosome must have been caught off guard. So thanks for all the color. Zac Nagle : Yes. Just to add to that, since we are guiding OI at this point, I would say, the average for OI for climate as a percentage of the year has been in the 15% range. It will probably be in the 14% to 15% range this year. So a little lighter in the first quarter. Mike Lamach : Thanks Zac. I am so used to EPS after all this time that we are going to get to talk about OI. Joe Ritchie : Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Hi. Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Sue, it was such a pleasure working with you, I think, actually with multiple companies. So congrats and good luck. Sue Carter : Thank you Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question, you know, residential construction, can you just walk us through your framework? How much visibility do you think on resi conception cycle over the next several years? And what gives you confidence that they will continue sort of to be positive? Mike Lamach : Andy, it's such a small part of kind of what drives our business that we would far from be the experts on giving you a forecast there. And if you think about the res equipment business being probably 10% of the company going forward and you think about 80% of our business there being replacement, new construction doesn't move the needle one way or the other for us really in a residential market. So I would probably defer to some of better forecast that are out there on that one than tell you that we have got a good read on that. Andrew Obin : Yes. I was just asking more as a leading indicator for non-res. Another question I have for you, how should we think about the Trane's market share over the next couple of years? You have done a fantastic job. So how sustainable it is? And what are the headwinds? Mike Lamach : Well, I mean, when we guide, we are generally guiding on, we think the market is going to be pricing, some sense of volume, some sense of mix. We always target our teams with market share and margin expansion. So the goal there is always higher than what you see and I think that's a healthy thing for us do. I feel really good about what's coming out in the marketplace. I feel good about a lot of the training and development we have had around the company in terms systems, sales and some of the more sophisticated offerings that we do around services. So I feel like it's lot of ways to win. It's not always on the product technology, although we are a leader there and that's a heavy part of the investment but it's also in the way that you go to market in a way that the expertise gets played out in the channel. And as you think about, I have always said in the commercial space, these are always going to be people that are 100% dedicated on behalf of the company. This is not something where you see distributors doing for us. That's such an important thing when you are trying to drive an overall system strategy and trying to sell total cost of ownership over the long run, it's a sophisticated sale generally done by very technical people and we have been it for a long time. And that's something that's very difficult to replicate and something we always invest in that capability. That's a big part of the secret sauce, I guess, of the business. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Operator : And that's all the time we have for questions today. I will turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : I like to thank everyone for joining on today's call and to remind everyone that we will be available for questions as always today and in the coming days and then we look forward to connecting with you soon on the road, in upcoming conferences and roadshows. Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Vik Kini, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Vikram Kini : Thank you. And welcome to the Ingersoll-Rand 2020 first quarter earnings call. I'm Vik Kini, Ingersoll-Rand's Investor Relations leader and with me today are Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer and Emily Weaver, Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release which was issued this morning and a supplemental presentation, which will be referenced during the call, are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this morning's conference call will be available later today. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. For more details on these risks, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our current report on Form 8-K filed with the securities exchange commission on May 1st, 2020, which are available on our website at www.irco.com. Additional disclosure regarding forward looking statements are included on slide two of the presentation. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our release, which are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will also remind everyone that in both our earnings release and today's presentation, we've included both as-reported financials and supplemental financial information to assist with analysis and comparatives. The as-reported financials only include the Ingersoll-Rand industrial segment results from the closing date of the transaction on February 29th, 2020 and the supplemental financial information provides results as the transaction had occurred as of January 1st, 2018 to provide a full quarter of comparable results. Turning to slide three, on today's call, we will provide an update on the top priorities of the company in the current operating environment as well as review our first quarter total company and segment highlights. We will conclude today's call with a Q&A session. As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. At this time, I will now turn it over to Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer. Vicente Reynal : Thanks Vik and good morning to everyone on the call. I would like to kick-off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by COVID-19 and all the dedicated healthcare workers, first responders, and volunteers who are on the frontlines all over the world battling this pandemic. I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll-Rand employees around the world. The pictures on slide four are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce who have adapted to the realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers. Every day I hear a new example of our businesses providing mission-critical products to our customers. And I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times. While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future, one thing I am sure about is that Ingersoll-Rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities and serving our customers at the center of everything we do and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees. Moving to slide five, I would like to ground everyone on the critical priorities we're following during these challenging times. When we close the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated that within a matter of weeks, we will be dealing with a global pandemic, causing disruptions to our customers, supply chain, and the day-to-day operations of the company. Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us plan, accelerate, and adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities. First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers, and the community. Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain times. And finally, continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation. The strength of Ingersoll-Rand team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more unified company. The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine, then we call IRX, are really at the heart of how we operate as a company, especially in these unprecedented times. During the integration process, we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose. One that is centered around our stakeholders, where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better. This purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams live on a daily basis, creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company and the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll-Rand execution excellence process. The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll-Rand. Turning to slide seven, I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis, since it has been swift and focused around two major components. First is a health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities. And second, business continuity not only within operations, but across a larger supply chain. Starting first with health and safety, we activated our COVID-19 task force in February, and had a full coordinated company approach in early March, just weeks after the creation of the new company. Our execution approach has served us very well as we're able to quickly implement enhance site safety protocols and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely. And it is very encouraging that our quick actions have been successful as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base. But it's more than just implementing safety protocols. It's also about supporting and engaging the employee base. As a result, we have implemented a number of measures, including a global outreach program to solicit employee feedback. Our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas. Not only did our team volunteered to take individual pay cuts, furloughs, and forego vacation time this year. They have thoughtful in depth suggestions, many of which we're actively implementing today. From a business continuity perspective, starting first with our operations, as we've previously communicated, we have seen plans largely in China, Italy, and India, impacted due to COVID-19. China was largely impacted in the month of January in February and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April, as things are now largely back to normal. Italy and India saw about a two-month lag to China, with operations being impacted in late March and into April. And in these times, our sites around the globe are 98% operational, with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work. The supply chain has seen a similar trend, as the impact in China is largely behind those and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues. The Americas and EMEA regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online. In the past few weeks, we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half, which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible. Much like our operations, India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain. And we expect situation to improve in the latter half of May, when governmental restrictions begin to ease. We're addressing the current environment head-on by actively managing those areas within our control. So, let me tell you about what we're doing here. Starting with slide eight, through the use of IRX, we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over $350 million with increases across all major saving categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity. As a reminder, we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost synergies of approximately $250 million by the end of year three after closing. We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energies and the associated stand-up of the new company. As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters, this phasing of synergy delivery was always an area, we believe, we could accelerate based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done. We have dramatically increased the pace, having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions with approximately $70 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020. The majority of these savings are coming from headcount actions already taken in the past two months, as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization. In addition, we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiatives with RFQs for nearly one-third of our historical direct materials spend base already launched, as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed. In total, we're now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020, which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of 10% to 15% realization. We're keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three-year timeframe at this time to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and i2V, given the current environment. It is not only the structural cost that we have taken out, but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short-term cost reductions to protect margins. So, let's move to slide nine to talk about that. In Q1, despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis, we were able to limit adjusted EBITDA decrementals to less than 30% with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments. We expect that these additional actions would yield $40 million to $50 million of incremental cost savings in the P&L this year with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter. We will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if demand environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year, we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly. While we're making some tough decisions to control cost, one area that we are not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise. Much like we did back in 2015 at Gardner Denver, when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains and new product opportunities, we're following the same playbook today. Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as Demand Generation and our IoT platforms. This is all part of the strategy to play offense now, especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration. Moving to slide 10, let me talk about liquidity. The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. At the time of the merger, we took the opportunity to reprice our legacy debt for placing the new $1.9 billion term loan to close the transaction. All of our debt is a term loan B structure with very attractive pricing as the U.S. components are LIBOR plus 175 and the euro component is a Euribor plus 200. The Term Loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective and there are no maturities until 2027. Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion as we finished the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet and over a $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities. As we look ahead, we continue to see several opportunities to unlock cash as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity. Opportunities exists across working capital and cash taxes and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense in the second half of the year as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by September of 2020. Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper, we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles, given the attractive rate and covenant environment. Turning to slide 11, our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering. You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy as we're building the culture of Ingersoll-Rand with our employees at the core. We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity, and at the same time, we will position the company for future growth, both organically and through opportunistic targeted bolt-on M&A. Our business operates in a very fragmented market and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio. And importantly, our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launched several of our ESG-oriented initiatives already. Overall, we have several value creation levers as we look ahead and we will continue to execute, despite the uncertain macro-economic landscape. I will now turn it over to Emily to walk you through the financials. Emily? Emily Weaver : Thanks Vicente. On slide 12, you will see the as-reported financials for the company. As a reminder, the reported financials include three months of legacy Gardner Denver and one month of the legacy Ingersoll-Rand Industrial segment in Q1 2020 and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019. As a result, the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction. I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result, other than to mention that the as-reported net income in the quarter includes $197 million of amortization, acquisition, restructuring, and other adjustments, which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation. Turning to slide 13, to assist in clean comparatives to the quarter, we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened as of January 1, 2018. From a total company perspective, FX adjusted revenue and orders declined 14% and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19. Regionally, we saw notable declines in Asia-Pacific, as well as sharp declines in the U.S. and Europe toward the end of the quarter, most notably in the IT&S segment. This led book-to-bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter. The company delivered $208 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decline of 24%, driven mostly by the volume declines in IT&S and the expected downturn in the HPS segment. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4%, down 200 basis points from last year. However, our proactive cost controls within the business limited decremental to 29%. In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company, the legacy Gardner Denver business delivered $97 million as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately $100 million, which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment. The legacy IR businesses delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March as opposed to a combined $60 million for January and February. Moving to slide 14, free cash flow for the quarter was $60 million on an as-reported basis, including $8 million of CapEx. The Q1 free cash flow includes $63 million of outflows related to the transaction comprised of $38 million of synergy delivery and stand-up related costs and another $25 million of transaction fees. We also paid $38 million of debt issuance costs in the quarter, which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement, bringing our total transaction-related outflows in the quarter to $100 million. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.6 times and while we do expect to see some short-term increase to leverage, we have shown the ability to delever historically. As you can see on the right side of the page, we remain extremely disciplined on cash and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically, specifically, internal reinvestments for growth, prudent debt pay down, and opportunistic bolt-on M&A. We have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time. I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segments. Vicente? Vicente Reynal : Thanks Emily. Starting first with Industrial Technologies and Services on slide 15. The IT&S segment first quarter adjusted order intake was $889 million, down 9% versus prior year excluding FX. Adjusted revenues in the quarter were $796 million, down 17% excluding FX and leading to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.12 times. From a regional perspective, Asia-Pacific revenues were down in the mid-30s, with Europe down 15% and Americas down 7%, all excluding FX. We use these trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out, meaning that the APAC decline in Q1 is what we expect to see in Americas and EMEIA in the near-term. This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business. But we're staying highly active with Demand Generation activities and pricing controls, while we continue to demonstrate discipline in price, generating over 1% in the quarter. While these markets are more opaque than historically, we're using our unique acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment. We break this out into two areas-aftermarket and original equipment. For aftermarket, a leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data, as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide that are connected to a remote monitoring system. In America and Europe, we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few weeks of March of nearly 30%, with some recovery in the past few weeks of April. We're now using this as a way to know where our service teams need to focus, while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity, which is approximately 50% of the compressor business today. For original equipment, we're using Demand Generation leads. We said in the past that Demand Gen was a leading indicator of orders that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks, with more than 1,000 leads per week, we have a lot of commercial insight in our system. What we saw in the latter weeks of March was a drop of 30% versus what we saw earlier in the quarter, with similar trends in America and Europe. We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April, but still approximately 20% to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year. Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective. We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers and vacuums where we saw orders down in the mid to high single-digits. We have spoken about third-party industry reports in the past and the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies. According to a leading third-party report, the market in the U.S. was down mid single-digits in dollars in the first quarter. Gardner Denver branded products were flat and Ingersoll-Rand branded products was down high single-digits, but when you look into the details, you see the power of the two companies, as Gardner Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines, while Ingersoll-Rand took share on high horsepower compressors. This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio as well as the direct and indirect channel that both companies have. Power tools and lift, which is part of the segment had a very tough quarter with orders and revenue down both over 20%. The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases that online retailers typically make in the first quarter to support first half of the year revenue. However, this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market, many online retailers switched their focus to household essentials. Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, IT&S delivered $135 million in the quarter, which was down 25%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 17%, which was down 150 basis points from the prior year, as our cost mitigation efforts helped limit decrementals to 25% in a segment that typically has base decrementals of 35% to 40% before cost actions. Moving to slide 16 to the Precision & Science Technologies segment. Overall, the segment had solid performance in this economic environment, as adjusted orders were $218 million, up 2% ex-FX. Adjusted revenue was $192 million, down 9% ex-FX on strong prior year comps of 12% ex-FX growth and shipment delays due to COVID-19. This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets. In the first quarter, we saw orders growth high single-digits in the legacy medical pump business, as we are leading key player in several applications like oxygen concentrators, respirators and liquid handling. You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into, at the bottom of the page. Our teams have been working 24/7 providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future. The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down 2% ex-FX, with the majority due to COVID lockdowns in January and February in China and towards the end of the quarter in India. What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals, which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in more industrial end markets. Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, P&ST delivered $53 million in the quarter, which is down 6%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%, up 120 basis points, driven by strong cost controls and productivity, leading to decremental margins of only 15%. Moving to slide 17 and the Specialty Vehicle Technologies segment. Our priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner. We see that this segment can expand margins with the use of the same IRX tools we have used across other segments and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward. Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter. Adjusted orders were $230 million and adjusted revenue was $185 million, up 8% and 7% respectively with a book-to-bill of 1.15. Growth was driven by the strength in Golf, Connectivity and Consumer product lines. The business saw strong double-digit order momentum in early January and February, but as the pandemic hit the U.S., we saw a sharp decline in the second half of March. While there is a lot to be excited about, we're expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple of reasons. First, last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter where some product was shifted to the second quarter of 2019. And two, the business is not immune to this current environment. While April orders were down year-over-year, we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders. We feel this is driven by couple of factors. First, in the consumer product line, the team pivoted quickly to leveraging Demand Generation techniques widely used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate. And second, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations, we were able to remain open, while some of our competitors were closed. Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, Specialty Vehicles delivered $18 million in the quarter, down 1%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was 9.9%, which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth investments and product mix. Moving to slide 18 and the High Pressure Solution segment. The business performed above our expectations in a tough operating environment, with adjusted orders of $84 million and adjusted revenues of $96 million, down 26% and 29% respectively. As expected, the revenue base in the business was nearly 90% aftermarket and the team executed very well commercially with sequential adjusted orders of 6% and sequential adjusted revenues of 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. We continue to see share gain opportunities in aftermarket and specifically consumables, where we saw orders and revenue up double-digit sequentially. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $24 million, at margins of 24.6%, which was down from last year level of 30.8%, but sequentially better by over 400 basis points. As we pivot to the second quarter and rest of the year, a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity. We can measure that in multiple ways, but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market. As a reminder, each frac fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks, with each truck carrying one pump. Each pump has a fluid end and every fluid end utilizes consumables. While Q1 of 2020, on average, we saw 318 active fleets, the exit rate in March was 240. We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter, where we believe the month of April ended at roughly 50 active fleets due to the recent demand dynamics in the market with the oversupply and lower pricing for oil, and this will have a meaningful impact on revenues within this segment. And because of that, we're taking very proactive stance to drive proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come. Moving to slide 19, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of how the business has performed thus far in April. Overall, the total company is down approximately 20% in orders as the month began very slow, particularly in U.S. and European markets. But we're encouraged by the order momentum throughout April, we expect total revenue to be lower than orders in the second quarter. In terms of orders, both the Industrial Technologies & Services and Specialty Vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average, while Precision & Science Technologies is performing considerably better with positive year-over-year orders performance, thus far as a result of continued strength in medical pumps. And not surprisingly, the High Pressure Solutions segment is down approximately 80% in orders as the market resets for what will likely be a prolonged downturn that we expect will last for a number of quarters. As we look forward, due to the uncertain environment that we find ourselves in, we will not be providing Q2 or total year guidance at this time. However, to best manage our business and ensure we're taking the right steps to manage during the downturn, we're running multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impacts on cash flows. Our current model shows that the business will need to be down 40% on an annual basis to be cash flow breakeven using fairly conservative assumptions around working capital and CapEx, coupled with the cost actions we have taken thus far. We feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compared to current order trends and coupled with our current liquidity position. Turning to Slide 20 for some concluding remarks, I want to say that while we manage through what will no doubt be a tough second quarter and an uncertain recovery thereafter, we feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has not changed. Ingersoll-Rand is a premier industrial company and we are in the early stages of our transformation. We have multiple levers for accelerating value creation. We're being very focused on the current priorities We feel good about our liquidity with opportunities to increase this by unlocking cash, as well as taking advantage of the current rate environment. We will continue to drive a culture of execution, and will continue to pay attention to the opportunities in our large addressable market, particularly on the current conditions to be strategic on bolt-on acquisitions. With this, we will turn the call back to the operator and open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. How are you? Vicente Reynal : Good morning Andy. Good and you? Andy Kaplowitz : Vicente, can you give us more color into the April order decline you're seeing in your largest segment in IT&S? First of all, how long do you think the change in customer behavior from that power tools business that you talked about can lessen? Obviously, you now have smaller upstream but especially downstream and midstream related exposure in IT&S. So are there discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses given it's -- they're more project versus the industrial compressor business? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Andy, let me just give you a little bit of color. I mean, as you saw, we said roughly April total orders down 20% book-to-bill greater than 1, from a book-to-bill perspective, the Industrial Technology and the Precision and Science were greater than 1 and obviously leading the way. I would say, in terms of IT&S, in particular, I will categorize it as the short cycle was most impacted in the quarter and continue to see some relatively weakness here moving forward. I mean it's mostly correlated to, I guess, maybe the PMI from the down in the Midstream, which is what we consider to be more on the long cycle. I will say comparatively a bit more stable in the first quarter and we kind of continue to see maybe some of that in the month of April. Again, typically we tend to get the orders for that long cycle now in the first half of the year in order to get shipments in the second half. And from a PPL -- from a power tool perspective, yes, I mean, rough quarter in Q1, as I alluded. I mean, last year they were seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion into online retailers and you saw that in the first quarter, many of these online retailers, they moved to have another kind of more household goods or critical needs to fight COVID-19 and clearly this business saw some of the impact. I'll say, April sale is relatively slow. So we haven't seen the pivot of the momentum of the power tool business. Andy Kaplowitz : So, that's helpful, Vicente, and I'm sure you expect us to ask about decremental margin in some way. So let me just ask it, like, there are some obviously good result in Q1 of close to 30%. How do I think about decrementals with High Pressure Solutions? The orders down 80%. Can you hold decrementals there in the mid-40%? At what point the fixed cost become a problem? I know you talked about accelerated cost out. As you think about the rest of the business, can the rest of the business hold 30% decrementals with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall in the rest of the business? Vicente Reynal : Yes, so as I said, Andy, I mean, that's kind of what we're targeting for. And, I mean, as you have seen, we have performed well in the down cycles in the past. I think we have a good solid playbook that we executed in the 2015, 2016 that included both, not only in industrial downturn, but also in upstream downturn. Base decrementals, they tend to be around 40% across the business with slightly higher in businesses like the High Pressure, as you mentioned, as well as the Precision and Science because of a nice high gross margins that those businesses have and lower on the Specialty Vehicles and the Industrial Technologies, they tend to play in that kind of 40% range. You've seen that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies and the short-term actions to protect the margin. We saw, as you mentioned, some very good first quarter results for the total business under 30% and Q2, we'll clearly see a bit more pressure from a topline perspective, but we will continue to manage the decrementals with the target being closer to that 30% of the EBITDA. And when you think about the actions, we're clearly taking much more aggressive actions on the High Pressure around cost actions based on what we see here with a lot of our data points and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Vicente, stay well. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, you too Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Vicente Reynal : Good morning Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just a first question on that point on decremental margins. So if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the year and also of that $40 million to $50 million of other cost out actions. And should those mean that decremental margins narrow in the second half or not necessarily depending on mix and some other things? Vicente Reynal : Yes. So maybe break it down into the two buckets, as you suggest, I mean, on the $40 million to $50 million that we spoke about, that are kind of more related to discretionary or kind of volume related. Those are largely second quarter and the third quarter with a good majority, I would say, more so on the second quarter. From a cost synergy perspective, the $70 million -- out of the $80 million to $90 million of in-year, roughly $70 million of that is headcount and I will say that is kind of consistent through the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, while the other roughly $10 million to $20 million that comes from procurement, it is really more weighted toward that kind of Q3 and Q4. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just my second question for you or for Emily around the free cash flow. So you had a good performance in Q1, just wondered -- you had the slide on the very broad brush sort of assumptions around breakeven free cash, but assuming that down 40 doesn't play out, what kind of sales are down, call it, 20%, 25% for the year? What type of free cash flow conversion should we expect? How do you see working capital moving? And maybe just remind us, you had, I think, in the free cash that $63 million of transaction and separation cash cost in Q1. What's the rough assumption for the year? Emily Weaver : Yes. There will -- so we are very pleased with the Q1 cash performance as you saw there, Julian, and we've been managing cash from the day after the transaction very carefully and continuing to put in good processes and strong controls around it, given the current crisis. We expect half to still be good as we move forward, but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move through what's going to happen here with COVID-19 and we're really managing payments as in response to the collections we're receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions. What the future holds, a lot of that's going to depend on things that we can't predict at this time, for sure, but we know we've got the right processes in place to maintain our cash position and our liquidity. Julian Mitchell : And how about the transaction and separation costs? Any very rough guide post for the year in light of that $63 million in Q1? Emily Weaver : Yes. There will be some incremental cash outflows in Q2. I don't have the figure at my fingertips at the moment, Julian, but I can get back to you on that. Julian Mitchell : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird. Your line is open. Michael Halloran : Good morning everyone. I Hope everyone is doing well. Vicente Reynal : Hey, Mike. Michael Halloran : So could you just talk about the synergy funnel you referenced? What are some of the incremental sources in that relative to the originally identified $250 million in synergies? And maybe talk about the difference you're seeing more on the cost side versus longer term, some of the revenue synergy opportunities you're seeing. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Mike, as you'll recall, we always said that we were going for a funnel higher than the $250 million as we were 60-days into the transaction. We have obviously a much more kind of line and clear visibility as to what that funnel could potentially be. Roughly that $100 million comes from a combination of structural savings, as well as some quick footprint rationalization, kind of, non-manufacturing. As I alluded to on the Investors Call that we had back in April that we have now a pretty good database of all the locations across the world and that is giving us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize, not so much the manufacturing yet, because we still see manufacturing kind of come in year two, year three, but more of the other kind of quick hits that we can take from a footprint perspective. Michael Halloran : So, second part of the question. Liquidity is in a strong position, once you get through some of the one-off things associated with timing of restructuring, the separation and some of the extra things, Emily just referenced, what would it take for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the cash outflow? And then secondarily, related to that, do you think the fact that we're going into some sort of recession here, who knows how long, visibility is low, but do you think the opportunity is going to accelerate for you to deploy capital more toward the M&A side of things over the next couple of years and are you positioned for that today? And any kind of thoughts on how you're thinking cumulatively about that capital side over the next six, nine-plus months? Vicente Reynal : Yes. No, absolutely, Mike, I mean, I think, clearly over the next couple of years, we see M&A continue to be really part of our strategy. Still we see it's a very unique environment right now. We still see, at this point in time, some very good funnel on bolt-on. We see also very good funnel around the Precision and Science as well as some of the Industrial Technologies, but they're really more related toward bolt-ons. Michael Halloran : Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Good morning. How are you guys? Vicente Reynal : Hey, Nigel. Good, and you? Nigel Coe : Yes, good, thanks. So I wanted to just go back to the Industrial Tech performance. I was a little bit surprised to see the down 17% pro forma performance and it seems like most of that came from the legacy IR businesses. Can you just maybe just kind of spell out in a bit more detail how much of that can be explained by the geographic and end market mixes of the industrial -- of the IR industrial business? And also what happened to service during the quarter? Vicente Reynal : What was your last question, Nigel? What happened to what? Nigel Coe : Yes, what happened to service within that down 17%, how much service? Vicente Reynal : Yes. So to the first question, yes, I mean, I think, I mean, China was definitely impacted largely in January and February. The legacy IR business, they have a pretty sizable China exposure and we saw an impact to that. In terms of the service, we saw service better than original equipment. I mean, typically we saw roughly about two times from a percentage perspective, better performance than the original equipment. And just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here, particularly, as you know there is some external ways of comparing some of the Industrial Technologies, the Industrial Technologies is composed of multiple technologies, compressors, vacuums and blowers. And our compressor business is clearly within the Industrial Technologies. When we specifically compare to some of the competitors, couple of data points that we look at is what I referenced in terms of the third-party report. At the same time, just to give you further perspective, the legacy Gardner Denver business, in Q1, orders were down in the low single-digit, which is kind of comparable to what we saw in the market and since we didn't own the legacy IR for the full quarter, we just tend to not comment on what we saw specifically January and February that they saw from an order perspective, but that hopefully gives you a good perspective as to how we were able to perform even on the legacy. Nigel Coe : Great, thanks, Vicente. And then switching to the High Pressure business. This business has become so small now, it's not so much development, but if it is down 8% in the quarter, it implies revenues of $25 million to $30 million. I mean, isn't it possible to breakeven at those kinds of levels? And given, you're clearly expecting this business to be kind of like, we keep it longer, would you expect revenues to kind of like just bounce some of the trough year, so for the next several quarters? I mean, any color there would be helpful. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Nigel, so for sure, that's what we're targeting to be, breakeven, even positive. I mean, we're taking some pretty aggressive actions. At the same time, I mean, this business is now 100% aftermarket and consumables. So that kind of carries a much better margin profile too as well. And those factories that are kind of not needed based on volume, I mean, we're basically keeping them closed or in very, very low exposure. So yes, I mean, I think, the team has a pretty good playbook on how to navigate this. It is something that we have done extensive work and I think we see that we can definitely overcome these kind of long-term. And our plan is that it's going to be down for a while. And to the second question, I mean, clearly, it's a market that, as you saw, we just invested in a new fluid end technology so that when the market comes back up again, we can be ready for capturing some accelerating market share. Nigel Coe : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Why don't we just come back to service for a moment, Vicente, interesting comment about utilization down 30%. But how do we actually interpret and apply that to a forward look guide though that doesn't necessarily mean your sales are going to be down 30% in the service? I don't believe -- I don't know if you have enough data historically to kind of piece that together. But what does that down 30% tell you? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Jeff, great question. I mean -- so in terms of the historical data, we don't have a lot of historical because, as you know, as you can imagine, a lot of these remote monitoring systems and connectivity with the IoT platforms that we both companies have now, it's fairly new. But we have enough data to then break it down by the specific soft end markets and that -- I mean, the indication here is that is telling us where are those market that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective. So it is helping us to redirect the teams. It is also helping us to really better serve our customers and making sure that we're still more resilient from that perspective. In terms of being down 30%, I mean, I think we just see that as a bit of indication as to what could happen here. But as you just very well pointed out, it doesn't give us a great correlation as we don't have a lot of historical data to really extrapolate here. So what we're doing is just taking that data point to really reassess our commercial teams and refocusing them on those areas, regions, and markets that we're still seeing some very good utilization of the compressors. Jeff Sprague : And the answer to your prior question where you noted IT&S obviously includes more than compressors, vacuums, blowers, et cetera, are you suggesting that those other products there, areas outside of vacuums and blowers, were substantially worse than the compressor business in the quarter? Vicente Reynal : Yes. So for sure, yes, I mean, for sure, the power tool and the lifting business was one that it was worse than that. I mean, the power tools -- they have two main product lines. I mean, it's that tool business, but also they have a lifting business that is kind of more related to factory consumption or factory rationalization. So I think that was impacted more so and then China as a region was definitely heavily impacted and from the other product lines, in terms of the longer cycle, which these are kind of brands like Nash, Garo, Liquid Ring Pumps and Liquid Ring Vacuums. Those are more longer cycle and those were, I'll say, more stable and resilient. Jeff Sprague : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso : Good morning. My question is about in the ITS business, when I think about the inventory in the channel and you think about some of the recent improvement you've seen, can you give us some sense on any sequential improvements sort of a lead lag and obviously inventory is part of it and also the mix of your businesses being short cycle versus long cycle? Can you just give us some sense of the inventory in those channels and somewhere we can read the lag you would need to see or that you would experience let's say, the PMI has got better, for example? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Dave. I mean, I think, when we look at the inventory in those channel, I mean, there's just not a lot of inventory and I am going to describe this from a compressor perspective, which is obviously the one that has the biggest size of the distribution network. And it is also a more particularly towards the Gardner Denver branded products. We don't tend to have a lot of inventory because these are particularly smaller distributors, more sub bridging alliance, more localized, they don't tend to put a lot of cash upfront to have compressors on the shelf. So to speak, I mean, maybe on the smaller compressors they may, but not on the medium to high level compressors and the inventory will come in more on consumables aftermarket and parts. But those tend to really move fairly well, I mean, they turn fairly quickly. David Raso : And the recent improvement you've seen just unclear. Is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in ITS or have you seen some little improvement in order sequentially? And I'd be curious, is that more short cycle or long cycle? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Great question. Yes, it is all categorized that has a set stabilization and initially and then obviously, when look at it within the month, I mean, at the month of April, there are some slight improvements on the second half of April compared to first half. David Raso : But again, was that more short cycle improvement? Vicente Reynal : Short cycle, yes. David Raso : Short cycle. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Vicente Reynal : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning all. Vicente Reynal : Good morning Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, Vicente, I guess, everyone here on the call kind of say most questions that we are going for most, so we covered a lot of ground already. I guess just with some of the commentary around utilization and with the comments made around supply chain interruption, how much of the decline that you're seeing and yes, I guess this comment is mostly an IT&S comment is related to customer shutdowns or supply chain interruption and in some form like, the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back because I think some of these points on service or utilization that maybe that's not the steady state, state of the world there? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Just outside more so definitely in Q1 in China, if you want to think about it's kind of that drives disruption completely. Also in the first quarter maybe some disruption from the perspective of in Europe, particularly in Italy. I mean, we do have some very good manufacturing base in Italy and we although we stayed operationally, I mean, most of our suppliers have to shutdown. I would say that now as kind of the comment that I made before we see kind of there is lower demand level kind of getting more civilized. But still not seeing that kind of recovery and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will play out. Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay. And then switching over to synergy funnel, it sounds like the year three pipeline of activity kind of has to stay there as you get back on other things for since we're manufacturing centric. Fair to say that the incremental step up in synergies then in the year two, is it smaller? I guess, is this more of a pull forward from year two or are you kind of implicitly saying, we think there's more than 250 here, we're just -- we're working on this as fast as we can walk to U.S. we know more? Vicente Reynal : Yes, I think that's exactly the case. I mean at this point of time, we think we want to keep it up 250, just we think it's prudent. And we think it's prudent because we're -- I mean, clearly focused on a lot of the internal funnel and execution. You see how we accelerated and we executed. I mean, this is not just talking about the savings, it's savings that just over executed. But there's a component around procurement and i2V savings, innovative value that is born independent. And when we did the $250 million cost synergy funnel, it was on based on 2019 kind of run-rate level, so to speak was 10 levels. So we just want to be prudent from kind of going out there and saying that the 250 will increase. Once we're ready, we'll definitely and when we see this kind of more stability or normalization in the markets, maybe we come back with that. But at this point in time, we're accelerating where we can control. And we know that we can control that structural headcount out and that's exactly what we executed. We know we can control a lot of the quick wins and procurement because commodities are lower and we are executing that and we know we can control a lot of discretionary spend and that's exactly what we also executed. So we're very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Appreciate the color. Good luck to you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open. Nathan Jones : Morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning Nathan. Nathan Jones : I think I will start on PST. Revenue down 8.6 ex-FX, margins up a 120 basis points, clearly some very good control lag, can you maybe give us a little more color on what drove the very good decrementals there? How you see the decrementals going forward and maybe any color, you can give us some what you think the long-term margin opportunities in that business? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Nathan. This is -- I'll say some very good cost controls, but also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical business. If you remember last year, when we talked about the medical business, we were seeing upwards of 200 basis points margin improvement and the medical business finishing last year at roughly 30%, 31% EBITDA margin. So, again very good momentum from that business and clearly as we saw some softness in the market, the team continued to execute those targets that they needed to get done. I think, when you look at this business, that I mean, it has some very nice gross margins and the decremental, that days decrementals are typically 45 or so. I mean, pretty good job that the team did here in order to get decremental down to the 15%. And I'll say from a long-term perspective, we'll definitely comeback with getting some kind of medium to long-term perspective. I'll just do a quick comparison then you can see that medical we were able to not only, just a few years ago that medical business was in the 25.6% EBITDA margin and we finished last year in the 31% EBITDA margin and there's a just a lot of good commonalities between the medical and the legacy, PFS and ARO business that are within this segment. Nathan Jones : Okay. Maybe just one on receivables. When you look through that, do you see any customer credit risk any collection risk there I guess it's particularly an upstream comment given the way that markets going, but anywhere else you see any potential issues in receivables? How you're going about managing customer credit those kinds of things? Vicente Reynal : I mean, I say not necessarily Nathan, I mean, I think is one that we live by day-by-day. I mean clearly on the high pressure solution, which is, as you mentioned, the most explodes, I mean, customers are still paying, they take longer to pay, but they still pay. They also realize that from an option perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again. So, we have been pretty strict in many cases that we need to see the payments or we will stop shipments and then we cease to provide any type of output of products either now or later in the in the future. So I think we're really executing a good playbook here on collections within teams. Nathan Jones : Excellent. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. Vicente Reynal : Good morning Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So, a lot of this has been answered. We've covered a lot of ground so far, but I just wanted to ask one. Into next year as we think about approaching our recovery, there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here. We've got more structural cost savings coming through presumably, you have temporary costs probably coming back to the business. And then just kind of dovetailing all of that with typical incremental margins, I'm not sure how best you can do this Vicente, but it'll be really helpful to kind of characterize the way you see incrementals coming out on the other side of this downturn. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Nicole that's great. I mean, I think, we typically see kind of the base, what I call the base level of incremental to be for the total business between 35 to 40%. Again, when you look at Precision and Science, maybe higher than that, Specialty Vehicles lower than that, with maybe Industrial Technology is about that level. Definitely, we'll see a little bit of a headwind, as we see a lot of these structural activities that we're doing to come to fruition. We also see a lot of tailwinds, I'm sorry, with the tailwinds a lot of these kind of structural costs come out, which is amongst some of the headwinds. But as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we kind of work with the teams, we'll definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin, obviously to be at a minimum at that base or more. Nicole DeBlase : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sorry, your next question is from Marcus Mittermaier from UBS. Your line is open. Markus Mittermaier : Hi, good morning everybody. I just wanted one more on the\u2026 Vicente Reynal : Hi, Mark. Markus Mittermaier : Hi, good morning. On synergies, I do appreciate that obviously, procurement is volume dependent, but you flag here 10 to 20 million savings realized in 2020. What you currently assume are sort of full run rate savings, how's that Wave 1 of the spin, which I think is a third of your overall spend? And how should we think about more medium-term for the other two thirds? If you assume that at some point, in a normalized would get back to that 2019 levels? Let's start here. Vicente Reynal : Yes, I think -- if you think about at 10 to 20 coming in this year. As you'll go into 2021, assuming maybe kind of current volume levels, it'll be 20 to 40 million. So that's maybe at least that what you can see here coming from Wave 1 on an annualized level at current volumes. And that obviously is only covering, a portion of the total spend with Wave 2 and Wave 3 coming up out here in the second half of the year. Markus Mittermaier : Right. Is there sort of an estimate you can give us what that would have been at '19 volume levels at sort of not 20 to 40? Vicente Reynal : I mean, it will definitely be a much a little bit higher than that. I mean, I think at this point time, you could say 40 to 50 could be upwards of 60. Markus Mittermaier : .: Vicente Reynal : Yes, I mean, I think this is a segment we like a lot by the way that this businesses are kind of so -- kind of niche and very, very solid market positions. And it has just a load of great descriptors such as kind of high gross margins and very specialized pumps that kind of really solidly mission-critical in the processes where they apply. We continue to see that there's a lot of potential not only inorganic, but also organically and we're doing a lot of work on that whether you take technologies like the ARO and combine that with like a either Haskel branded product or a Milton Roy product and then you can actually create some uniqueness in terms of applications and then enter some new markets. And that's what a lot of the team are doing is, how do we are being thoughtful and mindful on some of those vertical markets and kind of new niche adjacent areas that we want to play in. And not only do that organically, but then see what other technologies from a bolt-on perspective we can acquire. So, a lot of really great work strategically going on this segment to really picture this on how we kind of bolt it. Markus Mittermaier : Thanks a lot. Good luck. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Sorry about that had some technical difficulties earlier. I'm glad to hear everyone's doing well. Maybe just one question here, you alluded on the call to share gains on kind of both those legacy GDI and IR businesses. Wondering if you could put a little more color around what's driving those is it something on the product side. Is that some of the end market strategies you were doing previously around, more niche markets like paper and pulp, maybe some competitive pressures from smaller guys just any kind of color you could provide there would helpful? Vicente Reynal : Sure Johnny. So I mean what I said on the call is that it is on specific horsepowers and when we saw that we liked is this is in the U.S. based on the third party report. And we like because it was really very complimentary. So you look at the legacy Gardner Denver,we saw some share takes in the low to medium horsepower. While we saw on the Ingersoll Rand some share take on the high kind of larger horsepower compressors. I will categorize that as Ingersoll Rand has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the on the larger horsepower. Well, as you know, from a Gardner Denver perspective, we have been more focused on the medium-to-small compressor. And I think, this is what I mentioned on the call that this is a great hypotheses that we had on these great merge and combining the two companies because now we have great new complimentary products and spectrum of technologies that a lot of these that I mentioned is on the oil lubricated, which is very good solid kind of core product line. But as we spoke about during the April call, now also the oil free product line spectrum So again, it's new technology, new products and be able to do to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the product that teams are launching. John Walsh : Great. Appreciate taking the question. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, John. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the company. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. I just want to close out by saying thanks to everyone for your interest in Ingersoll Rand. I want to do another shout out and thank you to our employees that are obviously doing a lot of work here to stay healthy, stay safety. And at the same time provide to our customers mission-critical product that are needed in these kind of current market conditions. So, hopefully everyone stay safe and healthy and we'll look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

I want to share more about the culture and some of the initiatives we're taking. Our Ingersoll Rand execution excellence permeates the whole company and guides how we connect our values, strategic imperatives and execution tools. We do this to drive our company purpose which is lean announced to help you make life better. With IRX, we're now doing over 150 weekly sessions, we're able to mentor over 2,000 leaders globally every week on how to drive immediate execution. We know that to create a unique and single culture of content and open communication is imperative. So a few highlights to point out. First, during this no travel time, we wanted to create a more direct and open dialogue with our individual site teams. So owning our future forms were born from this idea. These are virtual one hour micro town halls with individual sites with 45 minutes are spent on Q&A specific to that location. These have been some of the most meaningful conversations I have had with employees over the last three months. In just the last 30 days, I have been able to interact directly and live with over 6,000 of our global employees. Second, the team designed a powerful interactive and fun purpose and values virtual activation sessions. Employees are having fun as they really get to know and decide how to apply our values every day in their roles. Third, we recognize the responsibility we had as a newly combined company to create a safe space for employees to have deep conversations on important topics. We recently hosted five sessions where Black employees openly spoke about their racial experiences and we had a lot of employees attending, listening and reflecting and it was an emotional and inspirational sessions. So when you think about everything that has happened since the merger took place, including the pandemic and its impact on the work environment, as well as restructuring and streamlining of the organization, this very highly of the foundation we're building at Ingersoll Rand, as we're still able to maintain a strong sense of unity, culture and ownership mindset and this is what makes us highly differentiated. Moving to slide 5, I want to take a moment to update everyone on the integration of the company and how we're executing in a thoughtful safe approach linked to our strategic imperatives. The first phase and one that we started even before the formal transaction closed at the end of February is building a strong foundation. As we have indicated a number of times over the past few quarters, our integration planning began in mid-2019 soon after we announced the transaction. Starting first with deploying talent, as I described on the previous slide, we'll create a unified culture across our entire workforce that is central to who we are. And a major milestone will come later this summer when we plan to issue the all employee equity grant that we view as central to our strategy in terms of driving accelerated engagement, ownership mindset and sustainable long-term shareholder value performance. This foundation can also be seen in the areas of expanding margins and allocating capital effectively. With the help of IRX tools, we have been able to accelerate our synergy delivery with a distinct focus on reducing structural cost. We have also built a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. And finally, we're embarking on our newest strategy of operating sustainably. And as you will see on the following slide, we're taking very proactive efforts to embed sustainability, through an ESG mindset and develop a cadence of transparency and disclosure as we move forward. As we look ahead, having a strong foundation in place will allow us to transition to the next phase of our integration which is pivoting for growth. Growth in the organization will take on many fronts, whether it be organic growth, where we have initiatives designed to drive further product and service penetration; or inorganic growth as we have a large funnel of bolt-on M&A opportunities given our $40 billion-plus addressable market. As we continue to optimize the business, this will lead us to the third phase of our integration which is portfolio optimization. While our focus right now is to continue to improve the underlying nature of our businesses we will continue to thoughtfully evaluate the assets within the portfolio as well as adjacent markets that allows us to grow the current $40 billion addressable market I just mentioned. Turning to slide 6, I wanted to talk about progress we're making on our nearest strategic imperative which is operating sustainably. It starts with building a culture that embraces various points of views, backgrounds and experiences. And I believe that it must start at the top of the house. Our Board of Directors is 50% diverse. We want to be surrounded by the best and that means high levels of diversity in race, gender, thought processes and perspectives. I have been laser-focused on these in the last few years and having such a strong experienced board in addition to being 50% rate and gender diverse, it's a point of pride. Our culture is also behind the strength of our COVID-19 response and why customers\u2019 employees and communities are leaning on us. Increased reporting on ESG measures is important. Recently, we completed a materiality assessment to determine our most impactful ESG topics and details of this are in our first sustainability report published last week and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. More important are the actions we're already taking. One example here is on energy use which in our facility in Wuxian, China has grown solid. This will reduce the Wuxian plant CO2 emission by approximately 3,800 tonnes every year and that's equivalent to the electricity used by more than 550 homes. So let's talk about putting operating sustainably along with our other four strategies into execution and move to page 7 to talk about our Q2 financial highlights. Overall, the business performed very well given the expected revenue declines due to COVID-19 pandemic and the downturn in the High-pressure Solutions segment. As we indicated during our last earnings call, our goal was to manage what's within our control, focusing on protecting the bottom line and ensuring ample liquidity. The team did exactly that as they deliver adjusted EBITDA of $241 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 19.1%. This was a 270 basis point improvement from the first quarter on relatively flat revenue. On a year-over-year basis, margins were down 50 basis points. But when adjusted for the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 160 basis points. The teams executed very well as we continue to accelerate synergies which now stand at $125 million on an annualized basis or 50% of our stated target of $250 million. The team also managed short-term cost extremely well, which ultimately led to a total company decremental margin of only 22%. From a cash flow and capital structure perspective, we saw similar strong performance in the quarter, as free cash flow was $230 million and liquidity now stands at $2.2 billion. Leverage also stayed flat to prior quarter at 2.6 times. Overall, I am very pleased with the efforts of the team, as they remain execution focused and delivered strong results despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. I will now turn over the call to Vik to walk through the financials in more detail. Vik? Vik Kini : Thanks Vicente. Turning to slide 8, you will see the Q2 financials for the company. We provided the 2019 historicals on a supplemental basis as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2018 to assisting clean comparatives for the quarter. From a total company perspective, FX-adjusted orders and revenue declined 21% and 19% respectively and continue to be impacted by COVID-19. This impact was seen within the IT&S segment, where the Americas and EMEA region saw challenging conditions particularly in April and May, partially offset by a return to positive revenue growth in China. Encouragingly all regions saw improvement in order trends in June. The High Pressure Solutions segment also saw the expected declines of over 80% in both revenue and orders due to continued overcapacity in the market and reduced activity levels. Overall, this led book-to-bill to finish at 0.96 for the quarter, which is generally in line with the levels seen in the prior year at 0.98. The company delivered $241 million of adjusted EBITDA a decline of 23%. This was driven mostly by volume declines in the IT&S segment and High Pressure Solutions segment as well as the impact of an increase in our accounts receivable reserve for the High Pressure Solutions segment due in large part to a single customer that declared bankruptcy. We will walk through this in more detail in the upcoming segment slides. Moving to slide 9. Free cash flow for the quarter was $230 million, including $17 million of CapEx. The free cash flow was driven by the strong profitability performance of the business combined with continued improvement in working capital management particularly accounts receivable as well as Q2 prudency measures, including reductions on non-critical CapEx. Free cash flow included $43 million of outflows related to the transaction comprised of $28 million of synergy delivery spend and $15 million of standup related spend. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.6 times which was flat to prior quarter despite $72 million of lower LTM adjusted EBITDA. While we do expect to see some short-term increase to leverage, we've shown the ability to delever historically. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity which now stands at $2.2 billion. Within the quarter, we executed on an opportunistic term loan B debt placement of $400 million, which was completed at attractive rates of LIBOR plus 2.75%, OID of 98.5%, and a 0% LIBOR floor. The new term loan B has the same covenant-light structure as the remainder of our debt and also matures in 2027. At the same time, we also increased our existing revolving credit facility by $100 million. Together with the cash generated in the quarter, total liquidity increased $650 million from the end of Q1 giving us ample dry powder to execute on our growth strategies as we look ahead including continued disciplined bolt-on M&A. Moving to slide 10. Our cost management efforts in the quarter were very strong. Starting first with an update on synergies, our funnel remains in excess of $350 million and the teams continue to add incremental opportunities to the funnel particularly as we build out more plans in areas like i2V and facilities. Vicente noted that our executed annualized synergies now stand at $125 million, which consists of structural and procurement synergies. Let me address each of these in turn. Within the quarter, we did accelerate the phasing of our synergy delivery as we now have already executed on $100 million of annualized structural cost reductions with approximately $80 million of savings expected to deliver in 2020. These savings are coming from incremental headcount actions taken in the second quarter and reflect a $10 million increase to both the annualized figure and our 2020 in-year synergy delivery expectations as compared to Q1. Progress on procurement synergies continues to go well and remain in line with the figures communicated in Q1 of approximately $20 million to $30 million of executed actions with approximately $15 million expected to deliver here in 2020. In total, we are now expecting to deliver approximately 35% to 40% of our overall synergy target in 2020, which is approximately $95 million in savings. As we communicated previously, we are keeping the overall cost synergy target of $250 million over a three-year time frame at this time to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and I2V given the current environment. We also continue to expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in conjunction with both achieving these cost synergies and the associated standup of the new company. On the right side of the page, we continue to show solid progress on managing decrementals as the company. For the second consecutive quarter, we managed decremental below 30% despite double-digit revenue decline, with very strong performance in our IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicle segments. In addition to synergy delivery, a strong contributor was the additional short-term cost reductions we have given the market conditions, which yielded approximately $40 million of savings in Q2. All of the teams, did a great job managing discretionary spend as well as rightsizing their cost structures, given the operating environment within the quarter. While we do currently expect at approximately $30 million to $35 million of these costs will return to the P&L in Q3, we're monitoring the environment closely, and we'll redeploy many of these measures, if the market recovery is slower than expected. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segments. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik, and moving to slide 11. Starting first with Industrial Technologies and services, the IT&S segment second quarter order intake was $788 million down 23% versus prior year ex-FX. The order figures contained two large de-bookings amounting to $20 million of other projects that were deemed not shippable and decided to cancel. These were two isolated situations and we do not expect any similar de-bookings or cancellations of this magnitude as we look ahead. Revenues in the quarter were $830 million down 17% ex-FX and leaning to a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95, including the debookings. As I have said in the past the immediate focus in IT&S was utilizing IRX to create a proper organizational structure and to execute synergies. This will allow us to demonstrate that our combined organization can focus on controlling quality of earnings and result in much better incremental margins once the market gets back to more normalized growth. With this in mind, we're very pleased with how the team performed despite the tough environment as we were able to limit decremental margins to only 8% leading to 280 basis points of margin expansion and a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2%. From a commercial perspective, we feel it is important to break the IT&S into its respective product lines as it creates better comparison and understanding of the performance. So let me first granule on the composition of the segment. First is the compressor which are 60% of the total segment and comprise largely of oil lubricated and oil-free product categories. Orders for the compressor category were down low to mid-teens with oil-free compressors flat and oil lubricated offerings down in the mid-teens. Second is the industrial vacuum and blowers, which comprise 15% of the total segment. Orders were down in the high-teens. These businesses are largely based in Europe, where customer closures early in the quarter drove order decline in the 30-plus percent range, while the last month of the quarter came back relatively strong. We're not implying that the strength in June will sustain, but we're monitoring that closely. Next is the Pressure and Vacuum solutions, which is 15% of the total segment, as a longer cycle business containing Nash, Garo and multistage gears centrifugal compressor offering. Orders were down in the low-20s driven largely by a record quarter in Q2 of 2019 on the multistage centrifugal business creating tough year-over-year comps. We also see our funnel currently weighted towards more projects being booked in the second half of the year, which is not typical in this business, but we believe attributable to some of the deferred investment decisions from our customers, due to the environment. And finally, Power Tools and Lifting, which is 10% of the segment. PTL orders were down nearly 40% for the listing side of the business orders were down more than 50% and while tools business was down in the high-30s. What we find encouraging is that the tool business saw much better performance in June as compared to April and May not only in orders, but also on point-of-sale performance from our customers. And from a regional perspective, the Americas orders were down mid to high-teens, while Europe, Middle East, India and Africa regions was hit the hardest with orders down low-30s, due to complete government countrywide shutdowns in certain countries, within the quarter due to the COVID-19. Asia Pacific performed comparatively better as orders were down a little more than 10% with China flat and the rest of Asia Pacific down in the low-30s. And from a pacing perspective, we saw the month of June much better across all the regions as compared to earlier in the quarter, the sequential improvement was encouraging to see as well. For further highlights, this quarter we want to highlight the oil-free TANX 5000. Customers have a strong need for oil-free compressed air offering that can deliver airflow in the range of 4,000 to 7,000 cubic feet per minute while being both highly efficient and tailored economically to the specific site requirements. Current offerings at this type of range are either very large compressors that need to be highly modified creating lower efficiencies or small compressors that become an economically -- with all the added auxiliaries that need to be placed. The TANX 5000 played very well in this midsized market, offering a very modularized product that can meet customer needs while delivering best-in-class energy efficiency. Moving to slide 12. We'll review the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, the segment had solid performance as orders were $201 million, down 6% ex-FX. Revenue was $196 million, down 8% ex-FX for book-to-bill greater than 1. As a reminder, Precision and Science Technology segment is composed of mission-critical flow creation technologies that run across seven P&LS and 14 different premium brands. Many of which have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets. In Q2, we saw orders growth of 7% ex-FX in the Medical business with continued demand for pumps that go into oxygen concentrators, ventilators and other products focused on fighting COVID-19 as well as strong demand for products on our Dosatron business offset by some of the other product lines like Milton Roy, MP pumps and over defer that saw a decline more in line with other industrial end markets. As you can see on the right side of the page, Dosatron is a fluid power non-electric chemical and dosing injector pump, making it the easiest and most reliable way to accurately inject chemicals into water lines. Dosatron injectors work using volumetric proportioning ensuring that chemical mixtures remain the same regardless of variations in pressure and flow and the technology is mostly used in niche end markets like nutrient delivery systems, water treatment, food safety and sanitation and animal health. This business continued to see strong growth in this environment with order rates up in excess of 20%. Moving to adjusted EBITDA. Precision and Science segment delivered $59 million in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was resilient at 30.3%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and up 260 basis points sequentially driven by the use of IRX tools to drive productivity leading to decremental margins of only 21%.  Moving to slide 13 on the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. As we indicated in Q1, our main priority for this business is to continue to capture growth in a more profitable manner, utilizing IRX and commercial tools like demand generation and e-commerce. And with that in mind the specialty vehicle segment deliver on both ends with strong commercial and margin performance. Orders were $208 million, up 5% ex-FX and revenue was $218 million, down 7% ex-FX. As a reminder, we expected revenue to be down at the second quarter of last year saw increased shipments, due to some supplier issues that shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2 as well as expected declines in the commercial and utility product offerings. While those factors do play out, the business saw continued strength from the consumer product offerings such as Onward highlighted on the right side of the page. We continue to find success with our direct-to-consumer or B2C approach to educate consumers while leveraging our broad channel to sell and service the vehicles. With this focus, the business saw a record in terms of consumer vehicle shipments in the quarter with a nearly 50% increase in terms of units. Moving to adjusted EBITDA. Specialty Vehicles delivered $41 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.9%, which was up 270 basis points despite the revenue decline due to strong product mix as well as continued use of IRX tools to drive productivity improvements. Moving to slide 14 in the High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed in line with expectations during what it was considered one of the toughest quarters in the oil and gas industry. Orders were $13 million, down 87%, which includes $6 million of cancellations, primarily from customers looking to reduce their spend. Revenue was $22 million, down 82% and were generally in line with expectations as frac fleet counts grew up 85% sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and our sequential revenue was down 78%. The majority of our revenue base continues to come from aftermarket parts and services with consumables being the most resilient piece of the portfolio. Even with this environment we continue to bring differentiated innovation with our newest valve offering highlighted on the right side of the page. Products like the Redline V3 valve which increases useful life by nearly 40% will be differentiators as we look to continue to win share despite the decline in the market. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we were on track to be nearly breakeven. However, we took $15 million in charges due to increases to our accounts receivable reserves resulting in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of down $15 million. The major driver was a specific provision for a customer that declared bankruptcy in mid-July, which require us to reserve $12 million based on our internal policy. Given the bankruptcy proceedings are still working their way through the court, it is uncertain how much will be being collectible and we have always taken a very prudent approach and view to reserve our entire outstanding AR balance in these situations. In addition due to the current environment, we took a more conservative approach on our accounts receivable reserve taking an additional $2 million charge in the quarter. We are actively working with each of these customers and expect to collect our outstanding receivables here in the second half of the year. As we pave to the back half of the year, we don't expect the market conditions to materially change. And while fleet count is expected to sequentially rise to about 80 fleets in the third quarter, the continued overcapacity of horsepower in the market and cannibalization of equipment will limit the growth. As a result, we will continue to be very prudent on cost and push for breakeven profitability or better. Moving to slide 15, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of how the business has performed thus far in the third quarter. Through July the total company is down mid-teens in orders with book-to-bill greater than one. The Industrial Technologies and Service segment is largely trending in line with the total business as orders are down 15% to 20%. The Precision % Science Technology segment is currently flat, although we do expect that rate to trend a bit more negatively as the quarter progresses. Specialty Vehicles continue to see strong momentum as order rates are currently positive, largely driven by ongoing consumer vehicle demand. And not surprisingly the High Pressure Solutions segment is down over 90% as we continue to see limited activity in the market. We're not providing Q3 or total year guidance at this time, but from a high-level perspective framework, we expect a continuous low market recovery in Q3. In addition, we expect we will see normal seasonality that we have seen in prior years including the impact from European holidays and the typical downturn in Specialty Vehicle in the gold cycle. From a margin perspective, we will continue to manage decrementals, but we do expect some headwind versus the level seen in the second quarter as $30 million to $35 million of short-term cost are expected to re-enter the P&L with a partial offset from the continued ramp of synergies. We will also plan to continue to invest for long-term growth as we want the business to be well-positioned when the overall market environment stabilizes. I will also add that we will continue to be very vigilant on our leading indicators and we intend to act quickly. Moving to slide 16, as we wrap today, we just want to leave you with some takeaways. We're very excited as we're still early in our transformation. Our employees have been able to drive tremendous performance even in this difficult environment. And soon, we will make our employee owners of this amazing company. From Rachel on a compressor assembly line in Cumbersville, Kentucky facility; to Paolo, one of machines in Brazil; and from [Indiscernible] who works in an assembly sale in Huishan, China; Mohamed in our distribution center in Charlotte; and Max who is an assembly line worker in Simmern, Germany; to Palani, a shop maintenance team member in Chennai, India. These are among the more than 16,000 employees globally who will soon not only be able to say they work for an amazing company for that they own part of an amazing company with scheming the game on our long-term transformation; one that we're mapping out as a multiphase approach executed by utilizing our IRX tools and all center on our values and our ultimate share purpose for customers, employees, and communities. So, with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a first question Vicente, around that slide 15 on the right-hand side the discussion around temporary costs. So I think at the Q1 earnings you talked about maybe a, sort of, 30%-ish incremental margin for the balance of the year. You did come in better than that in Q2, but is that the rough, sort of, placeholder for the second half we should dial in as you, sort of, balance cost control with some reinvestment for the pending upturn? Vicente Reynal : Yes, definitely. I think the way we're thinking about it is as you saw you said, Q1 and Q2 both decrementals were below 30%. And what we're saying here is Q3 we'll see a little bit of more pressure due to some of these discretionary items coming back offset by some of the synergy ramp. But that being said we still expect decremental to be in the low-30 range. Julian Mitchell : Okay. So low 30s for the second half? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Julian Mitchell : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. That's clear. And then secondly, the free cash flow extremely strong in Q2 receivables was about $100 million or so tailwind to that in the second quarter. Maybe just help us understand the puts and takes within that? How you see the second half free cash flow playing out particularly around working capital performance. And also what level of cash charges should we expect for the year relating to synergy extraction and restructuring? Vik Kini : Yes, Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that in two pieces here. So, you're absolutely right. In the second quarter really pleased with the free cash flow performance. Very good progress on the receivables side, generally across the portfolio. Clearly some more opportunity to go, but really pleased with the strong performance there in Q2. As we look ahead for free cash flow, kind of, just in total we do see opportunities continued on the working capital side. I'd say the biggest area continues to be on the inventory side of the equation. I'd say receivables and payables, you've seen good progress over the first half of the year continue to see some opportunities there inventory is clearly the piece that we're going to continue to look to rightsize and we have a lot of I'd say opportunities and initiatives in place right now across the majority of the portfolio. In terms of the second part of your question, we said at the end of the first quarter that we expect to see roughly about $100 million of cash spend for the balance of the year around restructuring-related costs or synergy delivery costs and standup. We delivered right around $40 million of cash spend in 2Q and still largely on track. We would expect about $60 million in the back half of the year which for right now you can kind of equally split between the two quarters. And we'll see how the timing plays out. But that should be a good placeholder for right now. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Mike. Mike Halloran : So I just want to parse out on slide 15 again, just what you mean by the sequential commentary still recovery? Obviously, there were some shutdowns that impacted revenue trends in the quarter. When you look for that sequential 2Q to 3Q, are you saying that sequentially we should see normal sequential patterns? I mean excluding kind of the high-pressure business, but pretty normal sequential patterns for the other three pieces, or is this just -- or is this more of a just keep in mind that there are some sequential softening that you have to worry about within a few of the pieces, but all else equal you still do have a better 3Q out of revenue line than 2Q? Vicente Reynal : Yes. So maybe Mike, let me just take that into some of the pieces, but by segment. So IT&S we do see typically seasonality in the Q3 due to the holidays, particularly, in Europe. However, that is likely going to get offset by improving conditions throughout the quarter, and so assuming that we do not see any second wave of COVID, of course. And as you saw IT&S orders were down 15%, 20% in July which is comparable performance to what we saw in June and better than what we saw in April and May. But again, we're watching this cautiously given the uncertainty that's still exist. And Precision & Science, similar conditions apply that I just made reference to the IT&S. Orders have started the quarter as well, as you have seen, very flat performance, continued improvement from the month of June. And Specialty Vehicle is a business that does tend to see much more seasonality in Q3 versus Q2, particularly driven by the growth cycle. And you can see from historical periods, that Q3 revenue loss tend to be down about 15% to 20% sequentially. Currently, consumer demand is helping to offset this a little bit, but we will continue to watch these, kind of, consumer orders as we go through the quarter. And, finally, High Pressure, we just don't expect any material shift in demand patterns, as we look really to the second half of the year. Michael Halloran : Thanks for that. On the industrial tech side, I really appreciate the granularity of the moving pieces there. How do you guys think about what share looks like? And how that tracked? Maybe there was a little selling against you, as the original combination of the two companies was materializing. But when you look at the trends you're seeing within the compressor, blower, vacuum side of the pieces, how do you think you're performing versus market? And any regional commentary would be appreciated. Vicente Reynal : Yes, sure Mike. I mean, last quarter we did a lot of commentary around the compressor side, particularly based on the association reports that are kind of the most known and we have access to. And we said that, we felt in the first quarter, on the compressor side, we took some share on the small to medium and some share on the large compressors in the U.S. What we saw in the second quarter is kind of holding share. So, no taking or not losing share on the compressor side. And what we see on the vacuum and blower, which is kind of primarily mostly in Europe, through OEMs or end markets like wastewater treatment for the blowers side, again, fairly consistent in terms of holding shares. So, again, we saw a second quarter where, obviously, tough across the world, but one that we're not concerned on losing share at all. Michael Halloran : Appreciate it. Thanks for the time. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good day, everyone. Just, first if I could, just a follow-up on cash flow. Vik, I think you said leverage is going to go up a bit in the back half. And just looking at kind of the likely LTM EBITDA, right? It doesn't change a lot, I don't think and the cash restructuring didn't sound particularly onerous that you described to Julian in there. Is there some other cash item in the third quarter in the back half that takes the leverage up? Vik Kini : Yes. Jeff, I think, what we're referring to here is that -- on the LTM adjusted EBITDA, there will be a little bit of noise there, as we kind of continue to lap some of the previous quarters of 2019. In terms of the back half of the year, nothing major we would call out. Obviously, we do have some of the normal cash taxes and some of that will play itself out, generally in line with what we have said for the total year. But, again, when we say, there might be a little bit of pressure to leverage at the levels we're at now, we're not expecting meaningful uptick. Still in the 2.6 to higher 2 realm, but not much higher than that at all. And, again, continue to see a good pass of delivering, like you've seen us do historically at the legacy Gardner Denver. So, again, not a meaningful uptick, but even around the levels where you are right now and maybe slightly higher. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks. And then, Vicente, you mentioned a very active bolt-on M&A pipeline. Is the organization ready to take that on, or are you just cultivating a pipeline and we should expect things kind of further out into the future? What's your general view on that? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Jeff. I definitely feel the organization is ready for it. And we said in the past, particularly around the Precision & Science technology, it's just a lot of focus that we're putting on that one. And as we have said in the past too, as well, I mean, there's not a lot of kind of cost-heavy integration structurally on that segment. So the team is definitely ready to take in more. And on Industrial Tech & Services as well, I mean, we're cultivating a very good pipeline, primarily, kind of, channel and some key technologies, but it's one that the team also feels good about taking on. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Andy. Vik Kini : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Vicente, if you look at some of your smaller businesses in IT&S especially power tools there are businesses that seem to have been a little weaker so far during the pandemic. You did mention the stronger June in these businesses but is there more you can do to balance out the performance of these segments? For instance, subsegments? Are you increasing new product intros in this business? And then could you talk also about legacy IOR compressor business the larger business? Is that business at all having lagging in terms of orders given its focused on large projects? Vicente Reynal : Yes. On the first question around the power tools I mean yes you saw the softness. We alluded to some of the softness early on the -- even on the last earnings call to the fact that kind of a shift of some of our customers on what they were putting more attention to from an online perspective. We saw actually in the month of June some pretty good pickup in orders, but also point of sales on the tool side. What we continue to see softness on the lifting side kind of the material handling and lifting and that side of the business the end markets that that performs is just not improving at this point in time. I mean it's got has some oil and gas exposure to it. But to your question in terms of what we're going to accelerate growth? I mean coincidentally last week we had a four-day session of our long-term planning review strategic plan sessions where we look at '21, '22 and 23 and there's some very good activity that we're putting forward here on the tool side that the team is putting forward that we think kind of selling more of what we have to more unique channels. So I think we expect to see a better momentum but it will just take time to really kind of readjust that business. We have been very focused on really the cost adjustment and now we're pivoting more towards the growth.  On the legacy IR the larger compressor side, I think you're referring to the multiphase centrifugal. This business is one that we -- that saw really strong demand in Q2 of last year. So I wouldn't say that it's getting really soft but I mean last year there was actually a lot of good momentum on refining and LNG markets and just as an example Q2 of 2019 there was just a single project, but it was worth upwards of $40 million in Vietnam. So just seeing kind of some tough comps based on some of the larger projects that kind of really happen in the second quarter of last year versus this year we're not seeing the momentum on those large projects happening here now. However, the team is fairly encouraged because they see really strong funnel and potentially movement from here on the second half as same things are coming back to normality in some of the countries. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks. And then just thinking about your overall synergy target understanding that it's early and you haven't changed it yet but you are creeping up in your synergy forecast in terms of now expecting 35% to 40% of the savings in 2020, I think you said 35% last quarter. So does that give you more confidence in the $250 million target even with the procurement being volume-dependent? Vik Kini : Yes, Andy this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think the answer is absolutely yes in terms of the confidence. You've heard us kind of reiterate the confidence in the last few quarters. Obviously, we have a higher funnel but given that a meaningful piece that funnel is procurement and I2V and supply chain which is all kind of volume-dependent and we're not at 2019 volume levels which is when a lot of that baselining work was done that's why you just haven't seen us kind of take the target up higher. But again, still feel confident and obviously have a healthy funnel that we're executing to. Andy Kaplowitz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Good morning guys. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : I guess maybe going back to the temporary cost actions coming back in the third quarter what's the nature of those? And I guess the reason I ask is it feels like the environment isn't getting, I mean clearly got a little bit better in July but not accelerating significantly. And so I'm just curious what would be your appetite to keep temporary actions in place in 3Q if we kind of remain in the current level of revenue decline? Vik Kini : Yes, sure Nicole. This is Vik. I'll take that. So clearly we did mention last quarter that we were going to take roughly $40 million to $50 million in discretionary spend controls over Q2 and Q3. We really kind of outpaced that. We delivered approximately $40 million in Q2 alone. And to answer your kind of your first part of the question there are still components of that equation that are staying in terms of cost savings things around reduced compensation for executive management, senior leaders, mirror deferrals and certain discretionary spend reductions. But as we kind of look forward to Q3 here and we start to see a slow recovery in the market, we're currently not expecting the same level of actions things like furloughs for example is, kind of, a bigger piece of the equation. And we would expect to see some of the discretionary spend starting to return. To your second point of your question, absolutely. If the markets are slow to recover than expected we will implement many of the same cost saving measures that you saw in Q2. And you show our ability to ramp up those cost savings in Q2 and exceed our prior expectations and we would be prepared to do the same thing if market conditions warrant it. And the other thing I'd probably mention here is, we have continued to make some prudent I think growth investments in the context of Q2 and we expect to do so going forward, which you'll kind of see just in the run rate of the numbers things around demand generation, things that we're kind of setting ourselves up for future growth that we expect to have really strong payback. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-on around the cost synergies projected for 2020 the $95 million now. I guess, can you just give some color on what has been achieved so far predominantly in 2Q? And then how that ramps in 3Q and 4Q? Vik Kini : Yeah, sure. So I think at a high level very simply stated $95 million. It's about $80 million of in-year structural savings, which is really coming from headcount-oriented actions. You've seen us take the majority of those actions here over the first 120 days, I wouldn't say that we're necessarily 100% done but you do see that coming to conclusion here pretty quickly just given the actions we've taken. And then right now about $15 million of in-year procurement savings, again very consistent with what we said first in the first quarter. The procurement piece is really meant to start ramping up in 2021 onwards. So in terms of the overall synergy number, $95 million expecting between 35% and 40% here that's in-year from a total year of a total of $250 million synergy target, and as we look ahead to 2021 that will start to ramp. Obviously you're not going to see the same magnitude of headcount related synergies and things of that nature ramp at the same pace. So we are expecting probably about 50% to 60%, 55% roughly of the synergies in 2021 and then 75% delivered in year three. And then you obviously get the full run rate into year four thereafter. So very consistent on the back end of this as you've seen us historically report. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, Vik. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : So Vik just following up on that last question. I wasn't able to run the math in real-time there. How should we think about the temporary savings rolling off in the next year versus the incremental pickup that you have on the synergy funnel just given that you've pulled more forward into 2020? Vik Kini : Sure. Yeah. So let me kind of take them in pieces here Josh. I think in terms of the short-term actions by and large you should see those largely back in the run rate as we exit the year. As we mentioned we got about $40 million of savings here in Q2, we would expect the majority of those to trickle back into the P&L here in Q3 and Q4 and then some of the smaller items around merit deferrals and things like that we expect to obviously come back in the cost structure next year. But again you should largely see those reentering the cost equation here as we exit 2020. And then in terms of the synergy ramp and I think to Nicole's question before, like we said we've got about $80 million of in-year headcount actions. That's the major piece of the equation. You could probably expect it around $20 million to $25 million that in 2Q and then ramping ratably between Q3 and Q4. So Q3, Q4 being a little bit higher probably closer to that $30 million per quarter and then the procurement piece of $15 million of in-year that's largely all second half weighted. You really haven't seen any material amount of I will call integration related or transaction related synergies when it comes to procurement just yet. We've launched a lot of the RFQs, have a lot of good momentum on some of the initial waves, but you should expect to see that really more in the back half of the year here in Q3 and Q4. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then, I guess next year the temporary bleed off versus the incremental synergy funnel is -- it won't quite be a push, but they'll be a small number that nets out of that? Vik Kini : That's right. Vicente Reynal : That's a fair way to think about it. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the oil-free side of the house. Since you made some opening comment remarks about some new products there, I think over time oil-free comes up pretty regularly is hey we've got a new product, new commercial initiatives something on that front. Obviously you have a big competitor who's pretty dominant there. Anything that you can share with us on growth rates in the product line? Anything that you think you're doing on market share gains, because it seems like it's still kind of a small piece of the portfolio and maybe not a big driver of overall performance? But, is this something that we should expect to be a larger piece over time just given that it's probably one of the more attractive areas of the market? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. I know Josh, so -- I mean I'll say that for sure, it is an area that we're putting a lot of focus into a tool as well here. And oil-free outperformed oil-lubricated. Oil-free is kind of basically flattish revenue performance, so it's actually good in terms of speaking about the resiliency and the strength of the end markets that it serves and why we continue to be excited about what our future holds in this product line. So, yeah, I mean I definitely -- without going into a lot of details of our strategies and what we want to accomplish here, it is definitely an area that we are putting some focused attention and that we definitely want to continue to outgrow. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck to you guys. Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Thanks Josh. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Vik, congratulations on the promotion as the CFO. Vik Kini : Thank you. Joe Ritchie : Maybe just kind of starting off, I know Vicente you mentioned that there are cancellations you don't expect to repeat going forward. But maybe just provide a little bit more color on what end markets they were related to? And what your conversations with your customers are like today on what's already been booked into backlog? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. To answer your question Joe just to be more specific, it's really along the kind of the loan cycle by the kind of the larger loan cycle products? Joe Ritchie : Yeah, yeah, that's right. Vicente Reynal : Yeah. So I think the most of our long-cycle businesses is kind of within these -- the industrial technology, in the business unit that we call, PVS or Pressure and Vacuum Solution. And as a reminder, it's just like 15% of the total segment. You can even split that business into two main areas : one is kind of the legacy Gardner Denver, kind of, what we call the Nash Go, what used to be in the downstream side of the business. That business actually performed fairly well. I mean they saw order rates being positive in the second quarter, and actually on a year-to-date basis, positive high-single-digits, so book-to-bill of like 1.3. So, that's good and encouraging, because that's exactly what we want. We always said that bookings of that longer cycle business we want it to be strong in the first half of the year, so that we can start making the shipments in the second half of the year. And the commentary in terms of the multi-stage or kind of the larger compressors, those are the ones that saw really meaningful tough comps. I mean in second quarter of 2019, it was a record quarter for that business. And it was really more on end markets, such as LNG and gasification and process gas. So, a lot of the kind of maybe momentum that, was getting into those end markets, earlier into 2019. And what we're seeing now is basically a little bit of a shift. We're putting a big shift in terms of new end markets. So we are putting focus on utilizing these large compressors for food and beverage. And so, we expect that as we kind of rebalance the end market that we should see probably a better stability moving forward. But in terms of the backlog I think we're fairly well positioned for here for the second half. So, these are kind of more orders that we still expect to hopefully get here in the second half based on the funnel from the team. So, it's not order cancellations. It's just in some cases order pushouts and just a more, smaller orders as to compare to the large big orders that were coming through in the early part of 2019. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Got you. That's helpful color Vicente. And maybe just my follow-on question, just taking a look at the Specialty Vehicle segment and the performance this quarter, it was really nice to see the margin improvement there. I guess just thinking about this, and I know this question comes up a lot around kind of like portfolio optionality and deleveraging. But again, just how are you kind of just thinking about the different pieces today and your ability to potentially monetize parts of the portfolio to help maybe accelerate the deleveraging plan across the organization? Vicente Reynal : Yeah Joe, I think no change in strategy on that one. I mean I think we still see that our current number one priority is to create integration, stabilize the businesses, drive some performance and that's exactly what you see that we're doing, and not only in this case in specialty vehicle from an order perspective on revenue, but also from a margin side. And I think when the time is right and the moment comes in that we can look into all the potential alternatives, we'll definitely be ready. As we said on the opening remarks, I mean we have kind of \u2013 this is a multi-phase transformation. And we have a Phase III that we're doing a lot of work in terms of strategically understanding each of the businesses and the path forward while at the same time we put a good foundation to invest and really drive some good improvement performance. So, yes I mean, I think this is what's really exciting in our story. We got some optionality here for later down the road while we continue to really fix the businesses. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Can you hear me okay. Vicente Reynal : Yes, perfect, Nigel. Vik Kini : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yes. Great. Thanks, hey. I just want to address aftermarket, mainly within Industrial Tech a big portion of that business is aftermarket and obviously that business was impacted by the shutdown. So just curious how that tracked during the quarter? And what your sort of outlook is in the back half of the year for services? Vicente Reynal : Yes. So aftermarket for that business or recurring revenue roughly 40% of the total segment. So a pretty large sustainable \u2013 large and one that we definitely want to continue to invest. Sequentially Q1 to Q2, we saw original equipment growing faster than the aftermarket, which is a good sign of capital investment. And \u2013 but at the same time a good sign of future aftermarket growth, as we are creating more machines in the field. And also it was in line with expectations from a pent-up demand in China and other markets. I mean, clearly in the second quarter, service on the aftermarket side was a bit more impacted due to COVID and the associated customer closures and the inability to be on the site. I mean, however, we see this as a really great opportunity moving forward as we would expect this to be a tailwind in future quarters assuming that market conditions and these machines will need to be serviced. We're also encouraged by our IoT platform and the remote monitoring capabilities which allows for remote diagnostics of the machine. And in some cases the ability to service the machine via the associated technology and we did some of that work actually here in the second quarter as well. So yes, I think a lot of good signs for long-term continuation of improvement of that side of the business. Nigel Coe : Just to clarify, so aftermarket within IT&S underperformed the benchmark or the segment average during 2Q? Vicente Reynal : It was not \u2013 both were about the same. Nigel Coe : Both about the same? Okay. And then just my follow-on question is really within High Pressure Solutions, I think you mentioned the ambition to get back to breakeven or better performance in the second half of the year. I'm just curious, how you're balancing the opportunities in the market with some credit risks that you obviously saw in 2Q? What is the potential for further credit problems in your customer base in the back half of the year? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Nigel I mean, we believe that this segment will continue to return to the breakeven in the third quarter. If you \u2013 I mean, obviously in the second quarter it was going to be the case. I feel as if this kind of one situation. In the second quarter we were on pace, as I said it to be breakeven. We would not expect that to be a repeat moving forward. And also worth noting that we continue to take cost out of the business including some continued restructuring efforts through the first half of the year that are not 100% seen in the financials just yet. So while we don't expect market conditions to improve meaningfully in the second half of the year, we're focused on those items within our control which is prudent cost control and being very proactive with our customers to ensure proper collection of any of the outstanding ARs. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Rob. Rob Wertheimer : My question is just on pricing in general and then some of your initiatives and specific how did hold in? And then, I know it's early days on the IR assets but some of the tracking and monitoring and price discipline maybe is the right word but just management, is it too soon to see effect on that on either margin or how much ship your product portfolio evolution? Thanks. Vicente Reynal : Yes Robert. So I'll say in the second quarter we saw price up. I mean, we actually saw \u2013 if you look at the different segments Industrial Tech and Precision and Science price up between 1.5% to 2%. But you still haven't seen the uplift or the changes that we're making based on the composition of the company, in the P&L yet. So -- and to your question yes absolutely, there's definitely opportunities that we see here to be more prudent and more precise on price. I mean as we have said in the past, we believe in quality of earnings. And that's one of our key areas of focus. Rob Wertheimer : Perfect. And then, your oil-free comments were pretty helpful in contextualizing your results. But you don't seem to think you lost any head-to-head share, I suppose in the quarter in any meaningful way, is that right? Vicente Reynal : No. I mean that's correct. I mean based on all the indicators that we see that's correct. I mean, one of the things we obviously hear that I just spoke a lot about is the orders, on order patterns. And as well as some of the third-party reports that we see and not that we can think of. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. Thanks Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso : Hi. Thank you. Can you help us with price versus cost during 2Q? And how you see that progressing, the next couple of quarters, just on sort of what you're seeing in your backlog and what the market trends are like? And sort of separate from your longer-term cost actions where you're taking structural cost out, more of a kind of on an operating basis what are you seeing?... Vik Kini : Yeah, David \u2013 yeah, \u2026 David Raso : Particularly not only IT&S, but both companies, that would be grateful. Vik Kini : Yeah. I think the easy answer kind of following up on what Vicente said is that the price cost equation particularly looking at, price versus really the procurement equation, and continue to remain positive. We have seen good momentum on procurement initiatives I'd say kind of more than normal course procurement initiatives that had kind of been in place as the two companies were coming together, showing a little bit of a tailwind there. And as Vicente mentioned price was up in both the IT&S and Precision and Science segments, which are the kind of the two largest between 1.5% and 2%. So we continue to see a pretty good cost equation there -- price cost equation there which obviously was seen in the margin profile. So again continue to see good momentum there. And especially with regards to price, I wouldn't expect to see dramatically different results as we look to the second half of the year. So again, continue to be very quality \u2026 David Raso : So that\u2026 Vik Kini : \u2026I think both show it. David Raso : So that's my question. So the price cost you don't feel the price erosion or the increase of diminishing will be greater than the procurement cost savings? I'm just trying to make sure that price/cost spread you see continuing, or do you think, it could widen, year-over-year for the second half? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. We see continue actually improvement on the pricing in the sense that, we executed here in the second quarter a lot of our pricing actions that are not seen yet in the P&L. David Raso : Okay. So with the procurement savings then you're expecting the price cost to actually be better in the second half, than the second quarter? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. That's exactly correct. Vik Kini : It will trend positively, that's correct David. David Raso : Yes. Perfect. Okay. Thank you very much. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Our final question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking me in here. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, John. John Walsh : Maybe just a clarification question first. And I don't know if it has to do with maybe the timing of the transaction closing or if any of the deal assumptions have changed but just wanted to ask about kind of the amortization expense stepping up, as I look across the different schedules Q1 to Q2? It's a little bit greater than we thought. Vik Kini : Yeah, John I'll keep it pretty simple here. It really just has to do with the purchase price adjustments that we're still working through. As we work through Q2 obviously you saw us true those up. And I'd say, even that we were only 30 days frankly into the transaction through Q1 you saw kind of a normalization of that in Q2. So again, the levels that you're seeing in Q2 should be largely indicative of what you'd expect going forward. But again, it's really nothing more than just the timing of the deal and Q2 is a pretty good run rate to use going forward. John Walsh : Okay. Excellent, that's very helpful. And then, I guess, maybe just a follow-up question. I don't think I heard any mention of supply chain in the prepared remarks. Is there anything to call out there, or does everything seem to be up and running now on a normal perspective? Vicente Reynal : No. John I mean everything is up and running and perspective, I mean nothing to -- that I will call out that is creating issues at this point in time. John Walsh : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, John. Operator : We have no further questions, at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Vicente Reynal, for closing remarks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. I just want to thank everyone for their interest in Ingersoll Rand and participating on the call today. I also want to thank again, our employees who many of them are actually on the call listening to their performance. So thank you for a great performance in the second quarter. We believe we're in a very exciting path. And we look forward to speaking with many of you over the next few days and weeks. So thank you. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and- answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Vikram Kini, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Vikram Kini : Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2020 third quarter earnings call. I'm Vik Kini, Ingersoll Rand's Chief Financial Officer and with me today is Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer. Our earnings release which was issued yesterday and a supplemental presentation, which will be referenced during the call are both available on the Investor Relations' section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this morning's conference call will be available later today. Before we get started, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, which are both available on the Investor Relations' section of our website. Turning to Slide 3, on today's call we will provide an update on the integration efforts of the company, as well as review our third quarter and total company and segment highlights. We will conclude today's call with the Q&A session. We ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik and good morning to everyone. I want to start our call by thanking all our employees around the world for the hard work and commitment to the health and safety of our teams and their families. As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their dedication to serving our customers at the highest level. Their focus and consistent contribution coupled with the continued proliferation of IRX throughout our organization delivered strong results we can all be proud of. Turning to Slide 4, I want to spend some time on our culture, because it is a competitive advantage for us, particularly in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, our progress has been impressive. Let me point out a few examples of the inflight initiatives that are helping to foster our unique culture as we integrate both companies. We have now rolled out our purpose and values activation to nearly the entire company. These are highly an engaging one-on-one sessions, where we work with our employees to discuss our purpose and values, and what it means to lead them every day. In addition, we have continued the owning our future forums, which are virtual micro town hall meetings to create open dialogue. Today, we have engaged and heard from over 7,000 employees. And their feedback is helping us simplify our internal processes. In the third quarter, we also conducted our first All Employee Engagement Survey, we had a 95% participation rate across the entire company, which is nearly 15 percentage points higher than the manufacturing index, we benchmark and puts us in the top quartile of participation. Our high engagement level is a positive reflection of employee satisfaction with working at Ingersoll Rand, and employee happiness is very important to us. And a great example of our employees leaving a purpose and values and making a positive impact in our community is those champions which fits in our Precision and Science Technologies segment. That those champions have developed a method to deliver clean drinking water to an orphanage in a remote location in Madagascar, using our technology of electricity-free dosing pumps, examples like these are happening around the company, and our strong tools for the culture we build in our Ingersoll Rand which firmly supports that purpose of lean on us to help you make life better. Moving to Slide 5, one of our key values is thinking and acting like an owner. In the third quarter, we took a major step forward in bringing that value to life. By making all of our employees shareholders of the company. On September 21st, we were proud to virtually ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and announced the issuance of $150 million in equity awards across our entire employee base. This is a meaningful distribution equal to 20% of an individual base cash compensation. And as I have said before, this is not a thank you note to the team. Instead, this is a catalyst to have all 16,000 owners all moving in the same direction to drive change and create value for all shareholders, including themselves. And like we did a Gardner Denver reward at the time the equity grant to a specific initiative of improving net working capital. We're training all employees on what it means to be an owner. When we launched this in 2017, we improved the working capital as a percentage of sales that Gardner Denver by about 500 basis points in less than three years. So for us, we feel the future is extremely great that Ingersoll Rand, and with 16,000 employee owners moving in a common direction, I am confident in our ability to create meaningful value. Turning to Slide 6, let me now provide an update on our integration efforts. We have built a strong foundation, and are now pivoting to growth, with a specific focus on executing our talent priorities, continuing to capture supply chain synergies, and driving free cash flow, which is allowing us to accelerate investment in IoT, digital and e-Commerce initiatives. And finally, advancing our work on the ESG front as we look to be a recognized leader in corporate social responsibility. It is an exciting time at Ingersoll Rand. And as we continue to mail complementary cultures, as well as leverage our deep portfolio to serve niche end markets and accelerate growth. Well speaking about growth, let's turn to Slide 7 to showcase a few examples. The first example is focus on how we're leveraging a differentiated compression technology to penetrate the Hydrogen Refueling and Dispensing Niche market, which is a high growth and rapidly changing market. A part of integration planning process, we did a lot of work to better understand these end markets, and the potential it could bring to our combined company. Haskel with over 70 years of industry experience is one of the world leaders in offering the most reliable high-pressure equipment and technology today. We're very excited about Haskel's comprehensive portfolio of specialized compression solutions. As we are well positioned to winning share, with turnkey refueling station used for heavy duty vehicles and buses, and light duty passenger vehicles, we have now over 100 stations across the world and a technology leadership edge that we created over the past 12 months. One example of our investments in innovation here is the launch of a new small-scale, cost effective standalone hydrogen fueling station, which is designed for small, simple plug and play installations. But with a complexible configuration, it can be relocated from one location to another very easily for forklift applications. As we look ahead, the growth prospects in this space are extremely promising as we continue the penetration of hydrogen fueling into key markets is expected to create a $2.5 billion addressable market for us by 2027. Turning to Slide 8, the second example demonstrates how we can leverage the breadth of our technologies across multiple segments to win in a targeted end markets like water and wastewater. Take for example, at wastewater treatment plant shown on the picture, we have begun to leverage our technologies across the ICS and PST segments to drive further penetration in what is estimated to be nearly $5 billion addressable market, with a 5-year CAGR of at least 2 times GDP. Utilizing IRX tools, we're focused on capturing quick wins within our combined broader portfolio. First, we're focused on increasing customer share wallet by offering a broader set of product solutions. We have identified already by more than 50 new sales channels to penetrate. Second, we're coordinating internally our large project funnel to ensure all relevant businesses and brands are involved in bids to the goal of maximizing the content of Ingersoll Rand products in any project. And third, by combining demand generation database contact across the two segments, we have now over 32,000 contacts with an expectation to increase by 40% in the US alone as part of our Impact Daily Management process. We're now beginning to educate this entire universe of potential customers of our technologies and solutions to dedicated digital campaigns. And while we're still in the early days as we just launched this initiative, we have already seen an increase of over $30 million in our funnel. This commercial synergy is just the beginning of what we believe will be a future where we connect all the technologies to optimize the entire process. And given the work we are already doing on IoT, we feel that we're well positioned to capture this opportunity, given our deep knowhow of the types of sensors and controllers require in our products to best optimize the data acquisition and analytics. Let me now turn over the call over to Vik for an overview on the financials. Vik? Vikram Kini : Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 9. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our performance in Q3 as industrial end markets saw a gradual sequential momentum throughout the quarter. We saw a similar trend across the majority of our businesses, as total company orders and revenue increased 13% and 6%, respectively, as compared to 2Q level with strong double-digit momentum in the Industrial Technology and Services, especially Vehicles and High Pressure Solution segments. The Precision and Science segment saw slight sequential declines in orders, which was in line with expectations due to the large COVID related orders for medical pumps we saw in the first half of the year that we did not expect to repeat. As we continue to navigate these uncertain times, our goal is to continue to manage those areas that are controlled by utilizing IRX to maximize the value capture on productivity and synergy initiatives and maintain ample liquidity. And the teams did exactly that as they delivered adjusted EBITDA of $284 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.3%. This was a 220 basis points improvement in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, despite double-digit revenue funds, margins were up 150 basis points, and when adjusted for the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 240 basis points. The teams are continuing to execute extremely well on capturing cost synergies, and our annualized savings now stand at $150 million or 60% of our stated target of $250 million. Our strong commercial and operational execution lead to companywide decrementals of only 6%, which marks our lowest level seen thus far in 2020. From a cash flow and capital structure perspective, we saw similar strong performance as free cash flow grew to $179 million. Liquidity now stands at $2.3 billion. And as a reminder, historical financials as provided in this deck on a supplemental basis, as if the transaction had happened on January 1st, 2018, to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter. The detailed assumptions and adjustments using these supplemental to be found in the appendix of these slides and our earnings release. Turning to Slide 10, from a total company perspective, FX adjusted orders and revenue declined 8% and 11%, respectively, which is a meaningful improvement from the comparable 21% and 19% declines we saw in the second quarter. While COVID continues to create challenges, we saw continued stabilization in core markets in the Americas and EMEA, particularly in the IT&S segment. Both regions saw high single-digit order declines on a total quarter basis for core compressor, blower and vacuum equipment, with the strongest month of period in September, and Asia Pacific continued to show positive trends on both revenue and orders led by China. Specialty Vehicles saw strong order performance up 29% ex-FX as the momentum for Consumer Vehicles continues at record levels, and unexpected, the High Pressure Solutions segment saw order declines of slightly over 80% due to continued overcapacity in the market and depressed activity levels. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.02 for the quarter, which is slightly better than the levels in the prior year of 1.0. The company delivered $284 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decline of only 3% versus prior year even with the headwinds caused by the pandemic. The IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles segments all saw a year-over-year improvement in the adjusted EBITDA and strong triple-digit margin expansion. Offsets were seen in the High Pressure Solutions segment as well as higher corporate costs, we saw a large benefit in prior year costs due to reduced incentive compensation costs, as well as in-year investments primarily around infrastructure and growth initiatives to stand-up the new company. Turning to Slide 11, free cash flow for the quarter was $179 million, driven by the strong operational performance across the business, working capital improvements and continued cost savings and CapEx prioritization initiatives in the current uncertain environment. CapEx during the quarter totaled $8 million. Free cash flow included $26 million of outflows related to the transaction comprised of $13 million of synergy delivery spend and $12 million of company stand-up related expense. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.5 times, which was an 0.1 improvement as compared to prior quarter, despite $10 million of lower LTM adjusted EBITDA. We would expect to continue to see leverage remain in the 2.5 times range or slightly better as we finish the year. And we feel comfortable with our current leverage position and clear path to be in at 3.0 times or better in the relatively near-term. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.3 billion based on $1.3 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion availability on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we terminated our legacy Receivables Financing Agreement, which was due to expire at the end of the year. We were not intending to renew the RFA moving into 2021, due to our enhanced liquidity profile and given the fact that the overall impact on liquidity from the RFA exit was less than 2%. As of September end, all the company's legacy fixed interest rates loss have now expired. This expected to yield at approximately $5 million cash interest benefit in Q4 as compared to Q3 at current interest rate levels. And as the company's debt profile is now 100% fully floating, we'll be examining the appropriate fixed versus floating structure moving forward from a risk management perspective. In total, liquidity is now increased $730 million from the end of Q1 given its ample dry powder to execute on our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Moving to Slide 12, we continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Within the quarter, we accelerated the phasing of this initiative and we have now already executed $150 million of annualized synergies. This includes $105 million of permanent structural cost reductions with approximately $80 million to $85 million of those savings expected to be realized in 2020. On procurement synergies, we've captured $40 million to $50 million with approximately $15 million to $20 million of the savings expected to be delivered in 2020. This represents an increase of $20 million of executed actions as compared to prior quarter. And as a reminder, our funnel for direct material led to synergies are based on 2019 direct materials spend. In total, we now expect to deliver approximately 40% of our overall synergy target in 2020, which is approximately $100 million of savings. In addition, we now expect to deliver approximately 70% of our cumulative synergy savings by the end of 2021, and approximately 85% by the end of 2022, with the balance coming in 2023. And as we previously communicated, we are keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three-year timeframe to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and i2V given the current environment, and we'll provide an overall update when we give 2021 guidance during our February 2021 earnings call. We also continue to make strong progress on lowering decremental margins. Total company decrementals were only 6% with IT&S, Precision and Science, Specialty Vehicles all seen strong flow through and High Pressure Solutions managing decrementals below 40% for the first time this year. We also mentioned in last quarter that we were expecting to see approximately $30 million to $35 million of the short-term cost actions that were taken in Q2 come back to the P&L. The teams did a nice job of managing those costs, and we only saw approximately $10 million come back to the P&L. Given the gradual recovery of the overall market, as well as very recent COVID related lockdown in several countries, we are now expecting the full return of that $30 million to $35 million cost base to extend into 2021. I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. So moving to Slide 13, and starting with the Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, this segment performed better than expected with organic orders and revenue down 8% and 9%, respectively, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA that was up 9% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. Moving to Commercial performance, while we know that many like to compare the entire ITS segment against some of our peers, that comparison can be a bit challenging given that we have several different businesses in this segment. Last quarter, we broke down the segment based on our internal business structure. In the spirit of transparency and desire to help you understand the business, we are now showing a product line breakdown. Starting with compressors, which represents about 65% of the segment, we saw orders down mid single-digit and revenue down low single-digit. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil lubricated products, will show that oil-free was up low double-digit in revenue, which we believe demonstrates the success of our strategic focus in this category, as well as market resiliency for oil-free products. From an oil lubricated perspective, orders and revenue were down mid-to-high single-digits, mainly driven by small rotary compressors while large compressors continue to outperform. Regarding the regional split for revenue on compressors in the Americas, the North American team performed competitively better a down low single-digits, while Latin America was down in the mid single-digits. Mainland Europe was down low single-digits, while India, Middle East and Africa continued to see a decline in the mid-teens, which is a great improvement from Q2 levels of down nearly 40%. Asia-Pacific continues to be the best performer with revenue up mid single-digits driven by positive growth in China, while Southeast Asia is still seeing declines due to COVID shutdowns in some countries. Moving to Vacuum and Blowers which represents approximately 20% of the segment. Orders were down low single-digit driven by mid single decline in the Blower business partially offset with positive order momentum in our longer cycle Nash and Garo Vacuum businesses. We were encouraged also to see that Industrial Vacuum business in Europe was relatively flat, compared to down double-digits in the second quarter, which is a sign that our OEM customers are seeing some underlying improvement in their markets. More next to the Power Tools and Lifting which is 10% of the segment, the total business was down high-teens in orders and mid-20s in revenue. Encouraging sign here is that the rapid improvement from last quarter, where we were down low-40s in orders. The Tool business has materially improved from the second quarter, while Lifting and Material Handling business remained depressed. And as we have said in the past, our focus here has been to materially improve the profitability of this business. And we're very happy with how the team has executed, delivering 270 basis points of sequential adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. In this quarter, we want to highlight one of our growth synergies, which is the expansion of our oil-free compressor launch in Europe. You may recall, we launched a radical new technology in the oil-free space within Gardner Denver just a few years ago. This patented technology delivers completely oil less air with a value proposition unmatched in the market. At that time, the Garner Denver channel was not properly set up an experience enough to sell such a unique product focused on total cost of ownership in the oil-free space. However, the Ingersoll Rand team has a lot of experience in selling oil-free products. And within the matter of months, we have re-launched the product under the Ingersoll Rand brand and leveraged the Ingersoll Rand channel. We have also trained over 400 channel partners and our funnel has increased to $15 million in a matter of months. It is good to note that more than 20% of that funnel increase was generated purely with demand generation efforts. Moving to Slide 14, we'll review the Precision and Science Technology segment. Although organic orders were down 9%, as expected, total order levels were down 3% sequentially, but when normalizing for the COVID related orders that we saw on the medical side of the business in the second quarter, the sequential improvement was actually positive. Revenue performance was quite strong at down only 1% organically, driving the strong performance within the business were that Dosatron and Medical businesses, which delivered double-digit revenue growth. The Precision and Science Technology team also delivered strong adjusted EBITDA that was up 14% on relatively flat revenue. This led to a very resilient adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.7%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, and 40 basis points sequentially. Again, driven by solid execution and use of IRX tools to drive productivity enhancements. On this call, we're excited to introduce Albin Pump to the Ingersoll Rand family. Albin is a leader in the manufacturing of electric peristaltic pumps, which is one of their highest growth positive displacement technologies. We see strong commercial synergies as we leverage Albin alongside our ARO and Milton-Roy brands and plan to leverage the Precision and Science global network and channel to accelerate growth as Albin. This is a great example of the type of bolt-on acquisitions, we're very excited about for the company. Moving to Slide 15, under Specialty Vehicle Technologies segment, although Q3 was another strong performance for the Specialty Vehicle Technology team, with organic orders and revenue up 29% and 1%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA of $38 million increased 36% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, which represents 510 basis points improvement versus per year. Proliferation of the IRX toolkit is allowing the Specialty Vehicles team to capture strong end market demand in the Consumer Vehicle segments and grow our share. The strength is based on continued digital demand generation activities, compelling new product launches, including lithium, and a 6-passenger offering and extremely consistent production and channel performance. We're also pleased with the traction on the launch of the second-generation lithium battery for the golf car market, where we're seeing an improvement in cost, reliability and range, which we believe is now leading in the industry. Aftermarket also continues to be a strong focus, including our Club Car Connect platform, which is showcased on the right side of the slide. With over 100,000 connected vehicles, Club Car Connect is a GPS-enabled technology platform that provides fleet managers with car control features such as geo-fencing and location-based speed control, as well as asset management tools such as the ability to monitor the location of the golf cars, and report vehicle diagnostics. Moving to Slide 16, under High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed largely in line with expectations. And its continued low demand in the oil and gas industry. Orders and revenue were down at 81% and down 68%, respectively. Nearly 90% of the revenue base continue to come from aftermarket parts and services, with consumable continuing to be the most stable component of the revenue base. I'm extremely proud of the team for their proactive efforts and productivity improvements around cost management controls, which allows us to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA of $1 million and decremental below 40%, despite the meaningful revenue declines. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, of the worst seasons of market recovery, we have the unknown of extended holidays later in the quarter, as well as continued pandemic headwinds. Looking forward to 2021, we remain encouraged with how the business is positioned from a product offering and cost structure perspective. We feel there is some pent-up demand in the market, which will return at some point beginning with the service and repair work. And we're well positioned to capture these opportunities with the premier service centers like our Permian facility that is highlighted on the right side of the slide. Moving to Slide 17, we want to provide a quick snapshot of how the business has performed thus far in the fourth quarter. Through the first three weeks of October, the total company is now mid single-digits in orders, with book-to-bill at greater than 1. Within the Industrial Technologies and Services segment, the regions are largely trending in line with the year-over-year order trends that we saw in the third quarter, and the Power Tool business continues to see sequential improvements. The Precision and Science Technologies segment is currently positive year-over-year. And the Specialty Vehicles segment is continuing to see healthy momentum on the consumer side coupled with growth seasonality. The High Pressure Solutions segment is down 30% to 35%, which is encouraging. But we see limited expectations for activity in December. We're not providing formal Q4 or total year guidance for this time. But from a high-level perspective, we expect the gradual market recovery to continue in the fourth quarter with revenue trending positively on a sequential basis. Industry Technology and Specialty Vehicles segment should support most of that strength given normal personality in their shorter cycle components of Industrial Technology, as well as larger projects that will ship later in the quarter. For the Precision and Science Technology and High Pressure Solutions segments, we expect a comparable revenue performance relative to the third quarter. From a marketing perspective, we will continue to aggressively manage decrementals and expect to be below 30%. We're expecting some headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to what we saw in the third quarter, mainly unfavorable product mix in Precision and Science due to a low contribution for Medical as the COVID related backlog have largely shipped, and Specialty Vehicles has mixed shifts more towards growth, which carries a lower margin than the consumer, which has been very strong. We also expect the cost base to increase slightly as we continue to invest in organic initiatives to fuel long-term growth. It is also worth noting that this assumes no additional material headwinds from the pandemic. We haven't seen any notable impact on order rates just yet. But we're monitoring closely and we will be ready to execute our playbook as we have successfully done this year to react quickly to any business interruptions. Moving to Slide 18, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that we're excited by our products. While we're still in the early stages of our transformation, we have taken meaningful steps forward in creating a differentiated culture and improving the performance of the company. And now with 16,000 employees, who are now owners of the company, I am confident that we can continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. So with that I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Vikram Kini : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just the first question around the operating leverage as we look ahead to a more normalized sort of recovery stage, you had 60% sequential incremental margins I think in Q3 so extremely high level and understand those incrementals will moderate as the recovery matures. But maybe any kind of placeholder as you're thinking about the net off of temporary costs coming back, the ongoing synergy extraction and the extent to which you'll manage those incrementals via an ongoing reinvestments as well? Vikram Kini : Yeah and hey, Julian, this is Vik, I'll start with that and let Vicente weigh in as well. You're absolutely right, I think Q3 was an extremely strong quarter for all the reasons you mentioned. I think as we think forward, as we look into Q4 as we mentioned, we don't expect the sequential, you know, incrementals still to look quite as strong. You know, our view as we look kind of forward and frankly even looking to 2021 is that, we think that you know, normalized incrementals kind of across the portfolio on a base level should play in that 30% to 35% range without using some upside opportunity for the synergy extraction. Remember, there are some cost normalization and things of that nature that will continue to kind of unfold as we move into 2021 as we mentioned, but I think, you know, 30% to 35% is probably a good base level to use with some upside opportunity as synergy start to materialize into 2021 and thereafter. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful, thank you. And then my second question really around the free cash flow, you know, very strong in the nine-month, you know, what, $470 million or 125% conversion to adjusted net. I realized that was the first sort of year of the combined entity. And maybe there are some one-time pieces moving around the working capital move perhaps a bit abnormal this year. So just wondered, you know, what you could indicate in terms of free cash conversion expectations as you look out and also within this year's number, what's the total synergy in stand-up cash outflow for the year, please? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Julian I think we would expect to be greater than or equal to 100% of adjusted net income on a free cash flow perspective. I think what we're excited about is that, yes, you have seen that there are some very good momentum on the free cash generation. And the most important piece here is that, we still feel we have plenty of levers for us to improve. You know, what, you know, clearly one that we just talked about here is, how we're rallying up, all 16,000 employee owners in the company, are on their working capital, as a percentage of sales and how we believe we can unlock good amount of cash by getting everyone focused on that perspective as we did with the Garner Denver in the past, and then all the levers such as, you know, tax or tax rates that we spoke a lot about that, you know, that's also offering a good meaningful opportunity. And so I think, you know, the regarding this year, Julian is that we still have more employment opportunities. Vikram Kini : Yeah, and Julian on the second piece in terms of some of the moving components and kind of what we've spent thus far from a free cash flow perspective, specifically on the synergy and stand-up costs. In the first half of the year, we had about $80 million between the first and second quarter of cash outflows. And then you could see in Q3, we had about $26 million. So you've had a little over $100 million of cash outflows thus far, specifically for synergy and stand-up related spend through the first three quarters. And we will expect right now that Q4 should look comparable to what you saw in Q3 as we've guided before. So I can kind of give you an idea of kind of just the - I call it one-time of really the synergy and stand-up related spend that has flowed through free cash flow. Julian Mitchell : Fantastic, thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Halloran : Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Mike. Vikram Kini : Good morning, Mike. Michael Halloran : So why don't we start with some thoughts as you're thinking about next year, just a lot of uncertainty out there, qualitatively, how are you guys positioning things internally in your core businesses as we sit here, just to hear your thought process of how you guys going about the iterations for next year? And any kind of high-level thoughts on that side? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Mike you know, clearly, you know, we're now in the midst of that cycle of kind of getting with the teams to do through our budget cycle for 2021. And this is part of our process. And as we completed our strategic plans a couple of months ago, you know, well we don't have full visibility. I mean, we like what we see from the macro indicators, BMI, Exane, I mean, across the world showing some continual gradual improvement. So we're encouraged about this. But, you know, we know that there's some uncertainties that with COVID in many other global markets and lockdowns. I think the most important thing for me to highlight here, and we're highlighting with the team is that, you know, I believe that we have been able to demonstrate how we're able to adjust and adapt to whatever environment looks like, and you can see that from the down market and how we have controlled our decrementals very well at the same time while investing. So I think, you know, I you know, the way that we're working with the teams is, you know, have a perspective in terms of good, gradual, continuous sequential, nothing, but more important, making sure that we're making the right investments while controlling, you know, the cost and continue improvements in our company. I would say to you as well, maybe, Mike to add to that is, you know, right now we feel good about kind of the backlog in terms of our long cycle businesses like you know, like we have, you know with our large Compressors or some of our larger Vacuum businesses and also with the Specialty Vehicles, I mean, they have a very solid backlog too as well heading into 2021. So, at least at this point in time, I mean, we're going to be working with the teams under budgets and building as we kind of outlook for 2021 with a high level of just flexibility. Michael Halloran : Makes sense. And then maybe help with some puts and takes on the capital optionality side. One, how you're thinking about the current portfolio as it sits here today, any changes there, and then secondarily, you know, you're in a good balance sheet position, you know, Vik mentioned earlier towards 2 times in the near future here, how are you thinking about M&A? What's the funnel look like? And then secondarily, are buybacks something you guys are considering in the near-term? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Mike I think this is, as you saw, you know, we got our three phases and you know, we spoke a lot openly about our kind of phase three or portfolio optionality that gives us you know, plenty of opportunity for us to evaluate that, and that is equal on both sides, as you said, you know optionality on potential debt securities, but at the same time on the M&A, and the M&A, I tell you the formula is very, very active. We're very excited with Albin, that acquisition that we just made, you know, a lot of these acquisitions as well, I think the interesting thing is that, we continue to source those ourselves and the things that we're finding that being proactive and working with a lot of these companies, in our relationships is really unlocking opportunity to be able to be more prudent and discipline in terms of multiples that we paid. So I think the M&A funnel is very, very active. And we're really excited about what we have ahead of us in that case. Michael Halloran : And the buyback side, any help there? Vicente Reynal : Not at this point, I would say, Mike, I mean, because we see very good opportunities for us in the M&A. And you have seen how we're able to, you know, from a pre and post multiple reviews that pulls multiple synergy dramatically. So we just see just greater payback right now on the M&A. Michael Halloran : That makes a lot of sense. Thanks, Vicente. Appreciate it. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Hey, just coming back to kind of the synergy question. You know, what, as you think about kind of the funnel, right, I just wonder if the funnel really, the complexion of the funnel is changing at all. And, you know, some of your concerns just about kind of the ability to travel and all these sorts of things kind of getting at the $250 million doesn't really seem to kind of borne out, right? It seems like you're actually getting at it, maybe a little bit quicker than you thought. So really kind of two questions, the speed with which you can, you know, kind of continue to knock out the $250 million. And whether there's anything really moving around on the $350 million, and when that might move from kind of funnel to actual firm target? Vikram Kini : Yeah, sure, Jeff, this is Vik, I'll take that one. You're absolutely right, we've been pretty pleased with how we've been actually able to execute on the synergy funnel at this point in time. As we mentioned, I don't think that, you know, frankly, the COVID environment has really prevented us from executing on the funnel, we started with frankly, a lot of the activities particularly on the structural side, and I'd say the beginning phases of the procurement, frankly, before the merger, even, you know, was really completed. So that's really been able to accelerate what we've been able to see. And you've seen that we've actually sequentially every quarter, we've even accelerated the cadence, including now where we're saying about 40% of the savings to be delivered here in 2020, 70% by next year, and then 85% by the year thereafter, which is considerably, I'd say, you know, stead-up compared to what our original expectations are. So I'd say at this point in time continuing to kind of move forward, I don't think the COVID environment has dramatically stopped things, we didn't found ways to do things like i2V and workshops and teardowns in a virtual manner, not how we planned it originally, but still being able to execute. And then in terms of the larger funnel, you know, in excess of $350 million, I did a complexion to your point, it's still largely the same, really what the ahead of us here is much more direct material-oriented savings as well as footprint. And as we mentioned, the direct material side does have a big component that's obviously tied to the volume equation, which as Vicente mentioned, as we get better visibility to 2021 and thereafter, I think we'll be able to give an update accordingly. And the footprint fees largely have not changed, I'd say that's the piece that clearly in this environment by a little bit more difficult to execute on. The good news is the funnel is continuing to progress quite nicely. And we'd always plan to be executing on that footprint, funnel really into 2021 and 2022, nothing's really changed in that manner. So I'd say we're still pleased with how things are progressing and we've largely accelerated what's within our control. Jeff Sprague : Great, thanks for that. And just back to IT&S on some of the kind of heavier CapEx oriented parts of the business. So just, you know, you gave us the order color and appreciate that. I was wonder if you could give us a little bit more color though just on, you know, what your customers are saying? You know, how the CapEx outlook in some of these vertical markets that are more industrial sensitive, you know, look as we perhaps look into at least the first part of 2021? Vikram Kini : Jeff, I think the good - I mean, we're encouraged in terms of how we're seeing the conversations with the customers. I mean, obviously we spoke earlier in the year on how things were kind of slow. But we are seeing some pretty good momentum among some of these kind of non-cycle businesses that require some very large capital investment. So we're encouraged with the conversations that our teams are having it. We saw also some of that here in second quarter. And you know, we always said that the fourth quarter, it's a - is a quarter where we expect a lot of these kind of orders to get closed and built into the orders. So at least we're encouraged with that. And that was a little bit of a commentary I made about, you know, going into 2021, that we're at least are positive in terms of the backlog that we have coming into the year with these businesses and obviously more encouraged about how our teams are pursuing, you know, more aggressively, a lot of these kind of large investments that are accounted and freed up. Jeff Sprague : Great, thank you. Vikram Kini : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. So I wanted to switch to your upstream on gas, the High Pressure, HPS. Obviously encouraging trends, there seems like we've found a flow so we're starting to improve sequentially. Couple of questions there. One, would you say, a disproportionate amount of the temporary cost measures, you know, have gone into that business to sort of preserve the margins? And, you know, should we be down in some modest sequential improvement in that business? You know, similar to what we've seen, you know, in prior recoveries from here? Vikram Kini : You know, Nigel, so definitely a good amount of temporary, but I mean, I would say similar in nature to what we have done, if we remember, I mean, the HPS is a business that even back in the second half of last year, we started to restructuring and the business was really different from a footprint perspective and also from the capital investment that we have done. So I think we're encouraged with what the team had been able to rapidly adjust. And I think that is really encouraging as we see similar kind of comeback that we're seeing in the market. Nigel Coe : And then sequential growth from here, do you think that's reasonable based on your customer conversations and what do you see in the market? Vicente Reynal : We think so - we think, Nigel, I mean, we're being kind of thoughtful and prudent from the perspective only just because you never know what's going to happen on some of the holidays here after Thanksgiving and into the Christmas. But based on you know, fleet count continues to increase sequentially, our order rates continue to increase. So now, you know, year-over-year, as we pointed out in the first week of October, we're bound only 30% to 35%, which those are encouraging. And but we still also feel that the pent-up demand has not come through. So I think that's also a highly encouraging, I would say. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. And then my follow-up question on ITS. First of all, thanks for all the detail. I think you preempted about 10 questions with a detail. But how did services track you know, within that mix? I mean, I know that was hit pretty hard by the shutdowns. I'm just wondering if we've seen, you know, some pent-up demand coming through there and whether we're back to growth and services? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, no, good, good, good question, Nigel. I would say that, you know, the big service business that we have is really mainly, I would say, mostly in the US and Europe, where we mostly in many cases, we'll go direct. We saw the good sequential improvement through the quarter. And what we have seen is that, you know, aftermarket and services all done holistically, is roughly 2 times better than the whole goods so then to complete. So I wouldn't call it as a massive pent up demand. I'll just say kind of more gradual improvement as people are kind of getting and opening the locations do allows us to go on and kind of go in, but nothing dramatic. Just good gradual improvement. Yeah, sure - Nigel Coe : Great, thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Rob. Rob Wertheimer : So Vicente and I think you've talked a couple of times on sort of long cycle versus short cycle you know dynamics. But I wonder if you could just tell us underlying demand, you know, sort of trends? Is there a very wide gap between the two? How wide is it? Is it already narrowing down to the you know, the longer cycle stuff is, in fact, you know, coming up, we're not just relying on the short cycles stuff? Vicente Reynal : It feels that way, Rob, I mean, it feels that definitely, you know, you know, we can tell you that, you know, on the long cycle business it was actually positive from our perspective in the third quarter. So, again, that can be sometimes spotted based on the size of the project that you see. But we're seeing some momentum in CO2 capture, we're seeing some good momentum in air separation and industrial gases. We're seeing some kind of project that are more related to onshoring kind of release and allowing us to implement our technology and those. So we're seeing some good you now, I would say a sequential improvement on that. I guess for me more encouraging is the conversations that our teams are having with the customers seem to be just much more active than what it was in the past. So but is there a big separation between the two? Not dramatically, I would say. But encouraging signs on both. Rob Wertheimer : Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. If I can ask just one other on, you know, pivot to growth on phase two, I wonder if you can characterize where you think you have the organization focused? Has the intense focus been on synergies the past few months, and you've already internally sort of pivoted the growth, you know, with some of the focus you're doing in and that will show up the next few quarters? Or what would you say you put the organization right now? Thanks. Vicente Reynal : Sure, yeah, Rob that was a great question. And, you know, one of the things that we're able to do in our business with an increased amount of agility and nimbleness that we're driving with the use of IRX, and as you know, we have, you know, almost 200 of those kind of every week with an Impact Daily Management. And so yeah, I mean, I can tell you that in our conversations, we talk a lot more about growth synergies, now that we see some good momentum on the cost synergies. So you know, we still have the KPI on the cost synergies, but now we have added the KPI on the growth synergy. So the conversation is really people pay more towards that, it takes time to see that solid momentum in the business. So but again, you know, we were able to pivot and people kind of writing the - in the, you know, I'd say, you know, we did a mid third quarter kind of field team do that. And so again, more encouraging and as kind of we go into 2021, that we could see some of the fruit of those actions that we're taking. Rob Wertheimer : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Hi. Good morning, guys. If I could just go back to some of your comments about the margin incrementals. You know, I think we had originally thought about 30%-ish this quarter. And obviously, you kind of blew that away and talked about some of the temporary costs not coming back as you expected. I'm just trying to understand, how does that work? I mean, it sounds like you don't actually kind of drive that from a top down perspective, maybe it's more driven by the businesses. And obviously, I'm trying to think about how that all plays out in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Vicente Reynal : Our categories that I mean, is always driven, I mean, our teams, as I said, you know, even as we are preparing our budgets for 2021, our teams are really attuned in terms of what incrementals and decrementals cannot be - been view as the best-in-class. And we'll try to get to those. I think when we provided some of that kind of conversation, no guidance, but, you know, framework as we were going into Q3, there was a lot of discretionary costs that was supposed to come that obviously, not all of that showed up into the third quarter. But I'd tell you that, you know, our teams just pay, you know, close attention to a lot of these leading indicators that we're tracking. And I think in our commentary, we'll just kind of be more attuned in terms of just telling you kind of what we expect to see, but obviously with the room for our teams to be able to drive further improvements to that. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. So just to be clear, then, Vik mentioned, I think, 35%-ish incrementals, is that the right way to think about the fourth quarter? Vikram Kini : No. So, Steve, I think the way we were thinking about it is, that was kind of more of a longer-term into 2021. From a fourth quarter perspective and if you look year-over-year, I think in our prepared commentary, obviously, we're still going to see a, you know, a, you know, a challenge view versus prior year. We mentioned that decrementals should be lower than 30%. And frankly, we would expect be able to control it, you know, frankly, lower than that level, bringing to more in line with probably levels you saw in the 2Q realm or slightly better, clearly not as well as Q3, which was at 6%. Clearly a lot of, you know, good tailwinds in some of the margin mix items we talked about, but I think Q4, specifically, continue to see decrementals well below 30%. So I think as we look further out and I hope that the business turns to more of a growth mode that was kind of the comment as we look ahead. Stephen Volkmann : Great, thank you. That's exactly what I was looking for. I should have said decrementals, sorry. So that's all I got. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Vicente, can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of the growth within Precision and Science? You mentioned the expected decline in the forum, PFS business, it was down 6% in Q3, GDI Medical, I think was up 10%. But then you mentioned the overall segment is positive through the first weeks of Q4. So is PFS continuing to turn more positive? Or has that really strengthened that GDI Medical business could you give us some more color on what's driving the improvement in PFS? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Andy, I'll say that most of the businesses are kind of continuing to strengthen with the Precision and Science. And that's you know, clear you're seeing some of that here in earlier quarter. And when we saw throughout the quarter in the third quarter, we saw continued improvement through the month of Q3. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then, Vicente, obviously, you spent some time talking about hydrogen, obviously ESG becomes more important every day. You just mentioned onshoring and the initiatives there. So if you look at all these sort of, you know, newer trends together, is it having an impact on your business overall right now? And as you think about '21, how well positioned are you to sort of grow above market because of all these new trends that you guys are exposed to? Vicente Reynal : You know that is the thing exciting to you there, Andy that a lot of these kind of trends continue to go on our favor from that perspective, and not just by pure log, but mainly because of the I'd say, I'll call self-help innovation that the team is doing. I mean, we find some of these kind of growth, secular trends, and then we evaluate how can that technology be applicable to those trends? And then we go deeply? And then create some unique differentiated innovation? I think that is what is very different in our case, is that, that our teams are pretty agile on that. So yeah, I mean, I think it's more going to be indicative in 2021 and further, you can see, I mean, efficiency for hydrogen are just going to be massive in terms of growth. And we want to be participants with our new kind of unique technology. But it's going to be kind of more I would say medium to long-term. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Raso : Hi. Thank you for the time. A question about what's in the backlog for each business? The color you provided on ITS, appears to be a positive mix when I hear that the bigger compressors are strong. And then within Precision, just thinking about Medical maybe that driving the growth diminishes a little bit. So we think about that as maybe potentially a little bit of a less positive mix moving forward. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what's in the backlog? What we have seen so far in October to better understand the mixed developments for the revenue within those two segments? Vikram Kini : Sure, David. I'll start kind of inverse order. On the head with Precision and Science, we did definitely have a I'd say an elevated Medical backlog that we were really leveraging through second quarter and third quarter and largely kind of shipping through here as it gets in the beginning of the fourth quarter and the Medical piece definitely has a little bit of a margin upside comparatively speaking. So it's not to say that the balance of the Precision and Science, it's actually healthy margins, it's just not quite at those Medical COVID related orders. So again, that'll normalize here at the end of the fourth quarter and into 2021. On the IT&S side, it's actually not dramatically different, you know, each project is a little bit unique. But I would say that the margin profile is actually kind of comparable to what you see on the typically shorter cycle Compressors or Blower and Vacuum equipment. And you know, as such, I would say that Q4 margin profile should be comfortable to what you saw on Q3, it's project by project, a little bit different. But I think in totality, it's relatively comparable, especially given the momentum we've seen on margins across the balance of the short cycle. David Raso : That's helpful. And lastly, on the COVID impact, especially some of the lockdowns we began to see in Europe. And hopefully we don't see any here. But when you think about the potential impact, are you trying to get ahead of that a bit, maybe securing some kind of buffer component inventory? Or you just sort of playing it straight and as it unfold and unfold? So just curious how you're reacting to potential impact. Vicente Reynal : So, David, I wouldn't call it that we're accelerating any inventories as we speak, no. So, you know, what our teams have been doing is that they based on their lessons learned, I mean, they clearly work with the suppliers so as the suppliers can hold more buffer inventory put on versus all holding that inventory. And so I think we're prepared and working with the supply chains to be able to service us proactively. David Raso : And so far, no implications on any facilities from some of the French or UK or that walk down lights we've seen in Germany, no. Okay, terrific. Vicente Reynal : No, implication, no, no. David Raso : Terrific, thank you. Appreciate it. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Sure, David. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Vicente, can you maybe just touch on that opportunity that you're seeing specifically on the oil-free side with selling through your European channel, I'd love to know any kind of thoughts on, you know, cadence of that opportunity over the next couple of years? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Joe, I think this is actually, I mean, as you remember, we were pretty excited with a combination of the two companies because of the complementary technology and how much we consider oil-free to be just a good kind of growth end market, just based on the market that it plays. And so this is a very good opportunity because the Ingersoll Rand team definitely has a lot of good experience selling oil-free compressors. And I would say that at this point in time, we're just kind of scratching the surface still on just purely kind of aligning the technologies to where the best channel could be served for those technologies. So what you saw here is basically our kind of launch of that oil-free technology that we developed during the Gardner Denver days and having the Ingersoll Rand team have access to that through their channel. And the teams are very excited. I mean, all our channel partners as well as the direct teams are very excited positioning those technologies into the primarily fuel and pharma end markets. Joe Ritchie : That's helpful color, Vicente. Thanks. I think maybe my one follow-up. I know we touched on this a little bit earlier on ITS for short cycle versus long cycle. But can you just remind us like how much of your ITS business is tied to short cycle with the ISM improving versus long cycle project related? Vikram Kini : You know, Joe, I'll take that one. This is Vik. I would say that, you know, probably I was all talking about 80%, roughly speaking, is probably shorter cycle, kind of typical standard air compressor, blower, vacuum, power tools and equipment, you know, 15% to 20%, somewhere in that range is probably a little bit more tied to the longer cycle components. So things around the larger centrifugal compressors as well as things like the Nash/Garo kind of vacuum, liquid ring, pump and compressor business. So that's probably a pretty good indication. Joe Ritchie : Great, thanks, guys. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Joe. Vikram Kini : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi. good morning. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Vikram Kini : Good morning, John. John Walsh : I was wondering if you could just first kind of touch on maybe your customer inventory levels, I'm thinking about kind of those distributors that are stocking the smaller side of the compression range? Vikram Kini : Yeah, John, you know, most - we don't have that many distributors that will stop a lot of our compressors. And our exposure to the kind of smaller reciprocating compressors that basically kind of will be, maybe the Do-It-Yourself or we also don't play on that. So I will say inventory levels are definitely not seen by anybody who kind of stocking anything. John Walsh : Okay - Vikram Kini : Just kind of by yourself. John Walsh : Great. And then I guess just thinking about some of the adjustments and as we go into next year, you know, I guess there was a non-cash impairment this quarter. The acquisition related expenses are ramping down. I mean, there's puts and takes, but how do we think about those items as we, you know, update our models for next year? Is your visibility into any big adjustments as you see it today? Vikram Kini : Sure, John, I'll take that one. So you know, I think in terms of, as we said, you know, the, whether it'd be Canada, the restructuring or acquisition related items, you can see that, you know, the large majority of the purchase accounting items have led themselves through. So again, you saw that dramatically decreased from Q2 to Q3. And I think with regard to some of the restructuring items, you'll see, you know, those are normal thing so that as we move into 2021, and we still do have, you know, restructuring the footprint optimization and things like that ahead of us. In terms of the trade name item, you're correct, we did have a small trade name impairment specific to the Power Tools and Lifting unit within the IT&S segment. Very discrete and so just a reflection of some of the revenue declines that we've seen in the Power Tools and Lifting that's specifically on the trade name side. So again, I would say that was one-time in nature. You know, as we look forward, we would expect that the nature of adjustments be very comparable to kind of directory you've seen with regards to restructuring and some of the normal course adjustments, but no other large adjustments of exact nature, no, we wouldn't expect those, those are very discrete and unique in terms of what you see to the first two or three quarters this year. John Walsh : Great, very helpful. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Nathan. Vikram Kini : Good morning, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I got a bit of a follow-up to questions Joe and Andy asked before. On the new product development and adjacent markets that you're moving into, and maybe if you're looking at over a little bit of a longer time, markets are going to grow what they're going to grow. Do you guys have a number that you're targeting in order - in growing that addressable market over time, like, do you think you can grow the addressable market 50 basis points a year, a 100 basis points a year through these new product development and acquisitions to get yourself into new markets to really expand that addressable market consistently over time? Vicente Reynal : Now that's a really great question, Nathan. I - you know, clearly, you know, we have always been kind of change speaking and not openly but how the addressable market grows and how we want to, if you remember the days of the Medical team, how we doubled that addressable market over a course of like, two years? So I think it depends on the business. But clearly, we want to continue to expand the addressable market, we don't have it pegged at a number. But in the Precision and Science team, it is clearly kind of dramatic in terms of how we want to increase the addressable market based on penetrating with the new technology that the team is working. So but specifically to a number, I don't have it, we don't have it pegged, we just have more asset holistically over the strategic period, which is three years, we want to double the addressable market in some other specific differences that we're focusing ourselves. Nathan Jones : Fair enough. One other number that caught my eye was the 29% audit growth in SVT. Can you talk about, you know, what's driving that number up? How that impacts the outlook for fourth quarter, and what's an average kind of book to ship in that business? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Nathan. So the impact, I mean the team is just executing really well on a lot of initiatives, and particularly one around, you know, the new the launch of new products on the consumer side. So basically, these are kind of golf cars that are customized to your needs, you can go online, and which I mean, you should do, Nathan you go online and then kind of customize through your specific kind of desire. And basically, that's kind of pretty unique solution for personalizing the vehicles for the individuals. And we have seen tremendous demand of that over the past couple of quarters. You know, I'll say that, you know, we're typically, I mean, based on the demand that we're seeing is typically, you know, maybe weeks, but not quarters, in terms of kind of the backlog and specifically, I don't want to call it a number just because we view it as kind of being very strategic in terms of how quickly we can deliver those golf cars for the consumer side. But it's driven by a lot of initiatives that the teams are doing around, you know, direct-to-consumer demand generation, as well as, you know, kind of new launches of product, we launch a new lithium battery that extends the range of these consumer cars. And also, you know, we spoke today on the call about the connectivity, and the connectivity platform is also providing some good recurring revenue streams productive. Nathan Jones : Great, thanks very much. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Your last question comes from Ivana Delevska from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ivana Delevska : Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Ivana. Vikram Kini : Good morning, Ivana. Ivana Delevska : So just a follow-up on Specialty Vehicles. What's driving this margin, significant margin improvement? And is there mix - is mix a big driver? And how do you expect it to kind of develop going forward? Vikram Kini : Sure, Ivana. Yeah, our Q3 was obviously exceptionally strong margin performance, really driven by kind of two main factors, one being the consumer piece, second being the aftermarket piece. So I think the mix, frankly, was the single biggest driver, consumer, as we've spoken about before, is the highest margin profile component of the entire portfolio. And more and frankly, aftermarket is right there with it. So when that consumed - you know, when that comprises a healthier component of the mix, you can see kind of the margin profile that goes with it. And then we've obviously done a lot with regards to i2V, you know, self-help IRX initiatives which you're seeing kind of play themselves out. I think, as we think about Q4, and as we mentioned, again, consumers still expect to be strong, but this becomes a very typical, very strong golf shipment quarter. And golf just does frankly, have a slightly lower margin profile comparatively speaking to the consumer end and the aftermarket components. So again, we would see, expect to see that kind of margin profile normalize a little bit, but that's really mix-driven, but even then, you're going to see, you know, meaningful margin expansion year-over-year. So again, we're quite pleased with kind of how the team is executing both on the self-help productivity side, as well as just frankly at the top lines of the equation. Ivana Delevska : Got it. And then one question on IT&S. How do margins compare between your core businesses, Compressors and Blowers versus Power Tools and other? And what do you see as medium to long-term targets for each? Vikram Kini : Sure. So you know, we don't break down necessarily the sub components of the portfolio, but let's just say that, I think that the, you know, as we'd historically said, the Compressor, Blower and Vacuum Components actually all have I'd say fairly comparable margin profile. While there tends to be a little bit of mix between the original equipment and aftermarket, what you can expect here is though, Compressors tend to have a higher aftermarket component, which tends to be a little bit healthier margin, and as such to the Compressor, Blower, Vacuum piece tends to be a little bit healthier. Clearly, components of portfolio like Power Tools tend to be a lower margin profile. We've said that before, but I think we're quite encouraged by the steps between that taken Vicente mentioned at the prepared remarks, you know, 270 basis points of sequential improvement as we move from Q2 to Q3. I think in terms of medium to longer-term targets, like we said, we feel very good about where the profile of the total segment is, kind of reaching that mid-20s range. You know, I think that's, you know, frankly want to see kind of those levels, and we have frankly a lot of opportunity with regards to the synergy execution and things like that, that are going to kind of start delivered in 2021 onwards. So, again, we haven't put a formal as a target, nor have we put a cap on it. But I think we're encouraged by what we're seeing. And yes, we would frankly also expect that the core component of the portfolio of Compressors, Blowers and Vacuums to have a higher margin profile in the balance. Ivana Delevska : Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions. I would like to turn the call over to Vicente Reynal for closing remarks. Operator : Thank you, and thank you, everyone for the interest in Ingersoll Rand and I'm very appreciative of the tremendous amount of work that our employees are doing here, even in these kind of difficult environment and delivering tremendous results. So thank you, and thanks to our employees. Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Vikram Kini : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2020 Fourth Quarter and Total Year Earnings Call. I\u2019m Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer; and joining me is the Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday that we will reference during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the Forward-Looking Statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today\u2019s remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, which are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today\u2019s call, we will provide a Company strategy and integration update, review our Company and segment financial highlights and offer 2021 guidance. For today\u2019s Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik, and good morning to everyone. Before we start, I want to take a moment to reflect. Think about it, one-year ago today, we were five days away from day one as an integrated company of Gardner Denver and the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment. And what a year we selected to take on a transformational transaction. Our newly combined company committed to a purpose to lean on us to help you make life better and a set of values that include having the confidence to take on the most difficult problems with humility and integrity. And little did we know, we will be tested so quickly. Looking back on 2020, the global pandemic was challenging for everyone. We will have to adapt and learn new skill to ensure our essential worker safety as they were to provide mission critical products and services to serve the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we turn to our innovation and creativity to discover new ways to connect with each other with our customers and with our partners. I\u2019m proud of every one of our global employees for their resilience, dedication and determination to think and act like owners and protect and nurture our one-year old organization. Our employees are strong. We adapt quickly and move fast. It is part of our culture, and that is not something you can replicate. It is a competitive advantage and it proved it worked for us this year. The backbone and economic engine is our Ingersoll Rand execution excellence, but it is our employees who trust and lead IRX every single day. And thanks to them, we delivered strong results and stand ready to grow in 2021 and beyond. Starting on Slide 3. Today, we are going to concentrate our remarks around three things : first, how we accelerated our transformation during 2020; second, how we are unlocking our true potential as a company as we successfully pivoted to focus on growth and our portfolio optimization; and third, how our focus on growth is supported through strong business segment performance during Q4 with momentum continuing in Q1. Moving to Slide 4. We have seen this before. It is a framework of building a strong foundation, pivoting to growth and optimizing the portfolio, all guided by our five strategic imperatives, down on the left-hand side. It is a reminder to what we have been executing against to deliver on our commitment. Turning to Slide 5. That framework shows we achieved substantial traction across all five strategic imperatives and pivoted quickly to offence around growth and portfolio optimization, from completing the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction and integrating complementary cultures to awarding one of the largest equity brands ever given to employees in an industrial company and establishing diversity, equity and inclusion goals. Our 2020 accomplishments, especially in the area of human capital management, are a differentiator. We see a broad-based employee ownership as a game-changer. It takes performance to a new level. We are thinking and acting like no other. As one of our core values, it changes the mindset from this is a company I work for to this is my company. It is a massive shift. Employees are highly engaged and active participants in our journey to create long-term value. All of these human capital management priorities are part of why we added operate sustainably as a strategic pillar. And more on that in a minute. We enhanced our portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and also the sale of a majority interest high-pressure solutions segment. Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, we will focus on several areas. We are ahead of plan on our integration as we enter year two. We are increasing our integration cost synergy target by $50 million to $300 million. On growth, we are bringing together complementary products across businesses for strategic niche markets such as work. And we are accelerating new product launches into sustainable industrial markets such as packaging, all of these while we continue to focus on our strong balance sheet to support our inorganic growth strategy through accretive M&A transactions. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6. As we successfully fuel the growth and our portfolio penetration, we are unlocking our maximum potential as a company. Capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus. And I will come back to you with more thoughts on this already, so we are actively discussing this with the Board. To start, last week we signed an agreement to sell a majority interest in our High Pressure Solutions segment. At the time of close, we will receive approximately $300 million while retaining a 45% common equity ownership in the business moving forward. We view the $300 million alone as a good value as it is approximately 24 times 2020 adjusted EBITDA and also represents a solid multiple of 2021 expected adjusted EBITDA. The remaining terms of the deal are confidential, and we are not going to comment further, but we view our remaining equity as pure upside in the medium to long-term. For Ingersoll Rand, the transaction is a meaningful step forward in our transformation. It materially reduces our direct exposure to the cyclical upstream oil and gas market to less than 2% of revenue and result in a much more predictable business performance, and all of these while removing minimal current earnings from the company. On the M&A front, at the beginning of this month, we the purchase of Tuthill Vacuum and Blower Systems. The transaction is highly complementary to our vacuum and blower technologies and will operate under the iconic and premium brands of MD Pneumatics and Kinney Vacuum Pumps. As we pivoted to growth, we accelerate investment in IoT, e-commerce and digitalization. Last week, you may have seen our announcement with Google Cloud for a five-year collaboration to advance connectivity across our portfolio. With real client data and machine learning both smarter and more innovative products, we are strengthening our capabilities to help our customers be successful for the long-term. Along with recent new products and wins in strategic end markets we have recently shared with you, like hydrogen, life sciences and oil for compressor products, our work with Google represents one way we are positioning ourselves for accelerated growth in 2021 and beyond. Unlocking our key potential means being focused on sustainable technologies in high-growth end markets. And it also means being focused on our commitment to environmental, social and governance principle as we see now on Slide 7. Yesterday, we joined a growing number of companies who are embracing their leadership responsibility to help confront the global threat of climate change. The differentiator is that we are placing some ambitious milestones for our ESG efforts. We were committing to be net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, but getting to 60% of this goal in less than 10-years, by 2030. In addition, we have also committed to targets for water and waste reduction. As our corporate state lean on us to help you make life better. We want to be an active participant on this important cause for the long-term sustainability of our planet. A key advantage for us is using IRX to deliver the performance needed to achieve our environmental goals. We will provide an ongoing cadence of transparency and disclosure in our second annual sustainability report being published at the end of May. I will now turnover the call to Vik to provide an update on financials. Vik. Vikram Kini : Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8. Q4 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with ongoing signs of improvement across industrial end markets. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q4. Total company orders and revenue increased 12% and 13%, respectively, as compared to Q3 levels, with strong double-digit orders momentum across each of the segments. In addition, the company continued to drive outperformance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $344 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%. This was 150 basis point improvement from Q3. And on a year-over-year basis, despite mid-single-digit revenue decline, margins increased 300 basis points. And when adjusted to exclude the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 350 basis points. Given the strong close in Q4, we had our best performance of the year in terms of managing decrementals with adjusted EBITDA increasing by $30 million on a year-over-year basis despite the $78 million decrease in revenue. As we have stated before, quality of earnings has been a key focus, and you can see the continued momentum we had throughout 2020 on this metric. Cash flow on the balance sheet was another highlight for the quarter as free cash flow increased to $397 million, yielding total liquidity of $2.7 billion at year-end. Moving to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 2% and revenue declined 7%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. This is a meaningful improvement from the comparable 8% and 11% declines we saw in the third quarter. IT&S, Precision and Science Technologies and Specialty Vehicle Technology segment all saw positive organic orders growth in the quarter. Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 2% FX-adjusted orders growth with both the Americas and EMEA regions showing mid-single-digit orders improvement for core compressor, blower and vacuum equipment. Precision and Science saw a 6% adjusted orders growth in the quarter, the highest level reached during the entire year. Continued strength in the product lines like medical and Dosatron, both of which saw double-digit growth, were the major drivers given niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences and water. Specialty Vehicles saw continued strong orders performance, up 21% ex FX. Specialty Vehicle showed positive orders growth each quarter in 2020, and Q4 saw a nice balance with continued strong momentum in consumer vehicles as well as double-digit growth in Gulf as well as aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.01 for the quarter. This was much better than the prior year level of 0.92. Given the typical seasonality we see in the fourth quarter, with strong shipments and book-to-bill below one, we are encouraged by the Q4 2020 book-to-bill being above one as it sets up a healthy backlog moving into 2021. The company delivered $344 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 10% versus prior year. The IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicle segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and had strong triple-digit margin expansion. The HPS segment continued to show profitability despite depressed revenue levels and performed largely in-line with expectations. And finally, corporate costs came in at $32 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations and relatively flat to prior year. Turning to Slide 10. Quickly touching on the total year. FX-adjusted orders and revenue were down 9% and 13%, respectively, due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 in both the IT&S and Precision and Science segments as well as the known downturn in the upstream energy markets, which impacted the HPS segment. Despite these headwinds, the business delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%, which is up 60 basis points versus the prior year or 180 basis points excluding HPS. This speaks to the team\u2019s ability to execute during different business cycles as full-year detrimental were limited to only 15%. And the three core segments of IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles all delivered triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. This is only possible to the power of IRX as an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $397 million, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing working capital improvements. Inventory management was a particular highlight with a reduction of nearly $60 million as we are starting to see benefits of many of the operational efficiency projects the team has been deploying as well as the benefit of the improving commercial environment. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million, and free cash flow included $17 million of outflows go into the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at two times, which was a 0.5 time improvement as compared to prior quarter due to both the stronger cash generation in the quarter as well as the improvement in LTM EBITDA due to the strong Q4 finish. We have now reduced leverage the same levels we had prior to the RMT and have line of sight to leverage coming down closer to 1.8 times once the HPS sale concludes. On the right side of the page, you see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.7 billion based on approximately $1.8 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. In total, liquidity has now increased nearly $1.2 billion from the end of Q1. This gives us considerable flexibility to continue our strategy of M&A, coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. Moving to Slide 12. We continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are increasing our overall target by $50 million to $300 million. To-date, we have already executed approximately $175 million of annualized synergies, which is approximately 60% of the overall target and a $25 million increase from prior quarter. In total, we delivered approximately 40% of our new $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% of the $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. The $50 million increase in the target is largely driven from procurement and direct material-oriented initiatives as the team continues to make good strides both on leveraging the larger spend base of the company as well as executing on the ITV funnel. ITV is a particular success story. Over the past six months, we have conducted over 20 virtual events with our commercial product management and manufacturing teams to both build the funnel and start executing on tangible savings. On the right of the page, we reported each quarter in terms of our progress on managing detrimental margins across the business, and Q4 was no different. I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Rick. Moving to Slide 13 and starting with Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, organic orders were up 1% and revenue down 8%, leading to a book-to-bill of 0.98 times. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 12% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, were also up 210 basis points sequentially versus Q3. Let me provide more detail on order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up mid-single-digits. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up mid-single digit. Oil-free order rates slightly outperformed those of oil-lubricated and stick to the airports of leveraging the company\u2019s expanded oil-free portfolio and taking advantage of new channels. Regarding the regional split for orders in compressors. In the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up low single-digit while Latin America was down high single-digit. Mainland Europe was up high single-digits, while India, Middle East and Africa saw a nice inflection of high-teens as compared to being down double-digits in the past two quarters. Asia Pacific continued to perform well with orders up mid-single-digits, driven by mid-single-digit growth in China and relatively flattish growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In terms of vacuums and blowers, orders were up mid-teens with strong double-digit growth in the industrial banking and blower portfolio as well as mid-single-digit growth in the longer-cycle Nash Garo va business. Moving next to power tools and lifting. The total business was down low-teens in orders. The tools part of the business was down high single-digits in orders compared to down high-teens in Q3. We expect to pivot to positive orders growth in the first half of the year driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities. On the right side, you will see three market drivers coming to our go- forward segment : sustainability, digitization and shifting demographics. For each segment, I will comment on how they are stepping forward to address these drivers. For IPS, the Google Cloud announcement I referenced earlier is a prime example of how the business is expanding comprehensive data digitization that will help increase the customers\u2019 ability to improve energy efficiency to support them on achieving their own greenhouse gas emission reduction. Let me move now to Slide 14 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 5%, driven by the medical and Dosatron businesses, which were both up double-digits as well as healthy growth in the water and general industrial markets from products like Milton Roy. The momentum on our Hygiene Solutions continues to build, and we saw some good orders and funnel activity in this rapidly changing end market. Revenue was down 8% organically with a major driver being two large projects for a large aerospace and defense company that shipped in Q4 of 2019 within the legacy PFS business. Despite the revenue decline, the PSCT delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, this segment has already generated a very respectable 27.7% adjusted EBITDA margin back in Q1 of 2020. But we are very pleased with how the team continues to transform this businesses now in Q4 with comparable revenue as what we did in Q1. This segment is generating 310 basis points more margin. Looking at the market drivers, the position on science team is meeting the demand for more sustainable energy sources and launching in new markets like hydrogen. From a digital perspective, many of our new pump technology can be multi-controlled, leading and dosing to ensure the safe and reliable dispensing of chemicals for markets around food sanitation and animal health. And the segment\u2019s medical business is answering the demand for precise liquid handling technology to help advance personalized medicine research. Moving to Slide 15 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q4 was another strong quarter for the Specialty Vehicle team. Orders were up 21% organically and continue to get stronger throughout the quarter as the consumer offering continues to gain momentum and market share. We also saw an inflection on growth that continued into Q1. We believe our lithium-ion battery launch is clearly a market leader, and we are taking share in the market. Organic revenue was up 8% with improvements across not only vehicles, but also aftermarket products and services. We feel we are in the early stages here and see potential as we expand the info base that can be served ongoing with parts and accessories. Adjusted EBITDA of $46 million increased 40% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.7%, and this represents a 420 basis point improvement versus prior proving that IRX can be applicable to any business to generate solid improvements. We continue to see runway into the future as the team continues to move rapidly on accelerating initiatives like new product launches and end-user life-cycle management. In terms of - market drivers, the segment is recognizing and responding to the sustainability and efficiency demand for zero-emission vehicles to replace gas engine vehicles. For example, in Q4, we saw more than 80% unit growth for lithium cars versus the prior year. Digitization is critical also as owners expect connected cars to provide real-time data on their vehicle. The data can range from maintenance information, location-based data or infotainment services. And from a demographic shift perspective, we are seeing a higher demand for families to own recreation, zero-emission consumer vehicles used for short distance driving at low speeds. Moving to Slide 16 and the High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed largely in-line with expectations in the midst of continued lower demand in the oil and gas market. Order and revenue were down 51% and 42%, respectively, which was an improvement over the decline seen both in Q2 and Q3. Nearly 90% of the revenue base continues to come from aftermarket parts and services. And the business delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million and incremental of 40% despite the meaningful revenue decline. Beginning with the first quarter of 2021, and due to the recently announced sale, the HPS business will be classified as discontinued operations in all future periods, and we will retroactively adjust the comparable prior periods. Within the income statement, the historical HPS business results will be presented on a single financial statement line below operating income. And upon deal closure, we will account for our 45% interest under the equity method of accounting. This means we will record a proportionate share of the HPS business income or loss for the period through a single financial statement line below operating income. Moving to Slide 17. We will review guidance for 2021. Given the pending sale, the HPS segment will not be included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Starting with revenue growth, we expect total Ingersoll Rand revenue to be up high single-digits to low double-digits on an actual quarter basis. This is comprised of mid-single-digit organic growth across each of the three segments. FX is expected to be a low single-digit volume for the business, on a total year basis given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currency like euro and British pound. FX assumption are based on December 2020 exit rates. And finally, we expect the M&A impact to be approximately $60 million, driven primarily by the Tuthill acquisition in the IPS segment. From a patient perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up low double-digits, driven by the prior year impact of COVID-19, particularly in China in Q1 2020 and the rest of the world starting in Q2 of 2020. In addition, the FX tailwinds will be most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to normalize a bit comparatively, but still be up high single-digits. As is typical, we expect Q1 to be comparatively lighter than the remaining 2021 quarters. Based on these revenue assumptions, we are introducing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.26 billion. The range includes an expectation for approximately $100 million of incremental transaction-related cost synergies with slight offsets due to two factors : First, approximately $35 million to $40 million of temporary costs taken out in 2020 returning to the P&L and second, some expected material and logistics inflation given current dynamic across the global supply chain. We continue to monitor overall inflation and will take appropriate incremental pricing actions if and when warranted. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of revenues. And finally, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24% as compared to the 24.3% rate seen in 2020. Moving to Slide 18. As we wrap today\u2019s call, I reflect in 2020 as a year that change ourselves. We took every measure to prioritize our employee safety while enabling our essential workers to maintain their livelihood and that is because our employees mean to us. We concentrated on delivering our mission-critical products and services to the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic side because our customers needed us. And we even proactively reached out to area healthcare providers to donate the use of sub-degree triggers to store COVID-19 vaccines because communities also needed us. So we take a role as a sustainably minded employee-owned industry leader services as can be seen by our clear commitment to reducing our impact on the environment. And I\u2019m proud of every side of team member in our company for how we came together and deliver to protect the interest of all of our stakeholders this year. What a difference this year makes. In the threshold of our one-year anniversary, it is been a momentous ride, created a differentiated culture and improving the performance of our company. I\u2019m confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Operator : Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question here comes from the line of Nicole Deblase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe we could start by just talking about if you guys are seeing any impact to production or your supply chain relative to COVID and how confident you feel about the ability to ramp-up as we move into 2Q when presumably growth should be pretty significant? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Nicole, I will say that, I mean, we are clearly not immune to what is happening out there in the supply chain, whether delivering or kind of the logistics side. I think the good news here is, I would say two things. One, we have always said that we are in the region for the region. So we are really co-located our factories to really support our customers in the regions. And for the most part, a lot of our supply chain is really co-located within kind of close proximity of the factory. So that has not been a material impact to us. And I think the second point that it has been good for us is that with the combination of the companies, we have a larger supply chain. And as we have gone through the procurement and the rationalization of suppliers, we are selecting some pretty strong partners that are here to support us from a global perspective and that is kind of leading to having that disruption that perhaps orders are seeing. So in terms of ramping the capacity, we just don\u2019t foresee that to be an issue. I mean for the most part, most of our factories, they operate under one-shift operations. And if we have to expand, that should be just a matter of expanding capacity from incremental shares. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. That is helpful. thanks Vicente. And then when you think about the proceeds from HPS once the divestiture closes or the partial divestiture, is the idea that, that is going to be used completely to pay down debt. I know you mentioned bringing down leverage on a pro forma basis and is that indicative of maybe the M&A pipeline just not being very full right now? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I think, Nicole, as we mentioned, I mean, capital allocation is definitely one of my top priorities. And we are having constant conversation with the Board. We will provide an update here in due course. But yes, I mean, we are very excited where we are. You have seen that we are still playing a pretty large addressable market, highly fragmented. Our M&A funnel is really robust, very strong. And it is just a matter of making sure that we are disciplined with current valuations. But it is something that we are going to remain really active. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, thanks. I will pass it on. Vicente Reynal : Thank you Nicole. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Michael Halloran : Hey good morning everyone. So let\u2019s start on the cost outside. So uptick the target from 250 million to 300 million funnel, still 350 million, but obviously, you are talking about some upside to that. So two things. One, can you talk through the components of what you have seen that give you confidence to raise it from 250 to 300? And then also maybe talk about what some of the things that are out there that would raise the synergy target funnel above that 350 million level? Vikram Kini : Yes. Sure, Mike. This is Vik. I will take that one. I think, like we said, we had a larger funnel you know Vicente mentioned in course of $350 million. And I think the teams have been executing really well. I think a large part of the, what I call, structural actions that are really behind us. Really, most of those have taken much more closer to the merger. And really, what you have seen the momentum building on here is really execution across really the more direct material-focused components of that funnel. So really, what I will call, procurement as well as now really getting deep to the ITBs on the equation. So I think a lot of what you are seeing is just good execution. Like we always said, we have a larger funnel. I would say that, no, not every idea in the funnel is going to necessarily translate straight to the bottom line. But the team is executing really well, we saw really good momentum, including in fourth quarter. Our annualized synergy number actually increased in fourth quarter compared to where we were in Q3. And so it gave us the confidence to be able to increase the synergy target up to $300 million. I think in terms of the second part of your question, what would give us kind of increased confidence to increase ahead of us here is items like procurement, ITV and footprint. And we have always been very disciplined in saying that the footprint piece of this equation was always going to come more so towards the back end of the kind of three-year plan. Nothing has changed in that perspective. But I think now as we are moving into kind of our second year as a combined company, now the teams are really starting to kind of build out that footprint funnel and start to see kind of some of that momentum. So I think that is really, time will tell in terms of being able to kind of increase the number from there, but we are optimistic about where we have gone this far. Michael Halloran : Thank you. And then the second one here. When you think about assumptions embedded in the revenue guidance for the year, maybe just talk a little bit about what the cadence looks like. Obviously, first half, second half dynamics, you laid out in prepared remarks as well as the slide deck. But are you seeing normal sequential, are you assuming a pretty conservative ramp through the year? Maybe just give some context on what type of environment is embedded in the assumptions as you look at the three units. Vikram Kini : Yes. Mike, I think in general, I think what you can expect is a quarterly phasing in terms of revenue be quite comparable to what we have seen in 2020 in terms of percent of sales per quarter. And what you typically see there is Q1 is typically the lightest quarter as customers kind of reload budgets and things of that nature as well as the Chinese New Year holidays in the first quarter. Second and third quarter, in between, and Q4 typically becomes the heaviest quarter. Again, for the same dynamics that we have seen historically as well as some of our, I would say, larger project businesses tend to ship more so in the fourth quarter or the second half of the year. So again, I don\u2019t think anything is largely different in that respect. When you think about the kind of overall equation. And 2020 is probably a pretty good proxy to use in terms of the quarterly phasing and applying that to 2021. Michael Halloran : So if I hear you right then, you are basically assuming normal sequential from the current run rate. No real acceleration in the environment from an underlying perspective for the year. Vikram Kini : Yes, I think that is a fair way to describe it. Like we mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think we continue to see the overall kind of industrial demand environment improving sequentially kind of just through Q4. I think as you look at it in the context of 2021, we see a fairly similar cadence to what we saw in prior year. Michael Halloran : Sure. Thank Vik, thanks Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just starting off with the adjusted EBITDA guide for the year. Just wanted to confirm that, that implies around 30% incremental margin or so. And then I understand there is $100 million of extra cost synergies as a tailwind for the EBITDA. Maybe give any color around the headwinds embedded in that guide from, say, that the scale of temporary costs coming back, any kind of input cost headwind, that sort of thing. Vikram Kini : Yes. Sure, Julian. I will take that one. So I think in terms of the incremental that we are expecting on a total year basis, on an all-in basis, I would say, growth as well as the some of the synergies as well as some of the other cost headwinds, it is probably closer to about a 35% incremental or slightly higher depending on some of the quarters. But it is a little bit closer to 35% is kind of the implied incremental on an all-in basis, which we actually see is pretty healthy given kind of the puts and takes. And it does, of course, include reinvestment back in the business as we are kind of focused on sustainable organic growth as we move forward. I think in terms of kind of the moving pieces, I think you hit it on the head here. In addition to just kind of the organic growth in the M&A and some of the FX tailwinds that we called out in guidance, a couple of pieces I would probably include : one, the $100 million that you spoke to in terms of the incremental synergy savings. That is the year two of our transaction-related integration savings. The second item then on the headwinds would really be the $35 million to roughly $40 million of temp costs really coming back into the equation, really ramping as we move through the back half of the year. And then we have baked in a nominal amount of inflation. We are not necessarily quantifying the exact dollar amount. But as you would expect, and as Vicente mentioned, we are seeing some of the kind of normal, I would say, supply chain and logistics-oriented inflation that you would expect. So those are probably the major pieces in terms of the, I would say, the components that we are seeing. And I think that hopefully kind of characterizes the components. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then maybe my second question, just around the free cash flow was very, very strong in 2020. Just wanted to confirm sort of what is left in terms of cash costs to achieve synergies? And maybe what the phasing of that is embedded in your free cash flow in sort of 2021 and 2022. Vikram Kini : Yes. Sure. Julian, I think we can keep it relatively high level. I mean we do definitely have, I would say, a fair amount of, what I will call, a continued integration of the company as well as synergy delivery, particularly on the footprint side. So again, I think we have been saying, roughly speaking, on average, about $20 million to $30 million per quarter has typically kind of been what you have seen in terms of cash costs going out the door for execution. I don\u2019t think that is a bad placeholder to use for 2021 as you look forward. So again, I think the equation still largely holds in terms of the expectations for the savings and the ultimate amount of cash costs going out the door. The only difference is we have really taken up the synergy number. We don\u2019t really feel like we need to increase the amount of cash out the door that we are expecting to spend to be able to deliver it. So again, I think we are pretty encouraged by how we have been managed to execute to a higher number in terms of synergies, but continue to keep the kind of cash outflow is pretty disciplined. But remember, we do have the footprint piece of the equation ahead of us, which, again, does tend to be a little bit more on the cost side. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. good morning everyone. I just wondering if we could come back to the kind of the margin discussion a little bit. And if you could elaborate a little bit on what you are expecting for price realization over the course of 2021. And just to be clear on your comments about cost, were those kind of inflationary pressures net of pricing actions? Perhaps you could just provide a little more color on that. Vikram Kini : Jeff, let me kind of give you a little bit of color on the price. We generated price in the fourth quarter. I mean we have said it very well that our products are such a mission-critical in the entire process that I would have been highly strategic on the price equation that we will continue to do so as we go into 2021. And Vik, do you want to comment about the headwind here? Vikram Kini : Yes. So Jeff, I think the way I would think about the headwinds are, we view those things as kind of separate from the pricing equation that I just mentioned. Net-net, we do expect to be price cost positive. That is kind of the trend you have seen historically in the business. And I think the other thing to mention here is to the degree inflationary pressure potentially become higher, if that is really how things play out, we are not seeing that just yet, but we want to continue to look at price as a lever to be able to pass that through. So I think right now we see everything that is kind of price cost on sort of inflation at this point in time. Jeffrey Sprague : And could you also give us some thoughts on what you actually expect HPS to do in 2021? Vicente, I think you kind of mentioned a multiple on 2021. I didn\u2019t catch it when you said it, but that implied an earnings number. Just thinking about what kind of placeholder should be coming through on equity income. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Jeff, we are not providing the guidance on HPS in the 2021 or anything further in terms of kind of the details of the transaction. What I said on the remarks is that when you look at the $300 million of cash, equals to roughly 24 times EBITDA of 2020. And also, it implies a pretty good multiple on based on expected 2021, but we are not guiding to any specific number for 2021. Jeffrey Sprague : I\u2019m sorry, can I just ask one more quick one. Backwards were characterized as healthy. But can you just give some context where they stand, maybe backlogs as a percent of kind of forward projected sales, are they normal in that regard, do they give you kind of comfort and visibility in the top line forecast? And I will stop there. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Jeff, when you look at the 3 segments, you can characterize, I will start with maybe the Specialty Vehicles. You have seen the bookings momentum. I mean definitely, they are coming in really strong into 2021 with very, very robust kind of backlog. ITS saw some very good large long-cycle orders as well in the fourth quarter. So that really - and also with some of the orders that we received in the third quarter that kind of gets shippable into 2021. So the backlog in ITS is coming in also better than what we have seen historically. And the Precision and Science is really more kind of more on the short cycle. They don\u2019t have that long cycle with the exception of the hydrogen orders. And those, we saw a few of them that we called out on some press releases in the third quarter. And we continue to see the final momentum of that continue to grow. So all-in-all, we feel pretty good position in terms of where we have the backlog coming into 2021. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi good morning guys. Yes, I guess we have come a long way from talking about fluid end pricing. So just really congrats on the overall portfolio transition the last few years. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So in kind of the compressor, vacuum, blower or more traditional side of IT&S, maybe a bit stronger on orders than you would normally see at this stage of recovery. I mean comps aren\u2019t really even truly easy yet. I know you are not big in semiconductor, maybe relative to your other big competitor out there. But can you maybe contextualize what is going on in the market and why orders are bouncing back so hard. It doesn\u2019t seem like it would be capacity for your customers, but some sort of debottlenecking or near-shoring, or like any way you would characterize what seems to be kind of earlier strength? Vicente Reynal : Yes. So we are obviously excited with what the team has been able to accomplish there. As we have kind of articulated in the past, that vacuum and blower, as you very well said, is mostly industrial. We don\u2019t really play in the semiconductor market. And it is really due to the nature of the kind of the niche business that we have in terms of applications. And the team on the vacuum side, they continue to win new OEM accounts. And these OEM accounts are basically new, pretty unique applications. And the blower, some good momentum on water and wastewater treatment facilities as well as some other kind of niche end markets that we have been very actively engaged in opening. And when you combine some of that with the activity that we are driving with demand generation in this kind of highly fragmented end market, it is really what is causing that kind of good solid momentum to perhaps show the ability to take some market share. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That is helpful. And then I guess just speaking to that fragmented end market, you guys are kind of a rarity in U.S. industrials that you have been able pretty consistently defined properties over the last several years at pretty steep discounts on valuation to yourselves. I know the properties in general tend to be on the smaller side, but are there a lot of Hills, Albins, Runtechs out there to be found. Like is this a flywheel you guys can keep going, because obviously, the balance sheet and cash flow are in good shape. It is more of a question of do you have a place to consistently play it? Vicente Reynal : I will say yes, Josh, it is. It is something that we spent a lot of time, even in 2020, improving our process, how focused we are with process and our M&A process from stage zero in terms of ideas and cultivation has dramatically improved. Also the level of investments that we have done with the team across the different segments to really support more penetration of M&A and the leverage of even IRX as a way to every week, we kind of review some key critical performance indicators on things that we are adding to the funnel and how the funnel velocity is working, particularly in M&A, I think that is working really well. And so to answer your question, yes, I mean I think we see some continued pretty good momentum on the funnel activity and what could translate into acquisition for us. And yes, we are also very prudent on the price. We continue to be highly disciplined on that. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Perfect. Thanks for the color. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Robert Wertheimer : Thank. Good morning everyone. My question is a little bit just on the Google Cloud announcement that you made. I\u2019m curious if that brings you new revenue models in the next five-years. I\u2019m a little bit curious if it puts you ahead of competition, how you thought about the decision strategically and how it relates to how you interact with customers? Thanks. Vicente Reynal : Sure. Yes, Rob, to your question, absolutely. I mean this should help us become more creative on new revenue streams over the next five-years. And when you think about it, the potential of what we have here is that in North America alone, when you look at all of our assets, when you look at particularly the segment of Industrial Technologies and Precision Science, we have over one million assets in the field in North America alone. So as we continue to find ways on how we connect them and how we harvest the data and how we leverage now the supercomputing power from Google Cloud to be able to create better predictive analytics and better revenue streams, I think that is the powerful of what we see here over the next few years. And we are very excited that it is a fairly rigorous process. We were able to select Google Cloud as one of those partners that can help us really harvest a lot of these data and analytics over the next few years to come. Robert Wertheimer : Do you have any comment on how connected that asset base is today, what you are doing internally and what you gain with Google. Is the groundwork done for the analytics to start or do you have a lot to invest? Vicente Reynal : So some of the groundwork has been done on the compressors. I think the excitement here too as well as now as, let\u2019s say, that you go to specific end markets. And we alluded to some of these on our last earnings call on how when you look at the water, wastewater. We have multiple of assets that could be connected to really optimize the entire process. This is what we see the powerful of realizing with the Google analytics, but we are the early stages on that one. Robert Wertheimer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Hey so obviously, great job navigating a really, really tough environment this year. I guess as I\u2019m thinking about the medium term for you guys from a margin perspective, you exited the year really strong in both ITS and PST. I\u2019m just wondering, like how do we think about the medium-term targets for both of those segments just given the upside synergies? Like can ITS be like sustainably in the high 20s? I\u2019m just kind of think about this like really kind of beyond 2021 into 2022, 2023. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Joe, to answer the question specifically, yes, I mean, we haven\u2019t come out with a specific guidance in terms of the medium term of where we see the margin profile to come. But I mean look, ITS, I mean, finishing the fourth quarter at 26% margin. And if you remember batch in the Garner Denver days, we said that industrial segment, we wanted to be in the mid-20s. But we also said that mid-20s is not the cap, and that is just kind of a milestone. And we see more room for improvement from there on. When you kind of open the door inside ITS, I mean, as you know, we are running P&Ls, and we have definitely P&Ls that are way above that kind of mid-20s. So we know that we have a model on how to - an impact on how to get to that kind of high 20s. In the Precision and Science, I have made some commentary, very proud with the team. When we started with that business in Q1 of this year, the business was doing a respectable high 20s, and we finished at above 30 on an exit rate. So do we see a potential on that continuing? I will make the same analogy back the medical business when we had that with Gardner Denver, we were in maybe the mid-20s and we ended up in the 30s. And again, we also said that, that was just kind of a milestone, but more room for us to improve on that. So we will comment here maybe sometime soon in terms of kind of how we think about the medium guidance for some of those segments, but we definitely see continued room for improvement from here and beyond. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. No, that is helpful. Great to hear. I guess my one follow-up question, I had to ask you about the portfolio just given the announcement in HPS. So I guess maybe two questions. One, just on HPS and keeping the 45% ownership here, like I guess, what is the kind of thought process. Is it to play in some of the upside and potentially then monetize it in the future. And then how are you thinking about the rest of the portfolio because there are other pieces. But this maybe don\u2019t necessarily fit longer term, but I would be curious to hear any thoughts around that as well? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Joe, I think we are very excited with the HPS for multiple reasons. I mean one, we found a great partner with AIT. And we are also very excited with the team on them becoming that pure play in the upstream oil and gas with a very premium product and very premium business. I think we view a really good because we were able to lock in some cash, but at the same time, as you said, participate in any of the potential upside that could come. I mean as you know, there is multiple cycles that can happen here. And as we continue to see, we get that 45% participation in terms of what could come next. And in terms of your other questions, I mean, clearly, as we said in the past, I mean we look at all possible scenarios. And to the degree that we can create shareholder value by doing something creative with some of the businesses that might not be that properly aligned, we won\u2019t hesitate to explore those options. And I think we just want to be thoughtful and strategic and disciplined on how we do that. Joseph Ritchie : Makes sense and thank you guys. Vicente Reynal : Thank you Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Stephen Volkmann : Hi good morning guys. Maybe just back to Joe\u2019s margin question quickly. Any difference amongst the segments and how we should think about incrementals for 2021? Vikram Kini : Yes. I will take that one. I think the way to think about it is, I think ITS will probably be, at least from a year-over-year perspective, probably the healthiest overall just because, frankly, a lot of the cost synergies, as we have mentioned before, are much more isolated or centralized, I should say, in the IT&S segment. In terms of the Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles businesses, the incrementals there will be a little bit more muted just on a year-over-year basis. Frankly, a little bit of balancing in terms of the mix, in terms of the top line. If you remember on the Precision Science, we did see a pretty strong in-swell of COVID-related demand in 2020. On the medical side, that actually came at a pretty good margin premium. That is obviously not expected to recur in 2021, replace it a little bit more what I will call general industrial and then obviously, some of the investments back in. And then the SVG business kind of comparable as the commercial and Gulf businesses tend to kind of normalize, you are not going to necessarily see that mix be quite as what it was in 2020. And we obviously continue to invest for new products and growth. So again, I think IT&S is where you will see a little bit more pronounced. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. Great. That is helpful. And then if I could just ask about kind of recurring revenue and services and maybe both near and longer term. I mean are you guys able to get out and do the servicing. Do we have some pent-up demand there and then longer term, are we getting those types of contracts? I know that is been a target for you guys, just maybe an update there. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Steve, I think we definitely are able to get out there and do a lot of these service work, and we have a fantastic team that being created not only by doing that physically, but in some cases, even remotely as we kind of connect more and more machines. And as we continue to go forward, absolutely, I mean, we see a lot of good potential here based on our info base and the technologies that we are launching with IoT and then now here further expanding with the connectivity with Google Cloud, being able to be more pronounced on how we can create some unique service agreements. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. I will leave it here. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you Stephen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Not a whole lot to really run through here. But I did want to go back to the synergies. And obviously, procurement has been a big source of cost savings. With the sort of the supply chain issues you have seen out there, is that limiting in any way your ability to get procurement savings in the near-term? Doesn\u2019t feel like it is, but just wanted to set in there. And then the second part SG&A is relatively small part of the synergy mix. I\u2019m just wondering now you have had IRN for a year now whether you see a bit more potential for G&A? Vikram Kini : Yes. Sure, Nigel. I will take both of those. I think on the procurement front, like we said, there is some inflation in the system, but does that prohibit us from being able to deliver on the procurement savings. And I will just make that even broader, the direct material equation, whether it be classical procurement from leveraging a larger spend base as well as now the ITV savings funnel. I think the answer is no. You have seen the continued momentum. Obviously, the conviction in raising the synergy target of $300 million. I think that we have a pretty good line of sight and pretty good conviction in being able to deliver those procurement and direct material-oriented numbers. And then on the G&A side, again, I would say there is always room for opportunities. But I think, like we said, the majority of the more structural-related savings and cost take-out really saw that much more executed in 2020. So again, I would say that part is kind of largely behind us. But we will always look for rooms for optimization. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. And then just going back to Joe\u2019s question on the portfolio. Just curious just given the performance of SVT, much better than we would have expected, probably to better than what you expected as well. How is your view on SVT evolve over the past 12-months and how confident are you that this kind of performance can be sustained beyond reopening? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I mean I think I put it in a couple of ways there, Nigel. I mean I think what you see on the LDT is clearly great performance-based on product launches that the team has done on the consumer side. When you look at also commentary that we made, even the Q4, also very good momentum in gold, again, based on new product launches that they have done, particularly with lithium battery cars that they have launched. So we feel that the team has taken some good market share. And they are not done yet. I mean what is COVID an accelerator or accentuate the decision-making for some consumers to really buy now versus maybe buy later? Yes, it could be. But I think what is exciting is that the momentum has continued. What is also exciting is that the team is getting ready to make some pretty good product launches in 2021, not only the consumer, but also the utility market. That could play very well not only in the U.S., but also in Europe. So I think the team is really hitting in all cylinders. We are supporting with great investments and more to come. Nigel Coe : Great. I will leave it there. Thanks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Nathan Jones : Good morning everyone A couple of questions on investments in growth here. Can you talk about kind of what kind of level of reinvestment you are making in growth at the moment. And what the kind of potential to take that to your view. And then the 1.5% to 2% CapEx seems a little low to me. Can you talk about opportunity to invest more here in order to drive better growth? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Listen, in terms of investment on growth, multiple ways. One, on the corporate side, I mean, we are continuing to make some pretty good investments on some of our - kind of demand investments on some of our generation activities as well as what you have seen here with the Google Cloud. And then within the businesses, absolutely, we are making some very solid investments. Maybe some that I can highlight on the Precision and Science, the team is making their investments in the hydrogen and really seeing some acceleration in terms of the product launches that they expect to get as well as commercialization by investing on feet on the street throughout the world. And on industrial technology, heavy investment on product launches. Now that we have the combined two companies, particularly on the compressor side, there is going to be a very good cadence of the execution of what we were planning and delivering and working through 2020 that is getting executed and launched now here to the year. And in terms of CapEx, sure, I mean, absolutely. We think 1.5% to 2%. I mean we are typically very light, very light CapEx base. But if the team comes in with a great proposal that provides some very good return on invested capital. We look at ROIC even on a CapEx basis, then we will do it. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then I wanted to ask one about revenue synergies. I know when we put these businesses together, revenue synergies is one avenue for creating value, but was also likely to take longer to really start to kick in. So now at year-end, can you talk about what you have opportunities seen, what successes you have seen and what you expect in the future? Vikram Kini : Sure, Nathan. I will touch at kind of high level. Obviously, we haven\u2019t necessarily quantified growth synergies externally. But clearly, it is strategic, And you have seen a lot of the momentum that we are actually driving, whether it be in the organic growth numbers that we have actually guided to, things around the water end market, some of deleveraging of the oil-free compressor technologies and the kind of expanded channel the market that the combined company has brought. I think that probably each of the segments, particularly in IT&S and Precision Science, have a good funnel of what all growth synergies that they have been executing to that you are really going to kind of see embedded, what I would tell you, within kind of the organic growth numbers. And I think we are really encouraged. You have seen some of the healthy order numbers. We talked about kind of the healthy backlog that we have exiting the year. I think you are starting to see some of those revenue synergies starting to click in. So again, we are not going to necessarily guide them explicitly, but I think you have seen a lot of momentum. And what we are going to continue to do is give you those examples and kind of give you that color as we continue to kind of leverage that kind color as we continue to kind of leverage that kind of revenue synergy base in the combined company. Nathan Jones : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Vicente Reynal : Thank you Nathan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is now open. John Walsh : Hi, good morning everyone. Just one here for me. Going back to the free cash flow guidance for this year, the greater than or equal to the 100%, is there another way you guys could kind of articulate what you are expecting in terms of free cash flow, either through a free cash flow margin or maybe free cash flow as a percent of EBITDA and then how you kind of think about that going forward as well? Vikram Kini : Yes. John, I think we are going guidance we gave was greater than or equal to 100% of adjusted net income, which we think is probably the right way to look at it, clearly taking a lot of the purchase accounting implications and things of that out of the equation. I think if you look, for example, at 2020, how we are able to deliver, we were quite pleased. Obviously, we saw some pretty good headwinds - I\u2019m sorry, some good tailwinds in the context, you know probably a little bit lower than normal CapEx and some pretty good working capital management. But the good news here, as we look into 2021, we see some strong equal opportunities, whether it be cash interest, which is coming down with all of our fixed interest rate swaps having rolled off in the second half of the year. The tax rate expected to be lower and also some good net working capital opportunity. So again, I think the guidance itself, I think, is pretty prudent. We would expect to see strong cash flow over the course of the entire year, much like you saw in 2020. Obviously, some of the opportunities now though are really starting to click in and some of the things we have mentioned before in terms of really the tax rate and working capital. John Walsh : Great. I will leave it there. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Markus Mittermaier from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Markus Mittermaier : Yes, hi good morning everyone. Just a quick one. On procurement execution, obviously, good to see the incremental $50 million here. Could you remind us what is the total spend base here for direct and indirect. And how far through that spend base are you now roughly in sort of consolidating spend, picking in new suppliers? Just trying to get a sense of visibility here for how far that incremental $50 million goes in that total spend base? Vikram Kini : Yes. No, sure, I mean, so we do roughly a little bit above $2 billion. It is kind of the mark that we said that we were going to do in terms of RFQs and negotiation and stuff like that. And we are maybe three-quarter of the way through there. So we still have another portion that we still need to go through the process. As you can imagine, it is just a lot of detail that the team is going through. So we still have some way to go to cover all that $2 billion plus. Markus Mittermaier : Great. That is very helpful. And then second one, if I may. Just on compressor, then a follow-up to the earlier discussion on order intake in box sticks out to me, particularly that high single-digit Europe order intake. Is the positive mix for you guys in Europe or is there some share gains versus some of the, obviously, our strong European peers? How should we think about that in the quarter? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I think the team is really executing pretty well in Europe in the combination of the power of the multiple brands. I mean as you know, in Europe, we had compared as one of the leading brands in Europe and now Ingersoll Rand and also Champion. So we have a multi-brand approach, and we are just leveraging the channel across all the regions. And we feel that, yes, the team is really executing well and potentially taking some share base on the numbers. Markus Mittermaier : Okay. thanks so much. Good luck. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey good morning guys. Could you give us some more color into how you are thinking about growth in the APAC region in 2021, as we know it is a strategic area of growth for you. China looks solid, but maybe the rest of the APAC remains a bit weak since you have a bigger presence there with the merger. Could you update us on your progress in the region? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I mean so obviously, two soft segments there. I mean, China, the team is really doing fantastically well. I mean we have great leadership. We just went through a lot of the accelerated commercialization based on the combination of the two brands and the technologies just here before the Chinese New Year. And it is exciting to see the momentum they are continuing to build. And we always said Southeast Asia is definitely an area of opportunity for us. It is not an area of opportunity for not only Gardner Denver, but also Ingersoll Rand. And now with the combination of the two, we can actually really go after a better channel and better end market channel. So we are being very selective. The team is really appropriately investing in that region. So it is just a lot of good potential opportunity that we see in the Southeast Asia. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And then guidance for mid-single-digit revenue growth for the segments, makes sense for 2021. But just looking at Specialty Vehicle, you mentioned orders strengthened through the quarter, up over 20%. So are you expecting some sort of slowdown there. I know the comparisons are more difficult versus the other segments. But it seems like very good momentum versus that guidance for 2021 in that segment. Vicente Reynal : Yes, it is definitely a very good momentum. I mean I think we are being a bit more prudent in terms of maybe some rationalizatoin coming here in the second half. And as we continue to see momentum from product launches and kind of market activities, we will update. But I think the team is very focused on delivering to the commitments that they have now. And we are just being kind of more prudent based on the normalization that could be seen here in the second half. And normalization, I mean just the tough comps. I mean probably some pretty hefty comps that they need to overcome based on what they were able to execute in 2020. But we see room for improvement. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thank you Andy. Operator : And there are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Vicente for any closing comments. Vicente Reynal : We want to say thank you to everyone for their interest. I know that in these calls, many of our employees across the world join to listen to the excitement of what they have to been able to accomplish. And to all of them, I just want to pass another big thank you. 2020 was a phenomenal year. We are about to celebrate our one-year anniversary altogether here. And what a phenomenal journey it has been. And this is just the beginning. We are getting started, and there is just definitely much more to come. So thank you. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Maxine and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] I would now hand over to your host, Chris Miorin, from Ingersoll Rand to begin. Chris, please go ahead when you are ready. Chris Miorin : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2021 first quarter earnings call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me is Vicente Reynal, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. This is my first earnings call in the Investor Relations role, and I look forward to working with you all. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday that we will reference during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a Company strategy update, review our Company and segment financial highlights and offer updated 2021 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for time for other participants. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. Let me begin by welcoming Chris to his role, as Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris replaces Vik in the role who was appointed to CFO in June of last year. I am delighted to be working alongside both of them. Chris previously led corporate development for the company and played a critical role in accelerating our growth strategy. Most recently with the acquisitions of Tuthill and Albin Pump, as well as the completed divestitures of HPS and announced divestiture of Club Car. I would like to especially thank Chris for his military service in the US Army. During his military career he served as infantry officer and ranger, including a deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Chris also held leadership roles in the Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetery, and served as an aide to the President of the United States. Following the military, Chris held roles in finance and investment banking, before joining us to direct strategy, and corporate development efforts. He is proud veteran who continues to help fellow veterans transitioning from military to civilian life. And he is integral to executing our strategic plan to deliver value for our shareholders. Chris is one example among our 16,000 employees who live our company purpose inside and outside the company. As you see on slide three, anchoring to our purpose is working. We're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You'll hear three key themes today. First, we're accelerating our transformation. It's amazing to think a year ago we closed the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction. And today, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion of value with two strategic divestitures, putting us in a great position to continue our portfolio transformation. Second, you will hear about how we are over-delivering to our expectations. As you will recall, during the down year of 2020, we controlled decremental margins. And now in the upcycle, we're delivering solid incremental margins. We're delivering strong organic growth in orders and revenue. And that illustrates our organic investments in demand generation and new product development are also working. And third, you'll hear how Ingersoll Rand's execution excellence, what we call IRX is becoming our economic engine to unlocking our potential. The processes are only as good as the team that executes them. Culture and human capital management are key differentiators at Ingersoll Rand. We have a highly engaged workforce who act like owners because they are owners. Every day our employees make decisions that demonstrate thinking and acting like owners with the power of IRX behind them. Our employees all around the world deserve sincere thanks for their adaptability, resiliency, dedication and determination. We will continue supporting our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. And on that point, our thoughts are with everyone dealing with pandemic situations, particularly in India right now. Moving to slide four, you see the roadmap we highlighted during our Q3 2020 earnings call. And since then, we have achieved substantial traction. Today I will concentrate remarks around the last two strategies, as we have had a lot of recent momentum across these areas. Starting with operate sustainably and turning to slide five, operating sustainably is one of our strategic pillars, because it engages employees, customers and communities, while delivering shareholder returns. In February, we committed to some aggressive targets around climate goals. I am proud our teams continue to deliver and execute on these goals. For example, last week was Earth Day. And our employees participated in planting more than 3000 trees and collecting over 4000 pounds of waste, while recycling almost 20% of that. However, advancing our ESG journey goes beyond our environmental commitments. It is also about our social and governance actions. Last week, you saw we announced our 2025 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. We set these goals to accelerate and illustrate our commitment to the representation of talent and the career advancement and sense of belonging of all employees. And actually one of the boldest and most belonging acts we have done in support our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts, a connection that some may not really make, was around our $150 million equity last September to all of our employees worldwide. Broad based employee ownership has an equity component, not often explored [ph] Equity grants and broad-based employee ownership such as what we did provide employees a tangible financial stake in company performance. And that benefits employees, families, communities, and the economy at large. Repeatedly, studies show on the representative population, increase their earnings and wealth if they are employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that ties into equity, and how we directly impact global ESG efforts. As I said last quarter, we see broad based employee ownership as a game changer. Our human capital management priorities are part of why we added operate sustainably as a strategic pillar. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals are the latest advancements. And we will use IRX as our key enabler to deliver on these goals, as we do every other critical initiative in our company. Moving to slide six, we have also used IRX to deliver against our capital allocation strategy. And as we see here, the outcome have been extremely effective. On the first of this month, we completed the majority intra sale of the high-pressure solution segment. And a little more than a week later announced an agreement to sell Club Card. IRX enable us to accelerate these transactions and make them happen. We have solid processes executed by engaged teams to ensure we always maximize value creation in an expedited way. And that's our special and unique economic engine. With these divestitures, we're proud the buyers will continue the commitment to employee ownership, which may be a little unusual for this type of transaction. But as I said before, it is important to us on many fronts. And with these divestitures, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion in value. And on slide seven, we see a visual illustrating the volume and timing of transaction milestones in our evolution over the last four years, including the completed and announced divestitures this month. Last quarter, I mentioned capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus. And I have been actively discussing this with our Board. Those discussions continue. And as we have done all along with our capital allocation strategy, we will inform you when there is something significant to share. Along with this today, I'll give you some additional color on how we have enhanced our inorganic growth strategy. So let's look at slide eight. I have mentioned IRX discipline a lot this morning. It is an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business, from our environmental goals and net working capital goals to our new pro development, goals, and our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. IRX has been transformational in helping us with the integration of companies like Tuthill and Albin, as well as helping us with divestitures and accelerating our M&A funnel. You can see our funnel has increased 5x since Q2 of last year. The average revenue of the companies in the funnel has increased by more than 50%. And we're moving potential acquisitions through the funnel much faster. And we have not only been integrated Ingersoll Rand and Garden Denver over the past year, but we have also completed bolt-on acquisitions with Tuthill vacuum and blower system being the most recent one. And we have already seen solid progress with Tuthill, such as growth outside the US where we highlighted that as a great opportunity and already received a multimillion dollar order in Asia Pacific during the first quarter. The simultaneous execution of small growth, acquisitions and divestitures highlights how IRX enabled capabilities to drive significant inorganic growth. I will now turn it over to Vik to provide an update on our financials. Vik? Vik Kini : Thanks, Vicente. Moving to slide nine, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q1. Q1 saw strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued signs of improvement across industrial end markets. Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 29% and 17% respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. In fact, our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company and set us up well as we move into Q2. In addition, the company continued to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as a catalyst, and we remain on track to deliver on our $300 million cost synergy commitment. The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $293 million, a year-over-year improvement of $107 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.4%, up 550 basis point improvement year-over-year. Continuing performance from previous quarters, we also achieve incremental margins of 54% in Q1. What item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solution segment, which was classified as discontinued operations in Q1 with relevant restatements to prior periods. Given the recently completed sale, we will not report on the segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $108 million, up $78 million year-over-year, yielding total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end. Turning to slide 10, for the total company orders increased 25% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX adjusted basis. The IT&S, Precision & Science Technologies and SVT segments all saw double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 13% FX-adjusted orders growth with strong momentum in core compressor technologies, with the Americas showing mid single digit orders improvement, EMEA with low 20% growth, and Asia Pacific with high double-digit improvement. Precision & Science saw 14% FX-adjusted orders growth in the quarter. Continued double-digit growth in product lines like Medical and Dosatron drove this performance, given their niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences, water and animal health, as well as strong performance from the AROo brand, which primarily serves core industrial markets. Specialty vehicles saw exceptionally strong order performance, up 89% excluding FX. The team has shown positive orders growth for five straight quarters and Q1 saw continued strong growth in consumer vehicles, as well as golf offerings and aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.24 for the quarter and improvement from the prior year level of 1.13. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q2. The company delivered $293 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 57% year-over-year. The IT&S, Precision & Science and SVT segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong triple digit margin expansion. And finally, corporate cost came in at $34 million for the quarter consistent with prior expectations. Turned into slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $180 million on a continuing ops basis driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. This compares to free cash flow of $30 million in the first quarter of prior year on a continuing op basis in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter from a free cash flow perspective. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $10 million of outflows related to the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 1.9 times, which was an 0.1 turn improvement as compared to the prior quarter. This included $184 million cash outflow to fund the Tuthill acquisition, which closed in February and did not include the cash received from the HPS divestiture which closed in April. We have line of sight to leverage coming down materially to below one time once the SVC sale is completed, which as mentioned previously, is expected in Q3 of this year. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.6 billion, based on approximately $1.64 billion of cash on hand, and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. With our current liquidity and the additional cash we expect to receive from the HPS and SVT divestitures, we will have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A, coupled with targeted internal investment to drive sustainable organic growth. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segment performance. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. Moving to slide 12 and starting with Industrial Technology and Services. Overall organic quarters were up 11% and revenue up 9%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.14. In addition to orders and revenue growth, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 57% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1% up 610 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margin up 65%. Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20%, a further breakdown into oil free and oil lubricated products show that orders for both were up above 20%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up mid-single digits, while Latin America was up low single digits. Mainland, Europe was up mid-teens, while India, Middle East and Africa saw continued recovery at up high double digits. Asia Pacific continues to perform well, with orders up high double digits, driven by high double-digit growth in both China and across the rest of Asia Pacific. Moving to Vacuum and Blowers, orders were up low double digits on a global basis, with double digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to the power tools and lifting. The total business was up low double digits in orders and pivoted to positive growth, driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improve execution. On the right side, we're highlighting the impact that our technologies are having on our customers sustainability efforts. As you may remember, we acquired Runtech in 2017. Runtech designs and manufacturers energy-efficient solutions primarily for use in pulp and paper mills. Since the acquisition, we have done several new product launches, as well as expanded commercially in other regions, and this has led to a 65% increase in the installed base. This has helped achieve an average of 45% energy savings per installation and save several billions of gallons of water annually across the installed base. Moving to slide 13, and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall organic quarters were up 12% driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which served lab, life sciences and water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits. And we also saw strong performance in our more industrial end market-oriented products, like Milton Roy and ARO. The momentum on our hydrogen solution continues to build and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 7% organically, producing a book-to-bill of 1.2. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $67 million, which was up 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.2%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 59%. From a sustainability perspective, we're highlighting our YZ brand Zero-emission authorization, and YZ Connect. ZO [ph] is an injection system that authorizes natural gas and hydrogen delivered to communities to help safeguard people, as customers replace legacy systems with our new ZO. This product is expected to dramatically eliminate emissions of methane. Our customer's authorization programs are further enhanced by YZ Connect, which provides remote monitoring capability through its Internet of Things, cloud platform, which is another example on how our customers can lean enough to help make life better. Moving to slide 14 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q1 was another very strong quarter for the SVT team. Orders and revenue were up organically 89% and 29%, respectively, driven by continue strength and consumer goals and aftermarket product lines. Adjusted EBITDA of $48 million increased 162% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1%. This represents an outstanding 1,020 basis points improvement versus prior year, showcasing the power of IRX and the team's application to its tool to capture value and market share. And while this business continues to perform well, we made a strategic choice to divest the asset to continue aligning our portfolio to our mission-critical flow creation technologies. And as mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong economic outcome with the sale of Club Car to Platinum Equity. It was very important to us in this transaction, and in our sale of HPS that we honor our commitment to employee ownership. As a result, employee recipients of our 2020 all employee equity grant will have 50% of the world's best at closing and 50% will be replaced by a new equity linked program implemented by Platinum. We're very pleased with these outcomes for the Club Car team. Moving to slide 15, given the company's performance in Q1, and continue strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our initial revenue guidance was up high single digits to low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of mid single digit organic growth across each of the three segments. After removing SVT, we're now [Technical Difficulty] we have implemented our IRX tools to help the impact and our teams have executed very well, including price and execution, and our continued I2V initiative. We do see this environment continue in Q2 and likely after. But we're confident that leveraging our IRX process, and working with our suppliers will allows us to continue exceeding our customer's expectation. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion, which represents approximately a $45 million improvement from oriental guidance at the midpoint of the range when excluding SVP. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to remain greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to remain 1.5% to 2% of revenue. And finally, we expect adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Moving to slide 16, as we wrap up today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in a great place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. The first quarter provided a solid springboard with momentum into Q2. We take our role as a sustainably minded industry leaders very seriously. One who is focused on employee matters, like broad based ownership, belonging and reducing our impact to the environment. I am proud of all of our employees around the world. Thank you for how you come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems, and lean on each other and collaborate. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Just a question on the raised guidance. So I think it looks like you're embedding around the sort of mid-40s segment incremental margin for the year as a whole. I mean, that guidance, maybe just clarify if that's roughly correct. And I suppose as you think about puts and takes from here after that mid-50s number in Q1, anything major to call out around, say mix shifts, pricing, it sounds like you're confident on price cost. But just wondered the extent to which those pressures on a net basis will increase from here in the balance of the year? Vicente Reynal : Hi, Julian. Yes, you're correct. On the first question, yeah, kind of that mid-40s range. And in order, kind of puts and takes, let me just kind of give you a little bit of color here. I mean, Q1, as you pointed out, I mean, very strong across segments and regions. And that is really encouraging. If you think to highlight, you know, in Q1, we're seeing kind of an easier comp on a year-over-year basis due to the cost energy savings, as most of our savings really started to show in April of last year and onwards. We're also seeing the solid price realization based on the actions that we took in late 2020. And the continued execution of I2V and other initiatives. As we go into Q2 and the second half, if I kind of break it down by segment, you know, IPS [ph] overall, we're still expecting that kind of 30 to 35 incrementals, even with the headwinds, around not only the inflation, but also the discretionary costs coming back, which again, speaks to the ongoing synergy delivery efforts, as well as our focus on kind of quality of earnings. On PST, you know, touching first on Q2, it's a reminder, and as we highlighted in our original guidance, Q2 incrementals will be lower than average, to the fact that in 2020 we saw outsized demand for our medical compressors and pumps, used again to fight COVID. And the majority of these orders came in Q1 and Q2 with shipments mostly in Q2 and Q3. And as I reminder, these shipments on the medical products came in at a premium margin. In addition, PST is seeing some of the inflationary headwinds that most companies are seeing. And while the back half of the year will be more normalized to about that kind of 35% and above. So again, you know, having said all days, I mean, as you know, we're very - we had a pretty strong processing in terms of price, I2V sourcing, that our teams are actively executing to offset any of these kind of headwind coming in. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then maybe switching to capital deployment, you know, given the proceeds from HPS and SVT and the cash flow outlook, you could be close to zero net debt at the end of this year, I think. Also, though, it's a very - it's, you know, valuations are very high for M&A right now. So maybe just help us understand sort of how optimistic you are on getting a meaningful degree of M&A done this year? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Julian. We still remain very optimistic on the M&A. I mean, the M&A as we highlighted, pretty strong, as you saw on the remarks on the slide that we put together. So we've been thoughtfully - if you can go back when we talked about our phases of creating a strong foundation, people think [ph] to growth and portfolio utilization, we've been very thoughtful on the timing of all those and proactively working on the M&A funnel. So we're ready with the funnel. Again, we're not going to go crazy on the market, we're continue to stay very disciplined in these environments. We buy companies that are strategic fit. And as we have always highlighted, the strategic fit, you know, not only from a technology, but also commercial perspective. We'll never buy for a kind of multiple arbitrages. We buy company that can have that strategic fit. And I think that's what's exciting. And yes, you're right. I mean, I think with these kind of unlocking $2 billion of value in - with these two divestitures, we're ready for continue executing M&A in a very disciplined way. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Julian Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is now open. Mike Halloran : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Let's just follow up on that last question. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Mike Halloran : Let's just follow up on that last question there a little bit then, right. So you're through the divestiture piece, some of the chunkier stuff, obviously a little bit more to come potentially, you know, good commentary on how you view the actionability there. But maybe just an update on how you're thinking about what this portfolio looks like, three, five years down the line. We've had some indication where the capital allocations are going to go, but maybe just a little bit of an update on directionally how you're thinking about this portfolio, composition over time, and where the chunkier pieces that capital allocation can go? Vicente Reynal : Sure, Mike. I - as you see, we kind of have these two segments and one larger than the other. We've spoken a lot about how our strategic focus on building the funnel has been on the Precision and Science. We see a lot of good things that we like on that segment. And we've been very prudent in terms of saying, you know, while we integrate Gardner Denver and the Ingersoll Rand through the past 12 months, building the funnel on the Precision and Science, I did not have that many kind of distractions, I will say, on the integration. So I think that continues to be the exciting piece. In terms of kind of how we look at, we're still going to be this mission-critical, high aftermarket. We like the recurring aftermarket side of these rotating components and devices that we have. And we like the space where we play. And we still have, you know, over $30 billion of addressable market, even when you exclude high pressure and specialty vehicles. So things around sustainable technology, high growth, end markets, we've been very thoughtful in terms of focusing and doing a lot of segmentation and market work around these kind of high end growth markets that where we can have the play in terms of flow creation, and any of those adjacent markets that kind of complement our ecosystem of the product line. Mike Halloran : And then a question on the guidance, on the assumptions on the revenue side, maybe just talk about how your revenue outlook compares to say normal seasonality, or what kind of backdrop are you embedding as you work through here, pretty stable or is there an acceleration assumed? And then also maybe just touch on what you're seeing on the shorter cycle side of your businesses versus some of the longer cycle side of your businesses? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Let me let me touch base first on the short cycle and then long cycle, and then I kind of let Vik comment on the other one. Short cycle, you know, we see very good strength, pretty broad base, particularly kind of this medical market, animal health, what kind of, what we call also agtech and aquatech [ph] kind of end markets that were putting a lot of effort to really continue to penetrate, pharma, food and beverage and water and wastewater. In terms of kind of long cycle end markets, most of our long cycle business, as all of you know, is in kind of what we call the Nash, Garo business, as well as the very large compressors, which is kind of the centrifugal compressors that the multistage centrifugal compressors, I will categorize the large multistage centrifugal compressors orders were very strong and positive. This is an area where we are seeing very good start with - when you think about kind of some of end markets we're seeing good momentum and kind of reshoring on some companies, as well as markets like renewable energy and generally industrial. The Nash, Garo in the first quarter was kind of down, primarily due to the timing we say. You know, if think about the Nash, Garo is one business that changes quarter, quarter-to-quarter, so we kind of think to look at it a bit more from a first half compare year-on-year. And the funnel still continues to be highly active. And just as a reminder, you know that business in the fourth quarter saw very positive orders in kind of the mid to high single digit order cycle. Vik Kini : Yeah. And Mike, I think your first part of your question with regards to kind of seasonality and kind of how we're thinking about the backdrop, I don't think we're thinking about it much differently than you've seen from a historical perspective. Obviously, strong first quarter, I think we're very encouraged by the orders profile where in IT&S and Precision & Science, you had book-to-bills of, I think 1.14 and 1.20 respectively. So we've obviously built some solid backlog now moving in the second quarter. And as Vicente said, typically speaking, you tend to see, particularly for the longer cycle businesses order stronger in the first half and shipment stronger in the second half. So typically speaking, you know, you tend to see Q1 seasonally a little bit of the weakest, Q4, seasonally, strongest and Q2, Q3 in between, I don't think you're going to see anything dramatically different in the context of the phasing, or how we think about seasonality here in the context to 2021. Mike Halloran : Thanks for the answers. As always, appreciate it. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. I wondered if we could just talk actually a little bit about price specifically, you know, Vicente, you indicated you felt you had price costs pretty well dialed even to start the year. But maybe give us a little color on what's going on with price? Have you gone out multiple times and maybe as part of that question, too, are there any particular supply disruptions that you're dealing with in the business? Vicente Reynal : Sure, Jeff. You know, on the price cost, the good thing is that, we actually planned for the inflation during the budget time last year with the team. I mean, we were seeing early indications of inflation. And we basically told the teams to plan for the inflation. And with that to plan for the price, and then we executed on the price. And I think, it was part of kind of our original guidance as well. And reason why we - it definitely increased prices back then. And I think the inflation is really coming in fairly in line with what we planned. And then, you know, I will say, in addition from a margin perspective, we continue to run the I2V procurement work that we're doing with the - that we did with a synergy integration between Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver. And that's kind of working really well. As we move forward, I mean, clearly, we continue to watch carefully this inflation and the teams, they're kind of lock and loaded to plan for incremental price increases based on what we're seeing, primarily typically like the logistic side of things. But, but yeah, we're looking at doing that proactively positioning of our products here in this inflationary market. And in terms of supply chain, I mean, we're definitely not immune to what you're seeing, I'm hearing a lot about logistics. But I think a couple things to highlight here. First, we're mostly in the region for the region. And this has proven to be a great strategy for us, not only in these difficult times, but also, as companies looking to reshoring, it has been very helpful for us. I'll say, second, you know, we're working with a much larger purchasing power than in the past, many of these are kind of new partnerships that we're creating. And these really has helped in the supply chain, as they want to deliver and have very good terms with us. So I'd say that supply chain, you know, non-immune, but I think the team really working very well to get it in control. Jeff Sprague : And second, unrelated, just what's going on with service, you see a clear pickup in activity there and commensurate with some of the kind of equipment order dynamics that are starting to tick up, or would you expect some lagging impact there? How does the year play out on the service? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Jeff, you know, in the first quarter, we saw outsize order momentum on the original equipment. And certainly, as the market recovers, we definitely want to see this. And we're very glad because again, as you're kind of alluding there, we're kind of seeding the market and putting our products, so then we can connect them with our IoT platform and then continue to generate these accelerated aftermarket. So that that's good news. I will say that, still with that, the service on the aftermarket sequentially we saw improvement in most of the regions. So again, good things that some of the strategies are definitely seen good momentum here. Jeff Sprague : Right, thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I want to go back to cap allocation and M&A. And I'm curious if you know the proposed tax changes, cap - capital gains tax changes in particular, whether that's - where you've seen more activity on the private seller sides. And so any comments there would be good. And then just given that we've seen acceleration in disposals, obviously, a lot of kind of available cash now. Is this driven by just like your timing, you know, this is one of those things or do you have increased confidence and line of sight on deployment from here, and that's kind of driven you to kind of accelerate the sale of Club Car? Thanks. Vicente Reynal : Sure, Nigel. I think on the cap gain taxes, I think maybe still slightly too early to tell. And obviously, that's mostly particularly here in the US. I think Europe continues to be, at least, no major changes, but too early to tell. I think it could free up better momentum in some cases, but nothing that I will classify as saying it is creating an imminent change, yet. Maybe some of the family owning owners are thinking about it, and we'll see, I mean, we'll stay pretty close and create good cultivation. So we'll see on that. I think the timing, as kind of alluded, I think we've been very thoughtful. On the timing, we said that we went to create stability, but at the same time, we want to improve some of these companies so we can maximize the value that we could generate. And at the same time, we did it in a way that we went to have some sort of visibility to the funnel. So in parallel, we've been working on all these aspects, not only the divestitures, but also accelerating the funnel. And you can see how some of the statistics on the funnel. And we're excited that, you know, the funnel is 5x what we had even last year, the average revenue size per company is more than 50%. And the velocity, which is really important, has been cut by half. So I think it's been - it's been done everything strategically well thought out from - in parallel, I would say, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Vicente. And then on - you called out PST is an area where you're seeing good opportunities in that pipeline. Is there an appetite or even visibility to expand the medical components of PST? Vicente Reynal : Absolutely. Yes, definitely, Nigel, yeah. I mean, it has been, if you remember, yeah, absolutely. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey. Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Morning, Josh. Vik Kini : Morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Chris, congrats on the new role [ph] Your background makes me feel like maybe I haven't done that since winning that seventh-grade spelling bee. Chris Miorin : Thanks, Josh. Appreciate it. Josh Pokrzywinski : Vicente, your 23% margins in IT&S, which still feels like an early point in the cycle. And I think to Vik's point, not a seasonal high point. I get that maybe margins will move around with M&A here, but can you get to mid-20s in the next couple of years on a core basis? I know that's sort of been thrown out there as a noble goal for a while, but it seems like maybe it's accelerating is an opportunity? Vik Kini : Yeah, Josh. This is Vik. I'll start there. I think the answer is absolutely yes. You know, we've been very, I think transparent in the context that quality of earnings and continue to execute on many of our strategic levers, notably areas like the synergy funnel, procurement, I2V, as well as you know, pricing realization are clearly focus areas and footprint, for example, you know, as that'll still kind of more so yet to come, frankly, from a synergy delivery perspective. So I think the answer is, you know, a mid-20s percent EBITDA margin kind of on the IT&S segment is without question, I think where we are targeting this business to be from a more medium-term perspective. And I think one thing to add would be, you know, we're really encouraged by the momentum we're seeing, frankly, across all the parts of that business. It's really not coming from one distinct area, I would tell you, all the regions, as well as, you know, the power tools business, inclusive, continuing to show good momentum. And I think some of the commercial initiatives that we also have, you know, Vicente just spoke to continuing to see good aftermarket traction. We're seeing a little bit outsized OE right now, which we think is a good thing. As we kind of start to show more of that shift into aftermarket and build from that 40% kind of baseline we have right now with aftermarket sales that obviously help us well. So all good signs and things that we would yet say, yes, should point to 25% margins definitely being the target here as we think ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, we've talked a lot about the M&A side of the equation, so maybe just kind of focusing on the core business. You guys mentioned, maybe some signs of nearshoring taking place, just wondering if there's anything else that sort of looks unusual or stands out at this point in the recovery, whether it's end market that you're kind of leading or lagging in a surprising way, or a mix of business where folks are doing more CapEx earlier in the cycle. Just any observation on kind of the complexion of spending underneath, you know, some of those consolidated numbers. Vicente Reynal : Yeah, sure. Josh, maybe something to highlight. I mean, we spoke about these industrial vacuum and blower business to be kind of up low double digit. And when you cannot decompose that, that has the industrial side, kind of brands like [indiscernible] and Robuskey [ph] and things like that. But included in there is also the vacuum business like Nash, which is kind of more the longer cycle. And as I just mentioned, I mean, Nash, you know, was down in the first quarter, which obviously implies that the industrial vacuum business was really high. And that was basically up in the - in the kind of 20s range, the industrial vacuum. Our industrial vacuum is really collocated within kind of large OEMs and OEMs. We always said that, industrial vacuum was always a leading - a good leading indicator for industrial recovery. And it is very exciting to continue to see that momentum happening on that industrial vacuum side of the business. So, I think that's very good news for what the industrial recovery market is seeing. In terms of some of the other things is, it's actually also good momentum based on the - a lot of the self-help initiatives on the commercial side. I think, Josh, it's exciting to see that we're seeing really good traction on some of the commercial kind of that product summit activities that we talked about prior quarters, in terms of, you know, the combination of Gardner Denver, and Ingersoll Rand, examples like, oil-free product like the Ultima, which was a Garnet Denver technology launched as Ingersoll Rand in Europe, that saw a really, really good momentum in Europe. And that is getting launched now here in the US. So expect to see that accelerated momentum too, as well. So a combination of those kind of multiple things, is not only the market, but also a lot of good execution from the team based on these initiatives that we're doing. Josh Pokrzywinski : And just to be clear, when you say vacuum that for you guys does not include semiconductor exposure, right? Vicente Reynal : Correct. Yeah, we don't play in the semiconductor market. That's right. Yes. It is all industrial. All industrial product\u2026 Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Morning, Andy. Vik Kini : Morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Vicente, maybe can give us a little more color to what you're seeing by region, you obviously talked about APAC sales and orders up high double digits. But is that just easy comparisons given the pandemic hit that region first? Or have you been able to harness some of the opportunities you've cited for China and Southeast Asia? And then, you know, America's, we just kind of talked about it, obviously, easier comparisons coming up, but is the cadence of orders and revenue continue to improve as we go through April here? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Andy, I think Asia Pacific, I'll say it is definitely combination of both. I mean, definitely some easy comps in China, for sure. But if you recall, Southeast Asia was definitely not an easy comp, yet, in the first quarter, because I mean, the Southeast Asia really start to getting kind of lock down in the second quarter. So I'll say, you know, a good combination of maybe easy comps, but at the same time, some really good momentum in China and Asia Pacific. I think this is - we always highlighted when we created the integration of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver that we said, Asia Pacific is definitely an area of growth and opportunity. And we're doing some very good organic investments. I mean, we spend a lot on new capital equipment to be able to have in region for region in areas like that I think is really, really exciting. And, you know, we put a renew focus also on emerging markets in Southeast Asia, something that before with the scale that we had, it was very difficult to do, but now we have the scale. And these organic investments are definitely showing some good momentum. I think in the Americas, yes, as you said, particular in the US, Andy, we will see better, easier comps here in the US in the second half, same in Europe. But I'd say as well, you know, you saw that in Europe, at least on the compressor side, orders we were kind of in the mid-teens up, while America or the US mid single digit up. And maybe some of that is a little bit of timing in the sense that the Europeans, as I just mentioned before, they kind of went in faster in terms of doing some of these integration of the product lines that we spoke about. And now we're seeing that getting implemented in the Americas. Again, the Americas, or the US is a more complex environment where you have a combination of direct versus distribution. So we just wanted to be careful. But I think everything is going really well, now in the US as well, and we'll see some inflection here as we move forward. Andy Kaplowitz : Helpful, Vicente. And then one of the issues that you've mentioned in the past with your synergy progress was that procurement synergies would be partly a function of your sales volume. And so you mentioned already that your supply chain is faring well, but could you actually harvest more procurement related synergies as part of your $200 million [ph] program, given, you know, expected higher sales? And you know, I'm cognizant of you just raised your target? So just thinking sort of medium to longer term here? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Andy, I think you hit the nail on the head. Obviously, when we - so the answer to your question is, you're completely right. Obviously, the direct material components of our synergy equation, most notably, the procurement side and I2V are, frankly a functional volume. And we did note that even in 2020, obviously, volumes were not at kind of that - kind of baseline 2019 levels. But we had seen, for example, a procurement, I'd say probably better than expected, percent realization on saving, so that it kind of been a nice - kind of I'd say, mitigant to lower volumes. Clearly, a higher volume equation clearly can materialize into higher savings. But as you said, some of that was definitely dialed in to the race, when we moved the number from $250 million to $300 million, we'd clearly indicated that the majority, if not all of that really was coming from the direct material equation. Could there be some potential in the medium term, over and above? Perhaps, but I think we want to continue to see how things play themselves out. But we're very encouraged. And I think the momentum we're seeing, frankly, even still today on the procurement and the I2V side is very encouraging in the context of the price realization, and the percent realization that the teams are actually recognizing. So quite encouraged, but I'd say a lot of that was factored into the, you know, the raise from $250 million to $300 million. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, guys. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Morning, Joe. Vik Kini : Morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So maybe just starting out, Vicente, you've highlighted in the past this longer-term opportunity on the oil free side, water, I guess some positive comments on hydrogen and the funnel activity. How do you think about these initiatives is providing some type of like, you know, GDP multiplier effect for the company over the course of the next two to three years? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Joe, definitely we believe that this is - these initiatives are the ones that will give us that kind of plus, plus, that we always like to talk about in terms of how we execute that, in the sense that, you know, we play in these kind of GDP environment, end markets, but with the initiatives that we're putting, we're kind of moving more towards those end markets that can give us that plus, plus an out execution. We always said, you know, call it anywhere between 100 to three - up to 300 basis points above the GDP, depending on kind of the region and the market. So these initiatives continue to be really exciting for us. We launched with the help of IRX several of the impact daily management programs from a global perspective, and I'm very excited with kind of what we are seeing and definitely much more to come. Joe Ritchie : Yeah. No, that's helpful, Vicente. I guess, maybe just, you know, with like oil-free and water, those are end markets that, you know, you guys have had traction. I think I heard you say on hydrogen that things were picking up, like is there anything that's happening kind of like at the margin, that has changed just in the near term on any of those opportunities? Vicente Reynal : You mean, the margin in terms of profitability? Joe Ritchie : Oh, no, I just meant on the margin, meaning like anything incremental, yeah. Vicente Reynal : Yeah, well, I mean, I think on the oil-free it's more about you know, I think this year and moving forward is when we start seeing the execution of this product line combination between the two companies. As you can imagine, I mean, we talked a lot about that last year with all the product summit and the acuity [ph] that we were doing to combine this kind of creative, highly complementary, I think a lot of the results should be and could be seen now. And I think, you know, same thing for the water, water and wastewater. I mean, I think it takes a little bit of time to see the results. But I think we're very excited and very encouraging to kind of what the momentum we're seeing across the company on these strategic end markets that we have selected. Joe Ritchie : Got it. No, that makes sense. If I could ask one more just on free cash flow longer term, you guys have made a ton of progress on the free cash flow margin, you know, even when it was passing [ph] the GDI days of working capital. How do you think about driving to potentially, you know, a 20% type free cash flow number or free cash flow margin by like, in next few years? And is that possible? And how do you think about the working capital opportunities in the company? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Joe, I mean, I think without question, we continue to see opportunities. I mean, we're pretty pleased with I think the momentum we've already seen. But we've been very adamant that there - there are still a number of, I'd say levers that we have to pull. First and foremost, I'll start with the tax rate. You know, we mentioned that when we started as kind of one year ago, putting two companies together, we really didn't have what I would consider to be an optimized tax rate. We've done a lot of work, their tax organization, frankly, whole organization and a lot of work. We've started to implement a lot of those, I'd say, practices here, and you're already starting to see some good momentum on the tax rate. We've said that we're getting to, you know, approximately 23%. And, you know, last year, you were 24% plus. So you're already starting to see some good momentum there. And we have line of sight to getting that into the lower 20s over time. In terms of the working capital side, absolutely. I think the biggest area that is still ahead of us here is on the inventory side. We've mentioned, I think a few times that inventory is really almost connected in some respects to a lot of our synergy delivery initiatives. We talk about procurement, and we focus a lot on the saving side. But there's also the - you know, making sure that you're negotiating terms properly, and that you're actually making sure that you're pulling inventory only when you need it. And then also, with the footprint side of the equation, you know, footprint is probably one of the biggest areas of the synergy equation, you really haven't started to see deliver in a material manner just yet. But you can be rest assured here, when we start to actually optimize our footprint on the manufacturing side, there will be working capital opportunities there. So you put that all together, and clearly there are other areas in terms of the payables and receivables equation that we're working. Clearly, I think working capital is a major opportunity ahead that, you know, can help drive us to those, you know, the levels that you're speaking to here over time. So I think we're encouraged. It's definitely, I'd say, a big focal point of the ops and finance and business teams. And we're going to continue to make momentum here as we move through this year, and frankly, into next. Joe Ritchie : Great to hear. Thanks, guys. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you, and good morning. My question is on maybe more of the structural or strategic side of pricing, as opposed to the responsive or tactical things that you kind of discussed already. I know you guys have a lot of work on, you know, looking at, you know, tracking discounting better and looking at various initiatives to sort of improve the way pricing flows to the organization. And I wonder, could you talk a little bit about the outcomes, as you look at your products, have you found that they have the pricing power you want or, you know, is there structural options there, and as you look forward into the backlog and into years out, is that a material difference from the past? Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Rob, I will say that - great question on the pricing side, and definitely something that you know, strategic pricing, that is basically what we like to do. We typically never do peanut butter across price increases, it's just based on the specific product lines. And I will say that, you know, as you know, our mission-critical products were very low cost relative to the overall system. And that is very good for us and works really well for us in situations of continuing to be able to increase price because the mission criticalness and the low cost relative to the overall system that our products have. In terms of the stickiness and the elasticity, I mean, we have done a lot of work on testing pricing elasticity in many of our end markets and many of our products. We have a really great, I'll say internal process for scoping that out and making sure that we continue to you know, push the boundaries on the envelopes on that, as we see that we can. And obviously we can only do it only as long as we have differentiated products, which is the other big play in terms of how our I2V has been really strong process for being able to continue to create differentiated products, whether it might be tweaks of innovation that is not only - so it's a process that is not only for driving direct material costs down, but it's also driving some increase in profit - price and profitability. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. That's a great answer. Thank you. And then just to understand it, I mean, when you think about, you know, all the testing, the measuring, the elasticity you've done and the profit - the product improvement, have you started to see a lot of benefit from that? Or is that, you know, a year out or two years out when it sort of kicks in? And I'll stop, thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yeah. No, we're seeing some of that. I mean, when you look at the margin expansion that we saw here in the first quarter, a good chunk of that also came from gross margin. So we're seeing gross margins continue to improve on a year-over-year, and even historically, when you go back, even go back to 2015, I mean, definitely some very, very solid gross margin expansion. So we're definitely seeing it in the real core of the business. Rob Wertheimer : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is now open. Nathan Jones, your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Sorry, it's on mute. Good morning. This is Matt on for Nathan Jones this morning. Vicente Reynal : Hi, Matt. Unidentified Analyst : You mentioned targeting sustainable investments. I was wondering if can you talk about what kind of level of investments you're making growth at the moment? And what kind of potential that is to take it to? And can you talk about the opportunities to invest more here in order to continue drive growth in 2020 and beyond? Or 2021 and beyond? Vik Kini : Sure, Matt. Yeah, I mean, I think generally speaking, a lot of the initiatives we talked about, I think you've been speaking to, you know, a lot of the - a lot of the questions we've had with regards to whether it be oil-free, whether it be investments in the you know, hydrogen, whether it be the products that we actually highlighted in the release, in the slides, the Runtech acquisition that we made back in 2017, or the, you know, the ZEO application from the Precision, Science technologies business. Generally speaking, all of our NPDs that we're really looking at have some facet of sustainability, energy savings and efficiency really baked in. So I would say it's probably the single biggest criteria by and large, when we're looking at innovation. And it's also a huge criteria that we're looking at when we're actually looking at the M&A pipeline. So I'd say its front and center, trying to quantify exact dollars is probably a little bit tricky. But I would tell you it's probably the single biggest factor. And I would also point to, you know, we really made a commitment to it in the context of our ESG goals, which Vicente you can - you know, we've obviously spoken to quite a bit. So again, I think it's kind of permeating the culture, and now we're actually putting distinct targets and goals that are associated with it as well. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. And then I wanted to follow up in regards to the supply chain conversation. Are you guys seeing any impact to production? Or your supply chain relative to COVID cases spiking, particularly in Europe, and India? And then how confident do you feel about the ability to continue ramp as we move into 2Q and the rest of the year? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Matt, I mean, I think in terms of production, I mean, our plants are up and running. I mean, clearly, the area that we're monitoring really close is India. We're deemed as a critical manufacturer, and all of our manufacturing facilities are - at the moment, they're open. A lot of - some of the closedowns that have - that is happening in India, at least in the cities where we are operating hasn't happened to us. But we're watching that carefully. We're proactively supporting vaccination efforts for employees based there. Again, this is because we're deemed as a critical manufacturer, and you've seen that lack of oxygen in many hospitals. Our products are actually helping to enhance that. And so we're working really closely with the government to really accelerate that. But so far, you know, no major impact, I will say, something that we're watching carefully. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions, so I'll hand it back. Vicente Reynal : Well, thank you, everyone, for your interest and joining on the call today. We're very excited. We're very thankful for our employees for all the work and dedication that they're doing, and thinking and acting like owner. So we're excited with the momentum that we're having and look forward to talking to many of you here present in the future. Thanks, again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christopher Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Chris Miorin : Good morning, everyone and thank you for the patience with the technical difficulty this morning. Welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2021 second quarter earnings call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me is Vicente Reynal, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday that we will reference during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a Company strategy update, review our Company and segment financial highlights and offer updated 2021 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for time for other participants. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. And as you can see on Slide three anchoring to our purpose, we're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear three key themes today. First, we're effectively allocating capital to advance our portfolio transformation to generate significant value for shareholders. Second, you will hear about how we are outperforming and raising guidance which illustrates our organic investments in new product development and demand generation are also working. And third, we will touch on our ESG journey. I have never been more excited about the state of Ingersoll Rand. The combination of a highly engaged workforce who think and act like owners. And the use of IRX is what makes us highly unique. I want to thank our employees all around the world for their dedication and determination. We continue to support our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well being. Moving to Slide four, our five strategic imperatives are how we stay grounded on priorities and areas of focus. You will see on the right-hand side, during Q2 we have achieved substantial traction in all five imperatives. Operate sustainably in strategic imperative we achieved another major milestone that I'll touch on the next slide. Moving to Slide five, a couple of weeks ago we published our 2020 sustainability report. The report reflects our 2020 ESG data celebrates our progress and details of our further goals with a high focus on measurable targets and accountability. We'll spend more time on this next Friday during our scheduled ESG and sustainability report investor update. What I want to emphasize right now is, the team's strong [bias] [ph] for action over the last year as you can see on this page. We have focused and delivered on diversity within our board and extended leadership team which is now 50% and 43% respectively. We have launched aggressive 2030 and 2050 goals and improved our new product development process to address these goals. We have standard stockholder rights through corporate governance changes. And one of the things I am most proud of on behalf of our employees is granting $150 million in equity to employees, which we believe is the largest employee equity grant ever provided by an industrial company. We see broad based employee ownership as a game changer. We know underrepresented populations increase, area has done well and if they're employed in organizations that offer equity grants and that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner. That even ties into how directly impact global ESG efforts. And I look forward to sharing more with you next week. Moving to Slide six, the signing off agreements to acquire Seepex and Maximus Solutions, both of which will become part of the precision and science technology segment. A representative of the key characteristics we're targeting to drive our inorganic growth strategy. Seepex is by our estimation, the number two global progressive cavity pump manufacturer. And it is a highly recognized brand as a premium player in the market that adds a new positive displacement pump technology to our portfolio. Maximus Solutions is a leader player in the agritech software and controls market, whose technology we intend to pull through to other markets and leverage across the Ingersoll Rand portfolio. Both of these companies have shown strong high single digit to double digit organic growth since early 2017. And are focused on sustainable end markets that tend to grow well above GDP rates. In addition, both have strong asset market profiles enhanced by digital revenue streams, including software as a service. We anticipate both acquisitions to yield single-digit pulse synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples by year three of ownership. With these two acquisitions, we're expecting to add approximately $3.8 billion to PST addressable market, which is an impressive 40% expansion. The profiles and characteristics of these high-quality, high return on capital and highly strategic acquisitions are indicative of how we're structuring our M&A funnel. Which leads us to Slide seven. We continue to execute our M&A funnel using IRX as its backbone. Our funnel is comprised of six stages and is probability weighted according to likelihood of closing when we calculate our funnel site. For instance, Seepex has been in our funnel for some time. And it was not until the owner became actively engaged and we were in active session that it was moved from 0% weighted revenue contribution to 50% and then 100% assignment and now it is out of our funnel calculation. Last quarter, we just learned how our M&A funnel has grown materially since the Ingersoll Rand Gardner Denver transaction was completed. At this current state, the funnel size remains approximately five times the size it was versus Q2 of 2020. With average revenue larger and velocity accelerated meaningfully. And to be clear, these describes the funnel even after removing the 32 targets we passed on in the second quarter, as well as our sign deals of Seepex and Maximus and it also excludes SPX Flow. As you can see, we have significant momentum in the funnel and our flywheel is in full motion. Regarding SPX Flow, we saw that they issued a press release this Monday stating that they will pursue strategic alternatives. Our $85 per share offer was preemptive and fully accounted for SPX Flow [indiscernible] plan which is ahead of consensus estimates. In terms of SPX Flow's strategic alternative process if we participate. We intend to remain disciplined in our approach, as we do with all of our M&A transactions. And there can be no assurances that we will confirm our preemptive offer as part of any such process. It is very important also to know that when we received the second rejection from SPX flow, more than a month ago, we pivoted to executing on other funnel opportunities. We have always demonstrated a very distance the sizes and highly visiting approach with everything we do. And when we believe it is much more important now in this current environment. As stated even with SPX flow excluded, our funnel remains as robust as it did last quarter, which exemplifies the volume and quality of our future potential opportunities. And we have sufficient cash in hand to execute on these opportunities with $4.7 billion in liquidity. However, as noted, we intend to remain very disciplined in this environment. It is also important to know that we continue to review our capital allocation priorities with our board and plan to communicate more formally on this topic later in the year. I will now turn the call to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks, Vincente. Moving to Slide eight, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q2. Q2 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued performance across industrial end markets. Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 48% and 25%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Given the comparisons to 2020, are materially impacted by the prior year impact of COVID. We think comparing this performance to 2019 is a better representation of how the business is improving. And we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing as organic orders in Q2 are up 9% and 6% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis respectively, as compared to 2019. Our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company eclipsing Q1 and setting us up well as we move into Q3. Our commitment to delivering $300 million in cost synergies attributable to the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment acquisition remains intact, as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $292 million a year-over-year improvement of $75 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 22.8%, 160 basis point improvement year-over-year. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the high-pressure solution segment or the specialty vehicle technology segment, both of which were classified as discontinued operations as of Q2, with the relevant prior periods restated to conform to the current presentation. We will not report on either segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, yielding total liquidity of $4.7 billion at quarter end, up approximately $2 billion from Q1 as we received the gross proceeds from both divestitures in Q2. This takes our net leverage to 0.2x a 1.7x improvement from Q1. Turning to Slide nine, for the total company orders increased 40% and revenue increased 19% both on an FX adjusted basis. The IT&S and P&ST segments both saw strong double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.14 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 0.96. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving to Q3 and beyond. The company delivered $292 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of 34% versus prior year. And the IT&S and P&ST segments both saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong margin expansion. Finally, corporate costs came in at $38 million for the quarter up year-over-year primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like demand generation and other targeted strategic investments. We expect corporate costs to remain elevated at comparable level in both Q3 and Q4 due to the same drivers. Turning to Slide 10, free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million on a continuing ops basis driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $12 million and free cash flow included $12 million of outflows related to the transaction. In addition, free cash flow also included $36 million in cash tax payments related to the historical earnings profile of the HPS and SVT segments. As is customary in these types of divestitures, cash tax payments are included in cash flows from continuing operations, due to the complexities involved in specific attribution with consolidated returns. However, the $36 million represents our best quantification of the impact. Given our reported financials including revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow are shown on a continuing ops basis, we're calling out the $36 million in cash tax outflows to provide a better representation of the underlying cash flow of the ongoing business. From a leverage perspective, we finished 0.2x, which are the 1.7x improvement as compared to prior quarter and this included the gross cash proceeds received from both the HPS and SVT divestitures. We expect to pay the cash taxes for both divestitures later in 2021. And if you were to pro forma, the Q2 leverage to account for these tax outflows leverage would have been closer to 0.6x. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $4.7 billion, based on approximately $3.7 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. We have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. Moving to Slide 11, we continue to see strong momentum on our cost, synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stand in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are reaffirming our stated $300 million cost savings target. To-date, approximately $250 million of annualized synergies have already been executed or in motion, which is slightly higher than 80% of the overall target. As a reminder, and consistent with previous guidance, we delivered approximately 40% of our $300 million target in 2020, which equals approximately $115 million in savings. In addition, we expect to deliver incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% up to $300 million in savings by the end of 2022, with the balance coming in 2023. The bottom of the page shows the progress we've made across the different areas of synergy delivery, with the most notable progress coming from direct material initiatives in procurement as well as I2V. In addition, we're starting to see some of the initial wave of savings from our footprint actions, and we expect these savings to ramp into 2022. On the right side of the page, we did want to highlight that despite the headwinds we've seen on the cost side largely coming from direct material and logistics, as well as some of the expected return of one-time and discretionary costs and strategic growth investments, we do continue to expect to be positive from a price versus cost perspective on a total your basis. This is entirely due to the team's use of IRX to proactively implement and deploy targeted pricing actions in the first half of the year. In addition, we continue to evaluate the overall landscape particularly with regards to inflation and are evaluating potential incremental pricing actions for the second half of the year. Overall, we expect to achieve further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the total company in the second half of the year, although not at the same levels we delivered in the first test. I will now turn it back over to the Vincente to discuss the segments. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Vik. And moving to Slide 12, starting with industrial technologies and services. Overall organic orders were up 41% and revenue up 17%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.15. In addition, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 41% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7% up 250 basis points year-over-year with incremental margin of 34%. Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors we saw orders up in the mid 40% further breakdown into oil free and oil lubricated products shows that orders for both were up above 40%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed strong and up low 40%, while Latin America was up in the mid 70%. Mainland Europe was up low 50% while India Middle East saw continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 100%. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up low 30% driven by low 30% growth in both China and high 20% across the rest of Asia Pacific. From a vacuum and blower perspective, orders were up in mid 40s. On a global basis with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. And power tools and lifting, the total business was up high 50% in orders and so continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced ecommerce capabilities and improved execution on new product launches. On the right-hand side, we're highlighting one of our new exciting products, which is a result of our continued commitment to organic investments in our portfolio. In this case, we were in Q2 we completed the launch of our new line of refrigerated drive portfolio. There's a bit of a background, the basic function of the air dryer is to remove moisture from the air by cooling it with a refrigerant, thus water vapor is condensed and the air can be easily compressed. The result is dry compressed air, which can be used in compressed air equipment without causing any damage. Air dryer technology is sold as an accessory to all rotary oil lubricated and oil free air compression technology. So in the great adjacent technologies that increases the total quality of air provided to the customer. This is a very important requirement, especially in oil free compression where customers demand high air quality in terms of dryness and particulate. It is also good to know that it is a great aftermarket generator as the filters or desiccant need to be changed often. In this case, we leverage a technology developed Aztec, which was a company owned by legacy Ingersoll Rand. Since the merger of Gardner Denver and IR, not only we have accelerated our organic investments in new products for Aztec, but we're now leveraging that technology in order to serve Gardner Denver, Ingersoll Rand and in the future, even our champion compressor customers. The even more exciting bit here is that we're doing these while helping the environment. This new dryer portfolio is 20% more energy efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. Moving to Slide 13, in the precision and science technology segment, overall organic orders were up 20% driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serves lab life science, water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits and we also saw strong performance in our ARO and Mytholmroyd broad lines. The momentum in our Haskel hydrogen solution business continues to build and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 12% organically which is encouraging, as we have some tough comps to cover the order and revenue in Q2 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 71 million, which was up 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7% up 40 basis points year-over-year with incremental margins of 33%. Today, we want to highlight our hydrogen refueling business to give you an update on where we are and investments we're making. As we have discussed before, during our Q4 earnings call, we made investments in developing a hydrogen dispensing unit leveraging our Haskel high pressure technology and we're now ready to [Technical Difficulty] in this business. We have line of sight over $45 million in organic investments over the next five years to both build high capacity and fund ongoing product development in the hydrogen refueling space. With approximately $10 million of this investment expected in the next 12 months. Since our last call, we have seen our funnel grow 3x to over $250 million in potential projects. I also feel confident that this is a business where we will see meaningful growth for years to come, driving our decision to expand two of our factories in Europe to support anticipated growth. In addition, we want to highlight that Ingersoll Rand is designing and developing the state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling stations to support the clock power and remote joint venture. Moving to Slide 14, given the company's performance in Q2 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the high pressure solutions and specialty the vehicle technology segment, as well as the pending acquisition of Seepex and Maximus. Our prior revenue guidance was up low double digits on a reported basis comprise of high single digit organic growth across both of our segments. And we're now up in guiding up to the mid-teens in total, with low double-digit organic growth across both segments. This reflects approximately 250 to 300 basis point growth in organic growth for the total company as compared to prior guidance. FX is expected to continue to be a low single digit tailwind, based on these revenue assumptions we are increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.1 5 billion to $1.18 billion, which represents approximately a $30 million improvement from prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. We also highlight that these also includes the increased copper cost of approximately 6 million per quarter for both Q3 and Q4 as compared to prior guidance as mentioned on the right-hand side of the slide. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to remain greater than or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenue. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be approximately 20% and this does include a 35 million benefits. This is a tax restructuring plan that was recently completed, that is reflected approximately 40% in the Q2 rate, with the balance in the second half of the year. Moving now to Slide 15, as we wrap today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding place. 2021 is poised to be a great year to our employees, I'd want to say thank you for how we come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems, lean on each other and collaborate. We take a role as sustainably minded industry leaders seriously, and our employees eagerly embrace IRX to put us in that leadership position. I'm confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran. Mr. Halloran, please provide your company name and proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : I'm with Baird. Thanks for taking the question. Focusing on the supply chains, inflation pressures, component shortages, things like that. Maybe some thoughts on how that's impacting results in the second quarter and how you see that playing out over the next couple quarters? When does normalization start materializing? And how are you thinking about that price cost equation internally? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Mike. Good morning. We definitely continue to see price cost equation to be positive. Even here in the second half. As you may recall, during the last earnings, we mentioned that we were seeing the inflation creeping up since Q4 of 2020. And we acted on that when building the budget for 2021. Since the end of Q1 of 2021 of this year, we have seen inflation and we've got inflation here, direct material and logistics continue to increase, which is the reason why we acted on additional pricing actions. I'll say those Brexit pricing actions are offsetting the incremental inflation that we're expecting to see in the second half. With that, we're also continuing to focus on mitigating these headwinds with a very heavy focus on I2V initiatives. So I think in terms of kind of moving forward, I will also categorize direct material inflation and continue to be a headwind but generally stabilizing while logistics side, we do expect to see continued pressure in the second half of the year compared to the first half. But this is kind of consistently with how we model our business and we are clearly working on a daily basis to ensure that our supply chain team is finding ways to mitigate the potential cost pressures. And then, there beyond as things materialize and we see good fruit of these continued price increases, obviously, we expect margin profile to continue to improve. Mike Halloran : Thanks for that. And then, the follow up is, obviously good momentum in the quarter underlying trends are healthy. What are the customers saying about sustainability at this point, large versus small sized projects maybe OE versus run rate? How are those tracking? And what is the visibility in the CapEx reinvigoration, as you're thinking forward? And again, what are customers saying about that topic? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Mike. I think if anything, what we saw is that, as we have some long cycle businesses, particularly kind of that Nash Garo and some of the large compressors. And we saw in the second quarter order momentum to continue to improve compared to the first half. We actually saw orders accelerating on these large projects. So maybe that's a good indicator in terms of the feedback that we're seeing from customers that they're kind of feeling more confident and comfortable about releasing CapEx for some of these large projects. And so, at least in our view, that's kind of good news. We also see, as I mentioned, good funnel momentum building on some of this kind of hydrogen refueling networks, which obviously that tends to create some good solid investments here that turn into revenue for our business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to start on acquisitions. And I think you've made it clear with flow that you weren't aggressively chase that maybe on the announced transactions, maybe help us understand, as you're thinking about sort of a full year EBITDA accretion, first 12 months or 2022 from Seepex and Maximus combined. What sort of number roughly should we be expecting there? And also Seepex margins, I think you're assuming that you can move those up quite substantially over several years. Maybe help lay out sort of some of the big moving parts within that. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Julian, thanks. We're really excited with these two pending acquisitions. And we actually see both companies as we kind of go ahead and look into next year to be continued to grow low double digit top-line. As we can have stated, Maximus is already at the precision and science technology margin profile. So and Seepex even though below we expect that Seepex, as we go into 2022 will be kind of a low 20 margin. And as you would expect, this is our initial view. And we have already launched an IBM part of the IRX with Seepex as part of our integration planning process, as we can move now into the next phase of closing the deal and move it into the integration. So far, what we see is that, we don't see any barrier to get Seepex margins through to the precision and science level, I think it's a business that it is solid with over 40% recurring after market, it has already launched a very meaningful or what we consider to be really strong digital platform where we've been able to kind of crack the code on creating edge devices for this type of pumps which tend to be highly cost effective. So we're excited with what we're seeing here with Seepex, I mean, as it brings to the table, not only a great new product portfolio with progressive cavity pumps, but also a great IoT technology. And clearly same thing with Maximus. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then, just my second question around sort of near-term margin dynamics in the base business. So I think looking at Slide 11, you've called out less of a margin increase in the second half year-on-year than the first half. So completely understand that, but the implied sort of incremental margins still look pretty high in the sort of mid 30s plus in the second half year-on-year. Just wanted to make sure that's roughly correct. And whether you think that's appropriately sort of conservative, given that backdrop of higher corporate costs, price cost pressures and so forth. Vik Kini : Yes, Julian, and this is Vik. I'll take that one. So, yes, I mean, I think first and foremost, in terms of the second half of the year as we mentioned, and I think actually, even the left side of that page kind of highlights despite some of the inflationary pressures and headwinds that we've been seeing, you've seen as a couple of distinct actions really taken by the team. First, is the proactive kind of pricing measures that we spoke to I'd say, we've talked about this historically, from a legacy Gardner Denver perspective, having a distinct pricing team that's able to be pretty nimble and take actions pretty quickly, particularly in an environment like this. And obviously, the first half of the year was no different. So I think between some of the proactive pricing measures you saw us taking, towards the back half of last year, as well as some of the actions we've taken in the first half of this year. I think that's obviously continued to allow us to keep the price cost equation on the positive side. And then, the other piece is, obviously, we are 100% still committed to the $100 million of incremental synergies that we're expecting to be delivered this year. And interesting enough, some of those distinct actions are really coming from the direct material side, particularly now starting to see a good influx on the I2V side. So you are correct that, yes, we are seeing some of those inflationary headwinds in the back half the year. I think some of the pricing measures as well as the productivity actions are definitely helping to offset as well as some of those corporate cost headwinds. We do believe that we continue to see EBITDA margin expansion in the back half of the year, albeit to your point, not necessarily at the levels that we saw in first half, obviously, given some of the headwinds we're talking about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey, Vincente, can you give a little bit more color on the funnel that you really built here on the on the M&A side? First, I would imagine the vast majority of its in PST, kind of confirm or elaborate on that. And also just, interested if there's any common theme on what you're actually passing on, would it just primarily be valuation? I would imagine that we're in the fall because they've got some interesting attributes. And they wouldn't have been there to begin with. So it was just -- this kind of evaluation dynamic or as you dug deeper into this, you just found some of the synergy opportunities that were you would have hoped. Vincente Reynal : Yes. Sure, Jeff. So I say in the funnel 20% is kind of almost like 60 :40. So 60% more on the PST, 40% on still ITS, so we still see some good kind of momentum here on the ITS side. We will say that, the characteristics right now on our funnel, they're largely bolt-on in nature with some medium to large size targets as well. And but nothing that I will describe as kind of transformational in nature. I will also describe them as, great companies and by that I mean, highly recognized brands, market leader, good gross margin, but that we can see a path to improve. And we continue to be prudent and seeing that ROIC can be achieved in the mid teens by year three. So, with that in mind, yes, I mean, you're absolutely right, in terms of the -- one of the common themes of passing is valuation. But I'll say that it kind of varies, and valuation is an important thresholding in how we screen deal against our financial metrics. But we're also very focused on future growth profiles of these businesses. And in some cases, we have seen expectations of inflated future growth due to expectations of ongoing COVID related demand, which we tend to be very disciplined by this company. So I think it just speaks a lot about the solid process that we have in terms of our diligence, that it's not only looking at businesses, but we do a lot of market work, including voice of customer and interviews, to ensure that we understand market trends and commercial possibilities. Jeff Sprague : And then separate unrelated question just on kind of, the energy efficiency push going on across, the product offering, just wondering, to what extent do you actually see this as a retrofit driver, where companies looking to kind of prove their ESC, profile or actually willing to kind of rip and replace functional equipment in the name of efficiency? Or should we really just think about the energy efficiency of new products is really just the basis of competition on new business or kind of regular replacement business. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Jeff, it is a great interesting question. I will say that -- we see a lot of retrofitting driver, because in many instances and we have said, some of these before, when you look at a blower that goes into a wastewater treatment facility, the energy consumed by a blower is close to like, 60% of the energy consumed at that total facility. So, these are devices that are highly mission critical, low cost to the overall process, when you put in perspective when it purchased -- when you buy the product, but they can be high energy users. Same thing with compressors and a lot of our new compressor technology it\u2019s just massively much better from an efficiency perspective than the old compression technology. So in many cases, we have, train our sales team, our commercial teams, to really sell on that value proposition. And this is what we see as one of the main drivers, when customers want to replace product, they say, might as well help the environment in terms of having a much more energy efficient and with energy continue to increase in countries like or areas like Europe and even Asia, there's a larger propensity for customers to go after products that can reduce that energy consumption. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Yes. So I just want to dig into your China, you reported 15 plus all the growth for compressors that on top of, I think the growth quarter into 2Q '20, as well. So it wasn't an easy comp. So curious, number one, what you've seen in China, there's some concerns, a hardest landing. And then maybe how your share is trending in China, obviously, you're up against a very strong competitor in that market. Vicente Reynal : Hi, Nigel. We're very pleased with what the team in China continues to do. I can say that even about a year ago, when COVID hit really hard in China, the team immediately start to pivot into end market, where they could see meaningful growth as the recovery from the China economy will come. And we're seeing a lot of that now. That pivoting into better end markets that are in markets where government has put in some good investments. I'll say that also the team has done some really great product launches. The team overall they have now relaunched the Gardner Denver brand line of compressors, it is getting really well positioned in the China market. I will also say that before, our blower and vacuum business was actually very small in a big market. Now that we have a larger scale team with a Ingersoll Rand acquisition, we're leveraging the channel and the knowledge of that team into the market to really accelerate the growth on the vacuum and blower business. And, one example that I show, even here today with the air treatment revenue right now in China is very low. So it is a really meaningful opportunity for the team in China as we can\u2019t take these new product line of dryer solutions and launch that and kind of launch that in China. So really good combination of -- the team is executing really well, commercially, selling what we have in different end markets, while at the same time launching new products that are really getting good traction in the market. Nigel Coe : Thanks, that's great. And then on the $100 million of synergies from the IR Co integration. Obviously, supply chain and procurement are a big bucket in that. And some of your kind of peer industrial companies are pushing out some of the kind of supply chain cost savings that they're targeting, because of the pressures that we're seeing right now. Have you seen some of that as well as or some of these projects moving to the right? And then within that as well, the inflation that you're seeing in the supply chain? Is that $100 million bucket? I know, it's not supply chain, but is that net inflation? Or the inflation outside of that bucket? Vik Kini : Probably backwards, frankly. So to start with your second question, they're kind of distinct. So yes, we are seeing inflation, but we're still very much committed to the 100 billion dollars of total synergies of which obviously, the agenda procurement direct material component comprises a big, big component. So it's no different than how we've messaged it before, even coming into the year, we were seeing, I would say $100 million expectation of synergies, and frankly, a smaller degree of inflation, clearly, inflationary pressures have probably grown a bit. But, those two numbers are somewhat distinct. And that's the way we're kind of managing it. Clearly our teams have done a really great job, when you think about the procurement and supply chain organizations, they've now really, I'd say, you know, been able to, I would say, use IRX and use a lot of our internal processes to be able to balance, as their attention between both synergy delivery, as well as managing a lot of the supply chain and logistics constraints that, frankly, the general markets have seen. So I think right now, we're extremely pleased, are we seeing any dramatic push out of savings, or anything of that nature compared to our original expectations? No, not in any material manner? I think for us, what we've been seeing here has probably given us a bit of a acceleration in the context of looking at more I2V initiatives as a means to mitigate. So, like we said, we're not immune to what's going on. But I think that right now, we're kind of keeping that synergy equation quite balanced to what we originally thought. And also opening, I'd say, the team up to, frankly, looking at more I2V initiatives and things like that as cost mitigants. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Rob Wertheimer : I had a couple questions, it\u2019s on the acquisition funnel, engine one is just on Maximus. So I'm curious, if the IoT aspect and growth are a little bit different than asset and whether, connectivity IoT, or find a way in the backlog or in the acquisition funnel in a more meaningful way. And how you think about transforming that opportunity, the acquisition versus what you're, also doing through your installed base. And the second one is, I may just do both at once. And just obviously, if you do a large deal, you replace some of the revenue, disappearance from special vehicle more quickly. I just wanted to ask you about your comfort with doing smaller deals and how long it takes and whether you think about that way. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Thanks, Rob. The Maximus IoT growth that is, a phenomenal find, in terms of an acquisition. And that came from looking at the market from a different kind of sort of angle and perspective in the sense that we had a good pump business called Dosatron. That plays really well in the animal health and agricultural market, that is the market leading non-electrical pumps, so basically creates dosing and movement of water, just by the flow itself. So it's kind of really unique technology. And in most of this kind of highly specialized applications and you can think about those applications, like hydroponics. I mean, we know the amount of the rain, the acreage that is available in the world to continue to grow vegetables and feed animals is kind of shrinking really fast. So more and more you're moving to indoor farming and hydroponics which is obviously the way of growing vegetables with the use of water. And here we have a really great leadership position. So when you go to one of these indoor farms, this is Maximus is a leader in these agritech controlling aspects of or being able to control the entire ecosystem of that. And where we see a lot of very good plays of not only our pumps, but all the devices that are inside that we can now actually bundle and kind of complete together the entire package. And when you think about that type of process, could we take it and replicate that into a wastewater treatment facility or into any of these other end markets? That is what our thesis also goes into? Is that how do you take that Maximus software IoT comprehensive solution, and then utilize it and leverage it for other end markets? And that's where we just get super excited. I mean, in terms of doing a large deal, I mean, obviously, you could argue that the smaller deals take as much time as large deals, that's what many say. I will say that with the use of IRX right now, we're building some incredible processes and muscle, whereas integrating is small or bolt-on deal is -- it goes actually quite well. I mean, Tuthill or Kinney is a great example. Where the theme in the Americas was able to integrate that pretty much by themselves and in a very rapid way, including the integration of the entire ERP system and in a very highly cost- effective way. So we think that larger deals can give us a bigger, faster scale. Yes, but we also know that, larger deals come in with what I call a bit of air in the sense that not all larger deals are 100% perfect. And sometimes you need to divest and kind of decouple businesses that you may not like from those systems from those businesses. So we continue to be excited about our bolt-on a medium size, business acquisitions that we have in our funnel. And we think that the processes that we have will continue to accelerate how we do deals. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hey, Vincente, I know we've talked a lot about the M&A funnel. But just a quick question, as you're kind of thinking through the types of opportunities, are you looking more for kind of fixer uppers where you can utilize, the IRX system to really drive better margin expansion? Or is there like a good balance of maybe, margin accretive type acquisitions that you're looking at as well? Vicente Reynal : No, I think Joe, we're looking for businesses that can continue to raise the bar of Ingersoll Rand in the sense of making Ingersoll Rand continue to be a great, I think what -- from being a good company to a great company, but also even bigger than greater company. And by that, it has to be strategic deals that make a lot of sense to our product portfolio. That makes a lot of sense to how we look at margin expansion and top-line growth for the future value of the company. Seepex and Maximus are kind of two, I would say great businesses that, for example, are drawing double-digit growth, great technologies. Maximus already at the margin profile of precision and science. Seepex has room to improve, but it's a technology that we like. So I think it's just one of those that in some cases, we look at both, but more important, is not the size, it's kind of just the margin expansion that we can generate and make the total company better. So we can continue to see multiple accretion in an overall business. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful context. And I guess maybe just my follow on question, you referenced the book-to-bill earlier, I think you guys were at, like 1.14 for total company. If I take a look at your order trends to the first half of the year versus revenue, I think you're up about 350 million bucks, is the way to think about this going forward, that you're booking even more kind of like mid cycle type work at this point. And that's why you don\u2019t have to play catch up on the revenue side with your order rates, or actually be kind of thinking about, how revenue and orders kind of converge over the next, call it 12 to 24 months? Vik Kini : Yes, Joe. This is Vik. I'll take that one. So, I think first of all is yes, I mean, we've always been really pleased with the orders performance. I think the good thing here that we've talked about and Vincente mentioned, in the second quarter, we actually saw a good mix of what we'll call kind of core compressor blower vacuum type orders, which, yes, typically ship out within kind of the next quarter thereafter, you're not typically booking those for five, six months out in most regions. But we've also seen a nice tailwind in some of the -- kind of the larger project size, whether that'd be the centrifugal compressor side, whether that be Nash Garo business. So I'd say, those are the types of orders that tend to have six to 12, in certain cases even longer than that kind of order to sale kind of lead time. So the good news here is, we've seen a bit of a balance. I think in the context of orders to revenue. Yes, obviously, we have a stronger backlog and we have more backlog visibility today than we've had in probably any quarter coming in, backlogs are up, strong double digits and frankly, even better in certain parts of the business. And yes, we have strong visibility into Q3 at this point in time, pretty much across most of the portfolio. But the good news here is, we've also taken some really nice, longer recycle orders, as we would call them, that kind of now even extended to 2022. So giving us even a little bit more visibility into 2022 than we had, frankly, over the course of last few months. So I think we're seeing a good balance of both is the answer Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Markus Mittermaier : Maybe I just follow up on that question. So now, if I look at the last CapEx spending cycle from 16, 17, 18, and then look at sort of pro forma in the [indiscernible] industrial Gardner Denver, in the growth there, but interesting to see that both companies are actually at the top of the sector, pretty much among the top in terms of that growth inflection? Is that something in the context of what you just mentioned around sort of short cycle, long cycle, et cetera, that they should use as a framework, maybe for the next two, three years, if we assume that we are at a similar point in the CapEx cycle, just trying to get a sense for these long cycle businesses size and how much of the short cycle business is short cycle in nature that industry is driven by CapEx. Vicente Reynal : Hey, Marcus. I think that's probably a good analogy, just to see -- to think that, at least, what we see here is this kind of broad base optimism in the market, and that our CapEx are kind of getting more and more, getting started to get released. And so yes, you could argue that's kind of the same type of momentum that we expect to see. Markus Mittermaier : Great. And then, maybe just a quick follow up on hydrogen. You've mentioned, sort of a 250 million funnel, how should we think about that timing on the conversion of that funnel? And ultimately, how fragmented is that market? If you look at that 2.5 billion opportunity for 2027? What do you think that market looks like, three, four or five years down the road? Vicente Reynal : Yes. In terms of the fragmentation is, there actually not that many players in the dispensing market. You could argue that they're kind of like top three main players with us being one of them. So at this point in time, it is such a highly specialized way of dispensing these types of gas, and that you have to do it with specialized type of equipment. And in this case, Haskel is one of the leading providers for doing that. And Haskel has a lot of history on dispensing hydrogen, because they used to do a lot of these for rocket ships, many, I mean decades ago. And in terms of the 250 million funnel, I mean, we see these over the next horizon of years. I mean, it varies from project-to-project. But I think the good thing is to be continued to see that funnel momentum increase and get back on many of these projects that are seeing expansion of networks. Vik Kini : And Markus, I would add to that, frankly, given that funnel and given where our technology is headed, that's driving, obviously, the investment that we announced, the $10 million that we expect to spend over the next 12 or so months, that's really meant to build out capacity in a large part here, with the expectation to be able to execute on a meaningful part of that funnel. So I think we're kind of seeing the funnel and we're reacting. And we always said, quite explicitly, we're going to continue to invest in those higher growth -- organic growth areas, this being a big one. And we're quite excited about a couple of the plant expansions that are going to be coming up here in Europe in the next 12 months. Operator : Your final question comes from a line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : It was just one question from me. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about free cash flow build in the second half of the year? I don't know if there's some type of bridge you could talk a little bit about or maybe help us dial in on what greater than 100 means because obviously, very strong conversion and you're usually back half weighted. Thank you. Vik Kini : Yes, John, you're exactly right. I think the free cash flow side of the equation typically tends to be a bit more second half seasonally weighted, that comes from probably a couple of different factors. One is -- one, the revenue and earnings profile of the business does tend to be a little bit more back end weighted in the context of just kind of our earnings profile, you've seen that in most years, I would also say the working capital side of equation tends to follow a pretty seasonal path. This year will probably be no exception here where, as you can see the numbers, we have seen some inventory build prudently, frankly, in the back -- in the front half of the year, a lot of that is positioned, quite frankly for the second half execution second half orders. And so, we do expect to see a nice tailwind on working capital in the back half of the year that tends to be, I would say, the kind of the two of the biggest contributors. I would also tell you that, we're working really hard steadily on the tax rate, we continue to see good momentum there on the tax position and the cash tax rate for the overall company and one that we would expect to continuously moving into 2022 as well. So I think there's multiple different levers that we're looking at and we're pulling. I think we're being very prudent continued in this environment in terms of deploying cash. But, again, we'd expect to see a strong second half of the year, not too dissimilar to what you saw last year. Operator : This continues the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Vicente Reynal for closing remarks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you so much. I just want to say one more time, thanks again to all of the employees that are listening to the call. I appreciate all your hard work [indiscernible]. And I also thank all of the investors and potential investors to participate and the interest that you have in our company and look forward to speaking to many of you here over the next days and weeks. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I will now hand the call over to your host, Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris, please go ahead now. Chris Miorin : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2021, Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations, and joining me are Vicente Reynal, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website [Indiscernible] In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call.  Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a Company strategy update, review our Company and segment financial highlights, and offer updated 2021 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. Starting on Slide 3, coming out of the third quarter, Ingersoll Rand remains in a position of strength. Demonstrating again that, as a purpose-driven Company, we remain grounded in what we do and how we do it. In the environment, we find ourselves in right now, our agility, our nimbleness and using IRX for speed to execution has proven to be our competitive advantage. Of course, global micro-economic factors continue to be a challenge. We're not immune to demand in supply chain inflation and labor market conditions, but we continue to outperform on our commercial and operational commitments, and we are again raising our guidance. This out-performance is propelled by continued organic and inorganic investments into the organization. And our comprehensive M&A focused capital allocation strategy is fueled by our drive to create long-term value and compound stockholder returns.  Moving to Slide 4, we remain committed to our 5 strategic imperatives, and we'll focus our remarks today on our growth and capital allocation strategies. Before we move to those, I have 2 important call outs. Our strategy to deploy talent across our organization is paying off. We just concluded our second employee engagement survey this year, across all 16,000 employees globally. And I am extremely proud to share, we had outstanding participation at 91% and several of our scores improved again, placing us well above the relevant manufacturing benchmarks in results and participation. In fact, on responses to how happy are you working at Ingersoll Rand we now rank in the top 10% of manufacturing organizations. When we talk about our performance because of our agility, nimbleness, and IRX, it's because of our people.  This is our culture. We always say and continue to believe that the combination of a highly engaged workforce coupled with an ownership mindset is a catalyst for long-term performance. The fact that, our voluntary turnover is less than 3%, even in this challenging environment also speaks highly of the culture we're nurturing and how we inspire our employees. I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the tremendous contributions of each and every one of our 16,000 employees. Without them, these results will not be possible.  Our Operate Sustainably strategic imperative, also highlights the speed at which our Company moves. In less than 18 months, we have been upgraded twice by MSCI,and we sit now at a rating of A. This is an improvement from approximately the bottom 1/3 to now, being in the top 1/3 of the companies rated by MSCI. We believe, based on our work, we will continue to see our ratings improve with the various ESG rating providers. Great strides have been made this year to accelerate growth and allocate capital effectively.  As we have announced or deployed approximately 1 billion towards M&A. In Q3, we completed both the Seepex and Maximus Solutions acquisitions and announced Air Dimension acquisition, last week. We also announced an agreement to acquire Tuthill Pumps earlier this week. We shared our comprehensive capital allocation strategy with you earlier in September. Along with our focus on M&A, we completed a large share repurchase as part of KKR sale of their final equity stake in the Company, as well as the prepayment of the more expensive trench of debt taken out last year during the onset of COVID.  And in addition, we initiated a quarterly dividend that began in Q4 and a new board authorized $750 million share repurchase program. On the next slide, it's a partial preview of what's to come at our November 18th Virtual Investor Day, where we look forward to talking in more detail about the mega trends. We and our customers are seeking to address in how Ingersoll Rand products and services help make life better for all our stakeholders. Our strategy enables all to compound our contribution to address in Megatrends, such as Digitization, Sustainability, and Quality of Life through organic growth enablers, where we have specific advantages.  For example, we continue to leverage our own unique and proprietary demand generation engine to drive a holistic approach to customer buying patterns. One that has already captured over 3 million end-user contents and allows us to generate over 200,000 marketing qualified leads per year. We also continued to invest in our industrial IoT platform. As we aim to connect or digitally-enable a meaningful portion of the $5 million assets that we have identified in the field. Moving to Slide 6, we're not unique in needing to effectively manage the challenges of the current supply chain environment. However, our key differentiator is our ability to respond with agility and discipline through the use of IRX to quickly and effectively minimize negative impacts from challenging supply chain conditions.  I would like to especially thank our global sourcing and logistics team at Ingersoll Rand, as well as our factory buyers and planners for their tireless efforts in creative thinking using data back analytics to overcome delivery gaps. We saw very early on that supply chain and logistics challenges were going to be an important issue. So we invested in this area to guarantee that we have rigorous processes and capabilities in place to succeed. This has produced outstanding results. Moving to slide 7, we will now look more closely at our recent inorganic achievements. We signed definitive agreements to acquire Tuthill Pumps, which is expected to close in Q4. And Air Dimensions, both of which will become part of the precision and science technology segment. We also closed acquisition of Lawrence Factor, which will become part of the Industrial Technology and Service segment. These 3 acquisitions are representative of the key characteristics we're targeting with our inorganic growth strategy. Tuthill Pump, is the second asset we have purchased from Tuthill Corporation.  It is a leader in the gear and piston pumping market. Which supports the expansion of our positive displacement pump portfolio. This is another example of a multi-generation family-owned Company, with premium assets that approached us on an exclusive basis because of the relationship that we have built and the opportunities they saw for their Company and employees, as part of the Ingersoll Rand family. This is another testament to how our unique approach to employee ownership allows us to be at the frontlines in M&A. Air Dimension, is a market leader in gas diaphragm pumps, which is complementary to our existing Lab and Life Science businesses, and is specialized for environmental applications like emission monitoring and bio-gas.  It has an impressive pre -synergy EBITDA margins of over 50%. And more than 70% of its revenue comes from, like-to-like replacement of original equipment and aftermarket parts. We also closed acquisition of Lawrence Factor, which will reside in the IPS segment. Lawrence Factor, is a great example of an acquisition that is well aligned with our Company purpose of making lives better. As our technology ensures safe work and play activities for people who depend on compressed air and gas, through their proprietary air sampling and aftermarket offerings. All 3 of these acquisitions were valued on attractive purchase multiple, and our synergy execution is expected to deliver mid-single-digit post-synergy realization by year 3, in line with our disciplined pre -deal screening process. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks Vicente. Moving to slide 8, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the Company in Q3, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution, fueled by the use of IRX to overcome a challenging inflationary and supply chain constrained environment. Our commitment to deliver $300 million in cost synergy, attributable to the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment acquisition remains intact, as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst.  Total Company orders and revenue increased 37% and 19% year-over-year, respectively, driven by strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Compared to 2019 as-reported orders in Q3 were up 27%, and 16% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, highlighting the strong performance of our business irrespective of the COVID impacted 2020. Our orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the Company eclipsing Q2 and setting us up well, as we move into Q4.  The Company delivered third-quarter adjusted EBITDA $314 million, a year-over-year improvement of $62 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.7%, a 110 basis point improvement year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $307 million, after taking into account the unique items as pointed out on the slide. Total liquidity of $3.1 billion at quarter-end was up approximately $0.7 billion from prior year. This now takes our net leverage to 1.3 times, a 1.2 times improvement from prior year. Turning to slide nine for the total Company orders increased 33% and revenue increased 17%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Overall, we post a strong book-to-bill of 1.13x for the quarter.  We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q4, which is up approximately 40% from the end of 2020, The ITS and PST segments both saw year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA margin on ITS improved a 150 basis points. While the PST segment margin declined 100 basis points driven by the impact of the SEEPEX and Maximus Solutions acquisitions, both of which closed in Q3. When adjusted to exclude the impact of the SEEPEX in Maximus acquisitions, PST margins increased by 20 basis points. Finally, corporate cost came in at $35 million for the quarter. Up year-over-year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like, demand-generation.  We expect corporate cost to remain elevated at comparable levels in Q4 due to the same drivers. One other item of note is the adjusted tax rate which came in at 10% for the quarter and stands at 15% on a year-to-date basis. The adjusted rate is benefiting from our tax restructuring efforts that we've outlined before and specifically a few nonrecurring impacts driven by our movement of IP and implementation of a royalty structure, as well as the utilization of carry-forward foreign tax credits. As a result, we do expect the adjusted rate for the year to be in the mid-teens. But as we look ahead to 2022, we would expect the rate to be back in the low 20s due to the non-repeat of some of these items.  Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter with $131 million on a continuing ops basis driven by strong operational performance across the business and prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $6 million of synergy and stand-up outflows related to the IR merger. In addition, free cash flow also included $220 million in cash tax payments related to the capital gains realized due to the divestitures of the HPS and SVT segments. Finally, free cash flow also included a $49 million payment from Trane Technologies for post-closing adjustments related to the IR merger. Excluding these 3 items, adjusted free cash flow was $307 million. Leverage for the quarter was 1.3 times, which was up 1.2 times improvement as compared to prior year. Total Company liquidity now stands at $3.1 billion based on approximately $2 billion of cash, and over $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility.  Liquidity decreased by $1.6 billion in the quarter as we executed our capital allocation strategy by buying back $731 million in shares as part of KKR sale of the remaining equity stake, strategically deployed nearly $600 million to M&A and prepaid approximately $400 million in debt, to remove the tranche of debt taken out during the onset of COVID-19, which carried a higher interest rate. We maintain considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy through M&A, coupled with targeted internal investment to drive sustainable organic growth. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segments. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 11 in our Industrial Technology and Service segment, revenue was up 14%. The team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 26% year-over-year, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.5%, up 150 basis points year-over-year, with an incremental margin of 33%. Organic orders were up 31% Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the high 30%, a further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows orders were oil-free up over 50% and oil lubricated up over 30%. In the Americas, orders in North America were up mid-20s, while Latin America was up high 40s. Mainline Europe delivered strong performance of high 40s, while India and Middle East, so continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 70%. Asia-Pacific continues to perform well with orders up high 30s, driven by strong mid-50% growth in China, and mid-single-digit decline across the rest of Asia-Pacific.  In banking [Indiscernible], always were up low 30s on a global basis with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to power tools and lifting, orders for the total business were up mid 20s and so, continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improve execution on new product launches. We will also like to highlight one of the many ways that, we enable our customers to become more sustainable. Our LeROI gas compressors are used to capture bio-gas immediate from landfills, dairy farms, and wastewater facilities. As the gas is emitted, the system captures the gas, cleaning the methane from other gases such as, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. And our LeROI product compresses the methane for reinjection into pipelines or storage for power generation, both of which enabled the customer to capture additional economic value. The compressor enables to capture up to 50% of the emitted bio-gas. Whereas without it, 100% of the gas will be released into the atmosphere. Our significant into base of 25,000 units will help capture 240 million cubic feet of bio-gas in the next 2 years. Technology such as these across our portfolio enable us to advance our ESG impact not only with the steps we're taking internally to reduce our carbon footprint, water, and energy usage, but also create significant value for our customers from both sustainability and economic perspectives. Moving to Slide 12, and the Precision and Science Technology segment, revenue was up 10% organically, which remains encouraging given the tough comps due to COVID-related orders and revenue in Q3 of 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivers strong adjusted EBITDA of $76 million which was up 17%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was, 29.7% down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by the impact of SEEPEX and Maximus Solutions.  And again, the segment was up 20 basis points, excluding the impact of those acquisitions. Overall, organic orders were up 25% driven by the ARO and Milton Roy product lines and the Medical and Dosatron businesses which serve Lab, life sciences, water, and animal health and markets. All of these businesses were up double-digits in the quarter. Incremental margins were up 25% as reported, and 33% when excluding SEEPEX and Maximus. In this segment we would like to highlight the momentum our Haskell hydrogen solution business continues to build to making life better through a more sustainable world. We have announced a long-term agreement with Hiringa Refueling to supply high capacity hydrogen refueling stations for a nationwide green hydrogen network across New Zealand. Hiringa, has played the first order of 4 stations, with a total commitment of 24 stations to be provided through 2026. The totality of these frame agreement alone, will double our Haskel hydrogen refueling business on a revenue basis. We're incredibly excited about this partnership. And as we spoke about last quarter, the investments we're making to expand our technologies and manufacturing capabilities in these high-growth market s are producing meaningful growth. Moving to Slide 13, given the Company's performance in Q3 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the divested high-pressure Solutions and Specialty Vehicle technology segments, as well as the pending acquisition Tuthill Pumps. However, Sypex, Maximus Solutions, Air Dimensions, and Lawrence Factor are included in our guidance.  Our prior revenue guidance was up mid-teens on a reported basis, comprised of low double-digit organic growth across both of our segments. We're now guiding up high-teens in total with low double-digit growth. organic growth across both segments. This reflects an approximately 100 basis point increase in organic growth for the total Company as compared to prior guidance. FX, is expected to continue to be low single-digit tailwind. M&A was previously expected to contribute approximately $60 million in revenue. But given the closed acquisition of Maximus, Seepex, Air Dimensions, and Lawrence Factor, we're increasing that expected contribution to a $135 million. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.175 billion to $1.195 billion which represents a $20 million improvement from prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. In terms of cash generation, we expect adjusted free cash flow to adjusted Net Income conversion to remain greater than or equal to a 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the [Indiscernible] for the reasons Vik provided earlier. Turning to Slide 14, we're very excited about our upcoming Virtual Investor Day, which is fast approaching and will be held on November 18. We look forward to outlining our long-term growth strategy fueled by alignment with Megatrends and compounded by our unique organic growth enablers. We will provide detail on our markets and technologies, and further discuss how our strong talent, operational execution, demand generation, and M&A capabilities, coupled with a sustainable growth mindset creates incredible competitive advantages for our Company.  We will also outline future financial targets. You can register for the event using the link on Slide 14 and I look forward to seeing many of you on the webcast. Moving to Slide 15, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding position. 2021 is poised to be a great year, despite the challenging environment. To our employees, I want to again say thank you for your relentless efforts to execute and solve tough problems throughout the quarter.  They are absolutely appreciated. It is apparent in our Company's performance. We are actively investing to deliver outpaced growth, both organically and through M&A, to continue increase in the quality of our portfolio. We continue to take our role as a sustainability minded industry leader very serious. And our employees eagerly embraced IRX that puts us in that leadership position. We're proud of the transformation we have achieved at Ingersoll Rand and are excited about the future opportunity to compound growth and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to the Operator and open for Q&A. Operator : Thanks very much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mike Halloran from Baird. Mike, your line is open if you'd like to proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Vik Kini : Good morning, Mike. Vicente Reynal : Hi, Mike. Mike Halloran : So let's start on the guide, and how you guys are thinking about the fourth quarter coming up year sales. Obviously, if you feel good about what the demand conditions look like, you're layering on some acquisitions here. 3Q was a good quarter in terms of performance, feels like maybe the margins on an organic basis are a little lower than what the sequential trend would imply. So maybe some commentary on how you're thinking about that as you move into the fourth quarter, and certainly correct me if I have the wrong assumption there. Vicente Reynal : Mike, as of -- our guidance, as you heard, is taking the midpoint of our prior guidance of by $20 million. You can think about it being 2/3 M&A and 1/3 is organic. In this current environment, we continue to be prudent, based on the overall supply chain environment noise of situation that you hear out there. In addition, just to point out, ITS margins in Q4, 2020 were up for 400 basis points reaching 26% margins. What our guidance here implies is that even with all the inflation, discretionary spend, increases and investments, we're going to be kind of flattish in margin expansion year-over-year, which speaks to all the great actions that the teams continued to execute, and puts that segment to a very solid margin performance in this environment, we believe.  And PST margins for the core business, which is kind of excluding the M&A that we said is EBITDA decretive but gross margin accretive. And some of the accelerated Hydrogen investment that we're doing based on that frame order that we just received. The EBITDA margin profile still is in the 30's kind of range, which we view as quite healthy given the top comps on medical shipments in 2020, as well as the inflation and discretionary investment that we have done here in 2021 and still do -- plan to do in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about that, and at the same time, prudent in terms of how we see supply chain out there. Mike Halloran : Since -- If I'm hearing you right, you're not implying that the market headwinds accelerate for you on the margin line 3Q to 4Q in terms of supply chain logistics, labor, transportation, expenses, things like that. Vik Kini : Yes, Mike, I wouldn't -- No, I think what [Indiscernible] saying is exactly in line with how you're interpreting it. Clearly, obviously, a lot of those same headwinds persist into Q4. But like we've been doing, we think we've kind of taken prudent pricing actions to kind of remain in line with offsetting those headwinds, much like you saw in Q3. So I think in that respect we see Q4 fairly comparable to Q3 in terms of price mitigating the inflationary risks. Mike Halloran : Got you. And then on the order side, obviously really strong orders, good to see. Maybe some thoughts on what types of orders, those are -- those more short cycle in nature or is this just a kind of MRO short-cycle type move or are you starting to see some more project or CapEx type orders coming through the funnel as well. Obviously, you highlighted the hydrogen, but I'm thinking a little bit more broadly. Vicente Reynal : Yes, I think, Mike, we're seeing kind of both. We see sustainable momentum on the short-cycle. And actually what we see is, long-cycle accelerating that some projects are getting released. The hydrogen being one, but others like, the bio-gas, is a very substantial project too as well. We're pretty pleased with what we're seeing. At the same time I can tell you that we're -- with the level of technologies that we have across our portfolio, you're going to hear a lot more about this during Investor Day is how we're able to pretty quickly, reallocate technologies to some of those end markets that are seeing some meaningful growth. And with the level of agility that we have in our business, it's positioned really well to capture the tailwind from any of those markets and continue to see that continue to sustain momentum in the order rates. Mike Halloran : Great. Appreciate it, gentlemen. Thank you. Vik Kini : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line will be open now, if you'd like to proceed. Joe Ritchie : Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Vik Kini : Hey, Joe. Vicente Reynal : Morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Maybe to staying with orders, obviously, clearly incredibly strongest quarter. I'm just curious, are you starting to hear this more CapEx decisions being made, Vicente, where your customers are looking to deploy a little bit more CapEx in this environment that's given, given the supply chain, is been fairly unprecedented in what we're experiencing today, or is this -- is it predominantly still a lot of OpEx that's coming through here? Vicente Reynal : Joe, we're definitely hearing a lot more on the CapEx too as well. And when we hear about CapEx, it really has to do with ESG and sustainability. And it's exciting to see that a lot of the older technologies, the majority of our technologies are enablers and beneficiary for ESG. And I think the exciting thing here is that, compressors can reduce energy consumption and you can see how energy has really radically increased across mainland Europe and even also China. So whether compressors, blowers and back-ends, we have always spoken a lot about our energy efficiency. And so I think customers are starting to make the move based on the targets that they set up themselves to be by achieving by 2020, 2030 and 2050. So I think a lot of this is really seem some -- it's going to see, it can still continue momentum in my view. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. And I guess just maybe if you could just parse out that pricing commentary a little bit more. I'd be curious to hear how positive the price cost equation was this quarter, what the expectation is through the end of the year, and then as we head into 2022, should we continue to see pretty decent price cost benefit coming through your numbers? Vik Kini : Yes. Sure, Joe, I'll take that one. So in the context of Q3, price realization was a little bit in excess of 3% across the entire enterprise, which obviously speaks to the healthy performance and frankly the proactive measures that frankly, all of our business is taking. Pricing did slightly outweigh inflation in Q3, so we were price-cost positive in the context of Q3, we would expect to be at fairly comparable of that equation in Q4. Now it is worth noting obviously that not unexpectedly inflation, obviously, headwind have risen in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We always expected that, and that's why we got ahead a lot of the pricing actions.  Again, we're quite pleased with the performance and the momentum that we're seeing. As we think about 2022, frankly, a little bit too early to start guiding on numbers just yet, but obviously, we would expect to see healthy carryover on the pricing actions. I'd say the majority of the pricing actions that we have taken are, our list price oriented. So obviously, it should be inherently a little bit stickier. But obviously, we do obviously have some carryover inflation that, we will be dealing with into 2022, as well. So we're -- we'll reserve commentary just yet on the price cost equation into 2022. But I think we're quite encouraged by the actions the team has taken to still say, price cost positive in the context of the second half of this year. Joe Ritchie : Sounds good. Nice job guys. Vik Kini : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel, your line is open now, if you'd like to proceed. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to attack on the back of that question, inflation. Just how do you define inflation? Do you just look at the direct input costs, the materials, is that labor and a board, definition increasing freight? That'll be interesting to hear. But just curious on obviously the orders very strong. Can you maybe talk about where we are on the revenue synergy capture from the merger? Obviously, you put together a much more balanced portfolio showing some clear synergies across the product. So, just wondering if some of this order strength is seeing some of the synergies come through? Vik Kini : Nigel, I'll take the first one and I'll let Vicente speak to the second one on the revenue synergies. On the price cost, specifically on the cost comments that I made. The inflationary numbers that I was speaking to really are, what we'll call direct material and logistics or freight. Obviously, we all, of course, measure and look at, what I'll call, labor inflation. The reality is, labor inflation has been frankly largely in line with our expectations the majority of this year. So again, while we do look at it, the commentary that I made was specifically around price versus what we'll call direct material and logistics. And I think one thing that we're quite pleased with, that Vicente mentioned it here is quite frankly, yes, while labor is, we're in the same labor environment than everyone else is. We've been really pleased with our retention rates and our very low voluntary turnover, which I think Vicente spoke to in the prepared comments. Speaks very highly of the culture, and a lot of the employee engagement and ownership initiatives that we put forth. Vicente Reynal : Yeah, I'll draw on the second question around the orders in terms of revenue synergies coming from the transaction, yes, we're definitely seeing some of that. You're going to hear more on some of the case stories that we will show you during the Investor Day. But clearly we're very pleased with how our oil-free compressor product line is moving, how air treatment -- a lot of good momentum that with a little product that we have launched and through the multichannel, multi-brand strategy that we have on a global basis is really giving us some good tailwinds on that. Nigel Coe : And secondly, on the Investor Day, you said longer-term target, just wondering, are we looking here at sort of three-year targets, but not 2022? Vik Kini : That's correct. We'll be talking about we'll call 2025 targets in the framework to think about. And then we will formally guide 2022 when we do our next earnings call. Nigel Coe : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : And your next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff, your line is open now. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just coming back one more on cost also I would've guessed, actually you might need more than 3% price to offset inflation. So I'm just wondering if in that direct materials, I would assume you are including, you're kind of sourcing and merger-related benefits. Sure, it gets harder and harder to kind of separate those with the passage of time. But maybe just update us where you're at on that, and what role that's playing in helping you battle the inflation here. Vik Kini : Just to be clear and put a finer point on it. The pricing number you're going to see in the cue when it's issued tomorrow, right around 3.4%- 3.5% kind of net across the entire enterprise. Fairly comparable numbers between ITS and PST. And in the context of what I was speaking to in terms of that covering inflationary headwinds, we're not incorporating, let's call it any of the merger related synergies, or anything of that, into that equation. You're right, it does become a bit of a score keeping exercise, but we've been pretty disciplined and prudent to keep those buckets separate, in terms of how we actually manage and run the organization. So things like some of the direct material productivity or some of the innovative value. Those are separate, and I will say, as we said at the beginning of the call, we're still on track to deliver the kind of the year 2 synergies as part of the merger, which was the $100 million number that we committed to. Jeff Sprague : That's great to hear. Thanks. And then just on the new M&A, you gave us the total additional revenue contribution. But would you mind just checking through those 3, what the annualized revenue of each one of those are? Vik Kini : Sure. I can absolutely do that. So in terms of the 3 acquisitions that we've kind of spoken to here, which are Air Dimensions, Tuthill Pumps, and Lawrence Factor. Air Dimensions is a low double-digit right around $10 million to $12 million in annualized revenue. The Tuthill Pumps is in the mid-20s in terms of 25 which is probably a good number to use. And Lawrence Factor is relatively small. It's a $6 million purchase price, which is actually very comparable to the revenue base and mid-single-digits, about $5 million, but very exciting technology on air sampling and aftermarket offerings that we think we can leverage very highly within our IPS portfolio. Jeff Sprague : Great, appreciate it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian, your line will be open now if you would like to proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just -- Good morning. Maybe just circling back on aggregate incremental margin or operating leverage. So it's running in the sort of mid-20s, firm-wide, I think the back half of this year. Understand the cost constraints, and new acquisitions coming in affecting that. But as you look at next year, how quickly, I guess, do we see that operating leverage move back into the 30s. Do you think something that can happen fairly quickly, or it's just too early to tell given these acquisitions that just come in and given the cost environment is moving around quite quickly? Vik Kini : Yes. I think that the latter part of your statement's probably true. I think obviously we're working through our views on 2022 and the annual budgeting process as you would expect right now. I think it's a little too early to call. I think the view right now is the first half of 2022. Obviously, we're still going to be facing some of the same dynamics we're facing now with regards to some of the inflationary headwinds, and obviously we have the pricing momentum to continue to offset some of that, if not all of that. And then frankly, yes, we will be continuing to integrate a lot of those acquisitions. So, I think given the carryover price, as well as the continued inflation into 2022, and then frankly, the synergy expectations for the base business, because we shouldn't forget that we still have the third year of the merger-related synergies as well as the integration nationally acquired assets. We would expect to continue to see that trend improve as we move through 2022 based on kind of what we can see now and get more client closer to web. Let's call it that 30 \u2013 ish percent type number that we've been seeing across the segments, if not a little bit healthier. But I'd say right now, the specific timing of exact cadence is something we're working through. And I think we'll give a bit more color as we do our next earnings call and formal guidance for 2022. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then just on the capital deployment, so yes, about a billion dollars of deployed sort of M&A funds this year. Maybe when you look at sort of across those acquisitions or you can call out one or two specific ones or more interested in maybe the total deployment, what do you think the 3 or 5 year return, sort of metric should be on those billion dollars or so that you have deployed? And if there's maybe 1 or 2 acquisitions in particular where you think the margin expansion should be above average. Now that they are all once, they're integrated into Ingersoll. Vicente Reynal : I think, Julian, we should definitely expect to see that, kind of low double-digit to mid-teen ROIC return on these transactions. We always said that that is a financial criteria that we have in our deals. We're still finding great transactions that, are highly complementary from technology, from commercial acumen, and all of that. And still be able to provide a good financial outcome based on a lot of post-synergy activities that we can do. Julian Mitchell : And then any sort of color Vicente on specific transactions that, you think offer above-average sort of margin expansion scope. Vicente Reynal : Well, one that I'll say comes to mind right now, for sure, SEEPEX, right? When we acquired SEEPEX, we said that was a mid-teens EBITDA. But we see that business to be way like a segment level to PST. So that is a tremendous margin expansion. Also, on the ITS, the recently acquired -- the recently signed transaction on Tuthill Pumps. When you think about the prior Tuthill, I mean, it was a phenomenal margin expansion, so we still expect that to see some good momentum on expanding that. So, I think really across the Board, the Board, in a lot of the transactions we expect to see some good meaningful expansion. Clearly, when you look at Maximus that is already acquired at PST difficult than that. And also, Air Dimensions, that is in the 50s, more difficult to continue spanning on that. And those tend to be, then focus more on the organic growth opportunities that we see, as we look into our commercial global footprint to expand the growth there. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andy, your line is now open if you'd like to proceed. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Morning [Indiscernible]. Andy Kaplowitz : You said that you've really been pushing hard into some of these newer markets over the last couple of years, lab life sciences, water, animal health, which obviously is leading to that 35% order growth in 20% revenue, growth in PST that you saw. If we look back Gardner Denver is all medical business at average, I think something like mid-single-digit growth, but given the sort of niche focus of PST and what seems like higher-growth markets. Is it fair to say the PST could average higher than mid-single-digits as you go into '22 and beyond? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Absolutely. I think we feel really compelled on that. I mean, I think as you said, old investments that we're doing are paying off in terms of, redirecting into these very niche markets and commanding some good, strong leadership positions, launching a lot of new product. You're going to hear a lot more about that also on the Investors Day, on how the cadence of new product has just been accelerated dramatically. Even during the COVID days, the team accelerated the new? [Indiscernible]product development and we're seeing that come through for? [Indiscernible] here now and into next year. Andy Kaplowitz : Great. And then maybe a little bit more color into what's going on regionally for you guys, particularly in China. It looks like you had a really strong compressor growth in China, and I know it's one of your key initiatives for the combined Company, but the rest of APAC orders were down a little bit in compressors. So maybe just talk about regionally, what's going on, particularly in Asia. Vicente Reynal : Andy, I think we're incredibly pleased with how the team continues to execute in Asia-Pacific and particularly in China. And what we saw quarter-over-quarter, Q2 to Q3, we saw actually the momentum of orders really accelerate in China, which is kind of contradictory through some of the things that you hear out there in other companies. So, it speak to a lot of the self-help initiatives that the team is doing. We spoke about relaunching the Gardner Denver compressors, which obviously has proven to be a tremendous success into -- and that was something that we always said we were super excited about, the combination of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver because we could have a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy, particularly in China.  The team has just done a phenomenal job, leveraging the [Indiscernible] initiative and an action to then relaunch an entire product portfolio with Gardner Denver. The second piece is Blowers and Vacuums. Blowers and vacuums was fairly small piece in China. And again, I think the team is putting a lot of good dedication and localizing and really penetrating some of the end-markets that we have seen are good in terms of applications in other regions.  The rest of Asia-Pacific, I can maybe split it between emerging and developing, like Australia, for example. And that's still continued to perform fairly well, where we saw a little bit of softness was on the emerging as countries like Vietnam or Philippines was created on a lot of shutdowns due to COVID. But again, that's a fairly small portion of our business. Therefore, China overcoming some of that decline still drive meaningful growth in the quarter for Asia-Pacific. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Vicente. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Rob, your line is now open, if you'd like to proceed. Rob Wertheimer : Hi, thank you. Vicente, I'd love to hear if you have any more color on how IRX was applied to supply chain issues that maybe rose and [Indiscernible] through the quarter, and switched the quarterly cadence upper or are added to the process of anyway, and then maybe just the outflow of that. We had a few unexpected cost surprises across industrial first quarter, you guys avoided that entirely. I'm curious if you think that the risk of unexpected surprises is nil because you've got a handle on it or whether it lasts another few months, whether you see more and more issues pop up that you have to deal with, or whether it's stable, just general outlook on supply chain over the next couple of quarters if you would. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Absolutely. Great question there. I mean, so I can tell you that definitely things will continue to pop up. And even though -- clearly based on the results, you can see how we have overcome. It really speaks to a lot of great work that everyone is doing. And I will say, great work supported by IRX and the process and the tool that we use. So we have definitely leveraged the IRX tool as you know, it's a very high cadence, high touch mechanism that we used to just accelerate how we execute and reprioritize the teams to the critical items. And that has allowed us to create this massive agility and nimbleness, even though obviously, we're a fairly large global Company and allows us to really redirect the teams, do the proper priorities that are happening out there. So for example, we leveraged IRX when logistics was a major issue. And you could go say, for example, into a factor you can see how IRX to tool we were leveraging to track the backlog of containers that we needed to fulfill and acquire as an example. I mean as simple as that could be. But now we're leveraging the IRX to prioritize the suppliers and the commodities that we need to go after. And again, that daily, weekly cadence of ensuring that the team has continued to see a good momentum and good perspective. It's really what's giving us the outcome that you see here. So I think as we continue, I mean, we think we live in a very dynamic world that we'll continue to see some maybe challenges. But that's why we have always said that agility and nimbleness is going to be a core competitive advantage, follow through the use of IRX as a tool to really execute, is just giving us that great sense of comforts zone that the teams will be able to continue to perform well. Rob Wertheimer : Right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski, from Morgan Stanley. Josh, your line is now open if you'd like to proceed. Josh Pokrzywinski : Good morning, guys. Vik Kini : Morning Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a question on -- I guess a question on compressor orders. I understand there's some virtuous [Indiscernible] going on there, but any idea of where those stand on, kind of the historical basis like, are we at all-time highs on compressor orders today? Obviously, there's a lot of new pieces of the portfolio and the combination. And what do you think the market has done sort of relative to you guys? Because apparently there is a recovery going on, but I would imagine that with some of the IRX tools you're gaining a lot of shares well. Vicente Reynal : Yes, George, I think in terms of compressor orders, we're definitely way above 2019 levels. And one could think that, it could be at a record level. We haven't done and going backwards to -- with the combined companies to really reassess if these record levels or not, but we haven't done that. We're just focused on, continue to execute and take solid market share. So in terms of against what we see in the market, I think we continue to position ourselves as a premium provider of compressor products. You see that we're focused on not only in the growth, but also on the profitability.  So we believe in profitable growth is one of our key drivers and enablers for us. And with a unique differentiation that we're launching, in terms of technologies that reduced total cost of ownership and great energy reductions, I think that is what has positioned us really well to continue to take some share and continue to launch products that help with that. One example, the team in Europe, the CompAir teams has launched a new compressor. Very large, fairly sizable compressor that has some radical new technology, and it is one of the most efficient compressors of that size and power in the market today. So, a lot of continued innovation is really what is driving the momentum in my view. And because we're able to deliver some differentiated value to the customers, then we're able to continue to command that -- the price positioning that we have in the market. Josh Pokrzywinski : That's helpful. I guess, maybe just following up on that last comment on kind of the pricing power and pricing to value. It seems like steel could start to becoming down here. Can't help but notice the average Ingersoll Rand product, particularly in the ITS portfolio, has an awful lot of ferrous content in it. If steel prices say got cut in half, what sort of cost tailwind would that be to you guys? Because I would imagine that pricing stays fairly sticky in that environment. Vicente Reynal : Great point there, Josh. Definite pricing are very sticky, and as we look forward, and commodities continue to get stabilized, yes, we should see that margin progression to even accelerate. Not only from the commodity, but also as we continue to execute a lot of the I2B initiatives that we have in our funnel. So we're overcoming the current market situation fairly well. In my opinion, I guess, again, thanks to the team in leveraging the tools that we have like a IRX, but as this current inflationary market continue -- subsides at some point in time in 2022, we should see earnings power to accelerate. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks, guys. Best of luck. Vik Kini : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole, your line is now open. Nicole Deblase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Hi, Nicole. Nicole Deblase : So we've been through a lot here, but I guess I just have a few pretty brief ones. First, just a clarification. I think you talked about, Vik like, 30% PST margins in the fourth quarter, but that was organic. Is the drag from M&A expected to be pretty similar to 3Q? I know you have some more deals folding in, in the fourth quarter. Vik Kini : That's great, just to be clear, that's 30% online unlock all the base business. Obviously the overall -- because you have a full quarter now off the acquisitions, primarily SEEPEX, which you only had 1 month of in the Q3. So the overall margin profile for PST, it will be dilutive, obviously, upfront here. You're thinking kind of more on in the upper 20s range. That's probably a probably decent proxy or maybe a little bit more dilutive than the impact you saw discretely in Q3 just because of the full-quarter impact at SEEPEX. But to the [Indiscernible] point here, the [Indiscernible] views on the SEEPEX is as gross margin accretive business. So obviously there's meaningful synergy opportunity that admittedly, you're going to see us start to execute on very shortly here into 2022 onward. Nicole Deblase : Got it, thanks, Vik. And then secondly, on the synergy profile, I know no change to the $300 million full run rate synergies. But are you guys still expecting to do about $50 million incremental in 2022? I'm just thinking about all the big puts and takes in the walk into next year. Vik Kini : Definitely a lot of puts and takes. But, Nicole, at this point, that's correct. Just to re-calibrate, $115 million was delivered in 2020, we expect a $100 million this year, $50 million next year, and then the tail which will be $35 million into 2023. At this point in time, nothing's really changed in terms of that phasing. And clearly as we move into 2022 and onwards, I'd say I2V and the footprint components of that equation are probably the more prominent drivers of the synergy profile, moving forward. Nicole Deblase : Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Nicole. Operator : Our next question is from Markus Mittermaier from UBS. Markus, your line is now open. Markus Mittermaier : Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to -- Vicente Reynal : Hi, Mark Markus Mittermaier : Hey, hi, good morning. Follow-up on George 's question, if I may, on compressor orders in -- if I look at that particularly compared to your large European peers, they're quite impressive. And this has been going on for few quarters now. I wonder if it's product, is this channel, is this -- you guys may be managing availability better. I think if you could elaborate on that, that would be great. And then connected to that, how much visibility do you have into the backlog? Obviously, at these massive order intake numbers, there could be some concerns that some customers, just for the build slots, I just wonder the risk of [Indiscernible] how do you adjust that? Vicente Reynal : Markus, in terms of the first question about the compressors orders, I'll tell you that it's a little bit of everything. It's definitely the product, because again, how we are leveraging the entire product portfolio across multiple brands, it is also the channel. And I think this is a great lead question Markus, as we go into to the Investors Day, because we have case studies actually that we will show you on how we have expanded our channel to really accelerated growth, and also reposition the product to really accelerated growth. So I think it has to do with a lot of the work that we have done since the product summits. If you remember, back in the -- I don't know, about a year ago we spoke a lot about product summit and how the team, so it's just being very thoughtful way and then executed with the use of IRX to really reposition a lot of the products on the channel with out creating any conflict.  I think that has proven to be a pretty successful recipe. Availability in some products has been actually quite good. I saw that team is marketing for [Indiscernible] and Blowers that we have one of the best lead times and how that is accelerating now even the momentum as they see here in the fourth quarter. To your question in terms of visibility of backlog, customers for compressors, because you have to customize many times the options to the specific application. There's not a lot of pre -order that can be done on compressors, just because of the optionality. And the visibility that we have in the backlog in the compressors is really on the more larger compressor, the multistage centrifugal compressor that are -- we positioned that as more long-cycle business. And those -- when we're doing a contract with a customer, we have caveats where we could actually pass or surcharge any specific cost increases that we're seeing through the supply chain in this environment. So I think we feel that we're doing everything that we can to protect ourselves in case that, obviously, inflation continues to stay at this level and commodities do not go down. But I think we feel good in terms of how we're protecting ourselves from a cost position. Markus Mittermaier : That's very helpful, thanks. And just a very brief follow-u to that last comments, so that's 40% increased backlog, which is probably related to those longer cycle orders. You could, if you have to re-price that, understand that write-off. Vik Kini : Let me let me clarify here. So the 40% increase in backlog is overall, it's total. So some of the longer cycle projects are part of that, sure. But also some of it and a good portion of it is obviously just the normal course orders that we've taken for things that are typically what I'll call shorter to medium cycle type compressor, not the larger compressors. In terms of the comment on whether you can re-price backlog. As I said, there's components like, the longer cycle that you do have some of those optionality. By and large though, no. I mean, most of the rest of the backlog is typically a couple of months in duration, and you wouldn't expect to re-price that. Clearly, it's inclusive of the pricing actions we've already taken, but not typical to re-price those types of backlog items. Vicente Reynal : Kind of the [Indiscernible] I'll say it one more point there, Markus. I mean, we track pricing on bookings, so we know we have a really great leading indicator on how that backlog is doing against the price increases that we have done. Markus Mittermaier : Super. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions registered. So hand the call back to Vicente for closing remarks. Vicente, over to you. Vicente Reynal : Great. I just want to say thank you for the interest in Ingersoll Rand. I know that many of our employees are participating in the call. I also see that many of our employees from the new acquisitions are on the call. So I just want to say one more time, welcome to those of you that are new. Exciting to have everyone on board, exciting that how very thankful for everything that all of you are doing every day to make life better for our customers, our employees, our communities, and obviously our shareholders. So with that, we'll leave it here for now, and talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you to everyone who has joined us today. This concludes the call and you may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Lithia and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] 00:23 It's my pleasure to now hand you over to our host, Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations at Ingersoll Rand. Please go ahead when you're ready. Chris Miorin : 00:33 Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2021 fourth quarter and full-year earnings call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday and we will reference these during the call, both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. 01:07 Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. 01:27 In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. 01:47 On today's call, we will provide a strategy update, review our company and segment financial highlights and announce 2022 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up to allow time for other participants. 02:04 At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : 02:07 Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Starting on slide 3, 2021 was a pivotal year for Ingersoll Rand with many accomplishments and new records. We solidified our compounding growth story as we reshaped our portfolio to focus on mission critical flow creation technologies and high growth sustainable end markets. While establishing a new capital allocation strategy designed to enable us to consistently compound earnings over time. 02:37 We continue the strong operational execution where the commercial effectiveness of our team, driven by our IRX process yielded a backlog at the end of the fourth quarter that was our largest ever and positions us very well for continued strong results in 2022 as demand for our products and services continues to grow. 03:00 Moving to slide forward, I want to take a moment to recognize some of the accomplishments across each of our 5 strategic imperatives in 2021. In Deploy Talent our employees think like owners, because they are, shares granted to employees today have appreciated from $250 million to over $500 million in value, motivating our engaged employee base to make decisions each day that can benefit our value creation and ultimately their personal wealth. Furthermore, we implemented a plan to also grant shares to employees who joined us as new employees or via acquisitions, yet another factor enabling Ingersoll Rand to be considered an employer and acquirer of choice. 03:49 Our employee engagement score up 17% over the last 3 years also shows the power of ownership. Our current engagement score now ranked in the top quartile of manufacturing organization. In Expand Margins, we have improved the company's adjusted EBITDA margin 370 basis points in 2019, include an improvement of 160 basis points in 2021 alone. We have realized $215 million in synergies out of the $300 million commitment from the IR merger with an additional $50 million expected in 2022. It operates terribly, we continue to make progress and have received recognition from ESG rating agencies, including S&P Global and MSCI. Once again demonstrating how we leverage the power of IRX to drive performance across a multitude of initiatives. 04:46 In accelerate growth our unique growth enablers outlined during our 2021 Investor Day strongly contributed to growth in the past year. Our demand generation engine now generates 3 times more marketing qualified leads compared to 2018. IIoT enabled assets were up 250% year-over-year and new product innovation increased 95% in 2021. We allocate capital effectively, we secured approximately $2 billion in gross proceeds from the divestitures of Club Car and High Pressure Solutions. And we deployed over $1 billion to acquisitions in 2021, which represents over 6% of sales when annualized. 05:32 We also repurchased $731 million in shares as part of the KKR\u2019s final equity sale, established a new $750 million share repurchase program and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share during the fourth quarter. We're incredibly proud of our 2021 accomplishment and could not have done it without the dedication of our team. 05:56 Turning to Slide 5. We're committed to executing the strategy we outlined at our 2021 Investor Day and are confident it will produce the expected results. This slide outlines how we are already delivering on that strategy and associated commitment. Our portfolio is now positioned to capitalize on global mega trends, such as digitalization, sustainability and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver mid-single digit organic growth through 2025. And as you can see, we outperformed on this commitment in 2021, delivering 12% year-over-year organic growth. When coupled with mid-single digit annual growth from M&A and technology investments, we expect to deliver total growth of low double digits through 2025. And in 2021, we delivered 4% in year growth from M&A and 6% annualized. 06:56 Our strong pricing, aftermarket and i2V initiatives enable us to generate operating leverage and incremental productivity with an expected 100 basis points of margin improvement per year over the period. And in 2021 we over-delivered on this target, capturing 160 basis points of margin expansion, despite several challenges like supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. With IRX as our competitive differentiator and over 275 Impact Daily Management or IDMs across our company each week, our high performance culture encourages strong execution. These continue to support our goal of being a premier high quality company that consistently compounds earnings by double-digit each year, which -- with free cash flow margins in the high teens. And we feel that we're well on our way as in 2021, we grew EPS by 63% and achieve adjusted free cash flow margin of 16%. 07:59 Turning to Slide 6, we have achieved strong margin improvement across our portfolio. since 2019. Looking at the company, margins improved 370 basis points from 2019 despite COVID impact and persistent supply chain and inflationary pressures. In the ITS segment, we improved an impressive 470 basis points since 2019 as we continue to accelerate synergy capture and execute on value creation opportunities from the IR merger. Incremental operating leverage and productivity should enable ITS to achieve margins in the high '20s over time. In the PST segment margins have expanded 170 basis points in 2019 and 290 basis points, excluding M&A. Continued strong flow through in the base PST business coupled with diligent synergy execution as we onboard acquisitions should yield adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid '30s over time. 09:04 It is important to note that as we highlight on the last bullet point, due to the nature of our products we're mission critical with premium brands and high quality and reliability and we have the ability to remain price cost positive. We have accomplished these in each quarter since the merger even during these inflationary times and expect to do the same in 2022. 09:29 Moving to Slide 7. We're thrilled to announce the recent validation of Ingersoll Rand\u2019s progress as an industry leader in ESG. Based on the demonstrated progress we receive another upgrade from MSCI, which is our second upgrade in the past 18 months and now have an A rating. And I'm really excited to announce that S&P Global in its Annual Sustainability Assessment that was just released a few weeks ago scored Ingersoll Rand in the top 15% and included is in its sustainability yearbook for 2022. In addition, S&P Global recognize us with the Industry Mover Award, which is given to the most improved company in each sector of the year. These recognitions exemplify our unwavering commitment to ESG. 10:26 In March of 2021 we are committed to becoming a top quartile ESG industrial company in 3 years. And we believe we have achieved or are on the cost of achieving that goal in one year and S&P Global agrees as it selected is to its sustainability yearbook which recognizes the top 15% ESG performing companies in each industry sector. Despite this progress, we're just getting started on our journey and we're very focused on accelerating progress towards our ESG growth. I'm incredibly proud of our team for being recognized by the rating agencies already this early in our journey. 11:10 I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 financial performance. Vik Kini : 11:17 Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q4, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX to overcome persistent inflationary pressures in a challenging supply chain environment. Through Q4 2021 we have realized $215 million in cost synergies and are on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment. Total company orders and revenue increased 24% and 16% year-over-year respectively, driven by strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment, despite comparisons to a strong Q4 2020. 11:58 Our orders and revenue in the quarter were a record for the company, eclipsing Q3 and setting us up well for 2022. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $342 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.1%, a 40 basis point sequential improvement. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $225 million after taking into account the unique items as pointed out on the slide. Total liquidity of $3.2 billion at quarter end was up approximately $400 million from prior year. This takes our net leverage to 1.1 times, a 0.9 time improvement from prior year. 12:40 Turning to Slide 9. For the total company Q4 orders grew 25% and revenue increased 18%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Overall we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.06 for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 7% from the end of Q3 and over 50% from the end of 2020. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. ITS segment margin declined 40 basis points, while PST segment margin declined 400 basis points, driven largely by the impact of M&A. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST margin declined by 120 basis points. 13:26 Finally, corporate costs came in at $26 million for the quarter, down year-over-year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general savings and prudency. We expect corporate cost to normalize back to the low '30s millions per quarter in 2022. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 51% to $0.68 per share. Off note, the adjusted tax rate came in at 5% for the quarter and 12% for full year 2021. Q4 benefited from our ongoing tax restructuring efforts, specifically some non-recurring impacts driven most notably by our efforts to manage and minimize the cash taxes associated with the divestitures of SVT and HPS completed earlier in the year. As we look ahead to 2022 we expect the rate to be back in the low 20s due to the non-repeat of some of these discrete items. 14:19 Turning to Slide 10. On a full year basis, orders grew 28% and revenue increased 16%, both on an FX adjusted basis. The full year book-to-bill was 1.2 and total company adjusted EBITDA was up 28% from 2020. Margin expanded by 160 basis points with ITS margin up by 220 basis points and PST declining 50 basis points. When adjusted to exclude the impact of these acquisitions completed in 2021, PST margins increased by 70 basis points. ITS posted incremental margins of 38% with PST at 27%, or 36% excluding the impact of M&A. 15:03 Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $224 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by strong operational performance across the business, while continuing to invest organically. CapEx during the quarter totaled $23 million and free cash flow included $4 million of synergy and stand up costs related to the IR merger. In addition, free cash flow included a net inflow of $3 million in cash taxes related to the divestitures of the HPS and SVT segments. Excluding these items, adjusted free cash flow was $225 million in the quarter. 15:40 Leverage for the quarter was 1.1 times, which was an 0.9 times improvement versus the prior year. And total company liquidity now stands at $3.2 billion based on approximately $2.1 billion of cash and over $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Liquidity increased by $100 million in the quarter, which included outflows of $165 million towards strategic M&A and $8 million to fund our first quarterly dividend. Our M&A funnel remains robust and active, up in excess of 5 times from the close of the IR merger and we are remaining disciplined in our approach. 16:18 Moving to slide 12. We'd like to provide an update on synergy delivery and some details on the impact of price versus cost. On the left of the page we are updating the cost to achieve the $300 million synergy commitment related to the IR merger, as well as the associated stand-up of the new company from a combined $450 million to now $280 million, an aggregate reduction of roughly 40% or $170 million from our original estimates. This speaks to how we are always heavily focused on high returns on cash investments regardless of the situation. 16:59 I'm very proud of our employee ownership culture continues to overdrive our performance, with everyone thinking like an owner, they think about how every dollar spent generates profit and improvement. In addition to the $215 million in realized synergies to date, we expect an incremental $50 million in 2022 and $35 million in 2023. The synergy funnel remains in excess of $350 million and while we don't expect our synergy commitment to materially change as we look ahead, we will provide periodic updates on status and execution, particularly as we approach the end of the IR merger related synergy delivery. 17:39 The right side of the slide highlights the ongoing price cost dynamic. In 2021 we remain price cost positive each quarter and we expect to deliver the same result in 2022. Note that we are calculating cost including direct material and logistics but not direct labor or labor inflation, as labor is mostly offset with internal productivity actions. In Q4, we delivered an incremental margin of 23% for the total company despite strong inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. What I'm most proud of is that, even in this environment our team was able to achieve a sequential margin improvement of 40 basis points. This highlights the resilience of IRX in very difficult environments. 18:26 Looking forward to 2022, we expect to remain price cost positive each quarter as we continue to leverage IRX to drive commercial execution and productivity initiatives. Given continued inflationary pressures in a very tough comparison from Q1 of 2021, we expect Q1 to be the most challenged period on a year-over-year basis, but nonetheless, expect incremental margins for the total year to be approximately 35% and the quarterly EBITDA profile to be well in line with prior year quarterly phasing. We know this is not easy, but it just speaks of the commitment of our team to be differentiated and be in the top quartile of performance. 19:04 I will now turn the call back to Vicente do discuss our segments. Vicente Reynal : 19:09 Thank you, Vik. And turning to Slide 13, in our Industrial Technologies and Service segment, organic revenue was up 11%. The team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA, which rose 10% year-over-year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.7%, up 20 basis points sequentially with an incremental margin of 23%. As a reminder, we are overcoming a very strong comp from Q4 2020 of 400 basis point margin expansion. However, important to highlight as well that on a 2-year clip the team has delivered 360 basis point margin improvement. Organic orders were up 19%. 19:55 Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20% and a further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products growing at over 15% and oil lubricated products growing at over 25%. The Americas team delivered strong performance with orders in North America up mid-20s, while Latin America was up high '20s. In Mainland Europe, orders were up high teens, while India and the Middle East were down low-single digit. Asia Pacific continues to perform very well with orders of approximately 20% driven by low 20% growth in China and high-teens growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. 20:39 In the vacuum and blower product line, orders were up approximately 20% on a global basis. Moving next to the power tools and lifting, orders for the total business were up approximately 20% and saw continued positive momentum, driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution on new product launches. On our sustainable innovation in action, today we want to highlight our recently acquired company. Jorc is a manufacturer of condensate drains, oil and water separators and air saving products, which are part of the compressor ecosystem. These products focus on improving overall system performance and creating energy efficiency through efficient use and recycling of fluids and air, which helps our customers achieve their environmental goals. We're very excited about these complementary acquisition as we continue to expand our offerings with the compressor ecosystem, as well as the impact that Jorc will have as we scale up and expand geographically. 21:47 Moving to Slide 14. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 15% organically, which remains encouraging given the tough comps due to COVID related orders and revenue in Q4 of 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PS team delivered well adjusted EBITDA of $78 million, which was up 22% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, down 400 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of M&A. Again, the segment was down 120 basis points, excluding the impact of acquisitions in Q4 2021 with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.6% ex-M&A. Overall, organic orders were up 14%, driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which were up strong double digits in the quarter and as they serve lab, life sciences, water and animal health end markets. Incremental margins were 17% as reported and 21% when excluding the impact of M&A. 22:55 Looking at the sustainable innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our recent Tuthill Pumps acquisition. Tuthill Pumps manufacturers gear and piston pumps for sustainable end markets, such as medical and lab, food and beverage, water and wastewater. Tuthill\u2019s D series magnetically coupled pumps are used in lab applications such as hematology analysis, as well as other chemistry analyzers. The business is complementary to our existing portfolio, and we are well underway with integration of this business. 23:29 Moving to Slide 15. We're pleased to introduce our 2022 guidance. In aggregate, we expect total company revenue to be up 11% to 13% with the first half up 12% to 14% and the second half up 9% to 11%. We expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the total company with 7% to 9% growth expected in ITS and 8% to 10% growth in PST. FX is expected to contribute a headwind of approximately 1% with 1% to 2% coming in the first half of 2022 and 0% to 1% in the second half. M&A announced and closed to date is expected to contribute an incremental $225 million in revenue. This outlook reflects normal seasonality in the business, which is typically lightest in Q1, similarly stronger in both Q2 and Q3 on an absolute basis and strongest in the fourth quarter. We do not see quarterly phasing to be materially different from 2021. We expect total adjusted EBITDA for the company to be $1.375 billion to $1.415 billion, including corporate cost of approximately $135 million spread evenly over each quarter. 24:51 This yields an incremental margin of approximately 35% for the total company with positive margin expansion expected to sequentially from Q1 through Q4 of 2022. Free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income is expected to be greater than 100%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to normalize in the low '20s for the reasons Vik mentioned earlier with CapEx representing approximately 2% of revenue. 25:18 Looking at Q1 specifically, we expect double-digit revenue growth year-over-year with ITS growing high single-digits organically and PST growing low double digits. We also expect flat to slightly positive margin expansion due to the tough year-over-year comparison, ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. 25:41 Turning to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding position. 2022 is poised to be a strong year despite the challenging environment. To our employees, I want to again thank you for your relentless efforts to execute and solve tough problems in 2021. We accomplished an incredible amount together and we move into 2022 as an even stronger action oriented team. We continue to invest for growth, both organically and inorganically with a focus on increase in the quality of our total portfolio, while serving as an industry-leading sustainable company. IRX is truly our backbone and drives every process in our company, enabling outperformance and ensuring our global team is speaking one language, focused on capturing growth opportunities driving innovation and efficiencies and acting boldly to win in the marketplace. 26:42 Our balance sheet is very strong and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we have significant ability to redeploy capital to compound earnings and continue our track record of market outperformance. 26:55 With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Operator : 27:01 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mike Halloran : 27:20 Hey, good morning everyone. Vicente Reynal : 27:21 Good morning, Mike. Vik Kini : 27:22 Good morning. Mike Halloran : 27:23 First on roughly 40% reduction in costs associated with the synergies, maybe just what's behind that? It's a pretty sizable reduction here. And so just like the moving pieces there. Vicente Reynal : 27:35 Yeah. I think Mike this kind of speaks to our meticulous approach to always look at that return on investment of the money that we used for every project and as we mentioned on the remarks, I mean it also speaks to the power of these ownership mindset that we have that everyone really cares about how we spend the money. So we've been able to be very efficient and very effective on the use of the cash of these kind of one-time charge for creating the synergies. Mike Halloran : 28:09 The backlog numbers are obviously really robust, maybe talk to a couple of things. One, how you look to the sustainability of the underlying demand? And second, what the guidance assumes as far as backlog phasing, does that backlog kind of normalize as you work through the year or do other challenges, plus the underlying demand kind of start extending when you get some backlog normalization? Vicente Reynal : 28:33 Yeah, Mike. In terms of sustainability, I would say that, what we are seeing is clearly the short cycle continues to be very broad based, very strong and while we eventually will see some tough comps on our ability what we have been able to show is our ability to actually pivot into the end market that might be seeing some good growth and utilizing our products to capture any new trends that might be in the market. I think we're very kind of excited and pleased with how we've been able to do that in the past and we expect to continue to do that. I would say, in addition what we're seeing that what we like in terms of recent trends is that, we're starting to see a lot of the CapEx cycle starting to get release. And it's really for those projects that are really related to the mega-trends that we spoke about in the Investor Day. 29:27 So for example, we're seeing capacity expansion due to re-align in supply chain, but also the quality of life around pharma or new discovery -- drug discovery, we're seeing also CapEx projects related to sustainability where new technology of compressors driving higher level of efficiency. It's kind of widely used by now a lot of the customers looking for reductions in Scope 1 and 2. And I'll tell you that, we're also seeing a lot of customers asking about upgrading their technology to be able to make it more IoT capable products so that they can actually increase and get the total cost of ownership benefit. Mike Halloran : 30:12 Great. We appreciate the time. Vicente Reynal : 30:16 Thanks Mike. Operator : 30:19 Thank you. Our next question today comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Josh, your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : 30:28 Hey, good morning guys. Can you hear me? Vicente Reynal : 30:30 Yeah. Josh, good morning. We don't hear you, Josh. Operator : 30:47 Hi, Josh. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : 30:53 Can you guys hear me. Vicente Reynal : 30:55 We can hear you now. Yeah. Vik Kini : 30:56 We can hear you Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : 30:57 Great. Yeah. Sorry about that. So maybe just a follow-up on my Mike\u2019s question on some of the backlog phasing. Maybe put a different way from an orders perspective, how should we think about book to bill here? I noticed in ITS, you kind of had a small sequential step down in orders, but memory serves, some of those businesses that will be kind of normal seasonally, how do you think about kind of the sustainability if these like 1.05-ish type book to bill numbers as we go through the year? Vik Kini : 31:30 Yeah. Josh, maybe I'll start and let Vicente add in as well. I think in terms of the absolute order patterns we're really pleased with the momentum we've continue to see. If you think back and kind of think about typical seasonality that we typically see in the business. This is a business where book to bill typically is above 1 in the first half of the year and then typically becomes a little bit at or below 1 towards the second half of the year, largely attributable to kind of some of the sell-through of the larger project type businesses, typically which sell through a lot more into the back half of the year. So obviously we have been able to sustain above 1 book to bill in the fourth quarter obviously just speaks to clearly the underlying continued strength in the overall demand environment. I think as we kind of turn the calendar here to 2022, I don't think we would expect to see the seasonality dramatically change, obviously we'd expect to see book to bill continue to be healthy, again, above 1 is the expectation in the front half of the year, but then I think we would expect again as supply chains presumably start to normalize, particularly as we think out to the latter half of the year did probably return back to a typical -- more typical seasonality book to bill being at or slightly below 1 in the back half of the year. Josh Pokrzywinski : 32:42 Got it. That's helpful. And then how should we think about price in the guide, presumably healthy pricing environment, you guys are carrying probably decent amount of that in backlog into the year as well. Vicente Reynal : 32:55 Yeah, that's right, Josh. I mean, the way to think about pricing is that, when you look at the kind of the organic growth, think about it on average for the full year, half of the organic growth coming from price and we think about the phasing, maybe slightly less than the half in the first half of the year and continue to increase as we continue to take actions in the second half. Josh Pokrzywinski : 33:16 Great. Appreciate the detail. That\u2019s all guys. Vicente Reynal : 33:20 Thanks. Operator : 33:23 Our next question today comes from Jeff Sprague of voice Vertical Partners. Please go ahead, Jeff. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : 33:33 Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : 33:34 Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : 33:36 Just maybe coming back to price cost, the incremental guide you're laying out here is quite impressive. It actually would suggest you're nicely price cost positive in 2022. Can you just true us up on that. is that in fact the case and maybe give us some context on the impact of inflation algebra so to speak on your margin rate or speak to it in dollars incentive either way, but just love to get kind of a better understanding of what's embedded in the guide for 2022 on a price cost basis? Vik Kini : 34:15 Yeah. Jeff, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start and again let Vicente add. So just to reiterate what Vicente said. Obviously from our guide perspective, we do expect price to be approximately 50% of the organic growth for each segment. So that's kind of the way you should think about it and a little lower than that in Q1 and then obviously improving as we move through the quarter. It's just based on, quite frankly, some of the continued, let's call it, pricing actions we're taking as we speak, just given the environment. 34:42 In terms of the actual price cost. Yes, you are absolutely right, on a dollar basis just like we saw in 2021, we expect to be price cost positive from a dollar perspective each quarter of 2022. And then just as a reminder, in 2021 again, we were price positive each quarter, obviously, much more so in the first half of the year and then quite -- and then obviously a more tighter spread in Q4 of 2021. I think as we think about 2022, it's probably not too dissimilar in that sense that Q1 will probably be the tightest spread from a price cost perspective, in terms of dollars. And then obviously, we would expect that to get a little bit better as we move through the year, again, based on some of those pricing actions. 35:22 And then specifically with regards to the actual inflation kind of equation or the way to think about inflation. I think the easiest way to say it is that, on supply chain and material inflation we expect kind of the first half to be very consistent. What we saw coming out of the back half of 2021 maybe some slight improvements in second half, but we're not really forecasting and huge improvements in the situation in 2022. It is worth noting, we've started to see some slight tapering in some of the freight rates so it good to be on logistics. But again, the material piece is clearly the biggest piece of the equation. 36:00 And then just to address it, even though it's not necessarily in that price cost equation because we manage the teams to offset labor inflation through productivity. Labor, we would tell you right now we expect to be largely in line with the levels of inflation or merit that we saw in 2021. Jeff Sprague : 36:16 Great, thanks for that color. And Vicente, maybe on M&A comments here again today about the size of the funnel and the like. Obviously, there has been a big dislocation in the market year-to-date and including obviously this whole Russia situation today. Any change in the nature of the dialog? Any impact on multiples that sellers are expecting in this environment or is it really too early to see that, but just wondering on their kind of actionability of the pipeline and the valuation outlook at this point. Vicente Reynal : 36:57 Yeah. No, Jeff, I would say that perhaps maybe it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell, although on a case -- I mean broadly, but on a case-by-case basis we definitely see in some instances that multiples are starting to kind of maybe slightly come down or expectations as some of the kind of companies that were counting on the kind of one-time COVID revenue to continue to happen is not that materializing that aggressively as they were expecting. So we continue to be highly disciplined and I think that's the good news in terms of our funnel is very large, we're very active, we're getting a lot of doors getting opened based on a lot of the work that we have done around employee engagement and the ownership mindset. I can tell you that has been very, very unique proposition for us in the sense of family-owned companies opening door and having that conversation, because they know that we're different and unique. And so the conversations are very active. To your point, I mean I think when the market is in a situation like this that there is maybe some volatility maybe that entices more faster process to get some M&A executed as owners want to have better visibility or kind of get things locked in. And so we're very active on this, Jeff. And I think that's the exciting piece. And as you saw, to your point, the funnel is very strong. Jeff Sprague : 38:26 Great. Thank you. Operator : 38:32 Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : 38:39 Yeah, thanks. Good morning guys. Vicente Reynal : 38:42 Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : 38:43 Good morning. Can we just talk a little bit about the progression of EBITDA margins throughout the year. Like if we're starting the year flattish, the key driver to getting to the full-year EBITDA margin target which would assume, I guess, progressive year-on-year improvement in margins like M&A dilution going away, price cost. Can we just kind of walk through the puts and takes that drive the conviction around that? Vicente Reynal : 39:11 Absolutely, Nicole. Let me take a stab at that. I'll say, first off, in terms of seasonality, we expect both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the total company facing to look very comparable to what we saw in 2021. Although I said, we're not expecting some big hockey stick effect in 2022 from a phasing perspective compared to historical performance or anything of that nature based on our current backlog and actions and forecast for the year. And to give you a bit more color in terms of kind of first half to second half adjusted EBITDA split, maybe easier to your point, I\u2019m going to give you that on a year-over-year basis. And I will say that, first, as you may recall comps are extremely challenging, I'll say, in the first half of 2021 where ITS margin expansion in Q1 of \u201821 was more than 600 basis points and then another 250 basis points in Q2 of \u201921. So a lot of these back then had to do with the proactive pricing measures that we took towards the end of 2020, particularly in the legacy IR compressor products. And these result --this resulted in very strong carryover pricing into the first half of 2021 before any of the inflationary pressures were really evident and very favorable price cost spread. 40:33 As 2021 progress and kind of what Vik mentioned too as well, we continue to maintain being price cost positive, but the spread clearly tighten in the back half of the year due to the inflationary pressures accelerating. And this now leads to a tougher comp in the first half and more reasonable comps in the second half of 2022. And then in addition, some of the things we mentioned about the M&A, when you think about the impact of M&A, the majority of our 2021 actions were completed in PST in the second half of 2021 and as we now start to execute on the synergy plans associated with those deals, in particularly the SEEPEX company, we would expect that the savings start to materialize in more so in the back half of the year. And for those reasons, we expect margins to sequentially improve each quarter of 2022, but being more favorable price cost spread, normal seasonality and synergies from recent M&A should let themselves through a more of our year-over-year margin expansion being in the back half of 2022. Nicole DeBlase : 41:36 Okay, got it. Thanks Vicente. That's really helpful. And then, I guess how did you put your plan together thinking about what's going on from a supply chain perspective. Is the expectation baked into the plan that we see no improvement in supply chain? Or have you guys kind of feathered in easing of the constraints as we progressed through the year? Vicente Reynal : 41:55Yeah. Great question Nicole. It is very, very slight improvement. I mean we're telling our teams plan for the worse and take action based on what we have visibility of it now and don't plan for it to come back very positively and strong in the second half. So our teams are executing plans that being a very kind of stable environment at these kind of levels. And if we see a benefit that inflationary markets abates pretty rapidly, then that's an improvement in our total good margin expansion. Nicole DeBlase : 42:28 Thank you. I'll pass it on. Vicente Reynal : 42:32Thank you. Operator : 42:35 The next question in the queue comes from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : 42:43 Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for the comments on price cost. One other one, just -- I don't know how much kind of volatility you're seeing underneath the cost side of price cost and supply chain. I'm sure, everybody is working incredibly hard on it. How far out can you sort of see stability, whether it's 1Q, 2Q? And then just maybe you could refresh us on how much pricing or how quick pricing flexibility can come if cost do pop up to the upside? Just how do you manage that to the potential volatility? Thanks. Vicente Reynal : 43:12 Yeah. Sure Rob. There is definitely volatility. And to your point, I mean, it's kind of what I say, it's definitely a lot of hard work by the teams are doing to really control what we can control. And so, that is the focus of our kind of culture is that, put high level of emphasis on controlling what we can control and control your destiny, and that basically means supply chain. In terms of the cost, yeah, I mean it's a bit of a kind of [indiscernible] in the sense that sometimes if you supply and logistics, then you see steel. Steel is not coming back, coming down, you see ferrous materials going up, you see non-ferrous material going down, so we got a team that is basically looking at a lot of indicators, and then taking actions as proactively as possible with our supply base, very, very quickly and very early on. 43:59 So to your questions, yes, I think I\u2019ll still see a lot of volatility on account of commodity to commodity that kind of lends to a total average to be still that flattish stable as to what we saw in the second half of the year. Vik Kini : 44:15 And then, Rob, on your -- the second part of your question around pricing and then kind of the flexibility. Yeah, I mean I think the team has done a fantastic job on that end. I mean, we've talked about it a number of times in the context of a lot of the process improvements, the distinct pricing team that we have in place to really be agile utilizing a lot of the IRX toolkit to be able to : one, connect with our supply chain and operations team to understand the impact of inflation as Vicente said, almost weekly, monthly basis as necessary and then recalibrate pricing. Obviously in the context of 2021, we indicated that we took multiple pricing actions across pretty much every part of our business and so the ability to be able to react in a pretty quick timeframe we've shown it and obviously we're able to react in a comparable manner here in 2022. Rob Wertheimer : 45:01 thank you. Operator : 45:07 The next question today comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Nigel Coe : 45:14 Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Hi guys, I just want to go back to kind of the margin cadence points. So LIFO charges are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. So I think that mean the inflation kind of bucket steps up from 4Q to 1Q, implies that price also steps up materially from 4Q to 1Q. Just wanted to confirm that you do have a bit more price coming in Q1 versus Q4? And then the comments around 1Q margin is flat for the corporation. It looks like PST is going to be down again materially on the M&A dilution, so it implies that IT is going to be up \u2013 ITS is going to be up year over year. Just maybe just confirm that, how we think about it? Vik Kini : 46:07 Sure. So yes, Nigel, I'll take those in pieces here. I think with regards to the price cost kind of dynamic in the pricing. I think you can probably expect that pricing is at least comparable to what you saw in Q4 and as we indicated here, clearly we are still looking at and recalibrating and taking pricing actions frankly as appropriate, just given the, let's call it, the kind of ever evolving environment that Vicente has spoke to. 46:34 In terms of the segment margin spread, you are correct. Obviously, Q1 for PST will still show -- will show margin decline year-over-year, largely attributable to the M&A dynamic. On the ITS side, we would expect to be, I would say, ITS is probably more so in line with the total overall environment, so flattish to slightly up, and then obviously you can also kind of look at some of the corporate has being kind of the rest of that noise to kind of get to that flattish to slightly up kind of expectation that we indicated for Q1 and 2022. Nigel Coe : 47:15 Okay, great, thanks. And my follow-up is really just going to compressor order trends. North America stands out, once again it is pretty strong and it sounds like we might be seeing some elements of some supply chain benefits environmental upgrades and you mentioned IoT. So I'm just wondering if you could maybe flush out from that end market commentary? And perhaps on the IoT is that a retrofit to existing equipments or does that require a bit more of a meaningful replacement cycle. Vicente Reynal : 47:48 Yeah. Nigel, In terms of the Americas, I mean we were very pleased to see how the team performed, not only in the US, but also even Latin America as well, really good performance there. From an end market perspective, I will say that, fairly broad base. I mean general industrial being strong, but also anything that has to do with oil-free products, such as food, pharma, semiconductor industry. So a lot of good momentum on our oil-free product line here in the US. And in terms of the IIoT, you're absolutely right. Yes, we can retrofit the compressors and the approach that we have in the field. That is definitely something that we're doing in order to kind of generate more of that recurring revenue stream that we spoke about during the Investor Day, but also in many instances the customers when they look at the IIoT, we have our teams very well trained to talk about that. If they're going to retrofit, they might as well should look into the total new compressor, for example, so that they can actually maximize the energy savings that they can achieve and not just retrofit and all technology. So I think it's an opening the door conversation topic that leads into a higher ASP selling point. Nigel Coe : 49:08 Great. Thank you very much. Operator : 49:14 The next question comes from David Raso of Evercore. Please go ahead. David Raso : 49:19 Hi, thank you for the time. I was just curious, Vicente, can you give us from your years of experience thoughts around what we're seeing with Russia-Ukraine and so with NAT gas prices. Obviously very strong, oil price is strong. Just trying to balance -- now, obviously some of these could be even positive demand drivers when it comes to where commodities are, but are there may be European factories filling the squeeze of high gas prices that may be cool their thoughts on CapEx. So I know it's early, but just given the dynamics of the day here, I'm just curious how do you think about the impact of a situation like that, especially that last a while. Vicente Reynal : 50:00 Sure. A very interesting question. I mean, I\u2019ll tell you that -- I'll say, first of all, our thoughts and prayers go to the people of Ukraine and based on Europe, I mean obviously dark days indeed. I can tell you that from our side, our revenue in the Ukraine and Russia, I'll say is fairly immaterial and nominal. In terms of kind of the overall impact. Yes, I mean, I expect that gas prices will continue to rise based on what you were seeing in Europe, they are already very high. I will say that what we have seen in ourselves, in our internal factories and potentially these kind of correlates to others as well and we're seeing it, is that, in many cases our teams are accelerating the projects to reduce the cost of energy. So cost energy efficiency and when you think about compressors that are roughly 30% of the energy consumed in a factory it is a very high speaking point. So then as people think that these high energy prices are going to be here for the long, it really accelerate that conversation of that new compressor to reduce the energy. And in our factories we're doing it, we're upgrading our compressors we're putting -- we're putting solar energy into our factories as well and that is increasing the level of conversations to our customer base. 51:27 So I think that megatrend and sustainability and how our products can really help our customer is a very high point of conversation. David Raso : 51:39 Thank you for that. And quickly, when I think about the \u201822 guide and the margins between the segments, if you had to think of an area where, let's say, early in the year you hopefully maybe leaving a little in your back pocket for maybe margins could surprise to the upside or it's simply cushion if price cost goes the wrong direction, but at least thinking on a glass half full view, if you were to say where there is more margin potential to surprise to the upside, would it be more in ITS just given strong volumes and particularly nice margin backlog that's priced well or is it more maybe PST and hoping some of the acquisitions you've made that have been diluting the margin, you can drive those margins now that they're under your control. Vicente Reynal : 52:27 I'll say, David, that it will be -- it will definitely be on the ITS. I mean -- and you even saw it, when you think about it Q3 to Q4 our sequential margin actually improved even in an inflationary market that continues to rise. So I would say that if anything will be continue to see very strong momentum on the ITS. David Raso : 52:47 Okay. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Vicente Reynal : 52:50 Thank you. David Raso : 52:55 Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : 53:02 Thanks. Good morning everybody. Vicente Reynal : 53:05 Hi, Joe. Vik Kini : 53:06 Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie : 53:07 So I guess maybe my first question. As the quarter progressed, I'm just curious like did things get worse at all Mike like absenteeism, labor, supply chain perspective and maybe even in the early part of 2022. And I'm also curious, obviously, the backlog is very good. I'm curious, were there any revenue deferrals into 2022? Vicente Reynal : 53:33 Yeah, I think there is a progression Joe. Q4 in terms of absenteeism, not so much that we can call out that really spiked. I mean clearly absenteeism spiked in the early part of 2022 kind of January, but we're back to normal levels now. So I'd say, from a quarterly progression in the fourth quarter absenteeism normal, in terms of inflationary, fairly normal to kind of continuing to rise. That's why we continue to put our emphasis on more incremental price increases that we have continued to do. And -- but as we look here in the first quarter, we see the better stability here now that we have passed that spike of the Omicron. Vik Kini : 54:25 Yeah. And John, the second part of your question in terms of any revenue deferrals anything of that nature. What I point to anything in terms of like true deferrals or things of that nature from a customer base perspective asking for things [indiscernible] nothing of any consequence there, obviously probably fair to say that, just given some of the supply chain constraints, and we would fully acknowledge obviously backlog being at level they are and even some past due backlog that obviously are intent is to get out the door here in Q1. Clearly, there were a low single digit points from an organic growth perspective. But you could argue, could have been a little bit better. But again, given the supply chain environment and the constraints quite frankly fully expected and I think the teams did a fantastic job all in, quite frankly still hitting what we say our commitments in the context of topline from a Q4 perspective. Joe Ritchie : 55:13 Great. Now that's great to hear. And then I guess my follow-on question is going back to the margin particularly in PST and I wanted to focus on -- holding on feedback for a second. So I think we have those margins are coming in like the low '20s. I'm just curious like as you kind of see the progression and the synergies in that business, maybe just kind of talk us through the cadence or what gets that business back to more kind of like PST level type margins over the next 12 to 18 months? Vicente Reynal : 55:45 Yeah. Absolutely. So Joe, I think the way you're thinking about it is spot on, let me just calibrate everyone, the SEEPEX business roughly $200 million revenue base business that we indicated that when we purchased it, which was in the latter half of Q3 of 2021, more in the mid-teens EBITDA margin realm, but gross margin profile is extremely strong in all place, if not better than the overall PST margin -- our segment profile margin from a gross margin perspective. So you're absolutely right, obviously there is synergy plans in place. I will tell you a lot of those actions are actually kind of going into motion as we speak. And so I think the way that you have thought about it in the context of where we expect the margin profile to be here from a 2022 perspective, eclipsing the 20% margin -- EBITDA margin mark, it is completely fair. I think obviously then as we continue to integrate we've always said within a 3-year time frame we expect that to kind of be closer to the PST segment margin profile. We're not even 1 year at this point in time. So obviously we still have a little bit of a road ahead of us. But quite frankly, getting from mid-teens to over 20% here within the first year is obviously quite encouraging. And then the other piece here is now as we start to also integrate from a commercial perspective. The technology is very complementary to the broader PST segment. So again, we expect to see some good revenue growth in synergy profile coming from that. 57:06 So again, everything continues to be well on pace, you are correct. Obviously, our expectation is that the margin progression there does get better as 2022 progresses, just quite frankly given that we're taking some of those synergy actions as we speak right now. Joe Ritchie : 57:21 Great to hear. Thanks guys. Vicente Reynal : 57:24 Thanks Joe. Operator : 57:27 Our next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Please go ahead. Nathan Jones : 57:33 Good morning, everyone. I want to start off with -- good morning. Vicente, you talked about larger capital projects starting to come back into the market, which I think is encouraging as we start to see some mid to later cycle capital come back into the market. Can you give us a little more color on where you're seeing those projects, what kind of end markets, what kind of geographies you're starting to see those projects? And what you think the outlook for growth in those is over the next 2 or 3 years? Vicente Reynal : 58:06 Yeah. In terms of where, Nathan, we're seeing good momentum in what we call in Asia Pacific and in the Middle East. And from an end market perspective, we're seeing water and wastewater as being one that is highly active. Where the project in India or projects in China or even in the Southeast Asia we're seeing a lot of good momentum on water and wastewater. And I think the good news here, I had some meetings with some large actually EPC company and C-suite to C-suite conversation. I mean there is definitely a lot of very strong momentum and what we -- what I like that I heard is that, a lot of these kind of hydrogen conversion is here pretty soon to come maybe. And as you saw on our Investor Day we spoke a lot about excitement on kind of how our products can play in that role. 59:03 So that does a one piece that we haven't seen anything come yet from our kind of large CapEx, except in our fuel expense business that we continue to see good momentum. But from a compressor perspective as it is aligned to hydrogen and the energy conversion, that's yet to come. Nathan Jones : 59:21 And I wanted to follow up on your response to Dave's question on the energy efficiency of compresses. I think it's an important point that pumps and compressors in some of these manufacturing facility, the power usage, electricity usage of these things contributes pretty significantly to the operating costs of those facilities. Can you talk about what kind of the payback period it is on a compressive that reduces the energy usage by 30%? And any metrics you have around what that contributes? What kind of the energy consumption contributes to the operating costs at one of these facilities. Just to give people an idea of what the potential savings for customers are here? Vicente Reynal : 60:09 Yeah, absolutely, Nathan. Based on the energy cost where it is now, some payback projects or even a year or less in some cases. So I think it depends on the country where if you -- for example Germany, where energy costs are very high or even China too as well. The payback is actually fairly quickly or fairly quick. And to your point, when you look at the compressor, a compressor consumes approximately on average 30% of that energy that gets consumed in the 12 factory. And again, it depends on the type of factory, but clearly one of those were \u2013 I\u2019m very excited about that opportunity, but it's not only a compressors it is also a blower. I mean, when you look at the blowers in the wastewater facility, a blower consumes 60% of the energy. And so we're talking to upwards of 50% reduction from that 60% or that 30%. And to your point in terms of absolute dollar savings, it ranges based on the size of the company, but we can tell you that -- we have -- we received a phone call from a very large beverage company that installed some of our compressors and basically they called us, they told us they received a call from the utility company, because there were energy being reduced by more than 50%. So again they were surprised that thinking that energy utility company surprised that potentially they were shutting down the factory and indeed, what it was happening is that the new compressors were consuming 50% of energy, therefore savings couple of hundred thousand dollars of energy cost per year. Nathan Jones : 61:59 Great. Thanks for all the color. Thanks for taking my questions. Vicente Reynal : 62:05 Thank you, Nathan. Operator : 62:07 The next question comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : 62:14 Hi guys. Most has been answered, but just Vincente, I'm curious, the playbook that you have for kind of these global dislocations like what we're seeing in Russia now, obviously your stock has been caught in the downdraft here. And given your balance sheet, do you focus more on sort of opportunistic repurchases in this type of environment? Or do you kind of circle the wagons a little bit and protect the balance sheet. Vicente Reynal : 62:42 I\u2019d say -- Jeff, good question. I mean, we don't want to kind of dramatically change our strategy. And to be honest, in these kind of dislocation of the market, this is a good opportunity to also be more aggressive on M&A. Some of the price points kind of get to the level that are actually more -- even more appealing to the way it was before. So we see that in this type of dislocation. Yeah, I mean, good opportunity to be aggressive on the M&A, which continues to be our number 1 capital allocation priority, but obviously very prudently. But as you saw, we definitely have very good use of cash, you saw that we approve that $750 million share repurchase from the Board and then we definitely plan to utilize that. Stephen Volkmann : 63:32 Great, thank you. Operator : 63:35 And our final question today comes from Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: 63:46 Hi, good morning. I wanted -- Hi. When you think about kind of 2022 and digitalization targets can you give us any insight in terms of kind of what you're looking at in terms of kind of what would be successful for you in the progress toward the 5-year framework you gave? And whether that's penetration of field units or whether that's kind of percentage of IoT ready products, but what you're thinking about in terms of 2022 targets? Vicente Reynal : 64:17 In our goals and objectives that we deploy to our team there is actually a very specific goal to digitization and it relates in this case to the revenue that we can generate, so with the digital assets that we're connecting. And in our case, it is very specifically tied to service and how that recurring service revenue, in this case, particularly compressors should accelerate as we continue to digitize and connect our compressors. At a lower level we also have clearly that leading indicators of metrics, such as the revenue that we're shipping with digitally enabled products across the entire company. And we think that that is a great indicator for us to say how much of our assets are being shipped that already enable that then later we moved into our future revenue streams. 65:11 And one thing I could tell too as well, Joe, I mean the excitement of some of these M&A that we're doing is that, as we kind of go deeper into companies like SEEPEX. SEEPEX is doing a phenomenal job on IoT, I mean phenomenal. And one that even on comparable to some of the kind of IoT standalone companies, again, we're very excited that that was an acquisition that we've got a great technology, while we also got a great team that is highly comparable to these kind of IoT standalone software companies and then here is the great benefit that we were able to find and unlock. Not only a great progressive cavity pump but also a team that we're going to leverage to the better benefit of the entire company, not just the SEEPEX business. So a lot of good momentum and good excitement around this topic. Joe O'Dea: 66:05 Great. Thank you. Operator : 66:09 We have no further questions in the queue, so I'll hand back to the management team for closing remarks. Vicente Reynal : 66:17 Thank you. As we close, we clearly are in some pretty volatile times as someone said on the Q&A. But as you can see from our performance, we and actually particularly on Slide 6, even in these very difficult environment we were able to perform and outperform too, maybe because we have a team that has these ownership mindset, the life to control their destiny and really execute to what we can control, and also make life better for our employees, customersm the planet and also important to shareholder, which in this case, our employees are shareholders of the company. So with that, I just want to say, again, a big thank you to our employees, a big thank you to all the support that all of you are giving us. 2021 was a great year and we're here ready to take on any challenges that come into 2022. So thank you again. Operator *: 67:05 This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You can now disconnect your line.",

[Operator Instructions]. I'll now pass over to your host, Chris Miorin to begin. Please go ahead. Chris Miorin : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2022 First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer.  We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today.  Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details.  In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a strategy update, review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to 2022 guidance. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Starting on Slide 3, Ingersoll Rand's unwavering commitment to our purpose of making life better is evident in the sustainability of our products, which help our customers reduce their energy consumption and water usage. We delivered another strong quarter in the first quarter with our teams leveraging the IRX process to outperform even with ongoing challenges in supply chain, accelerating inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. The performance in Q1 is attributed to our highly engaged employee base who think and act like owners because they are. Our latest engagement scores highlight this dynamic where we now rank in the upper part of the top quartile scoring over 500 basis points above the manufacturing benchmark.  And for the most critical question of how happy are you working at Ingersoll Rand, we rank in the top 10% of all manufacturing organizations. Not only are we focused internally but also on the needs of those outside our organization. Last quarter, we made a $1 million commitment to support Ukranian impacted by the work with humanitarian aid. Demand for our products and services remain strong with our backlog at an all-time high and our leading indicators showing resiliency in our markets. We remain attuned to the dynamic environment around us and are hyper-focused on executing on what we can control.  Moving to Slide 4. We've spoken before about how operating sustainably is embedded in our company and is intentionally at the center of our core values as it underpins our very existence. Ingersoll Rand makes life better for customers by making them more sustainable. We'd like to take time today to highlight that even in an uncertain environment, customers have significant opportunities to reduce their emissions and materially reduce their energy cost and water usage. And this is how we think about our sustainability strategy, growing sustainably by providing mission-critical solutions to customers that reduce energy and water usage and operating sustainably in the processes we employ to deliver those solutions.  We spoke at our recent Investor Day in November about the sustainability mega trend. And despite the uncertainty in today's market, we strongly believe that this trend will drive customer decision-making to invest on more efficient flow creation devices like air compressors, blowers and pumps, which has been an underinvested area over the past decade or so. Turning to Slide 5. Our customers are increasingly realizing that air compressors and air treatment optimization is an essential opportunity to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Air compressors consume up to 30% of the manufacturing sites electricity. And with the recent significant rise in energy costs, this will continue to increase. Ingersoll Rand's products provide industry-leading efficiency that enables customers to reduce the energy cost from our compressors up to 50%, and air treatment solutions or dryers up to an incredible 90%. As we have forecasted out our potential impact of our Scope 3 emissions, we have established a goal of helping our customers achieve a combined 15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of our products, which equates to more than 40 million megatons of CO2. Our customers are becoming more educated about the impact that compressor optimization can have on their mission.  We have shown 2 examples in this slide of global leaders in both the consumer electronics and paper industries, who clearly identified compressor optimization as a top priority for greenhouse gas emission reduction in their latest sustainability reports. In addition to energy usage, our customers are also faced with water shortage and a need to improve water management and quality. And you can see at the bottom of the page, we're a global paper company and a world leader in consumer packaged goods have committed to reducing water usage by 25% and 20% per unit, respectively, a significant commitment. And one we're very well positioned to solve with our products.  Approximately 30% of our total revenue base is generated from products focused on improving water management, purification and reducing water consumption, and we're committed to helping customers save over 1 billion gallons of water annually through the use of our products.  Turning to Slide 6. Not only our largest customer is making buying decisions based upon opportunities to improve energy efficiency, but we believe that almost all of our customers take energy efficiency into account. Additionally, governments are now regulating energy conservation standards for compressors, and we anticipate these trends will continue to accelerate, and we intend to remain at the forefront of these requirements. Last year, just in the U.S., we conducted over 4,000 compressor system audits, which is an increase of 60% from 2019. After the audits, we made upgrade recommendations based upon evaluations of energy efficiency and several other factors, and this led to $100 million in sales directly attributable to these audits. And this is a great example on how we connect and educate our customer base on total cost of ownership and energy efficiency. We estimate that 2/3 of our current global installed base could realize meaningful improvements in efficiency by upgrading their compressor system.  And with the midpoint of 15% energy efficiency uplift across that portion of the install base, a customer with a typical compressor system will realize on average a payback of less than 2 years at current energy prices. So you can see the savings here are real and meaningful and we're highly engaged in educating our entire customer base about this opportunity.  Moving to Slide 7. In addition to helping our customers progress on their sustainability journey, we're leveraging IRX to achieve our goal of being recognized as a top quartile ESG company by operating sustainably. Those efforts have delivered significant progress. And within the past 6 months, we've been materially upgraded by all of our targeted ESG rating agencies, including MSCI, Sustainalytics, S&P Global and CDP. And in fact, Sustainalytics and S&P Global now rank us in the top 15% of companies in our sector, exceeding our goal of becoming top quartile in half the time we had committed to it. But we're not finished with the journey. We're just getting started. We take our role as a sustainability leader very seriously, and we're committed to continuous improvement and progress towards achieving our other sustainability goals.  I would now turn the call over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance. Vikram Kini : Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q1, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX to overcome persistent inflationary pressures, a challenging supply chain environment, increased geopolitical uncertainty and lockdowns in Shanghai. Despite these challenges, we continue to remain on track to deliver on our $300 million synergy commitment with $50 million expected to be realized in 2022.  Total company orders and revenue increased 25% and 18% year-over-year, respectively, with strong double-digit orders growth in ITS and double-digit organic revenue growth across both segments. Our orders in the quarter were a record for the company and revenue was a first quarter record, setting us up for continued strength in 2022. The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $304 million, a 24% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.7%, a 110 basis point improvement from prior year. Incremental margins for the company were 29% despite the aforementioned challenges. Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million and remained positive despite working capital headwinds in most notably an increase of approximately $100 million in inventory to support the growing backlog and elevated incentive compensation costs coming off of a strong 2021 performance.  Total liquidity was $3.1 billion at quarter end and cash was up approximately $400 million from prior year. This takes our net leverage to 1.2x, an 0.7x improvement from prior year and a slight increase of 0.1x from prior quarter. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q1 orders grew 21% and revenue increased 14%, both on an organic basis. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.22x for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 70% from Q1 of 2021.  Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 24% from the prior year. ITS segment margin improved 70 basis points while our PST segment margin declined 260 basis points with the largest driver of the decrease coming from M&A. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in the 12 months ending March 31, PST margin declined by 130 basis points, driven mainly by the impact of inflation, FX and product mix. It's important to note that both segments did remain price cost positive in terms of dollars in the first quarter, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds.  Finally, corporate costs came in at $29 million for the quarter, down year-over-year primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general cost savings while continuing to invest in critical growth areas like demand generation, and industrial Internet of Things. We expect corporate costs to normalize back to the low 30s in terms of millions of dollars per quarter for the remainder of the year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 26% to $0.49 per share, and the tax rate for the quarter was 23%. We anticipate the full year being in the low 20s as well.  Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million on a continuing ops basis, remaining positive despite the aforementioned increases in net working capital. CapEx through the quarter totaled $18 million, which is an approximately 25% increase compared to last year, further demonstrating our continued investment in the business. Free cash flow included $8 million of synergy and standup costs related to the IR merger. Leverage for the quarter was 1.2x, which was an 0.7x improvement versus the prior year. And total company liquidity now stands at $3.1 billion based on approximately $2 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Liquidity decreased by approximately $100 million in the quarter, which included outflows of $30 million towards strategic M&A, $101 million in share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment.  Our M&A funnel remains robust and active with 6 bolt-on acquisitions currently under exclusive letters of intent. We remain prudent and disciplined to generate strong returns on transactions with highly strategic and synergistic characteristics. But clearly, we have significant firepower to deploy to M&A, which is a strong driver of our compounding growth model.  I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Vik. And turning to Slide 11. Our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong organic revenue growth of 14%, including approximately 6% in price and 8% volume growth. Both of those year-over-year while also demonstrating solid sequential acceleration on both price and volume.  Adjusted EBITDA rose 17% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.8%, up 70 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 29%. Organic orders were up 25% with a strong book-to-bill of 1.24x.  Starting now with compressors, we saw orders up approximately 30%. A further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products growing over 30%, and oil-lubricated products increased approximately 30%. The Americas team delivered strong performance with orders in North America up approximately low 30%, while Latin America was up in the low 40s.  In Mainland Europe, orders were up solidly in the with no material deceleration of note sequentially during the quarter, while India and Middle East were up in the mid-40s.  Asia Pacific continued to perform well with orders up mid-20 driven by mid-20s growth in China and high teens growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In Vacuum and blowers, orders were up low 20s on a global basis. In the power tools and lifting business, orders for the total business were up high teens and saw continued positive momentum. As we discussed during the Investor Day, our demand generation capabilities provide us with the most forward-looking indicators of customer demand through the data-driven approach to developing marketing qualified leads or MQLs, and we gained an additional several months of insight by leveraging this data.  And we're aware of the uncertainty related to the global economy, but as we review MQLs across our business and across geographies each week, these indicators show double-digit growth year-over-year across all major geographies, including America, Mainland Europe, the Middle East, India and Asia Pacific. China has clearly been impacted due to the Shanghai lockdown, but even in the most recent weeks, MQLs are very near last year's level.  As I mentioned earlier, we're very focused in our approach to delivering sustainable innovative solutions. As such, I want to spend time a minute highlighting our LeROI gas compression business, which we acquired in mid-2017. Since then, we have been very focused on repositioning the portfolio of LeROI to further penetrate biogas market, which has seen strong growth as customers are able to capture gas emitted from sources such as landfills and cattle farms and monetize it as an energy source.  And as you can see on the page, the growth we have realized from these efforts has been phenomenal and continues to rapidly accelerate. Orders were over $100 million in the past 12 months. And revenue is expected to be more than double in 2022, bringing total organic growth of over 5 years to over 440%, and creating a post synergy multiple of the acquisition to around 1x. We greatly exceeded our mid-teens return on capital target and expect to achieve approximately 70% ROIC by this year. LeROI is just a fantastic example of a highly strategic and synergistic company whose value has been unleashed in the transition from a family-owned business to ownership of Ingersoll Rand.  A few weeks ago, I get a chance to visit the LeROI team in Sidney, Ohio. And the transformation the team is making is very impressive. You can feel the energy, passion and engagement of employees as you enter the manufacturing floor. We heard a lot of feedback around how the ownership mentality we have and the equity we granted has positively impacted not only the performance we show here, but more important, the lives of many of our employees in a very positive way.  Moving to Slide 12. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 12% organic with approximately 5% price and 10% volume growth. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $85 million, which was up 27% year-over-year with incremental margins of 22%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.6%, down 260 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of M&A. And again, the segment was down 130 basis points, excluding the impact of acquisitions, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.9% ex M&A.  Overall, organic orders were up 6%, which is on top of 13% year-over-year organic growth in Q1 of 2021. In addition, we continue to be excited about our funnel for the hydrogen fuel business, which now stands in excess of $100 million. The integration of Seepex, which we acquired in September of '21 continues to progress very well, with strong growth in new geographies and an acceleration of margin expansion into the low 20s from the mid-teens level inherited at the transaction closed just a couple of quarters ago.  I also had a chance to listen the Seepex team in the U.S. And once again, our unique approach to ownership brand is playing a very crucial role in accelerating engagement and performance. I left very excited about the future potential of Seepex as part of Ingersoll Rand.  A further example of our focus on sustainable innovative solutions is the Thomas pump brand. A compression technology, primarily targeting the life and science market with a $2.5 billion addressable market. Thomas pumps, they serve the patient care end market, both in facility through applications like ventilators and also at home through oxygen concentrators. Adjacent today is an in-vitro diagnostic end market. And we have leveraged our highly translatable technology to grow 40% within this market with a very strong focus on OEMs and with significant runway ahead.  We have recently secured several sizable orders from large pharma customers in the in-vitro space who designed our Thomas pump into their new products, which will generate strong recurring revenue over the customers' product life cycle.  Moving to Slide 13. After a strong start to the year, we're raising 2022 guidance. We're raising organic revenue growth 100 basis points from 8% to 10% driven by a 100 basis point increase in organic growth expectations from both the ITS and PST segments as compared to the original guidance. FX is expected to now contribute a headwind of approximately 2% versus 1% on the prior guidance. And this leads to a total company revenue up 11% to 13%.  We're also increasing the adjusted EBITDA range to $1.385 billion to $1.425 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater than or equal to 100%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20s and CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue.  Lastly, we want to provide some color on Mainland Europe and lockdowns in Shanghai. During the quarter and into April, we have not seen any material slowdown in orders. In fact, we monitor our marketing qualified leads or MQLs as we said, fairly close and as they are really a leading indicator for order activity, and MQLs in Europe have been quite stable throughout 2022.  As for the lockdown is Shanghai, we're starting to see the ease of the lockdowns trending positively. We remain encouraged. But as you know, this is a fluid situation that we continue to monitor closely. And although we don't provide quarterly guidance, the best way to think about it is we are not making significant changes to the first half and second half phasing as compared to our original item as we're taking a prudent view in the second quarter due to the lockdowns in Shanghai.  Having said this, we still see continued Q1 to Q2 sequential growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, both expected to be modest.  Turning to Slide 14. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a very strong position. We delivered record performance in the first quarter, and our backlog provides momentum into the second quarter. 2022 is poised to be a strong year despite known challenges and dynamic market conditions. We will continue to remain agile and leverage IRX across every facet of our business to deliver on our commitments.  To our employees, I want to say thank you for your continued engagement and making thoughtful, action-oriented decisions like the owners that you are. This engagement continues to drive the accomplishment of our mission to make life better for our customers, the environment and the shareholders. Our balance sheet is very strong and with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the ability to deploy capital to investments with the highest return on capital as we continue our track record of market outperformance.  So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird. Michael Halloran : Just some thoughts on backlog and what kind of visibility that gives you. So obviously, orders really strong, particularly in ITS. How is that expected to be cadenced out? What's going on with the backlog levels? And what kind of visibility does that give you on a forward basis as we sit here? Vicente Reynal : Mike, so clearly it gives us, I mean, obviously, much greater visibility than what we have been in prior years. ITS, as you know, has a portion of being loan cycle. And the way we may want to think about it is that kind of 20% to -- maybe 20% to 25% of that backlog being kind of more on the longer cycle perspective, which kind of gives us a good view into potentially 2023. So I think it's -- we're having great visibility here, obviously, for the next couple of quarters and even greater visibility than what we have seen in the past as we go into 2023. Michael Halloran : So as part of the conservatism then less about what you're actually seeing from a demand perspective because you have that visibility in the backlog and it's just more uncertainty about when that backlog actually converts at this point in time? Or is there something else to the conservatism that you laid out in the guidance? Vicente Reynal : That's it, Mike. It's prudency, clearly, as we kind of navigate the ramp after the lockdowns in China and any continued geopolitical environment that might be happening out there that may cloud a bit of a shorter-term visibility. But I mean, I think it's -- you see it in the orders and the remarks that we made, momentum continues. Our marketing qualified leads continue to be pretty strong and resilient. And I think at this point in time, it's just more prudency based on what we're seeing. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe I just wanted to start with a question on the margin outlook. So you had 29% incrementals in Q1 and you're saying sort of mid-30s for the year. When we're thinking about the second quarter, should we assume that incremental margin year-on-year is maybe a little bit lower than Q1? That seems to you what you're saying, but just wanted to confirm that. And then maybe in that light, sort of talk about price cost margin impacts, what was it in the first quarter and what you expect for the year? Vikram Kini : Yes. Julian, I think the way you're thinking about it is quite accurate. So maybe I'll start with the price cost. So price cost from a dollar perspective was positive in the first quarter. I'd say on a margin perspective, not necessarily margin accretive, but we did cover inflation from a price perspective. We would expect the dynamic in Q2 to frankly be fairly comparable. Obviously, given a lot of the geopolitical situation as well as some of the outcomes of the Russian-Ukraine situation, clearly, that's driving some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing incrementally into Q2.  Worth noting here, though, that obviously, we've continued to recalibrate from a pricing perspective, and we would expect price cost to be more favorable and more positive and margin accretive more into the back half of the year. So that's kind of the way to think about it. But -- and your thought in terms of the incrementals being a little bit more subdued in Q2 due to that nature as well as the Shanghai lockdowns, that's correct as well in Q2. That will drive a slightly more subdued incrementals in Q2 specifically. Julian Mitchell : And then just my quick follow-up would be around the orders expectations. So you had better orders than I expected in the first quarter given your comp. Sounds like orders are staying good into Q2. Just wanted to make sure that's correct. And then within PST specifically, the orders are up I think mid-single digit in the first quarter. How are you thinking about those looking out the next few months? Vicente Reynal : So yes, I mean I think orders continue to be actually fairly good. Clearly, as we go more into Q2, Q3, tougher comps, obviously. As you remember, last year, we were seeing that 30% and 40% orders momentum, but we still see very good momentum as we are moving here into the month of April.  And from a PST perspective, I think the way I think about it is, again, they're comping against that double-digit orders from Q1 of 2021. But if I look at it from a sequential perspective, actually on an absolute dollar, sequentially Q4 to Q1, we saw about a 10% increase in order momentum on the PST. So again, speaks pretty well as to no concerns on what the team is seeing and the ramp continues in terms of the order momentum, which obviously will lead to a better outcome here. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : My question, you made pretty clear comments on Europe, and I just wanted to circle back there because it still seems like there's opposing potentialities where you could have a recession and the demand drop. And at the same time, Europe desperately needs energy efficiency, energy savings and solutions to the growing energy crisis. And so more qualitatively on your MQLs, can you just talk about time line? Is the issue, the energy spike, already started to impact plans for upgrades? Are people coming to you for that reason? Can you see it in your pipeline? Vicente Reynal : I think, Rob, what -- I think our teams will tell you that they're seeing an increase in requests from customers as it relates to how -- what else can they do from an energy efficiency perspective. I think a data point to think about it, we talked about the audits that we do in factories. And how -- when you think about it in the U.S., it's up 60%, the number of audits that we're doing, energy efficiency audits as compared to pre-pandemic levels back in 2019. We didn't come in Europe, but in Europe, we also do a lot of audits. And the audits are kind of similar in nature in terms of seeing good momentum in terms of growth. So customers are definitely more attuned to it. We leveraged our demand generation engine to continue to educate the customers on what they can achieve. And so we're taking that advantage and continue to create a bit of a tailwind here for us. Robert Wertheimer : Perfect. And then can you give any comments on -- maybe it varies a lot, but on the general time line and what your factory upgrade might be investigated, decided upon and delivered? I'll stop there. Vicente Reynal : Sure, yes. On the customer audits, you're trying to -- from the time that the customer request and we go and show up to the facility to the time that we provide a report, it could be a couple of months. We definitely want to gather a lot of good data points. And by the time that we kind of do the reports and provide this and communicate, I think the cycle could be roughly 2 months in order for us to get to that face-to-face meeting with a customer and agreeing what they may be making a purchase there. Robert Wertheimer : Perfect. And then if they do the purchase, the upgrade, is that another few months? Or how long is lead time? Vicente Reynal : Yes, then it goes into the lead time. I mean, and clearly, we've got extended backlog now. So depending on the product could be -- yes, it will go into the backlog of the regular lead time of the product. So it could be another couple of months, yes, or longer. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just wondering if you could give us a little more color on the deal pipeline and specifically, the 6 bolt-ons that you mentioned here, maybe collectively the size and maybe what's the historical hit rate for you once you get into kind of the exclusive LOI. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Jeff, once we're in exclusive LOI, we don't find anything. I mean I said hit rate is pretty high. I'm going to say, maybe 90% plus. So we're confident that we're going exclusive with them, and we have done enough diligence but it's just a matter of kind of some of the final negotiating points.  In terms of deal size, think about these 6 bolt-ons similar in nature to LeROI by the time that we made that acquisition. So you can see that they're small in size, but not that every deal will be like LeROI. We want it to be always like that. But clearly, it shows that these bolt-ons can become significant good acquisitions for us over the period of time. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Understood. And then just a follow-up on the whole MQL kind of information insight that it provides. I wonder also if there's any update on kind of your hit rate there as you've tried to look further out and develop leads further in advance, just kind of what's going on kind of conversion lead to order. Or anything to... Vicente Reynal : Yes, just to give you a -- kind of to frame it up. I mean when we have a marketing qualified lead, it is what we consider to be a medium to hot lead. So it has been already kind of prequalified through a lot of the algorithm that we do internally and kind of with our demand generation, we'd like to call that artificial intelligence engine that we have. So it is higher than the typical close rate.  So if you think -- we don't explicitly talk about our close ratio as we think that's kind of strategic to us, but it's much higher than the typical sales call that we can make. So that's why we're very encouraged with just keep pushing MQLs. And at the rate of several thousand of marketing qualified leads per week, it's quite encouraging. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So maybe just starting off, going back to the discussion around audits. I thought that was a really interesting discussion. So I know it's not an apples-to-apples comparison because 4,000 audits, your installed base I think, across your portfolio of products is something like 5 million. I'm just trying to think through this opportunity on a longer-term basis because I see $100 million conversion and that's pretty meaningful, like 2 points to your ITS growth.  And so I'm just wondering, is this something like a growth multiplier over the coming years, is this something you guys are hoping to kind of bank on going forward? Any thoughts around that would be helpful. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe. So I can tell you that the 4,000 that we made reference is only in the U.S. So yes, I mean, definitely many more as we think about it globally, from a global perspective. And yes, I mean, I think we're -- this is something that we're leveraging as another kind of what we call a self-help growth initiative. We think it's meaningful for the customers to learn more about what they can do.  It is something that we've been doing for a little bit of time, but we're getting really good at doing this not only for compressors but also for like blowers. So when you look at a company like Rontec in the pulp and paper industry, they're now doing a lot of these audits as well to think about energy as well as water conservation in the pulp and paper industry. So yes, I think it's something that is very strategic to us. We're kind of unique on how we do it. We think some of the acquisitions that we're making, like Lawrence Factor a couple of quarters ago, it's another enhancer on how we're going to be able to do not only the air audits, but maintain the level of purity of air and efficiency and so on with remote connectivity testing.  So I think it's -- yes, it can be a good growth driver for us. It has been for us so far. And as we said on the remarks, 60% improvement from the number of audits that we did in 2019, pre-pandemic. So it's definitely an area of continued investment for us. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. No, no, that's great to hear, Vicente. I guess maybe my follow-on question, just on China. Just curious, like, can you maybe just provide some on-the-ground color size of the business for you guys? What are you seeing in the region right now? What's been the impact? And how are you thinking about it quantitatively for the guide? Vicente Reynal : Yes. So China for us is roughly 15% of sales, 1-5. And I think we said it before that we're really in the country for the country. So you could argue that roughly 90% of the product that gets sold in China is produced in China. And so therefore, the supply chain is kind of closed by. We don't have a factory in Shanghai. Our factories are outside in Xuzhou and Wuxi and Busan. So these are kind of different cities that have not been fully impacted by the lockdowns as our operators can still go to the factory. In Shanghai, what we have is we have a distribution center. So it kind of has impacted maybe some of the distribution center that we do from -- which is mainly aftermarket. But most recently here, the government is allowing for some companies to actually go back, and we have been one of those companies that we have been allowed to go back.  So the situation here now is where we need now the supply chain to start ramping up. So it's not so much about us, but making sure that those suppliers that we have within the Shanghai region that has been locked down, that they're able to ramp up kind of as fast as where we have been able to. So I think it's just one of those that we're taking a prudent view as we go here in the second quarter and as we're able to work with our suppliers and be able to ramp that even faster and better. It will be, hopefully, some upside opportunity from the perspective of being able to support our customers in a better way. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Vicente Reynal : Maybe Victoria, we move to the next and then come back to Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski at Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just to keep on the energy audit discussion for a second. I'm sort of wondering what the historical context is here, Vicente. We've seen sort of energy price spikes before. I think kind of going back at points in time, there's been a compelling payback analysis, but like we haven't seen customers move as much. I guess the current environment feels may be more different and more structural with what's going on in Ukraine. But like has this happened before? And what sort of the order of magnitude difference? Vicente Reynal : I think, Josh, maybe the 1 different variable that is maybe very new here is ESG and the 2030 and 2050 targets that companies are agreeing to. And you saw on one of our slides how we actually included quotes from sustainability reports from pretty large companies that basically talk about the compressor and the air treatment systems are their way for getting to their Scope 1 and Scope 2 activity. So I think it's a combination of the multiple variables that, yes, energy has spiked in the past and that kind of may create a little bit of acceleration. But I think now the really fundamental change in the market is that, is the fact of these kind of ESG targets that companies are putting out and realizing that this underinvested area of compressors, blowers and pumps that consumes energy, there's now time to really upgrade that.  And the second variable could be around IoT and how the industrial Internet of Things and the remote connectivity is really accelerating that connectivity of the product to really enhance energy consumption and water usage even stronger. So those are the 2 variables that are very different now that really we think are going to create a better sustainable ongoing momentum. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe that's part of the answer to my next question is this business and at other points in time, felt a bit more cyclical with this sort of macro backdrop, whether it's PMIs or specific disruptions in regions. What do you think is sort of the big difference now? I mean part of it is probably some of the sustainability stuff, maybe near shoring, maybe your own lead generation. But like if you had to focus on 1 or 2 things, either macro or micro, do you think are sort of driving the better order performance today than in past volatile period, what would you sort of break that down to? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I'd say, Josh, if I say in terms of things that we can control that we have been working on for the past several years, is how we have moved to better end markets, kind of what we call sustainable, high-growth end markets, whether it is food, beverage, life and sciences. We called that out in the Investor Day as the quality of life and how we continue to see that as we move more of our product by our own choosing to be able to play in those end markets, that provides a better sustainability.  The second one is, again, in terms of what we can control, it will be demand generation. We think that this is a really compelling competitive differentiator that is allowing us to reach this highly fragmented customer base in a much more highly cost-effective way and very, very efficient, allowing us to create this acceleration in market qualified leads that turn into sales qualified leads. And the way we like to say sometimes internally is that we're going to get -- we're getting our sales guys more ad bats and basically hitting more home runs than in the past.  And the third piece internally in terms of what we can control is, I'll say, innovation. I mean, you see how new product development for us is essential. And every quarter, we speak about how we've been able to create new technologies, new products, I mean, the Thomas pump in the technology and moving it into in-vitro diagnostics. Or even the LeROI compressor, which it was a very gas compressor oriented, and we moved that to a much more sustainable end market.  So I think those are 3 areas that we have in our control that are allowing us to have a much more sustainable ongoing growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : I just want to follow up on something you just said. If you talk about the resiliency of IR's portfolio now versus a few years ago, I think one of the big initiatives you've had at the company post the RMT was to improve the aftermarket capability of the company. So how has you proceeded with that initiative? And how has the improvement gone over the last few years? Vikram Kini : Yes. Andy, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start, and I can let Vicente on as well. You're absolutely right. I think if you followed the journey here for a few years, we made some very concerted efforts, I'd say, to eliminate a lot of the, what I'll call, cyclicality that was inherent in the portfolio previously. So you've obviously seen that with the divestitures, particularly with upstream oil and gas obviously being divested away from the business.  And then I'd say a couple of other areas now as we think about today and moving forward. One is the aftermarket piece, which you're absolutely right. We see a path to be above 40% from a total enterprise perspective, which is a more stable and recurring base of revenue, obviously, more profitable as well.  And I think the other one that Vicente just mentioned, and he gave a number of examples, whether it be the LeROI or the Thomas pumps, is what I'll call higher growth, more sustainable end markets. So you've seen a lot of push for areas, whether it be on the water side, whether it be on the lab life science, whether it be hydrogen, a lot of the applications that our oil-free compression technology goes into.  So I would tell you, yes, that's absolutely been a huge push and a very concerted effort. I think if you look at the portfolio today, even versus what the composition was from an end market perspective at the time of the RMT meaningfully different by virtue of both of those areas that we focus on. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then, Vik, if I could follow up with you on cash flow. Obviously, started out seasonally slow in Q1, you mentioned $100 million investment in inventory. How are you thinking about working capital improvement as you go through the year to reach that 100% goal and should we sort of normal cadence from here? Vikram Kini : Yes. That's thought on, Andy. Obviously, clearly, given the backlog and the global supply chain environment, you have seen a build of inventory here in Q1. I would say, obviously, right now, clearly, with the Shanghai situation and still kind of some of that supply chain unrest that's there, we would expect to continue to see working capital at probably a slightly elevated levels here, particularly through the first half of the year. So Q2 probably not being much different. And then the second half being I'd say about more of the normalization.  So I think by the second half, again, assuming everything continues to return to some semblance of normal, you would expect to see that seasonality probably come back in. And it's worth noting here that our cash flow is typically seasonal Q1 is typically the lightest and it does ramp towards the end of the year. We would expect no different this year. Just a little bit more exacerbated in the first half due to the inventory situation. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones at Stifel. Nathan Jones : I wanted to start off with some questions around the backlog and lead times. I mean you've obviously had very strong book-to-bill ratios, very strong orders. But I'm sure you have more backlog than you would like at this point. Are you in lead times getting shorter, getting longer? Any color you can give us around how that's impacting the business and how that's impacting pass-through backlogs, et cetera. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Nathan, I would say and it actually varies by business and also the product lines within the businesses. So for example, we've now been able to have like the small compressors to reduce the lead time dramatically versus what it was in the past.  And so I think in the aggregate, you can think about lead time maybe about the same to slightly better with some kind of mix within those product lines that we have. So is our team working aggressively to try to reduce and use it as a competitive advantage? You bet, they are, yes. Nathan Jones : Do you think that your lead times are better or significantly better than the competitions and that, that is leading to market share gains? Vicente Reynal : I think it will vary country by country. Nathan, I mean, as you know, we're still in region for region or in country for country. It could vary country to country. And in some cases, like I said, I think if we have that opportunity to utilize our lead time as a way to have a competitive differentiator, we will. Nathan Jones : And just one quick one on the energy audits. Do you actually charge for those energy audits? Or do you view that as kind of a selling expense? Vicente Reynal : Yes. No, we actually do it as -- well, I won't say that it varies again, Nathan. In some industries, we're actually charging for some of that, minimal amount. What we do is only mainly because we just want to see the commitment from the customer in doing these audits. I mean sometimes, if you do it for free, they just don't pay the attention to it. So in some cases, we're actually charging. I mean -- but not to generate a profit on these audits. It's just more to create that conversation on what we can do to the customer. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Vik, I just wanted to go back to the incremental margin question, if I could, because I guess the second half is going to have to be pretty heady relative to incremental margins to kind of get to the 35% for the year. And I guess probably most of that's price cost. But I just want to make sure you have a conviction and visibility into that accelerating in the second half. And I assume the fourth quarter would be kind of the highest of the year, but just any comfort around that would be great. Vikram Kini : Yes, Steve, that's completely correct. Yes. I'd say the incremental margins are expected to be obviously much better in the second half of the year than the first half. The major drivers clearly price cost is probably the single biggest driver. As we said, we would expect that price cost is going to be dollar positive in all quarters, but not actually margin positive, particularly in the first half. In the second half, much more so. I'd say the other areas to note would be, one, we do have the $50 million of synergies that we are still expecting to see. Remember, those tend to be a bit more seasonal because the synergies we're seeing now are much more, I would call I2V-oriented maybe to a degree, footprint in certain areas. But they are very volume -- they show up on the volume shifts there. So obviously, they have the seasonality associated with them that, once again, would follow them more so in the second half of the year, it's seasonally stronger.  And the third area to note here is, remember, we do have the, I'd say, the synergies on the bolt-on acquisitions that we completed last year. And so we're taking -- a lot of that is in the Seepex business specifically. We're taking a lot of the actions now, and we'd expect to see a lot more of those in the -- actually in the margin profile more towards the back half of the year. So -- and again, it's -- obviously, it's probably worth noting that right now, particularly for those PST acquisitions, you didn't have them in the prior year for the first half.  So there is a bit of a nuance between first half, second half, once you start comping fully on the acquisitions, it starts to normalize a bit more. But those would probably be the 3 biggest drivers. Price cost obviously being the biggest of the 3 of them. Stephen Volkmann : Understood. That's helpful, and I think actually sort of leads to my follow-on because I was curious about the 6 bolt-ons that you have in the pipeline. Are those likely to be margin dilutive? I know you can sometimes find some pretty good margin acquisition targets. But just curious if you actually get those over the goal line, how we should think about that mix? Vikram Kini : Yes. Steve, I wouldn't -- so they're bolt-on in nature here. They vary in margin profile. And they also, I'd say, vary from a segment perspective as well. So we have a pretty good, I would say, mix across the portfolio. Not meaningfully, I mean, majority of things we're purchasing are in that 20%, 25% plus realm, typically speaking, but we typically have a very good path to how they will get to segment margin profile, if not better, within a 3-year time frame, if not better. And I would tell you the margin profile -- I'm sorry, for the return profile from an ROIC perspective on all 6 of these deals is completely in line with the targets that we've laid out previously.  So even if there is some slight dilution upfront, we would tell you that's something we feel like we can rightsize pretty quickly. Operator : Our final question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : This time I'm here. Sorry, managing the calls. So I apologize for that, embarrassing.  I want to go back to the energy audits. I know you've touched on it a number of times here. But you said a 2-year payback, Vicente. I'm wondering how that looks specifically in Europe, just given how high energy prices are there. 2-year payback is definitely in the realms of a good CapEx ROI, but just wondering how that looks in Europe. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Great, Nigel. Yes, I mean Europe, clearly, with the energy cost being much higher, will be better than that 2-year payback. We don't want to specifically quantify region by region. But as energy costs will continue to rise, that is definitely kind of core to the mathematical formulation of getting that payback in there. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just I'm curious, I'm not aware of any specific credits or incentives at the manufacturing level. But are there any incentives that you're aware of that could encourage -- maybe get some customers over the line on replacements? Vicente Reynal : Nothing that I would say meaningful, Nigel, to be honest. No, nothing meaningful. Nigel Coe : And then just finally on compressors, the legacy Ingersoll Rand i.e., train, you know what I mean. The old compressor portfolio was definitely a bit more oily than the Gardner Denver portfolio, larger, higher prices. Just wondering, what is the mix right now of energy centric end markets there? And so what trends you seen in those verticals? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Great. So this is actually one that very well fits in line to what we said before about moving to the sustainable high-growth end markets. So we're taking that technology of that large centrifical compressors into air separation like for hydrogen or for LNG. So these are kind of the kind of more what we call more into the sustainable end markets that we're seeing. Also food and beverage and also a lot of the new semiconductor expansions that you're seeing and the localization of the supply chain.  And the last one is electric vehicle production and lithium battery ion production. I mean those are kind of the end markets that we have pivoted away from oil and gas and into these better sustainable growth in markets. So this is a great example on taking what we can control, which is taking the products and position them very well into end markets that are seeing better growth momentum. Operator : This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'll pass it back over to Vicente Reynal for any final remarks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Victoria. I just want to say thanks to everyone for your interest on Ingersoll Rand. And to all the employees that are listening to here on the call who are shareholders and also to all of our shareholders, we want to say thanks again for the support. As you can see, we're a company very well positioned to continue to execute even in difficult environments, and we're always guided by our purpose of making life better not only for the planet, our customers, but also our employees and shareholders.  So with that, I want to conclude here and say thank you again, and talk to some of you soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everybody, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our host for today's call is Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Fort. You may begin sir. Matthew Fort : Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2022 second quarter earnings call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more details. In addition in today's remarks we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a strategy update, review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to 2022 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller to keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks Matthew, and good morning to everyone. Moving to slide 3, I would like to start by welcoming Matthew to his new role as the Head of Investor Relations after several successful years leading our power tools and lifting business as a finance leader and helping to return the business to profitable growth and a strong margin profile. In addition, I am also very happy to welcome Kathryn Freytag as our new Chief Information Officer. Both appointments demonstrate the deep bench of talent that we continue to develop at Ingersoll Rand. I would also like to say thank you to our employees worldwide for exemplifying our purpose through an ownership mindset and entrepreneurial spirit and delivering on our customer needs. Our teams continue to impress me on how we're leveraging our own IRX process to outperform in the most challenging macro environment. Our performance in the second quarter and year-to-date exemplifies how our employees think and act like owners. Demand remains very strong as we sit here today. And when we see the supply chain risk and geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to be a concern, we stay focused on what we can control while leveraging our strong balance sheet and operational mindset to deliver on our own 2022 commitments and beyond. We also remain very agile in this environment and you will see today how we continue to accelerate organic investments for growth around innovation and demand generation. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy that is very focused on inorganic growth through bolt-on acquisitions. And today we're highlighting three new acquisitions that are very well-aligned with our stated M&A strategy and will enhance the quality of our portfolio. Starting on slide 4 staying true to our five strategic imperatives where operate sustainably is at the center, we continue to align our portfolio to sustainable high-growth end markets supported by global megatrends. There are four points I would like to briefly highlight on this page. First, is that we have a simple two-pronged approach of growing sustainably and operating sustainably. Second, we released our 2021 sustainability report in June highlighting our progress across all aspects of our sustainability journey and how we continue to remain on track to hit our 2030 targets. Third, our efforts have resulted in another upgrade from MSCI to AA from A, which puts us in the upper quartile of our peer group. It is also worth noting that we now have moved from a BB rating to a AA rating in less than 2.5 years. And this recent upgrade was done before the release of our 2021 sustainability report so we will be watching carefully and we will expect to see continued positive momentum in our ratings from the other sustainability rating agencies. Last, I want to remind everyone to save the date for our Annual Sustainability webcast on September 22 where we will provide a comprehensive update on our current efforts around sustainability. Moving to slide 5, we want to highlight today an exciting innovation, which is a testament to our commitment to sustainability and organic growth through differentiated technology. Later this year, we will officially launch this first of its kind water treatment system called Ion Solutions. This is a very compact solution in the box where a small compressor and liquid pump technology from Ingersoll Rand are combined with our own patented cold plasma technology to produce nanobubbles that contain a high concentration of oxygen. This innovation allows for chemical-free disinfection and enhanced oxygenation of water. You can see some of the incredible benefits this technology produces on the slide including higher disinfection efficacy and increased oxygen concentration all while delivering and driving a lower total cost of ownership and footprint. We're officially launching this product later this year for indoor farming as well as water disinfection applications and we will continue to expand our reach into other high-growth sustainable end markets like medical, food and pharma. What excites me even more is the speed in which the team has moved to develop and commercialize the Ion Solutions technology. Through the utilization of the Ingersoll Rand Execution Excellence or IRX, the team moved from the acquisition of the technology and IP behind Ion Solutions to the launch of the product in less than 15 months. In addition, the development was self-funded within the PST segment and we continue to increase our investments in R&D to drive future organic growth opportunities like this. Turning to slide 6, we're also very pleased to highlight the most recent inorganic investments which remain our top priority from a capital allocation perspective. Our M&A funnel remains very healthy and as of the end of Q2 2022, the funnel remains over five times larger than it was in Q2 of 2020. Earlier this week, we announced the signing of three bolt-on acquisitions, which are well aligned with our strategic and financial criteria. In addition, these three companies have grown on an aggregate of more than 20% CAGR over the past three years. Let me quickly walk through the signed deals. First, Holtec, which is a leading provider of on-site systems that generate high-purity nitrogen gas. This is a great example of a bolt-on acquisition that extends our addressable market to very close adjacencies within the ITS business. In this case, the nitrogen generation can be connected to a compressor and produce nitrogen on site. And there are huge benefits for this including the elimination of large nitrogen storage tanks at a customer site which typically also requires frequent refilling via trucks. In addition the purity and quality of the gas can be much better controlled on site with a drastic reduction in costs. Second is Hanye, which is a manufacturer of dryer technology that has served as a long-term OEM partner of our ITS Asia Pacific business. Hanye brings differentiated and patented technology to our China compressor business. Both Holtec and Hanye are great examples of expanding our solutions and offerings in the broader compressor ecosystem to better serve our customer needs. And finally Hydro Prokav an India-based manufacturer of progressive cavity pumps and retrofit spare parts. Hydro Prokav generates more than 80% of its revenues through the sale of aftermarket parts and serves as a complementary addition to the recent Seepex acquisition to further penetrate the growing market in India. We continue to be very prudent in our sourcing and execution of M&A deals as illustrated by the single-digit aggregate pre-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples for these three deals. In addition we expect to have several more bolt-on acquisitions to announce in the second half of the year as shown by the fact that we have eight additional deals under LOI. As a result, we're confident from being able to reaffirm our stated target of 400 to 500 basis points of annualized growth coming from M&A. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks Vicente. Moving to slide seven. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q2. We saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX demonstrating our ability to operate in a very agile manner in the current environment. We remain on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment in cost synergies from the merger. In addition as we've indicated many times we have a funnel that stands in excess of $350 million and we are ready to take incremental actions if warranted by macroeconomic conditions and market activity. Total company orders and revenue increased 10% and 13% year-over-year respectively driven by strong double-digit organic order growth in ITS and low single-digit organic growth in PST orders. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $335 million a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.3% a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement and 60 basis point improvement sequentially from Q1. Free cash flow for the quarter was $165 million despite ongoing headwinds from inventories due to the global supply chain as well as the need to support backlog. Total liquidity of $2.4 billion at quarter end was down approximately $700 million from prior quarter driven primarily by the execution of our capital structure strategy which we will discuss shortly. Our net leverage is 1.1x a slight improvement of 0.1x from prior quarter. Turning to slide eight. For the total company Q2 orders grew 15% and revenue increased 18% both on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.11x for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog which is up over 40% from last year. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. ITS segment margin increased 70 basis points while the PST segment margin declined 390 basis points driven by the impact of prior year acquisitions as well as the impact of investments for growth such as the Ion Solutions innovation highlighted by Vicente and the impact of China lockdowns in two PST facilities. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST margins declined by 190 basis points. It's important to note that both segments did remain price cost positive in terms of dollars in the second quarter, which speaks of the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. Finally, corporate costs came in at $35 million for the quarter, down year-over-year primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general cost savings and prudency offsetting incremental investments we made in the area of demand generation and IT. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 17% to $0.54 per share. The tax rate for the quarter was 23% and we anticipate the full year being approximately the same. Moving on to the next slide, free cash flow for the quarter was $165 million despite a $92 million increase in inventory to support backlog. CapEx during the quarter totaled $21 million. And leverage for the quarter was 1.1 turns, which was an 0.1 turn improvement versus the prior quarter. Total company liquidity now stands at $2.4 billion based on approximately $1.3 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Liquidity decreased by $700 million in the quarter, which included deploying $621 million to debt repayment, $153 million to share repurchases and $8 million to our dividend payment. As Vicente mentioned, M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation. Our funnel remains robust and active and we would expect M& A to be our primary usage of cash here in the second half of the year. On slide 10, we show in more detail the strategic changes we have made to our capital structure. In an effort to create a flexible and efficient capital structure, we took a number of actions within the quarter. First, we paid down the entirety of our euro term loan of $621 million. The debt paydown is consistent with our financial policies to prudently manage our gross debt and our commitment towards achieving investment-grade credit ratings. We also executed a combination of interest rate swaps cross-currency swaps and interest rate caps to better balance our fixed to floating interest rate ratio and our currency mix of our debt. In addition, strong cash generation of the business, along with a strong balance sheet, enable us to execute on our growth strategy across all economic conditions. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. Turning to slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong organic revenue growth of 14%, including approximately 8% price and 6% volume growth year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rose 13% year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.4%, up 70 basis points from prior year, with an incremental margin of 32%. Organic orders grew 11% with a strong book-to-bill of 1.11. It is also important to note that on a two-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 50%, which is higher rates than the Q1, 2022, two-year stack of approximately 40%, meaning that thus far we continue to see accelerated demand for our products. If we move to the individual product categories, each of the below figures includes the negative impact of FX, which you can see was about 5% headwind across the total segment. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the high single digits. A further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products grew in the high teens and oil-lubricated products grew in the low single digits. The Americas team delivered solid performance with orders in North America up approximately 10%, while Latin America was up low 20s. In Mainland Europe, down low single digits, due primarily to FX headwinds. And a further look into our leading indicators like demand generation lease shows stable growth in Mainland Europe. Despite nearly two months of lockdowns in Shanghai China the Asia Pacific team delivered orders in the mid-teens. This was driven by low double-digit growth in China and mid-20s growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In vacuums and blowers, orders were down low single digits on a global basis, driven mainly by FX we spoke about before and also a tough comp, even we saw mid-40s growth in orders during Q2 of 2021. Moving next to the Power Tools & Lifting. The Power Tools & Lifting team delivered strong performance, with orders for the business up approximately 20%. And this marks their largest quarter for orders since Q1 of 2015. Looking at the sustainable innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our next-generation oil-free compressor. With the patented aerodynamic impeller design, this innovative centrifugal compressor is approximately 15% more efficient than the oil-free rotary compressor it will typically replace. This technology is a perfect example of how we are continuing to address our customers' sustainability needs and goals by driving productivity through improved efficiency and reduce energy costs, decreasing the Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Moving to slide 12, revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 6% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $78 million, which was up 9% year-over-year, with incremental margins up 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, down 390 basis points year-over-year. As illustrated on the table in the bottom left side of the page, the decline in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven primarily by the impact of prior year acquisitions which drove 200 basis points of the decline. In addition, the impact of investments for growth, such as our hydrogen business and the ion solutions product line that drove 80 basis points of decline and China lockdowns, where the other largest discrete driver had nearly 60 basis points, given the impact due to China facilities in the PST segment. Organic orders grew up 2% year-over-year, as future comps were challenging due to the prior year COVID related demand, primarily in the Thomas Medical business. Adjusting for the COVID and the one-time large non-repeating orders, normalized organic orders were up approximately 9%. And on a two-year stack organic orders were up 22%. It is also important to note that in Q1 of 2022, the two-year organic stack was approximately 19%, again showing some sequential acceleration of demand into Q2. Since the Investor Day in November, one of the key questions we have been asked is how we expect to achieve the mid-30s EBITDA margin profile for PST. On the bottom right-hand side of the page I want to illustrate, why we continue to believe a mid-30s margin is achievable and we remain committed to delivering that in the medium term. As you can see 25% of the portfolio is already above 35% EBITDA margins, with another 40% of the portfolio that is around 30% margin. That leaves us with a few targeted businesses that are at or below 25% EBITDA margin with the vast majority related to new acquisitions and early-stage innovations. We believe we have significant opportunity for margin expansion across the entire portfolio and we have a proven track record of margin expansion in both newly acquired assets and within our core business. And let me point out to three examples. The first example is Seepex and illustrates how we plan to improve businesses that are in the less than 25% EBITDA margin bucket. As you recall, we acquired Seepex in September 2021, which had mid-teens EBITDA margin at the time of the acquisition and has already improved to the low 20s in less than two quarters. The next two examples point out to how we can continue to improve businesses that already have some very high EBITDA margins. First, Air Dimensions, which was another recently acquired company in Q4 of 2021, which in less than two quarters have gone from mid-50s EBITDA margin to low 60s EBITDA margin. And then there is our legacy Gardner Denver Medical segment, which we now call our Thomas business. This is a core business where we have shown an ability to grow its EBITDA margin from the high 20s in 2018 to the low 30s by 2021 and where it remains today. Overall, we continue to see a strong runway on margin expansion across the entire PST portfolio and we will use IRX to ensure proper prioritization of actions and nimble execution. Moving to Slide 13. Once again we're raising our full year guidance. We're raising our organic growth guidance for the total company to 11% to 13%, which is a 300 basis point increase from our prior guidance. The raise comes entirely from our IPS segment. The organic growth increase is offset by the negative impact of FX. FX is expected to now contribute headwinds of approximately 5% versus a headwind of 2% in prior guidance. And this leads to a full year 2022 revenue guidance at 11% to 13% total growth. We're also raising the adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.395 billion to $1.425 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater than or equal to 100%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20s and CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue. And although, we don't provide quarterly guidance the best way to think about the back half revenue and EBITDA facing is that the distribution between Q3 and Q4 is similar to what we saw in prior year. We expect pricing to improve slightly from the first half to the second half, as we continue to work through backlog and we do expect the price cost spread to improve in the second half of the year. As a reminder, the new acquisitions mentioned on Slide 6 are not included in this guidance as the transactions have not closed. Turning to Slide 14, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a very strong position. We delivered strong results in the first half 2022 including record second quarter performance that was better than our expectations. 2022 is poised to be a strong year despite known challenges and dynamic market conditions. We will continue to remain agile and leverage IRX across every facet of our business to deliver on our commitments. To our employees, I want to again thank you for your continued engagement and making thoughtful action oriented decisions like the owners that you are. This engagement continues to drive the accomplishment of our mission to make life better for our customers, the environment and shareholders. And our balance sheet is very strong and with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient to have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with a high return on capital as we continue our track record of market performance. With that I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Halloran. Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Mike. Michael Halloran : So a couple of questions here. First question, Vicente you talked about constructive or positive leading indicators that give you confidence in the demand through remainder of the year at least. Maybe you could just dig into that a little bit more quoting customer conversations and what really \u2013 what some of those leading indicators are that are making you feel that level of confidence. Vicente Reynal : Yes Mike I think one of the most important I'll say leading indicators for us is what we have spoken in the past about demand generation, qualified leads, which as you know we have a very unique marketing engine to be able to grab a lot of good new customers. And as we saw through the quarter, we continue to see pretty good stability on the marketing qualified leads that the team is generating. And as we kind of move into July, we actually even saw acceleration in some areas and some end markets and regions. So that's kind of what gives us confidence. And as we look into the order momentum into July also pretty strong \u2013 continue to be fairly strong. Michael Halloran : Thanks for that. And then good color on the capital deployment side of things. On the LOIs and what you're seeing in the pipeline, could you give a little more context to size of the transactions and if there's any change to the type of things you're pursuing at this point? Vicente Reynal : Sure, Mike. I mean I'll say that very excited about what we see in the pipeline. I mean very solid funnel. You saw that the three transactions that are highly strategic I mean great growing companies, good technologies, addressing \u2013 expanding the addressable market. I mean it kind of hits all the marks and even also with the financial criteria. And as we look through the other eight that we have in the LOI, I would say similar to what we have been doing over the past kind of 12 to 18 months, which kind of bolt-on tuck-in in nature, great returns, good growing companies, elevating the portfolio of the company and one that we see can be highly \u2013 highly strategic for us to continue accelerating the growth. Michael Halloran : Thanks for that, Vicente. Appreciate it. Vicente Reynal : Yes, thank you, Mike. Operator : And we have a question from Julian Mitchell. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to try and understand the sort of the second half EBITDA outlook a little bit more clearly. So when we're thinking about the sort of weighting between third and fourth quarter, are we thinking the third quarter is maybe a sort of high 20s share of full year EBITDA? Just trying to understand the margin ramp. And then by segment, any color you could give us on how much the margin step-up into the back half your split between ITS versus PST? Vik Kini : Yes. Julian, this is Vik. I'll take the first part of your question, I'll let Vicente answer the second. I think in terms of your first question in terms of I think you asked about the phasing of EBITDA in Q3. Yes, you're actually, right. I'd say, mid- to high 20% in terms of the phasing. And what we would probably say -- very consistent to actually what we've been saying all year is that the phasing throughout the year in terms of the quarters, is actually very similar to what you saw last year, in terms of the phasing -- in terms of the Q3 and Q4 weighting of EBITDA. So that's probably, a good proxy it's. Vicente Reynal : Yes, and maybe Julian in terms of the segments, I mean if you think about it, kind of first half to second half, which is the way sometimes we like to look at it is that think about ITS. Flow-through in the first half, was approximately in the 30s. And as we get closer to the 40s for the second half, and that's going to be driven, primarily through a better pricing realization that we already have action, as well as some kind of continued movement in terms of the merger-related productivity savings, that -- so think about it it's already actions, that you could call it that we have so to speak in the back or already action. And then from a PST, I think when you look at the data again, same thing first half to second half flow-through, in the first half was kind of in the low 20s with an EBITDA margin generating in the first half in the high 20s, kind of 28% range. And as we go into the second half, EBITDA margin should expect to grow closer to the 30s, which leads to that incremental flow-through of the 50s. And again when you think about the big pieces, it's fairly similar in terms of, better price realization given the actions that we have taken for the PST segment. It's a lot around the M&A synergy realization, for the deals that we closed, in the second half of 2021. And also for the PST, is kind of some of these known repeat China lockdown volume mix, and absorption related issues. So again, it feels like fairly doable and the team is executing to all those actions that we need to get done. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up would be around the IT&S EMEA orders progression, how comfortable do you feel with that and the demand outlook in that ITS compressor piece. I realize the order numbers, you put up are including FX, and sort of stripping that out it's a little bit healthier. But are you seeing any change in demand on that piece? And then PST, how long does that kind of COVID headwind last? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Julian, from an ITS EMEA, no change in dynamic. As we see even here with our leading indicators. As you very well pointed out, I mean the Q2, pretty well affected by the FX. And that's why when you can even see it Q1 to Q2 sequentiall, I mean FX, Eurozone was like a 5% to 6% headwind impact. So, yes, I mean FX -- but even with that the team continues to outperform pretty well and confident on the execution, what the team continues to outlay in the coming quarters. From a PST perspective, in terms of COVID, you're going to see one more kind of meaningful comp here in the third quarter. That should be relatively about the same, to what we saw in the second quarter. And then basically, after that we should be kind of clear in the goal I mean, in the fourth quarter. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just to put a finer point on that third quarter phasing, Vik is that -- I mean my dumb math would get me to $375 million of EBITDA. Is that in the right zone of where you see things? Vik Kini : Yes, Nigel I think that may be maybe a little on the higher side. If you were to use kind of a mid \u2013 I'm going to say mid plus 20% phasing in Q3, I think you'd be in the right zone. So, maybe a little on the high side, but you're not dramatically that far off. Nigel Coe : Okay. So like $350 million, $360 million. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then on the PFT side, we've talked about the margins a fair bit. You called out the COVID order headwinds. And I'm wondering, when do we start to lap that impact? I think, there's four points to orders. And how is that floating through to revenues and margins? So are we seeing a headwind there as well? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Nigel, so we'll see one more quarter here in the third quarter of the same kind of COVID head related one-time from last year. And so what you see in the third quarter should be fairly similar to what we saw here in the second quarter, from an order and revenue perspective. Nigel Coe : Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there, guys. Thanks a lot. Vicente Reynal : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : A couple of quick ones for me. Just trying to understand, I think with a lot of our companies like, how this \u2013 the fact that like base metal pricing is starting to deflate and how that ultimately impacts the P&L out in 2023. So, I'd love to hear some thoughts just around, how much of the pricing do you think you're going to be able to hold on to versus potentially give back? And what happens, do you think to your margins if you do see some deflation from a cost input perspective? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Joe, I'll say that, the way we think about it is that, we're not \u2013 we have not historically given out any pricing impact. And the reason being, all the price increases that we have done even this year, and last year have been list price increases. And the way to think about it too as well our customers, they don't buy, the same type of product every month. I mean, they buy, a compressor now, and they just probably buy another one five to eight years later. So it's kind of difficult to compare that kind of price to price perspective. I mean, clearly against, the market they do, but that's why we want to continue to create that highly innovative solutions and differentiated technology that will allow us to command that premium price. And so as we think \u2013 and we look forward. Yeah, I mean, we're pretty excited to that you're starting to see some of these kind of base commodities kind of dramatically reduced. What we have here for ourselves, and we told the teams here for the second half is assume inflation stays constant and kind of work on what you can control, which is price and execution and productivity. And as we go into 2023, and we get a better visibility of what that deflation could happen, yeah, I mean, we see that that could be a great margin expansion for us on an ongoing basis. Joe Ritchie : That's great to hear, Vicente. And maybe just \u2013 I know, we talked a little bit about the PST margins. I like the walk that you guys did on slide 12, the year-over-year walk. If you take a look at those four buckets, M&A growth China, and then other, and you think about 3Q, how should \u2013 like maybe just talk me through like the buckets and how those buckets change in the third quarter. I'm assuming that, your PST margins are maybe down modestly in 3Q on a year-over-year basis? Vik Kini : Yeah, Joe, I'll take that one. So, if we kind of think about the three buckets, the way I probably describe it is, first starting with the biggest one the impact of M&A. First and foremost, we do start to lap the M&A. Obviously, the biggest drivers in there were coming from Q3 of last year's acquisitions, particularly Seepex being the biggest one, and we've highlighted that one a few times. So, obviously as we lap that, and clearly with some of the higher synergy expectation that, we expect to see that will start falling off. So again, we would expect to see the impact of M&A start to dramatically reduce here in Q3 given that we only had a one-month impact last year -- sorry one-month impact this year in terms of the timing of when we purchased it. The impact of China lockdowns, we really wouldn't expect to see that repeat at all. Obviously, that was a very nuanced in Q2. The good news here is exiting really through June -- exiting June, our China facilities particularly in PST, we're operating right back on track and we don't have any expectations of any concerns here in Q3. In terms of the investments for growth, yes that definitely will still be part of the equation. I think it will be -- you should expect it to be dramatically different in terms of Q3. A lot of these are areas like for example our hydrogen business and the Ion Solutions business that was highlighted in the deck. And those will continue. These are great innovations things that we're really excited about, one that we continue to invest in and execute on frankly since last year even through this year. So again, I think that's how the three major buckets play themselves out. And then as Vicente indicated here, the price/cost spread will continue to get better for PST not just in Q3 but also in Q4. Joe Ritchie : Super helpful. Thanks guys. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Joe. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Hey, thanks and good morning, everybody. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Rob. Rob Wertheimer : My question is actually going to be on innovation and the cold plasma is something -- it sounds very interesting and how differentiated it is. And I really just wanted to see if you could review your innovation sort of process changes that have gone on and any metrics you want to share on pacing change and so forth? And then breakthrough innovations, may be slightly different. I don't know the oil-free is a known industry thing. I'm not sure if this is evidence of a different program that's been ongoing or whether it's kind of a lucky opportunity or if it's a more widespread effort? Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Rob, so very intriguing questions. I'll say that the innovation on the cold plasma technology it is highly differentiated and pretty unique. And actually, you go out there in the market and we'll be able to talk more about it is the only one that has all in its own -- in its self-contained unit, not only the ability of creating disinfection, but create ability of accelerated oxygenation in the water, which is kind of particularly very, very important for hydroculture markets and hydroponic markets and things like that. So I think it's going to be really strong. We have built a very strong IP around it. And so we have a very big area in terms of IP protection around that. And again speaks volumes to some of the things that we've been wanting to do, which is kind of a combination of several Ingersoll Rand technologies such as compressors and pumps into additive technology that can actually create a very unique solution. And again here is just one great example. In terms of how we think about innovation kind of the cadence of innovation. We spoke, I think it was back at the investor conference how from an ITS perspective and we kind of gave a bit of a highlight that innovation accelerated dramatically when the combination of the two companies and we continue to do a lot of that work around global product summits that we have with the teams. And so I think it's a very exciting piece, which is fairly recently here -- a couple of weeks ago we had our strategic plan review with the teams. And one of the core characteristics of the review in every business it was around intellectual property and IP and patented technology because we believe that we have unique technology that can be application-driven and protect that as a protective IP. In regards to that breakthrough technology and particularly to the centrifugal I think it's just one example where again you take kind of core technology such as centrifugal compression that it is very unique for oil-free products. And in this case oil-free compression. And again we've created some IP protection around the aerodynamics of the product inside and how the air flow moves inside. So, again, we feel that that allows us to create differentiation and energy efficiency. So, a pretty unique model that we leverage IRX all in its own to drive the process. And I would say that this Ion Solutions the cold plasma was one great example. Acquired some IP, developed the IP, utilized IRX processes as a way to out-execute the product and in less than 15 months we went from concept to launch of a product which is pretty impressive. Rob Wertheimer : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have a question from Stephen Volkmann. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Hey, good morning guys. I just wanted to ask about kind of what you're seeing in terms of the supply chain and sort of the productivity impact of that. And I'm just trying to figure out if there's been any kind of margin headwind due to all these issues that we're seeing? Vicente Reynal : Yes, I would say Steve absolutely a margin headwind because if you think about it we don't have all the components at the right time at the right place. So, yes that creates the factories to do heroics in terms of reconfiguring and try to maybe prebuild a piece of the compressor put it on the side and then wait for the part. So, yes, absolutely. We've seen productivity hits due to the inefficiencies on the supply chain. And I think one thing we'll say is that we still see supply chain constraints and issues. So, I don't think that everything is perfect. I think what our teams are doing with the utilization of the IRX and the processes is incredible from the perspective that they're able to outperform. I mean and you saw that very clearly with the team in ITS in China that just basically outperformed dramatically to even some of the expectations that we had when they came back with the lockdown. But yes, definitely some headwinds. So, to your point, it's a very good point as we go into maybe 2023 and beyond, we should see maybe the better efficiencies or productivity due to the ease of the supply chain being more stable. Stephen Volkmann : Right and obviously that's exactly where I was going with this because it feels like for 2023 demand will be whatever it is but you should see some margin tailwinds from sort of normalization of supply chain at some point presumably. And then maybe price cost also turns positive. And so maybe it feels like incrementals could be pretty robust in 2023. Vicente Reynal : Absolutely. Vik Kini : Yes, I would agree. I mean I think the only thing to add to what you said there is we're pretty encouraged that price cost actually has been -- we've actually been positive the entire time from last year even through the first half of this year. We do expect it obviously get better into the second half of this year. And then potentially, as Vicente indicated earlier ,if commodities start to deflate the next year and given how we deploy price, we definitely see that as a potential tailwind into 2023. I think the other thing we should probably mention here is and you see it -- you saw it in the financials that clearly as a result of the supply chain, obviously, inventory continues to be at elevated levels. And I think our supply chain alleviates here. We obviously have a meaningful opportunity from a cash perspective in terms of deploying that inventory. So and the good news is the backlog is there to do it for the back half of this year. So again it's just a matter of us continuing to execute and seeing a little bit more normalization in the supply chain. Stephen Volkmann : Super. Thank you. Vik Kini : Yes. Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase. Your line is open. Unidentified analyst : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning guys. Vik Kini : Good morning Nicole. Unidentified analyst : Just maybe going back to the comment you made about July orders Vicente like you mentioned some acceleration in certain regions and markets. Can you elaborate a little bit on where you guys saw things improved? Vicente Reynal : Yes Hi Nicole. I figured that we'll get the follow-up for sure yes. I think \u2013 Nicole, I think we -- it was -- to be honest it was fairly broad-based if I were to categorize it. I'll say that we saw -- we're starting to see more I guess release so to speak for the some long cycle projects. So we're seeing that some of these kind of large projects that have been in the pipeline and there's been a lot of conversations they're getting released. So we're seeing some good momentum on that as -- and some of these are energy transition-related and/or expansion of capacities and also in some cases onshore into as well. So we're seeing some good momentum on that perspective. But to be honest it was fairly global from a global perspective across all regions and very exciting movement in the U.S., China but even also in Europe. So I think it was a fairly broad-based here, Nicole. Unidentified analyst : Thanks Vicente and Vik maybe just a follow-up on the comment you just made about free cash flow. Can you talk a little bit about the path you see in the second half to get to the 100% plus conversion? Like is this very 4Q weighted based on your plans for reducing inventories? Vik Kini : Nicole, I'd say it's probably second half weighted. It's probably the best way to say it. If you look -- last year is probably a good example. Typically we are seasonally more second half weighted. I would say that's probably a combination of two things. One, following the profitability of the company as well as the typical movements in working capital, I think in terms of this year sure you are going to see probably a stronger fourth quarter comparatively speaking. But yes, a lot of that is also predicated on the working capital let's call it continued rightsizing which inventory obviously being the biggest piece. You kind of see that through the first half that we have built a meaningful amount of inventory about $200 million I'd say for the first half headwind from a cash flow perspective. But despite that we're actually quite pleased with generating $165 million of free cash flow still in the second quarter. So again, pretty pleased with the execution of the team despite what I would call working capital headwind. But the good news here is we have the backlog and the path to be able to execute and free up that cash. Unidentified analyst : Thanks Vik. I'll pass it along. Vik Kini : Thank you, Nicole. Operator : Our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky. Your line is open. Unidentified analyst : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Vicente Reynal : Good morning Vlad. Unidentified analyst : So maybe just on the capital allocation front, a lot of good color around obviously the three deals you've announced and then the additional LOIs on the bolt-ons. But can you talk about just given how leverage has come down, how you're thinking about your appetite for larger deals especially given maybe some increased noise in the macro backdrop? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. I'll say, Vlad when you look at our funnel -- the funnel characteristics that we have are still fairly talking bolt-on in nature. So I'll definitely speak in terms of what we see today in the funnel is nothing around those one billion plus acquisitions and not because they might not be out there but because we're being very focused more on this more bolt-on in nature deals that can be highly accretive to us. Unidentified analyst : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful Vicente. Thanks. And then maybe just going back to the organic growth outlook here. So you took your organic growth outlook up on stronger IT&S growth. So can you just talk about what's really changed in the environment since 1Q? I mean, investors are more focused on a potential slowdown and worried about the macro, but you're seeing organic growth accelerate. So can you just talk about the drivers and how you think about the sustainability of that growth trajectory beyond the back half here? Vicente Reynal : Sure. I'll say that maybe to keep it more or less simplistic in nature is that we're seeing definitely better price acceleration and realization. You saw how sequentially Q1 to Q2 we improved price, I mean, almost 200 basis points in terms of price whether ITS or PST. So again we -- and those are actions that we have taken that is already built already in the backlog. So basically shipping the product and realizing that higher price realization that gives you that increase in organic, as well as also as Vik said that price cost margin amplitude that will continue to get better in the second half. And to the volume, organic volume is then in terms of the just again supply chain constraints getting released and be able to accelerate some of the shipments from being able to deliver to what customers want. So again it's better price realization and better supply chain coming to a better movement here for us that allows the factories to produce a product. Unidentified analyst : Great. That\u2019s helpful Vicente. Thanks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Thank you, Vlad. Operator : We have a question from Nathan Jones. Your line is open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I wanted to start off with a question about the long-cycle projects Vicente. You talked about some of those getting released and helping to drive the order book. I think by the time those projects get to ordering products from Ingersoll Rand, they're likely to go ahead regardless of the macro backdrop. Can you talk about any information or insight you might have on some of those larger longer cycle projects that might be -- might have been in the planning stages that maybe customers are reconsidering with higher interest rates, macro uncertainty or anything like that? Have you heard anything about customers reconsidering or delaying moving forward with earlier stage projects like that? Vicente Reynal : I'll say Nathan to be honest, it's an interesting question, but I would say that nothing that we see dramatically customers just put in a big pause and rethinking. I think on the contrary, I will say that because of current energy prices being so high and the fact that our technology allowed us to drive this energy efficiency and improvements, we're seeing customers making the acceleration of let's just get it done here now because they see energy prices to be high for the longer or kind of medium to longer period of time of perspective. So I think that again this cause benefit equation that we have with our products and solutions and how our teams are positioning that from a total cost of ownership to the customer that equates to a better carbon footprint for our customers. It is actually seeing some good momentum on getting projects even more through the accelerated pipeline in my view. Nathan Jones : Thanks. Maybe for Vik. On the capital structure swaps caps, can you talk about any detail you can give us on notional value how it impacts the interest expense here in the short-term? And what the plans are for maybe putting actual fixed debt in place over the next couple of years here. Just any details you can give us on your intentions with the capital structure? Vik Kini : Yes, sure. So, maybe just for completeness here, I'll kind of just summarize kind of what we did here. But we did a number of things here in the second quarter to, I'd say, execute on our capital structure strategy. And it's important to note that ensuring that we're on our continued path to an investment-grade credit rating, and we obviously want to make sure that we're cognizant of balancing further interest rate exposure by balancing our fixed to floating ratio as you indicated. And so what we did was, I'd say, three distinct things or three to four distinct things in the quarter. One we did pay off the full amount of the euro-denominated term loan, which was in dollar terms $621 million. Then we executed \u20ac1 billion USD to euro cross currency swaps three-year term. And 50% of that swap to fixed, 50% swap to floating. And then, the final piece is we executed $1 billion of US dollar interest rate capped at 4% on the base interest rate. So again, we've meaningfully changed a fixed to floating ratio here in the context of where we were exiting Q1, for example, to where we are now exiting Q2. And I think in the context of -- your kind of second part of your question, yes, I mean I think this is just a step in the consistent evolution of our capital structure. As indicated here, we do continue to see a path to investment-grade credit rating at which point in time clearly we would expect the nature of our capital structure to continue to evolve and change at which point we'll probably go into more of a fixed rate structure at that point in time. The good news here is the maturities of our debt towers right now are all out to 2027. So that gives us some time here to continue to both evaluate but execute and change that structure. And I think the good news here is we still have a considerable amount of flexibility as well as coupled with the strong free cash flow as well as with the -- I'd say, the amount of cash and liquidity we have exiting Q2. It gives us I'd say, a lot of flexibility to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which you heard from Vicente. Obviously, we'll continue to be very M&A-centric. And clearly, the funnel continues to support that. Nathan Jones : And maybe just the bottom line what's the quarterly run rate for interest expense? Vik Kini : Yes, you'll probably be, I'd say, closer to the high 20s in the back half of the year on average, roughly speaking\u2026 Nathan Jones : Good. Vik Kini : From legislative perspective. Nathan Jones : Thanks very much. Vik Kini : Thanks Nathan. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Joe O'Dea. Your line is open. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Joe. Joe O'Dea: I wanted to ask on the M&A contribution to growth based on the deals this quarter and then based on what you have under LIO, when you think about the framework of the 4% to 5% annual target and given kind of what's in motion right now what kind of a contribution you think that's setting up for next year. Are we looking at something better than that based on the number of deals that we're looking at here? Vik Kini : Yes, Joe, I think the best way to think about this is maybe two pieces. One our commitment and what we still are reaffirming here today is the ability to execute 400 to 500 basis points on an annualized basis of inorganic growth. So let me take it in two pieces. You can see in the guidance, we still are committed to about $225 million of in-year impact. Now the reality is that's largely coming from the deals that you saw already announced primarily in the second half of the last year as well as you'll see -- remember we did one small bolt-on in the first quarter a business called Jorc. So that's really what's driving the $225 million. The three deals that were announced earlier this week they are actually not in guidance yet, because they have not been closed. We expect them all to close in the second half of the year. And based on what Vicente indicated the LOIs and what's in the funnel again the annualized impact of those deals as well as the one we just announced, again, we would expect to get to 400 to 500 basis points on an annualized basis. So we actually see that whether you want to look at the in-year impact of revenue, the annualized impact of what we expect to be able to purchase this year all of us -- all of those lead to the 400 to 500 basis points whichever way you want to look at it, which is actually setting us up nicely here, if I'd say, the M&A impact to revenue as we go into 2023. So again, I think, Joe depending on how you want to look at it, it actually probably leads to the same answer, but I just want to make sure we understand that the three deals announced here earlier this week, they're technically not in guidance yet and they won't be until we actually close the deals. Joe O'Dea: Understood. And then circling back on the ITS Asia Pac orders and up low double-digits China mid-20s rest of Asia. Can you talk a little bit about the degree to which you have insight into outperformance in the market? Some of what's driving the growth that you're seeing in the region there? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, I mean, according to the teams there's actually not a third-party report in Asia Pacific or in China, but you can do a lot of triangulation. And yes, I mean, according to our teams, we continue to outperform what we see in terms of our peers from a compressor perspective I say. And I think also the team continue to leverage really well the technology that we have around vacuums and blowers and really expanding that penetration in the market where our market share is today fairly small. So we have a very big great opportunity to accelerate that. And the last piece, I'll say Joe is that our team in the Asia-Pacific, the ITS team has been incredibly agile in terms of being able to take the technology that we have in our kind of pilot of old technologies compares well as vacuums and really move pretty quickly to create applications to those areas where they're seeing kind of the good areas of growth momentum. So I think this is something that I would say, still is kind of not that well understood externally, but the fact that we have these kind of great technologies that you can make them applicable to the end markets and to the growth trends that you have. It is something that is unique to what we have in our portfolio. And that has been pretty well executed by our team here in Asia Pacific and in other regions, but particularly China, the team has done a phenomenal job, just to execute into that strategic aspect. Joe O'Dea: Got it. Thanks very much. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Reynal. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Paul. I'd like to say a few things here at the end. I just want to say that, I'm very proud and we're all very proud of the work our teams have done over the second quarter and the first half of 2022. I mean, in terms of performance and navigating in this challenging macro environment, you can see that, Ingersoll Rand continues to be very financially strong, operationally fit and our business is quite resilient. And more important, our culture of agility and ownership, I mean while leveraging IRX is the essential piece to our continued momentum. And we importantly want to highlight that we continue to build a stronger team for long-lasting performance. And with that, we're super excited about the announcements of Mark Stevenson and Michael Stubblefield to the Board -- adding them to the Board. I know, both will add incredible value, as we continue to transform our company. So with that, I just want to say thank you for your continued support and look forward to speaking with many of you here soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to our host, Matthew Fort with Ingersoll Rand. Please go ahead, Matthew. Matthew Fort : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will be referencing these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before I start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call.  Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a strategy update, review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to 2022 guidance. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin with a big thank you to our employees worldwide for their hard work in helping us deliver another record quarter in Q3. You consistently exemplify our purpose and think and act like owners to deliver on our customer needs. Every day, I am impressed with how you're leveraging our IRX process to outperform in a continuously challenging environment. Our performance this quarter and year-to-date reinforces the impact we have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. And now let's review how we accomplished these results on Slide 3. Our achievement is reflected in the numbers and also in our commitment to Lead Sustainably. We continue to position Ingersoll Rand for long-term value creation through industry-leading innovation that offers intrinsically sustainable benefits to our customers. Through Q3, demand remained strong. And while macroeconomic, geopolitical and supply chain uncertainties continue to be a concern, we remain focused on what we can control while leveraging our strong balance sheet and operational mindset to execute on our commitments. Remaining agile in today's environment is critical, and you will see today how we continue to accelerate organic growth through demand generation and product execution. In addition, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, which is focused on inorganic growth through bolt-on acquisitions. Today, we're highlighting 6 new companies we have recently acquired or have under contract that will strengthen our position in core categories and broaden our exposure to high-growth, sustainable end markets. Turning to Slide 4. Today, we will discuss 4 critical elements of our compounded model to demonstrate how we stay focused on controlling what we can control. Moving to Slide 5, we have some exciting news to share. We recently earned a score of 81 on the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. As of October 21, this score puts us at #1 in North America, #4 in the world and in the 99th percentile within our industry, which is very impressive. And think about it, less than 3 years ago, we were not even showing on the list. And today, we are #1 in our industry in North America. We continue to align our portfolio to sustainable, high-growth end markets supported by megatrends. In September, we hosted our second Annual Sustainability Call where we introduced our enhanced strategic imperative, Lead Sustainably, which is based on a simple two-pronged approach on grow sustainably and operate sustainably. On this slide, I'll spend a bit highlighting 2 examples from our broad product portfolio that help improve energy efficiency and reduce water consumption. We believe that within the U.S. alone, there are over $1.3 billion in cost savings opportunities for compressed air system. And that number is likely 5x greater globally. The energy recovery unit shown here is an innovative device that captures up to 94% of the heat generated during air compression and uses it to warm water that can be used in other processes or for space heating, with a payback period for our customers of less than 1 year on average. Our impact on water conservation occurs in multiple ways, but perhaps the most compelling is our products that eliminate the need for water usage in critical applications. The Runtech turbo blower technology is a perfect example. This blower technology is used by leading pulp and paper manufacturers, and it replaces an alternative technology that requires a fresh water supply. Our existing installed base around the world is currently saving 7.5 billion gallons of water a year. And we estimate that over 50 billion gallons of water per year could be potentially saved with the full adoption of our Runtech technology globally. To put that into perspective, that's more than 3x the amount of bottled water consumed in the United States annually. Within our own facilities, operate sustainably is an integral part of our business. We focus on reducing electricity and water consumption to drive zero greenhouse gas emissions. Our commitment to operating sustainably delivers value for our stakeholders and our planet, creates a sense of purpose and inspiration for employees and has a positive impact on the communities in which we operate. This commitment also makes Ingersoll Rand a supplier of choice for our customers. Together, we're building a better future and planet by leading sustainable actions within our business, with our suppliers and in our communities. Turning to Slide 6. Let us demonstrate 2 simple examples on how we continue to control what we can control to deliver organic growth. On the left, we have an example of demand generation execution in Europe, which clearly has been a challenging market. In Q1, at the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, we saw a downward trend of marketing qualified leads or MQLs. The demand generation team immediately jumped into action, leveraging IRX to invert that trend through channel campaigns focused on high-growth, sustainable markets, vertical-specific and energy-efficient-related webinars and utilizing trend data to remain agile and revise all targeted campaigns. As a result of these actions, we saw a 60% increase in MQL, which is our primary leading indicator for orders. And as you can see from our results, orders in Mainland Europe continue to remain healthy and grew in the low single digits, excluding FX, for our compressor portfolio in ITS. On the right is an example of an outstanding product line execution in China. Prior to the merger, Gardner Denver had a solid compressor portfolio for the China market, but did not have the right sales structure or operational footprint. Post merger and leveraging IRX, the team refreshed the product line, integrating the best practices from both IR and GD. Through the new product development process, they improved efficiency by 5% to 10% and also improved the cost structure of the compressor portfolio through utilization of i2V. With those improvements in efficiency and cost structure, we focused on fast-growing small- to medium-sized customers and expanded the Gardner Denver channel over 200%, separate from the legacy IR channel. The end result is triple-digit growth in revenue and unit volume in a highly competitive market. Turning to Slide 7. Since our Q2 earnings call, we announced the signing of 6 bolt-on acquisitions that enable us to increase value across ecosystems by expanding our core mission-critical flow creation technologies while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies. So let me quickly walk you through these deals. First, Airmax, which is a leading full-service provider of air compressors and compressed air system services based in France. This is an example of a strategic channel expansion for our ITS segment which will leverage Airmax' strong end-user relationship and technician network to convert competitive products and support aftermarket growth. Second is Pedro Gil, a leading Spanish manufacturer of blower and vacuum systems. This acquisition strengthens our position in core blower and vacuum categories in high-growth, sustainable markets, including water and wastewater. Next is Everest, which is a leading Indian manufacturer of blower and vacuum systems. Everest significantly broadens our presence in the key high-growth market of India. These 3 acquisitions are strongly aligned with our strategy and increase our product portfolio in core technologies or enabling expansion into close adjacencies. Continuing on Page 8, moving from left to right of the page. These are great examples of close adjacencies with immediate synergies. The SPX FLOW Air Treatment business is a leading manufacturer of desiccant and refrigerated dryers, filtration systems and purifiers for compressed air. These products are highly complementary to our portfolio since more than 75% of compressors need one of these air treatment solutions. And in addition, they generate strong recurring aftermarket business. Next, Dosatron International, which is a U.S. leader in water-powered flow solutions and IIoT for hydroponics and agriculture markets, which improves our capabilities in several high-growth, sustainable end markets through differentiated digital controls and IIoT solutions. And finally, Westwood Technical, which is a highly experienced control, instrumentation and IIoT specialist, with technology that is complementary to our YZ Systems product line. Westwood enhances our IIoT platform, including innovative, Low Power Wide Area Networking technology. We expect the team to integrate these acquisitions at the regional level by utilizing IRX and our proven model of integration excellence that you have seen in prior acquisitions. Our M&A funnel remains strong. And as of today, the funnel still remains over 5x larger than it was in Q3 of 2020. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide update on our Q3 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks, Vicente. on Slide 9, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q3, with a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX, despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. We remain on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment in cost synergies from the merger. And as we have indicated many times, we have a funnel that stands in excess of $350 million and we are ready to take incremental actions, if warranted by macroeconomic conditions and market activity. Total company orders and revenue increased 10% and 14% year-over-year, respectively. We saw strong double-digit organic revenue growth in both ITS and PST at 19% and 15%, respectively. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.09 turns for the quarter, and we remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 40% year-over-year. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $376 million, a 20% year-over-year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.8%, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 160 basis point improvement sequentially from Q2. Free cash flow for the quarter was $253 million despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to global supply chain challenges as well as the need to support backlog. And total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end was up approximately $200 million sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve and is at 1.0 turns, which is 0.1 turns better than the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 10. For the total company, Q3 orders grew 18% and revenue increased 22%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 20% from the prior year. And the ITS segment margin increased 70 basis points, while the PST segment margin declined 60 basis points, driven primarily by the impact of prior year acquisitions as well as the impact of prior year COVID-19-related demand. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST adjusted EBITDA margin actually increased by 60 basis points. And we did see a significant sequential increase in PST's adjusted EBITDA margins, which were up 230 basis points versus Q2. And now PST margins are generally back in line with where we have seen them historically at approximately 30%. It's important to note that both segments remain price cost positive in terms of dollars, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. And finally, corporate costs came in at $30 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 9% to $0.62 per share. The tax rate for the quarter was 21.7%, and we anticipate the full year being in the low 20s as well. Moving to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $253 million despite $69 million of inventory headwinds primarily to support backlog. CapEx during the quarter totaled $22 million. And leverage for the quarter was 1.0 turns, which was an 0.1 turn sequential improvement. Total liquidity now stands at $2.6 billion based on approximately $1.5 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $4 million for share repurchases and $8 million to our dividend payment. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash as we look forward. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment performance. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 19%, split evenly between price and volume. Adjusted EBITDA rose 15% year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.2%, up 70 basis points from prior year, with an incremental margin of 32%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 80 basis points from Q2 to Q3. Organic orders were up 16%, with a strong book-to-bill of 1.13 turns. And note that on a 2-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew approximately 50%, which is in line with the Q2 2022 2-year stack, meaning that thus far, we continue to see strong demand for our products. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which was a 7% headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue. Starting with compressors. We saw orders up in the high double digits. And a further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products grew 20% and oil-lubricated products grew in the mid-teens. The Americas team delivered solid performance with orders in North America up high 20s while Latin America was up mid-30s. In Mainland Europe, orders remained strong with growth in the low single digits, while India and the Middle East were up high double digits. The Asia Pacific team delivered orders growth in the high single digits driven by low single-digit growth in China and low 30s percent growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In vacuum and blower, orders were up low 20s on a global basis. The global Power Tools and Lifting team continues their strong performance, with orders for the total business growing in the high double digits. Moving to the sustainable innovation and action portion of the slide, we're highlighting the relaunch of our Buffalo, New York facility. The reopening of this site has not only localized manufacturing and reduced customer lead times, but it has also expanded our global capacity for air and gas centrifugal products in high-growth, sustainable end markets such as clean energy. Doing large part of research and activities, orders are up over 500% in the Americas, with over $40 million booked since our May 2022 launch. This is a real tangible and very inspirational example of our employees thinking and acting like owners. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 15% organically, split evenly between price and volume. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $92 million, which was up 22% year-over-year, with incremental margins of 27%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.1%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. As illustrated in the table on the bottom left side of the page, the decline year-over-year in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven by the impact of prior year acquisitions at 120 basis points and the impact of prior year COVID-19-related demand at 60 basis points. However, sequential adjusted EBITDA margin significantly improved by 230 basis points due to operational execution and price/cost performance. Organic orders were up 3% year-over-year as Q3 comps were impacted by headwinds from prior year comp-related demand, primarily in the Thomas business. Adjusting for the COVID-related orders, normalized organic orders were up approximately 8%. On a 2-year stack, organic orders are up 27%, which is higher than a 2-year stack from Q2. From our PST sustainable innovation in action, we're highlighting Air Dimensions. This recently acquired business is a market leader in diaphragm vacuum pumps serving mission-critical environmental applications in sustainable end markets such as clean energy. Since the Q4 of 2021 acquisition, the team has installed and leveraged IRX to accelerate investments in new product development and launched a higher-pressure offering, securing orders from 4 major OEMs and system integrators. As a result, the business is seeing revenue growth of low double digits and has improved adjusted EBITDA margin from the mid-50s to low 60s in less than 3 quarters post acquisition. This is a great example of how we leverage our compounded model through the power of IRX to achieve double-digit earnings growth. Moving to Slide 14. In terms of 2022 guidance, given the ongoing strength in commercial and operational performance, we are raising our organic revenue guidance from the total company to 12% to 14%, 100 basis point increase from prior guidance based on both our ITS and PST segments. The organic growth increase is offset by the negative impact of FX, which is expected to now contribute headwinds of approximately 6% compared to a headwind of 5% in the prior guidance. For the full year, we are reaffirming our 2022 revenue guidance at 11% to 13% total growth. We are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance at the midpoint by tightening the range to between $1.4 billion and $1.425 billion. Important to note that this guidance includes nearly $20 million of adjusted EBITDA headwinds from FX when compared to our prior guidance. Due to investments in inventory to meet growing demand, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be approximately 90% for the year. Even with this change, free cash flow margins are expected to be in the mid-teens. And we expect free cash flow conversion to return back to 100% as we think about 2023 and beyond. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20s and CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter. Our M&A guidance does include the acquisitions of Hanye, Holtec, Hydro Prokav, Westwood Tech, Pedro Gil, Dosatron and Airmax. However, overall M&A revenue guidance for the year remains flat to prior guidance due to the impact of FX, specifically on previously acquired businesses, with Seepex and Maximus seeing the largest effect. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a strong position. We delivered strong results in the first 3 quarters of 2022, and our full year outlook remains optimistic. We're keeping a close eye on the dynamic market conditions while we remain agile and prepared for any challenges that may come. To ensure consistent delivery of our commitments, we will continue to leverage IRX across every facet of our business. To our employees, I want to again thank you for your ongoing engagement and for making thoughtful, action-oriented decisions like the owners you are. This continues to drive our ability to make life better for our customers, our planet and our stockholders. It is also exciting that our most recent survey on employee engagement continues to show improvement, which demonstrates the rapid changes we continue to drive are very welcomed by our employees. Our balance sheet is strong, and with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market outperformance. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike Halloran : Two questions here. First question, obviously, the orders trends are really healthy and pretty impressive considering the backdrop here. Maybe just talk a little bit about the volume trends you saw through the quarter. Anything notable? Any areas of weakness? And when you look at those leading indicators that you talk to, any signs of concern in there? Or do you think there's just a lot going on that is unique to Ingersoll Rand that allows you to be able to continue a pretty healthy clip going forward on the order side? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Mike, I'll say nothing that I will classify as major significance up or down. I mean very good, stable, robust across the portfolio or the regions, the segments. Clearly, as we kind of highlighted here on the earnings call, it's a lot of that has to do with controlling what we can control. And clearly, our demand generation, it's a great example here that we're showing some proof points in terms of how that is helping us overcome any market dynamics that we see out there. Clearly, aftermarket continues and services continue to be a very important piece of our equation. And then -- so I think it's just continue the teams driving the initiatives that we have in place. Mike Halloran : And I heard Vik's comments about if things change, you have the ability to leverage into some of those synergies to drive some upside to the range. And I know, Vicente, you've got a history of being able to act quickly if the environment changes. And so I guess what I'm just wondering is, what kind of things are you guys looking for to be able to pull that trigger in a more real-time basis? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Mike, as you could expect, we're quick and pretty agile and nimble in taking action. And a lot of that has to do with the proper planning that we have in place. So we already have several downplay scenario playbooks that we have with the team that, as we cannot look at the demand and we see that order patterns, if those materialize in terms of reduction or decrease, we will definitely take immediate action. So I think it's just one of those that we continue to look at, the leading indicators, the MQLs, the order rates, and we're ready to pull the trigger. I mean if you can think about it, one example of this is that over the past couple of years, as we integrated the two large companies, Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand during a period of -- in the middle of pandemic, we didn't do much on footprint. And footprint could be another area of continued expanding our synergy creation here from the merger of the two companies. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question on the very short term. I know you get asked this hundreds of times in the last few months, but help us understand that fourth quarter EBITDA ramp one more time. I think it implies sequentially, sales are down slightly and then EBITDA is up about $20 million sequentially even with a wider sort of corporate cost. So maybe just help us understand between the 2 segments how those earnings are moving up sequentially. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Julian, I think the way to think about it sequentially, think about revenue to be kind of fairly, on an absolute dollar basis, consistent, maybe slightly up Q4 compared to Q3. And this implies kind of on a year-over-year, the organic growth is going to be in the top end of the organic growth guidance, kind of mid-teens growth versus what you saw here in the third quarter. Fairly similar, slightly above. But FX continue to be a headwind of an additional 100 to 150 basis points. And M&A roughly 200 basis points lower than Q3 as some of the M&A falls off and we move through the fourth quarter. So when you put all this together, kind of comparing to the total company from an EBITDA perspective, and this is fairly similar, I would say, in the segment level, is that you would continue to see improved price realization Q3 to Q4, given the actions that we have already taken and inflation staying flat, I mean relatively flat to Q2 exit level. So again, we expect to see a moderate improvement as we go quarter-to-quarter. M&A synergy realization for the deals we closed in the second half of 2021, particularly PST, we'll continue to see some acceleration on that as we kind of move ahead. And also don't forget that we still have roughly -- in the year, we had about roughly $50 million of the merger-related synergies that tend to correlate to volume. So again, we'll see some of that here in the fourth quarter. So those are kind of the 3 core variables that allows us to, to your point, with a prudent revenue being roughly consistent Q3 to Q4, we still see improvement in the EBITDA even though we're getting a big headwind on the FX. So again, it just speaks loudly to what the teams continue to execute really well despite a lot of headwind that we continue to see. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And then maybe just my quick follow-up. There's a massive good color on IT&S orders and sales by region. Maybe then to focus on PST, how you're thinking about the sort of organic orders trajectory there. They were up kind of low single digit for a couple of quarters in a row. Understood the COVID headwind. So maybe how do we think about orders next few quarters in PST play out? Vicente Reynal : Sure, Julian. I think you said it well in terms of kind of reflecting here in the Q3 and Q2 ex COVID impact that we saw from these kind of large orders into 2021 not happening now. When you exclude that, PST was -- in the Q3 was up 8%, which we view as relatively healthy and in line with our stated Investor Day targets of growing PST in the mid-single-digit plus range. As we continue to move forward over the next few quarters, we expect that the teams will continue to deliver that kind -- in that kind of range as we move forward. Julian Mitchell : Got it. And the COVID headwind kind of drops out as we enter '23. Vicente Reynal : Yes. That's right. I mean there's a -- yes, it was mostly noted Q2 and Q3. A little bit here in the fourth quarter, but more -- I mean, less significant. And obviously, as you're going to 2023, there's definitely nothing. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So just starting off, I guess, Vicente, thinking about ITS, the order strength has been notable throughout the year. I guess it might be too early to think about the 2023 framework, but I'm curious, do you have any preliminary thoughts on growth, particularly in ITS? And then also, pricing has been very strong. Maybe some comments around the carryforward in pricing and how to think about that for '23. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe. So as we think about 2023, and clearly we're not going to provide kind of a detailed guidance here on this call on 2023. But a couple of items to consider, is that from a revenue perspective, I mean we had a very strong book-to-bill in Q3 over 1, and particularly much even stronger in the ITS. And so again, we continue to build more backlog. We built more backlog in Q3 as compared to the second quarter, even though obviously we had increased revenue output. So heading into 2023, we're very pleased that we're going to have much more backlog than we have ever historically had. And I think a lot of that has to do with how we have continued to align to the megatrends that we spoke about, around sustainability, digitization, that those are kind of gathering very good momentum. And it is then what will allow us, as we continue to move forward, perhaps continue to deliver or outdeliver the commitment that we said that the ITS segment can continue to grow at this kind of organically mid-single digit over the horizon and the period that we committed to. I mean in terms of price, we said that even in any market we can generate at least 1% to 2% of price regardless of the market conditions. And again, that's just because of the nature of our product being so mission-critical. So as we kind of go into 2023, you expect that we'll definitely continue to generate some of that new price as well as carryover, that will definitely a plan to carryover that will be much higher than the 1% to 2% of price. But I think the good thing that -- is that as we think about 2023 is that inflation seems to be fairly stable or stabilizing, which when that starts turning more favorable or kind of inflation decreasing, we're holding the price. So I expect that, that continue to drive continued margin expansion. And that we recognize that as we move forward, we'll continue to see also very good momentum on the integration of the M&As that we're doing here. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's super helpful. And then if I -- maybe one question for Vik. You saw that this quarter, you guys had a $33 million LIFO adjustment. I think last year, it happened in the fourth quarter. Can you just maybe just provide some context around the timing of the adjustments? Like what to kind of expect that -- I guess maybe there aren't any surprises kind of like going forward in that regard. Vik Kini : Yes. Sure, Joe. I'll take that one real quick. So just kind of just high level, first and foremost, one, the LIFO adjustment, it's a noncash adjustment. It's done, frankly, more so for book or really tax purposes. We do state our books each quarter on a FIFO basis, which we believe is a more accurate assessment of our true operating performance. And as such, we do adjust out the LIFO reserve adjustment from our non-GAAP results. It's also worth noting, as you indicated, this is 100% consistent with our historic practice. You saw in Q4 2021, we did exactly the same thing. And in fact, the dollar impact was, interestingly enough, almost exactly the same amount. Now with regards to the timing, and I'd say really much more in line with accounting requirements, we do monitor materiality on a quarterly basis to determine when the adjustment should be made. And obviously, it was deemed that just given the inflationary dynamics that we've seen that it was appropriate to make that adjustment here in Q3 of 2022. So again, I would say not being inconsistent with what you've seen historic. It's just the facts and circumstances here that have dictated that we take the adjustment here in Q3. And it's also worth noting, obviously, that our guidance, the way we report all of our non-GAAP financial metrics, whether it be adjusted EPS or adjusted EBITDA, 100% consistent. So whether it's the adjusted EBITDA number you saw or the $0.62 of adjusted EPS, that excludes that impact, but that's 100% consistent with how we've guided and how we've historically reported. Operator : Our next question comes from [Bastian Sosa Marin] with Wolfe Research. Unidentified Analyst : So congratulations on the quarter. I was just curious and I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the LIFO reserve. Maybe you could shed a little bit more color on why it was so large. And are you seeing any add-backs on Q4? And if you can, something about the future of inflation. Vik Kini : Yes. I'll keep it pretty short here. I mean the LIFO reserve adjustment is obviously correlated to the inflationary levels that we have been seeing in the market. And as you would expect, given where inflation has continued to trend, whether it be last year or this year, you're obviously seeing the impact commensurate there. So again, I would tell you, it's reflective of the current operating environment that we're in. It's not being, quite frankly, more than that. But I think that's quite frankly the easy direct answer there. And then I'll reiterate kind of what I've said before, our practice with regards to stating our non-GAAP metrics is 100% consistent. And as such, that's what you've seen us report, whether it be -- whether it's our guidance or our actuals or our comparatives on a year-over-year basis. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up question would be about orders in compressors. So you had a low 30% order book in the Americas, while Europe and China were more middle single digits and high single digits. Could you maybe shed a little bit of light on your marketing qualified lead and how do they stack up against softer orders in Europe? And maybe if you could shed a little bit of light on what's the pipeline of MQL conversion order looks like? Vicente Reynal : Yes. In terms of the MQL, I mean you saw on one of the slides, we provided a little bit of color in terms of that increase in MQLs that we saw particularly in Europe, again, driven to the activities that the team have been doing. And as you saw, I mean over 60% increase in MQLs. It does take time to convert those leads. What we typically say is that it's anywhere between 6 to 8 weeks to go from the marketing qualified lead to the sales qualified lead that kind of generates the order. And to your point, I mean, there's a percentage of conversion rate. We don't really actually talk about that externally because, obviously, we think that this whole system that we have is really strategic and proprietary to us, which is very exciting what we have been able to build here together internally. But again, I think the exciting piece is that whether you look at it by region or by product line, MQLs continue to be stable, if not continue to look a bit upward momentum, as we kind of go into here in the fourth quarter. So... Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Vicente, it seems like a relatively difficult time to get M&A done given the volatility of the markets, but you've obviously been able to maintain or even step up your M&A activity. I know you mentioned your funnel is still 5x larger. Could you talk about the sustainability of your recent made momentum? Obviously, you announced some larger deals pretty recently. So just talk about sort of what you're seeing out there. Vicente Reynal : Sure, Andy. I will say that we continue to see pretty good momentum and activity on the M&A. And again, I think we have said it before, which is that a lot of our M&A, call it 90% of that, it is sole sourced, meaning that we are proactively going to the owners and cultivate that relationship in order to execute the M&A at the right moment in time. And I think what you saw here in a lot of these deals is exactly that. I mean think about even Everest, that vacuum and blower Indian manufacturer, I mean that has been a relationship cultivation of over 2 years. And clearly now is the right time to move on and transition mutually from the ownership of the family to even also us. So I think we continue to leverage a lot of our processes. I mean as you can imagine, we're utilizing IRX processes as a way to drive M&A through the funnel and increase the velocity.  So I would say that we still see continued demand. We still see that there's a lot of companies that we're also walking away from. So in the same amount that you see deals that we're transacting, I mean we're walking away from a very, very large number of deals and transactions. So over 80 companies that we have said no to over the past kind of couple of quarters. So you can -- that tells you a lot of the kind of velocity and movement that we see in the M&A funnel. But again, yes, we're excited that, as you said, over 5x the funnel size and still already 8 LOIs currently on negotiation in addition to, obviously, the transactions that we have announced. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. And Vicente, maybe give us a little more color regarding what you're seeing in China. Order growth looks like it maybe decelerated a bit in China in Q3 versus Q2. I think it was up low double digits pre last quarter and up low single digits this quarter. What's your visibility like there? I know you've done a lot of work there. The RMT has helped you. So what's your visibility there going into Q4 and into 2023? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I would say, Andy, that we still see fairly stable demand, I mean even as we kind of go here into the month of October. October on a year-over-year basis, actually, from a percentage perspective ex FX, even accelerated from the numbers that we posted here in Q3. So again is we continue to see good, stable demand. And I think important to note that Q3 of 2021, I mean this is the time when the -- when China, we were seeing really a 50% type of growth number. So again, it's a bit of a tough comp. But still, even the team was able to deliver a 2-year stack that is really impressive and see that continued momentum as we go here into the fourth quarter. And as you pointed out, a lot of that very important self-help. We show the example of compressors. But you can imagine that vacuums and blowers is very similar story that the team is driving and doing, localizing products, making it more for -- in the market for the market and then leveraging the commercial footprint to execute with the help of IRX. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Rob Wertheimer : So my question is really on Europe. You obviously used IRX to offset some choppiness in the European markets. And it's really just the fundamental question again about the rising need for energy efficiency in Europe as energy prices have gone way up versus the obvious potential hesitancy on spending CapEx. So aside from what you've done there, do you see customers coming to you with a need for energy efficiency? Do you see them being hesitant? How would you characterize the market? Vicente Reynal : Absolutely, Rob. That's definitely one of the core fundamental things that is definitely happening in Europe is that, clearly, natural gas prices, and you've seen a little bit of a drop here or dramatic growth of natural gas prices, but it takes time to digest that also through the system. But yes, long term, yes, I mean, we see that continue rising energy in Europe, but also in other places of the world as a way for us to drive that return on that invested capital to be very, very palatable when you think about generating less than 1-year payback when you buy a compressor. And not only a quick payback, but also you're doing something good for the planet because you're saving the energy and helping these customers achieve their sustainability targets. Rob Wertheimer : And so do you think that Europe is getting worse or better on the underlying demand dynamics through the quarter and into 4Q? And I'll stop there. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Rob, in terms of what we saw in the third quarter, again, fairly stable. But the stability comes in really driven by, I would say, a good loan cycle CapEx kind of getting released. And that is in the sense of, again, related to sustainability, relating to energy transition activities. A lot of the things that we've been talking about in terms of getting ourselves aligned to these megatrends of sustainability and even digitization. I mean the team continues to do a very good job on driving that service and aftermarket capability in Europe. And as we kind of look into the -- into here into October, again, we still see FX-adjusted positive growth in the month of October from an orders perspective in Europe particularly, to your question. Yes, sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Brandon McCann : This is Brandon on for Josh. Just two follow-ups on some of the questions that have already been asked. But first on the MQLs. When you turn to this MQL process in places like Europe where demand may be slowing, does that come with some sort of margin impact versus the more typical order process? Vicente Reynal : Brandon, the cost of customer acquisition for MQL is really low. So I would say, think about it as even perhaps it might be a margin accretion or margin improvement because we're not sending the sales guy to knock on doors and we're doing all this kind of digitally. And so we're really increasing and enhancing the efficiency. So if anything else, I'll say that we -- because we're more prone to specifically put products with a higher margin through the MQL process, it's actually good news that you see a total average margin improvement. Brandon McCann : Got it. And then just on M&A. With all the deals recently, how are you guys thinking about synergies for 2023 in what's been announced? Vik Kini : Yes. Brandon, I'll take that one. The way I would think about it here is, again, the framework with which we have done all these deals, and again I'll talk about it kind of in totality, you've kind of seen very much in line with historic practice. The pre-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple across effectively the suite that already you've seen us do has kind of been in that low double-digit-type range. We typically are able to drive anywhere from some roughly 2 to 4 turns of EBITDA multiple purchase reduction as we think about a 3-year out view. And so whether you want to look at it from a purchase multiple perspective and the ability to reduce that through synergies or, alternately, the ROIC kind of calculus where everything we're doing is very much in line with kind of our stated return criteria, mid-teens ROIC or greater than our cost of capital, so again double-digit type returns, that's the way I would probably describe all of these. And as Vicente mentioned during the prepared comments, these are all core technologies or close adjacencies. They are technologies, businesses, companies we know very well. They are split nicely between the 2 segments and, interestingly enough, actually across the different geographies, which is great because the integration happens in the business. And I would tell you, right now, we don't see any reason why these won't be in line with the types of deals and the types of returns and the types of synergy profiles you've seen from our historic bolt-on acquisitions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : I'm going to ask a couple of questions. E-Max, the E-Max heat recovery device that you highlighted, you talked about that being $1.3 billion of potential cost savings for customers in the U.S., 5x that globally at less than a 1-year payback, which kind of implies that's more than a $5 billion revenue opportunity for Ingersoll Rand. Customers are typically looking for 2 years or less payback on those kinds of investments. What's the limiting factor to getting those out there? Like how do you think -- how do you view the rollout of something like that and the customer adoption for something like that? What do you have to do for education, marketing, those kinds of things, to get that product out into the market? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Nathan, I think I would say that, that is basically the, I'll call it, limiting factor or not. But this is why we think and why we believe the demand generation in terms of digitally educating customers in a better way more efficiently and more proactive, is the way to go even in industrial market space that we are today. So I think it's just a matter of continuing to educate customers. Customers see that technologies like this, what can drive for them. Clearly, you hear a lot about water heat pumps and other things in Europe. We think this is also another avenue of technology that can really help a lot of companies save energy, not only in this case, for how we do it on the heat recovery unit but in many other applications. So again, it's just one of those that -- it's just all about educating customers and customers seeing that they can grab that activity and implement it in their businesses. So -- but yes, you could imagine that we're leveraging -- as you can imagine, we're leveraging the demand generation team and a lot of our digital transformation activities towards educating customers on very unique innovations like this. Nathan Jones : And then my follow-up around the drying side of the business. I think it's pretty obvious you guys have decided that having the drying capability to go with compression is a strategic advantage for Ingersoll Rand with some of the acquisitions you've been making. Can you talk about why you think being able to supply both the drying and the compression is a strategic advantage and how you can leverage that in the marketplace? Vicente Reynal : Yes. So Nathan, in simple terms, the more you can actually optimize the total system versus optimizing or suboptimizing multiple systems separately, then you're better off. Meaning if you have a compressor that is attached to a dryer and you can actually work in a way to really optimize the 2 at the same time in an ongoing operating basis, that, I think, is a very winning proposition for us to drive that to the customer and then potentially create new revenue streams that could be very good for us. So again, it's just one of those that we believe that air treatments whether you design it or whether you're really utilizing the air treatment as a way to generate nitrogen or oxygen at point of use, it's a good thing for the customer, it's a good thing for the planet and it goes really well aligned with our just total holistic company strategy. Nathan Jones : Do customers see the value in you having that -- the dual capabilities? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Yes, yes. Because then again, you can -- when you sell it, you're talking to the customer about the best optimal solution between the 2 versus having a customer buy a compressor and then buying something else from someone else and the 2 of them have just not been optimized together. So the better optimization which then drives better -- yes. Operator : Those are all the questions we have for today. So I'll now hand back to Vicente for concluding remarks. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Thank you. Concluding, I just want to say that you have seen our culture continues to be a very unique differentiation and differentiation based on the performance that we're driving, and this is driven by our employees, which we pass on with a big thank you. I mean our employees continue to be highly engaged, and it's driven by a load of activity that we do internally in the company as well as this ownership mindset and thinking and acting like owners because all the employees are owners in the company. And we're very excited about what's ahead of us and continue to drive performance and be very transparent with all the investor community. So with that, thanks so much, and look forward to seeing many of you as we go into the road. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our conference call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference call over to our host Matthew Fort of Ingersoll. Matthew, please go ahead. Matthew Fort : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. I am Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation this morning and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everybody that certain statements on this call are forward looking in nature and subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide 2023 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to start by acknowledging and thanking our employees for their hard work in helping us deliver a record year in 2022. We finished the year on a high note, with strong fourth quarter and full year results despite ongoing inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain constraints and geopolitical uncertainty. Our employees consistently exemplify our purpose, while thinking and acting like owners to deliver on our commitment. And our performance this year clearly reinforces the impact we have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. Starting with Slide 3, in 2022, we demonstrated again how we continue to over deliver on our Investor Day commitments. We also made tremendous progress against our sustainability goals, but I'm very proud that Ingersoll Rand was named to the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index. As we look to 2023, demand remains solid. And while macroeconomic, geopolitical and global supply chain uncertainties continue to be at the top of everyone's mind, we will remain agile and focused on what we can control. IRX is our differentiator to fuel our performance and continue to execute on our commitments. Turning to Slide 4. During our last Investor Day, we highlighted how we delivered compounding results through our economic growth engine. We remain committed to our strategy and its success is evident, given the results outlined at the bottom of this page. Our portfolio is positioned to capitalize on global megatrends, [digitization] (ph), sustainability and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver mid-single digit organic growth through 2025. And as you can see, we outperformed this commitment again in 2022, delivering 16% year-over-year organic revenue growth. In 2022, we delivered 4% of in-year growth from M&A or 5% on an annual basis. The combined organic growth and inorganic growth of 22% [also surpassed] (ph) a low-double digit growth commitment. As we look to 2023 and beyond, we reaffirm our commitment to deliver total average growth of low-double digits through 2025. Our strong organic growth levers, aftermarket demand generation, as well as our i2V initiatives will enable us to generate operating leverage and incremental productivity with an expected 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement per year on average. With IRX as our competitive differentiator and over 300 IMPACT Daily Management, or IDMs, across our company each week, our high-performance culture encourages a strong focus on execution. This continues to support our goal of being a premier company that consistently compounds earnings on average by double digit each year. In 2022, we continued to achieve that goal with adjusted EPS growth of 13%. Moving to Slide 5. In 2022, we saw strong organic order and revenue growth of 11% and 16%, respectively. Aftermarket continues to be a strategic focus and we delivered growth of 17% excluding FX. Our 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was driven in part by improvement in our gross margin due to pricing, aftermarket revenue growth and i2V actions. As we continue to align our business to the mega growth trends, we formalized our IR-Digital team to accelerate how we create new revenue streams. It's important to note that this is an incremental investment we made in addition to the teams that reside at the business level. With 19% of our total revenues coming from IIoT-ready products, we have already exceeded our 2023 Investor Day targets. On the right side of the page is a great example of our ability to deliver organic growth by focusing on the sustainability and efficiency megatrend. We were selected to be a critical technology provider for what will be the largest carbon capture and storage project in the world when it comes online in 2024. With a capacity to permanently capture and store 12 million tons of carbon dioxide gas every year. This one project will deliver more than $14 million of value for Ingersoll Rand between 2023 and 2024. On Slide 6, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation trends. We invested over $800 million in 12 acquisitions in 2022, including the SPX Flow transaction with the annualized revenue from these acquisitions being approximately $300 million. These acquisitions have added both market-leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies. Our M&A funnel remains strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five times larger than it was at the time of the R&D. And more importantly, we currently have 11 transactions under LOI. We expect an additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. Finally, we started the year well with regards to executing on our inorganic strategy with the recently completed acquisition of Paragon Tank Truck, a leading provider of solutions used for loading and unloading dry bulk and liquid tanks in demanding industrial environments as well as food and beverage. Moving to Slide 7, we have some exciting news to share. We achieved placement on the DJSI World and DJSI North America Indices. Our score of 81 on the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment puts us at the Number One in North America and Number Four in the world within our industry, which means that we are in the top decile of global companies. This is a perfect example of how we leverage IRX for agile execution across all aspects of our business. In this case, we use our own IRX execution process to go from being unranked to now in the top 10% of all companies [revealed] (ph) by S&P Global. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 and full year 2022 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 8, we finished the year with strong performance in Q4 through a strong balance of commercial and operational execution, fueled by IRX despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 2% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up 30% year-over-year, equate over $2 billion of backlog. This provides a healthy backlog to execute on as we enter 2023 and gives us conviction in delivering our 2023 revenue guidance. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA $420 million, a 23% year-over-year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.9%, a 180 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 110 basis point improvement sequentially from Q3. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was up 6% versus prior year. This is despite some meaningful headwinds that I will explain shortly. Free cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to global supply chain challenges as well as the need to support backlog. Total liquidity of $2.7 billion at quarter-end was up approximately $100 million sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve year-over-year and sequentially. At 0.8 turns, we're 0.3 turns better than the prior year and 0.2 turns better than prior quarter. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q4 orders grew 5% and revenue increased 21%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 23% from the prior year, with the ITS segment margin increasing 170 basis points, while the PST segment margin improving 330 basis points. It's important to note that both segments are price/cost, dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at $33 million for the quarter. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 6% to $0.72 per share. This 6% growth includes significant headwinds associated with FX as well as favorability in the prior year tax rate due to one-time benefits that were not expected to recur and an ongoing headwind associated with interest expense. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, with the full year adjusted rate finishing slightly below 22%. On Slide 10, total company full year orders grew 16% and revenue increased 21%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 20% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 100 basis points, while the PST segment margin declined 70 basis points. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed largely in 2021, PST adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 60 basis points. As you recall, most of the decline in adjusted EBITDA margins throughout the year was due to the Seepex acquisition. I am pleased to report that Seepex is another amazing story where we acquired a business at mid-teens EBITDA margin and the exit rate in Q4, just five quarters after the acquisition, is in the mid-20%s. We are well underway to getting Seepex to our PST fleet average EBITDA margin. We continue to see sequential increases in PST's adjusted EBITDA margins and now PST margins are generally back in line with where we have seen them historically, at approximately 30%. Both segments, finished the year price/cost, dollar and margin positive, which was a major driver of the company's overall triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Corporate costs finished the year at $127 million, down $6 million from prior year, largely due to adjustments in management incentive costs. And lastly, adjusted EPS for the year was up 13% to $2.36 per share. It is important to note that the adjusted EPS growth includes significant one-time headwinds associated with FX, prior year tax rate and interest expense. If you exclude the impact of these headwinds, our adjusted EPS growth would have been over 20%. Moving to the next slide, in 2022, we returned $294 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Free cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, including CapEx, which totaled $34 million. And total company liquidity now stands at $2.7 billion, based on approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. It's important to note that these figures include approximately $525 million of cash, which has subsequently been deployed for the SPX Flow's Air Treatment business acquisition on January 3, 2023. Leverage for the quarter was 0.8 turns, which was 0.3 turn improvement year-over-year. And cash flow outflows for the quarter included a $184 million deployed to M&A, $8 million to our dividend payment and $3 million for share repurchases. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 22%, with volume growth outpacing growth from pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 170 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 38%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 4%. Note that on a two-year stack the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 20%. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of OpEx, which year-over-year was [67] (ph) percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low-single digits and we continue to see oil free products orders outpacing oil lubricated products. Orders were down mid-single digits in the Americas, driven by a large order push from Q4 to the first quarter of 2023. EMEIA demand continues to be above market, with orders up mid-single digits. The Asia-Pacific team continues to deliver great performance with orders growth in the mid-teens, which is impressive when you think about that our team in China delivered double digit growth even throughout the COVID-related closures and disruptions. In vacuum and blowers, orders were up low-20%s level. And the power tool and lifting global orders grew mid-single digits. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our footprint expansion in India, which is another organic investment initiatives we're drive. We have seen significant growth in India and we continue to drive opportunities for in region for region manufacturing, which is driving the need for increase in our footprint. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 9% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $93 million, which was up 20% year-over-year, with incremental margins of over 80%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.1%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see sequential improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margins driven by price/cost improvement and synergy delivery on our recently completed M&A, such as Seepex. Organic orders were down 2% year-over-year as Q4 comps were challenged due to headwinds from a single large hydrogen order intake in Q4 of 2021, which will deliver a network of refueling stations in New Zealand. Adjusting for these hydrogen order, normalized organic orders were up slightly. And on a two-year stack, organic orders are up double digits. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our EVO Electric Diaphragm Pump. This recently launched product is the only-electric triple-chamber diaphragm pump in the market. The EVO Series pump is utilizing high-growth end markets, such as electric vehicle batteries, specialty chemical manufacturing and food and beverage applications. This product offers significant energy savings, leading to faster payback times for our customers. And this is yet another perfect example of sustainability as a growth driver and our focus on high-growth sustainable end markets, enabling us to deliver double-digit earnings growth. As we move to Slide 14, we're introducing our 2023 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow between 7% to 9%, with the first half growth of 9% to 11% and the second half growth of 4% to 6%. We anticipate organic orders growth of 3% to 5%, where price is approximately 70% and volume 30%. FX is expected to contribute approximately 1% of a headwind for the year, of which the impact will primarily be realized in the first half of the year. M&A is projected at $270 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions in 2022 as well as the acquisition of SPX Flow Air Treatment and Paragon Tank Truck. Corporate costs are planned at $140 million and will be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year. The year-over-year increase is largely driven by investment in IIoT and demand generation. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.57 billion and $1.63 billion. At the bottom of the table, we're introducing adjusted EPS guidance. While we have not historically guided EPS, we will now include [these key] (ph) metrics moving forward. Adjusted EPS is projected to fall within the range of $2.48 and $2.58. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low-20%s, interest expense to be approximately $165 million and CapEx to be around 2% of revenue. The right hand side of the page includes a 2023 full year guidance bridge showing the growth associated with operational activity and the headwinds associated with interest expenses, FX and changes in the adjusted tax rate. Based on the above guidance, adjusted EPS growth attributed to operational performance, is approximately 13% to 17%, offset by approximately 8% in headwinds from interest expense, FX and the adjusted tax rate. As we sit here in mid-February and to provide some Q1 commentary, it is worth noting that we have seen organic orders continue to be positive on a quarter-to-date basis through the first week of February, which is consistent with our expectations. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a solid position. We finished 2022 with strong Q4 results. We continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions, while remaining agile and prepared for any challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you again for an excellent finish to the year. We delivered strong results by demonstrating our commitment to meet our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the strong use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focus actions. These results show the impact you have as owners of the company. Our balance sheet is strong. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation policy and strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market outperformance. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is now open. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Mike. Vik Kini : Good morning. Mike Halloran : Can we go through the first half-second half cadencing you're talking about? Obviously, FX gets a little more favorable in the back half of the year, but the growth rate is slowing. How much of that's organic versus just phasing of acquisitions? And then, is it just price? Is it an assumption on the macro environment being a little bit worse? Just kind of any puts and takes on how you think about the seasonal factors 1H versus 2H? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Hey, Mike. I'll say that facing comparable to what we have seen historically. Clearly, the item to watch is that, as expected, comps become more meaningful as we go into the back half of the year. And we don't have anything to assume in our guidance or the phasing related to supply chain returning to normalization and/or significant commodity deflation either. And so, in terms of the organic, I mean, second half, based on that and the tough comps, we say kind of roughly flattish. And as we said on the remarks, good continued momentum that we see on price. And what we expect is that we expect as we go through the year to see continued strength on kind of what we call the long cycle orders, which are driven by a lot of these megatrends that we've spoken about before in the past around sustainability, onshoring and things like that. So, net-net, that leads us to believe that we just don't see significant changes in our backlog as we go through 2023. Mike Halloran : So, you're essentially assuming a pretty normal sequential cadencing and not much change in the macro backdrop, if I interpret that correctly, Vicente? Vicente Reynal : That's correct. Yes, that's correct. And basically, as you can see, a bit of a prudency here in the second half. Mike Halloran : Yes. No, that helps. And then, on the M&A side, obviously, the backdrop has changed a little bit, not for you all. You guys seem to still see very high levels of success here. Maybe you could just talk about what the buyer's mentality is? Obviously, you've got a lot of deals you're working on, the LOIs are high. Have you seen a greater willingness by buyers to move forward and consummate some of these transactions? Has there been any change in that landscape at all? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Mike, I will say that the simple answer is, yes, in the sense that -- keep in mind, yes, we're seeing much stronger momentum as we talk to a lot of the sellers out there. And -- but it has to do primarily because keep in mind that 90%-plus of our deals and transactions are sole sourced. So, we have really long-standing cultivating relationships with the company that we're looking for to be attracted to Ingersoll Rand. And the relationship goes along the lines of understanding that, hey, you know, there continues to be all these changes that happen every year, and [how many] (ph) ownership is realizing that we are a great place for them to continue to kind of keep the legacy and treat employees in a very unique way the way we do. And that is driving the continued momentum of being able to open the door and have a much better conversation with a lot of these companies that we want to bring to Ingersoll Rand. So, again, I think that's what gives us the confidence that our M&A funnel continues to be very strong. And the fact that you see that we still have 11 transactions under LOI and the momentum continues to get accelerated. So, yes, we're very pleased with what we're seeing here. Mike Halloran : Thanks, Vicente. Appreciate it. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. We now have Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just... Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : ...the first question I wanted to start with -- good morning, just to start with the top-line outlook. And just to understand it, so it sounds like you think that, that backlog stays at about $2 billion through the year, a book to bill around 1 for the year as a whole. And then, within the second half, organic sales guide, you're assuming sort of volumes are down slightly, but that's solely a function of comps, it's not related to destocking or any particular region softening or anything like that? Vicente Reynal : Yes, that is absolutely correct, Julian. Yes, that's accurate. And again, we're saying that we're viewing these as -- perfect. No, I was going to add to that, Julian, as I said on the answer before too as well, we view these as a prudency right now at this stage, and, as you know, we'll continue to update as the year goes, kind of not to the similar to what we did here in 2022. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then, just on the thinking about the sort of the earnings seasonality, because I know in 2022, we spent the whole year, people fretting about the sort of Q3, Q4 ramp in EBITDA margins and the implied incrementals in the back half and all the rest of it. So, just to understand, for 2023, are you assuming kind of first half, second half EPS split? Is the consensus split roughly okay at sort of 45/55 and then anything you're kind of calling out year-on-year moving around much in the back half? Vik Kini : Yes. Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that. I think the answer is that, that's correct. I think the phasing of whether you want to talk about top-line or on the earnings side of the equation is very consistent with what you've seen historically. I think the margin implication on from an adjusted EBITDA perspective is, roughly speaking, close to 100 basis points on a total year basis for total company, which remains relatively consistent and right in line with what we messaged at our last Investor Day. So, again, nothing dramatically different there, but yes, the phasing is very much consistent with what you've seen in years past. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We now have Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead when you are ready. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Hey, just on the price/cost... Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just want to be clear, I think you said 70% of the organic growth guide was price, just confirming that. But the question is would that just be carryover price or are there other actions in flight for 2023? And maybe you could also just give us some perspective on just the total price/cost equation for 2023 embedded in the guide? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Jeff. So yes, correct. 70% price as we will -- we communicated. And the way to think about it is that on the price, a good portion of that is carryover. We're still doing another regular price increase, but it's that, that one is more normalized as we -- what we have done in the past, which call it maybe 1% to 2% incremental new price that gets realized throughout the year. So that gives you the perspective in terms of what we're seeing on price. And from a price/cost perspective, yes, we expect that we're going to be price/cost positive and report it throughout the year. And with that, we have a [so and so] (ph) -- that the cost side basically stays at this level. So, we're not assuming a major deflationary market. Jeff Sprague : And then, just maybe totally shifting gears, just thinking about some of the initiatives in the -- in particular the IIoT enabled initiative. To what extent are customers paying additional for that capacity? And to what extent, given the product actually has that capability, is it driving higher or kind of more profitable service or other revenue streams? Vicente Reynal : Yes, great question there, Jeff. So, the paying additional comes in from as you now referenced to [OEM] (ph), which is with the added services that we're offering. So, we are having a remotely connected device. We're able to have better service agreements with our customers and, therefore, that generates a higher recurrent revenue that -- streams that we see. So that's the whole purpose of why we want to have our IIoT ready and enable machines, because we want to generate new revenue streams that are more recurrent in nature on top of, obviously, selling the device. So, I think that's what we're seeing. And in terms of customers willing to pay for it, I'll say, yes, I mean, because today there's a lot of lack of skilled labor out there and customers are kind of more dependent on companies and OEMs like cost to be able to demonstrate the added benefits that we can have. So yes, I think it's just one of those that we see it as increased way to add services, increased way of adding energy efficiency. And net-net, it's a very quick return for the customers on what they pay. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Jeff. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead when you are ready. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Rob. Rob Wertheimer : So, I just wanted to go back to revenue outlook for -- yes, hey, the revenue outlook for a minute, where you have backlog up, I think, 30%, and organic growth [7%] (ph), covered by price up 3% to 5%. And so, I think you mentioned earlier, Vicente, that you're not assuming a whole lot of supply chain improvement in cost. Is the revenue still constrained by supply chain? If that loosens up, is there upside there? How do we sort of foot the backlog in the orders and the revenue outlook? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Rob, I mean, some constraint by supply chain, but also keep in mind too as well labor. So, I think as we kind of continue throughout the year and we continue to see better productivity, but it's really much more so on the prudency and why we say that backlog will stay at the current level as we continue to shift more towards our more normal phasing that we typically have. So, yes, some supply chain constraints, but the majority, I'll say, more of labor constraints to be able to bring more people to factories and be able to ship more. Rob Wertheimer : Okay, perfect. And then, I apologize if I missed in the prepared remarks, but ITS North America orders were kind of the only weak spot. Any additional color there? I don't know if you're seeing broad-based strength in small projects and large, or order [picking up] (ph) or if things are fading away? Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yes, thanks. That's a great question, Rob. We're seeing actually a very good momentum acceleration of what we call the long cycle orders, which are basically driving strong CapEx cycles that we see. And as we get into more projects related to the growth of like secular trends, so for example, onshoring, energy efficiency, cargo capture, we see more of that. And what that creates is maybe sometimes a little bit of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But when ITS, when you look at the ITS America, and it's something better to look at it first half to the second half, and you -- we actually saw acceleration organically going into the second half from -- compared to the first half. And that is because it's important to note that also ITS Americas in the third quarter, we had one of the biggest quarters that we can recollect for where book to bill was close to 1.2 back in Q3. So, again, I think we view it more from first half going into a second half. And what we saw was really order acceleration in the ITS Americas, which kind of gives us good confidence on continued kind of fundamental solid strength demand. And as we said also in the remarks, as we go into -- here into the 2023, we're seeing continued positive organic order momentum pretty much across all the regions, including the ITS Americans. Rob Wertheimer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We now have Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Nigel Coe : So, it seems like -- yes, good morning. You're talking about this hydrogen order in the prior year and order in North America slipping into 2023. So, it seems like we've got larger lumpier orders coming through, which given these mega project decarb-reassuring type projects, we should expect, I mean, do you agree with that -- particularly with that, that we will have lumpier orders sequentially from here? And my real question is, as we get larger orders, do we have comparable margins to -- on these larger orders versus sort of run rate? Vicente Reynal : So, to answer the first question, that's really yes. I mean, we think that we see a lot of these kind of mega projects that are getting a lot of the CapEx release. And yes, I mean -- and I can tell that historically, we have always said that these projects come in with pretty good margin to us well. And obviously, being large, so it will create a good flow-through as they kind of go in -- through the P&L. So, it's -- for us, it's good news that we're seeing the release of these CapEx projects. They're more long cycle, gives a better visibility. And at the same time, they're pretty well aligned with a lot of our secular growth trends that we're seeing around sustainability, energy efficiency, onshoring and the like. Nigel Coe : Okay. Yes, nothing wrong with lumpy as long as they can [contribute] (ph) to revenue. And then, I want to go on the service revenue growth. I think, you said 17% ex FX. Just so that implies, I don't know, mid-teens -- low mid-teens organic service growth, which is pretty good. So just wondering -- to come back to Jeff's question to what extent is the service growth being driven by, I don't know, some kind of deferred catch-up? Or are we seeing this IIoT enabled devices starting to contribute meaningfully to revenue growth? And any thoughts there would be helpful. Vicente Reynal : Yes. It is, I would say, it's more of the latter in some regards. As you remember, during our Investor Day, we spoke about our care packages and service agreements that we developed as they get related to our IIoT-related services. And we're definitely seeing very good acceleration of that driven by trends such as not been able -- customers not able to find the skilled labor that is needed in the factory to be able to service, repair and maintain compressors or other devices where we can provide that. And in addition to that, we can provide an energy efficiency as a guarantee, but energy efficiency reduction that the customer can have and visibly see in addition to other benefits. So, it is actually good news for us to see that good solid momentum and [indiscernible] teams are doing very well on that. Nigel Coe : Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks for the questions. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI. David Raso : Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to pick up on the orders so far in '23 commentary. Even excluding the hydrogen comp, PST orders were up 0.2%, basically flattish year-over-year, while the ITS obviously was up 3.6%. Are you saying the order growth has accelerated so far in '23, just to be clear? Vicente Reynal : Well, David, again, we're saying that the order momentum is actually positive across the two segments. So, yes, I mean, if you think about it from a percentage perspective, that is correct. David Raso : And the type of projects that you're getting, I just want to understand what's the pricing in these new orders versus what's in the backlog already? Just to get some sense of, assuming costs don't reaccelerate, what is the pricing dynamic in the new order book? Vik Kini : Yes, David, I would say to Vicente's remarks that orders in first quarter, quarter-to-date across both segments are trending positive on an organic basis. And within that, I would say the pricing dynamic, given the carryover pricing dynamic that Vicente mentioned, which, as you would expect, is more obviously evident in the first half of the year, comparatively speaking, I'd say it's comparable to what you have seen exiting 2022. So, nothing has dramatically changed in that respect. And I think to the question that was asked before, the margin profile is healthy on those projects, and the pricing levels on those projects are commensurate or comparable to what you see in some of the more standard book/ship type business. So, we've been seeing comparable margin performance and comparable pricing across both the shorter cycle and longer cycle components of our business. David Raso : All right. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We now have Steve Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead when you are ready. Steve Volkmann : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to go back to the supply chain. I was interested in your comments that you didn't project anything really improving through the year. But can you just give us the sort of current conditions? Because it seems like we're hearing sort of broadly the things are improving. So, I just wanted to kind of square those up. Vicente Reynal : Yes. I mean, so it is definitely improving as compared to last year. What we're saying is that -- but there's still some bottlenecks and issues that pop up here and there. So, it's not -- again, what we're saying is that it is not perfect. It is not back to normal conditions. And that what we foresee here as we go into 2023, whether it is with the reopening of China or a lot of the CapEx cycle releases that we're seeing in terms of long cycle, we think there's going to be continued constraints in the supply chain. So, these were just being more proactive in terms of kind of realizing that there's a lot of work that our teams need to continue to do and realizing that, hey, things are not going to be back to normal from a supply chain perspective as we go into the second half, based on a lot of these other kind of trends or indicators that we're seeing that are happening in there. Steve Volkmann : Okay. Great. And then, just Vik, anything -- I think you mentioned 100 basis points of EBITDA margin through the year. Anything to think about relative to the two segments or one versus the other? Vik Kini : Yes. It's a good question. So, yes, approximately 100 basis points enterprise-wide. You're going to see both segments trend right around there. I do think the PST probably is a little bit more outsized than ITS, probably not overly surprising, because you had a little bit of an inverse happening in 2022. So, I think a lot of this is now, quite frankly, as we've now got Seepex, which was probably the largest headwind on EBITDA margins through the better part of 2022, now that's coming closer to fleet average with, frankly, still room to run, I think you're going to see a little bit more outpace on the PST side comparatively speaking, but total business should be trending closer to 100 basis points. Steve Volkmann : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. We now have Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Josh. Vik Kini : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just wanted to dig into -- hey, good morning. Just wanted to dig into the complexion of what you're seeing on the compressor side or even maybe more broadly across [IT&S] (ph). You talked about some of the big drivers, Vincente, around things like nearshoring, kind of a broader CapEx cycle. I mean, we just haven't seen one of those in so long. I'm just wondering like are you seeing larger pieces of equipment, a lot more of what looks like capacity versus replacement. I know some of that detail, it can go missing in the numbers. But as you talk to customers, like are they adding roofline? Are they adding capacity? Or is this sort of an extended replacement cycle that has kind of been caused by all this post-COVID interruption? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Josh, I'll say that we're seeing a little bit of a good blend of both in terms of new rooftops as well as expanding even capacity. And just to put in perspective, I mean, it's not dissimilar to what we or Ingersoll Rand were doing ourselves. So, as you remember, last year, we reopened our Buffalo facility. So that was -- you could consider that as an expansion of capacity. We also invested in expanding our factory in Brazil. So that was actually you could think about an incremental rooftop. We just here announced our expansion of the footprint and creation of a new building facility in India, which is on top of our already four manufacturing facilities in India. So, I think it's -- and our customers are doing the same, and we're very close to the customers because we believe to be in region for region is the most strategic factor and uniqueness that we have as a company, and this goes back all the way from our Gardner Denver days that we were doing that. So again, we're seeing a lot of good momentum of that in region for region continuation because of onshoring not only in the US, but we're seeing it in India, we see it in China, we see it in Europe. And I think our ability to flex our products and our localization to that, it's driving that pretty good momentum, I would say. And from a technology perspective, to your question, we're seeing solid momentum and we said that on the prepared remarks on oil free, which again, is good news because we're moving more towards these kind of high-growth sustainable end markets food, beverage, pharma that -- where we can provide more unique solutions to those customers, and, therefore, see that accelerated growth. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on hydrogen, specifically. And I think there's a lot of stuff out there that's in discussion, maybe projects that are not quite ready to go FID, because there's [a norm] (ph) making clarity in the IRA that hasn't been established yet. But just wondering how you guys are thinking about the timing of when you could see another order wave there? And anything you're watching specifically that could help us track alongside that? Vicente Reynal : Sure, Josh. Maybe I'll see it -- kind of put it in two buckets. One is the -- on the PST side, where we make dispensing units, we're seeing better momentum on acceleration that we see here in Europe where more countries are leveraging hydrogen and so we expect to maybe see better momentum as we go here in 2023 in Europe. The early cycles of that PST hydrogen really happened more so in Asia Pacific. And we always said that, that was kind of the core start and then it was going to move to Europe and eventually gets to the US. And we're seeing that. Started in Asia Pacific, it's moving to Europe, and we're seeing conversations about dispensing hydrogen networks and things like that in the US, as you very well said, on the IRA budgetary commentary that we are read about. On the ITS, it's not too dissimilar. But I will say that the large capital investments that have been talked about in terms of hydrogen, we're not seeing that kind of come through fruition yet within the compressor side or the ITS side. So, we still think that there may be more room to come on that. And as you very well said, whether IRA or some of the other funds that are in Europe, hopefully, that kind of gets some of the projects getting released. But -- so good tailwinds we expect for a couple of years to come. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks for the color. I'll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. We now have Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on the backlog, and I think you said a little over $2 billion of backlog. But it sounds like the view would be that, that's more a normalized level, would be trending, I guess, a little bit over 30% of 2023 revenue. I'm guessing, historically, backlog hasn't been quite as strong relative to revenue. So, could you just talk about sort of what you're seeing sort of structurally within that, the confidence that we should be thinking about that as more of a normalized backlog level? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, I would say that normalized maybe right now here in 2023. As we go into 2024 and longer than that, we'll see. I mean, we expect that things will get back to the way they were before. Our view in terms of why we should continue to see backlog at this higher level is again because of a lot of these kind of long-cycle CapEx releases that we're seeing that, that should continue to add on to that backlog while we continue to see maybe solid fundamental growth on the short cycle as we have just also stated. So, I think it's not that the new norm is going to be that 30% or $2 billion. It's just that right now, at this point in 2023, that is basically what we're saying is that we're saying that we'll continue to -- our expectation is that we're not going to deplete the backlog based on what we see coming through for the rest of the year. Joe O'Dea: Okay. And then, just a clarification on the $200 million to $300 million of annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired. Of that, how much is included in the 2023 M&A revenue contribution? And does that amount include sort of all 11 of the LOIs that you currently have? Vik Kini : Yes, Joe, so let me take it in two pieces. So, the guidance -- if you go to the guidance slide, $270 million of M&A is included in the guide. That $270 million is for completed and/or closed acquisitions to date. So effectively, everything you've seen through 2022 that has any degree of carryover impact as well as probably the two bigger contributions being the SPX Flow Air Treatment business, which closed right at the beginning of the year, and then the Paragon Tank Truck acquisition, comparatively smaller but closed at the beginning of this month. That is all included. That's what comprises the $270 million. In terms of forward expectations, we do not include any non-closed transactions in guidance. So, the 11 additional transactions that you see at the LOI stage, that would be all incremental to current guidance if and when those transactions close. And like we've done, historically, as those transactions close, we'll obviously start including them in subsequent guidance. So, again, yes, non-completed or non-closed M&A would be additive to the current guidance for 2023. Joe O'Dea: Okay. And then -- but are those 11 included in the $200 million to $300 million that you're talking about acquiring over the course of 2023? Vik Kini : That is correct. Yes. So, I think, our [re-] (ph) kind of affirmation of the capital allocation strategy includes that we expect to close another $200 million to $300 million on an annualized basis. And obviously, that's just contingent on the timing in terms of what will actually impact 2023, but that is correct. Joe O'Dea: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : We now have Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open. Adam Farley : Good morning. This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Adam Farley : So, you performed very well in China in 2022, despite COVID headwinds. Could you provide some color on how you outperformed? And maybe what you expect in 2023 in China, specifically with reopening? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Adam, so I'll just say to that, a big thank you to our team in China and team in Asia Pacific, whom I was actually just having a celebratory call last night with them and kind of kicking off into high gear a lot of our initiatives in 2023. So, generally, I think our team continues to be pretty agile and nimble as to finding the growth vectors that are being seen in China, and they've taken our products and repositioned them and leveraging our demand generation to accelerate the penetration of those technologies into those very unique end markets. So, I think it's all about ensuring that our teams are very nimble and very agile and that's exactly what they're doing. I mean, they're finding these very good growth vectors and those could be around battery production, photovoltaic production as well for solar panels or even electric vehicle production. So -- and then they leverage the technology and the demand generation to be able to acquire just incremental market share. Adam Farley : Okay. And then, on the recent close of the SPX Flow Air Treatment business, could you provide any color on revenue or cost synergy opportunity, given that it's still early days of integration work? Vik Kini : Yes, sure, Adam. So, to repeat, we did close the SPX Flow transaction at January 3, at the beginning of this year. Using rough numbers, we can kind of expect something right around $180 million of revenue contribution, so slightly less than $200 million, and very much in line with a lot of the M&A you've seen us do historically. It's coming in right in that kind of mid-20%s type EBITDA margin range. And as we did say when we announced the transaction, we do see -- over a multiyear basis, we do see cost opportunities and synergy opportunities to drive that to be accretive to ITS segment margins in due course. So, again, we're about 45 days in, I would say, the integration process, as you would expect, using IRX and the whole IDM process to kind of guide the integration, it's going as well as we had expected, and things are very much tracking in line with [Technical Difficulty] started. And as you would expect, that's the single biggest contributor of the $270 million of M&A that's included within our guidance. Adam Farley : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Vik Kini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We now have Chris Snyder of UBS. Please go ahead when you are ready, Chris. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I want to follow up on some of the order trends. So, the book to bill is going from 0.91 in Q4 to an expected 1.0 in 2023. Should we expect an immediate jump back up to that 1.0 level in Q1, or will it take a couple of quarters to play out? And then what type of visibility do you have into orders as we go beyond Q1, maybe into the back half of '23? Thank you. Vik Kini : Yes. Sure, Chris. So, I guess, I'll start by saying, I think the way you described it is relatively accurate. Yes, we did see a little over 0.9 in Q4. Worth noting here, it's quite normal in the business to see book to bill less than 1 in the second half of the year, and particularly in Q4. And that's largely attributable to shipping the longer -- the larger, longer cycle orders during the second half. And you see that primarily in the ITS business. And that's exactly what we saw on Q4 as well as obviously the strong revenue performance. So that did drive the book to bill to be less than 1. But to Vicente's point and some of the commentary, we are seeing the order momentum continuing here in the first quarter, quarter-to-date through the first week in February. Orders -- organic orders performance is up. And it's worth noting, that's driven despite the headwind of the Chinese New Year timing, which is in January this year versus February in last year. So, again, continued to be encouraged by the trending. As Vicente said, backlog continues to remain healthy with a good contribution from the longer cycle projects, which will continue to extend over a 12- to 18-month timeframe. So again, yes, book to bill less than 1, but quite normal in Q4 and continue to be encouraged about what we see here moving into 2023. Chris Snyder : No, yes, I appreciate that and I appreciate the color on the seasonality. And then, on the implied margin guidance, so my math kind of pegged EBITDA margins up 70 bps, maybe up to 80 bps year-on-year at the midpoint. So obviously, a bit below the run rate that we've seen and below the kind of the multiyear target that the company has laid out at 100 basis points. But it sounds like price/cost will continue to be kind of in your favor. So, can you just maybe talk about some of the moving parts there on the margin side as we build up to the guide? Thank you. Vik Kini : Sure. I'll take that one, Chris. So, yes, 80 basis points to 90 basis points, slightly right below 100 basis points, that's probably right in line. I think it's a few things to note. When we gave our Investor Day targets, we said to expect about 100 basis points on average over a multiyear timeframe. Obviously, worth noting that we have outpaced that in the prior two years. So, we're still very much tracking in line with that. And I think in terms of the guidance, your point is spot on. We do expect to continue to be price/cost positive. We are still driving productivity as well as the synergies, the last phase of the merger to merger-led synergies to offset any degree of merit and/or labor inflation, which obviously we are seeing and speaks to Vicente's point earlier. But I think the other thing here is that we are continuing to reinvest for growth and to drive ongoing organic growth, which is very much part of our Investor Day target. So, you are seeing requisite investments in -- to the appropriate commercial resources and growth resources in the business as well as some of the investments we called out specifically even at the corporate level around demand generation and IIoT. So, again, we'll continue to be very prudent. We continue to expect margin expansion year-over-year as we go through the year. And sequentially, the margins could continue to sequentially increase quarter-to-quarter as we move from Q1 to Q4, much like you saw in 2022. Chris Snyder : Appreciate all of that. Thanks for taking the questions. Vik Kini : You bet. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn it back to the CEO, Vicente, for some final remarks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you so much. As I kind of wrap up the call today, I just want to say that our teams have done an outstanding job executing our plan throughout 2022, despite the ongoing macro challenges, and that's because they think and act like owners, because they are owners to the company at Ingersoll Rand. And we have clearly demonstrated that there's a lot of resiliency here in our business as we continue to invest organically and inorganically and continue to focus ourselves in sustainability, innovative product and solutions. And that, we believe, is truly positioning Ingersoll Rand as a global leader. So, thank you for the time and attention today. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for joining. That does conclude today's call. Please have a lovely day, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

All lines have been placed on mute during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for question-and-answer at the end. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to our host Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Fort : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2023 first quarter earnings call. I am Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2023 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q1. Our employees consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners to deliver on our commitments despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Start on Slide 3, in Q1, we delivered double-digit adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS growth with strong free cash flow generation, which is up over 350% year-over-year. Fueling this performance is our competitive differentiator IRX. We continue to align to mega trends and high growth, sustainable end markets to deliver on our Investor Day commitments of achieving sustainable revenue growth. Based on the solid Q1 performance, we're raising our 2023 full-year guidance. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine continues to deliver compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in Q4 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic, and quality of earnings growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined on this page. On the next two slides, I will provide you with deeper insights into our organic and inorganic initiatives. On Slide 5, we start with our organic growth initiatives. So let's dive into how we approach the megatrends of sustainability, digitization, and quality of life. Demand Generation Excellence or DGX, which is a tool within IRX helps us to capture above market growth. Here we have six examples of initiatives that we launched during the first quarter of 2023. Important to note that these six are only a few examples out of hundreds of these initiatives we execute every quarter. I'll review a few of these examples shown on the page. Within the sustainability megatrend, we have a digital campaign example, which is focused on carbon capture system builders and integrators. This campaign generated a global supply agreement with a key carbon capture player and has also driven a $200 million increase funnel with no new product development required. For digitization, we have a great example on how we utilize IIoT to grow our aftermarket business; leveraging our IIoT connected equipment machine alerts are set up to trigger e-mail notification to our customers and Ingersoll Rand service contracts when service is needed. The result of this initiative was increased orders on new contracts for preventive maintenance. And this initiative is in its early stages and we plan to expand this approach to other key triggers in the future. Finally, at the bottom of the page, we have a great example within the quality of life megatrend. We launched a social media campaign tailored towards small farms and agriculture that increase our marketing qualified leads by 96% for Dosatron dosing pumps. These are merely a few examples of the tailwinds associated with megatrends and how we deploy our organic growth enablers to deliver compounding annual results. On the inorganic initiatives, we wanted to provide an integration update of one of our larger acquisitions since the merger to Seepex. In less than 15 months, the business has expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by over 1,000 basis points, and this margin expansion has come from a balanced approach of gross margin expansion and SG&A synergies. When we acquired this business adjusted EBITDA margins, we're in the mid-teens and we expect to deliver low-30s in 2023, while accelerating organic growth. And this speaks to the power of our M&A approach on finding phenomenal companies and then integrating them into our economic growth engine. With new acquisitions, we're not only focused on cost improvements, but also maintaining focus on growth. For Seepex, we accelerated organic growth across three levers. First, from the Seepex acquisition came a great IIoT technology, which we now have expanded and scaled across the entire PST segment. The second lever is combined Seepex technology with Ingersoll Rand existing channel knowledge to access lithium ion battery customers, and we were able to bring a mission critical product to market in less than nine months, while expanding our addressable market by over $250 million. Finally, we have also integrated Seepex pump and compressor technology to accelerate product differentiation within the marketplace by combining an air compressor with Seepex progressive cavity pump, this patented technology enables our customers to better transfer materials with controlled airflow and improved energy efficiency. As we move to Slide 7, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We're pleased to highlight one closed transaction and one signed M&A deal. These acquisitions add both market leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with closed adjacencies. Let me walk you through these two deals. First, Trace Analytics, which is a leading provider of lab-based testing and sampling for compressed air technologies. This acquisition has strong recurring revenue in air purity and quality across attractive markets such as life sciences, food and beverage, and pharmaceutical. Next is Gaopeng Vacuum, which is a well-established oil-free vacuum pump manufacturer that expands our product portfolio in a very attractive and growing sustainable end markets across Asia-Pacific. Our M&A funnel remains very strong, and as of today, it continues to be over 5x larger than it was at the time of the R&D. We currently have five transactions at the LOI stage, and more importantly, we have several other transactions in process which are close to the LOI stage. Based on acquisitions to-date, the five transactions are under LOI and our current M&A funnel; we are reaffirming our commitment to additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. Moving to Slide 8. While our results have been strong and we continue to see orders and backlog growth, we do acknowledge that the market is in a state of constant change and we need to remain agile and nimble in order to respond. Over the past few years, we have transformed our portfolio to be more resilient than ever. We have a large, recurring, and highly profitable aftermarket business that accounts for approximately 35% of our total revenue, while growing at double-digits. In addition, we have divested almost $2 billion of highly cyclical assets in Club Car and high pressure solutions, and in turn reinvested that into acquisitions that are better aligned in high growth sustainable end markets. We believe that this, along with a differentiated long cycle and better geographically balanced portfolio, will ensure a more durable, stable performance in the next slowdown. We also have a proven track record of performance. For example, in 2020, during the global pandemic, we were able to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by 190 basis points year-over-year. As you recall, during the pandemic, we immediately deployed merger-related synergies to ensure we were out in front and controlling cost pretty quickly. Also, in 2019, the legacy Gardner Denver Industrial Segment delivered 70 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and grew adjusted EBITDA dollars 3% in spite of revenue declining 3% organically year-over-year. We're constantly monitoring for early indicators of an economic slowdown and we remain nimble and ready to act in the event that markets start to suffer. We have highlighted in past earnings calls how we are able to pivot our demand generation activities towards market that are still growing. And with an addressable market of over $45 billion, we believe that there is still plenty of room to take market share. In addition, we have multiple levers to manage adjusted EPS as seen at the bottom right-hand side of the slide. On Slide 9, our commitment to become a market leader in ESG continues and we're very excited to continue receiving positive feedback from the rating agencies on our efforts. In April, Ingersoll Rand received an ESG risk rating of low with a score of 12.8 from Morningstar Sustainalytics. This rating ranks us second in the machinery industry group and places Ingersoll Rand in the first percentile in the machinery industry and six percentile of all rated companies. This is a perfect example of how we utilize IRX for agile execution across all aspects of our business. In this case, we use our own IRX execution process to grow from medium risk to low risk and are now in the top percentile in the industry and regionally. I will turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 10, despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we delivered solid results in Q1 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 8% and 20% year-over-year respectively. Book-to-bill was 1.09 and we remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 15% year-over-year and up approximately 10% sequentially. This provides a healthy backlog as we move into Q2 2023 and gives us conviction delivering on our revised 2023 revenue guidance. The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $400 million, a 32% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.6%, 190 basis points year-over-year improvement. For the quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 33% versus the prior year. This includes a $0.05 headwind from increased interest expense. Free cash flow for the quarter was $148 million despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to the need to support backlog as well as continued global supply chain challenges. Even with these headwinds, free cash flow was up more than 350% versus prior year. Total liquidity of $2.2 billion at quarter end was down approximately $500 million sequentially, and our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 1.1 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than the prior year and 0.3 turns above prior quarter. The sequential decline in total liquidity and increase in net leverage are largely driven by the timing of the SPX Flow Air Treatment acquisition, which closed in early January. Turning to Slide 11. For the total company Q1 orders grew 13% and revenue increased 26%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 32% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 240 basis points while the PST segment margin improved 170 basis points. Notably, both segments remained price/cost, dollar, and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at $40 million for the quarter driven by continued investments as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 33% to $0.65 per share, and the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.1%. Moving on to the next slide. I want to highlight that our credit rating was recently upgraded to an investment grade rating by S&P. This is a major milestone for the company and we remain focused on becoming investment grade across all of our rating agencies. Free cash flow for the quarter was $148 million, including CapEx, which totaled $22 million. And as of March 31, 2023, total company liquidity was $2.2 billion based on approximately $1.1 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. It is important to note that in April, we amended and extended our existing revolving credit facility, including upsizing the overall borrowing capacity of the facility from $1.1 billion to $2 billion. This amended credit facility not only strengthens our balance sheet, but also supports the company's growth strategy by adding additional flexibility for M&A. The increase also speaks to the credibility we have in the financial markets as this was purely an increase in borrowing capacity with all the same favorable covenants and structure from the original $1.1 billion facility. Leverage for the quarter was 1.1 turns, which was an 0.1 turn improvement year-over-year, and cash outflows for the quarter included $566 million deployed to M&A, and we returned $85 million to shareholders through $77 million in share repurchases and $8 million in dividends. As mentioned earlier, approximately $520 million of the M&A-related cash outflows were attributed to the SPX Flow Air Treatment business, which closed in early January. M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash looking forward. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. On Slide 13, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 24% with volume growth outpacing pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 40% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.2% up 240 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 35%. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 10% and a book-to-bill of 1.1. And note that on a two-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 35%. Moving to the individual product categories, each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which year-over-year was a 4 percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue. Starting with compressors. We saw orders up in the low 20% and we continue to see oil-free products outpace oil-lubricated products. Orders were up high-20s in the Americas, driven by both strong book-and-turn business and large long cycle projects in high growth, sustainable end markets. EMEA demand continues to be above market with orders up mid-teens and the Asia-Pacific team once again delivered a great performance with order growth in the low-double-digits. Vacuum and blower orders were down low-single-digits. As many of you know in this category, we have large engineer to order products like our Nash and Garo product lines. In this case, the timing of a large order in Q1 2022 not repeating was the large contributor of the decline. Our funnel remains very strong and we're not concerned about the Q1 decline at this point. The power tools and lifting business saw its best booking quarter since Q4 of 2014 with global orders up high-single-digits. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting a differentiated carbon capture solution that incorporates three different products within the Ingersoll Rand portfolio of brands. Here, utilizing patented technology, we have partnered with a clean tech innovator to deploy a new system for industrial point-source CO2 capture. The first units are being commissioned and monitored in the U.S. and will include four Ingersoll Rand products in each model. Turning to Slide 14. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 6% organically. Additionally, the PST deliver adjusted EBITDA of $95 million, which was up 11% year-over-year with incremental margins of 64%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.3%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, and margins were up sequentially from Q4 of 2022. The year-over-year and sequential improvement of, in our adjusted EBITDA margins is driven primarily by price/cost improvements, and synergy delivery on acquired businesses like Seepex. Organic orders were down 2% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.05. Across the PST segment, we did see strong organic order growth from all businesses, with the exception of the oxygen concentration business, which declined approximately $25 million, primarily due to long cycle frame orders received in Q1 2022 that did not repeat in Q1 2023. Excluding the non-repeating oxygen concentration business orders, the PST segment grew mid-single-digits organically. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our new Seepex battery fluid pump. Here is a perfect example of how we leverage our recent acquisitions and existing portfolio to drive product differentiation and organic growth in sustainable end markets. As I mentioned earlier, we combine Seepex technology with Ingersoll Rand existing channel knowledge to access this high growth lithium ion battery customers. The unique progressive cavity design ensures zero contamination, which is mission critical to the production of precise high purity coatings and leveraging IRX, we brought this new product to market in less than nine months and expanded our addressable market by over $250 million. As we move to Slide 15, given the solid performance in Q1, and momentum from backlog, we're raising our 2023 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 10% and 12%, which is a 300 basis point improvement versus our initial guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 6% to 8% where price and volume remain split at approximately 70%:30%. FX is now expected to be relatively flat for the full-year. M&A remains projected at approximately $270 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of May 1, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $160 million and will be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year. The increase versus initial guidance is driven by investments for growth as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.66 billion and $1.71 billion, which is up 5% versus our initial guidance. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.64 and $2.74, which is up 6% versus prior guidance and 14% year-over-year at the mid-point. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate, total interest expense or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue. All remain in line with initial guidance. However, I do want to provide an update on a recent development that affects the phasing of the guidance. Late in the evening on Thursday, April 27, we detected and took actions to contain a cybersecurity incident that resulted in a disruption of several of our IT systems. We immediately partnered with external experts to assess, mitigate, and restore these systems. In parallel, we proactively took immediate actions to maintain business continuity and minimize disruption by isolating certain systems and implementing workarounds. We expect to begin restoring the impacted systems to normal operations next week. We do not expect this incident to impact the full-year guidance we just provided on this slide, although it could result in some revenue shifting from our second quarter to the second half of 2023. In fact, as a matter of potency, we have kept the phasing of adjusted EBITDA delivery between the first half of the year and the second half of the year, consistent with our original expectations. This will imply delivering approximately 45% of our adjusted EBITDA in the first half of the year, and 55% in the second half, which generally means that the balance of our adjusted EBITDA guidance raised in addition to the Q1 outperformance will fall into the second half of the year. It is important to note also that the underlying demand environment remains healthy and in line with our expectations. And while our investigation is ongoing, at this time, we're not aware that any confidential customer information was exfiltrated. If we become aware that any such information was ill-exfiltrated, we will make appropriate notification. We remain fully committed to our customers as we diligently work to resolve the issue and restore normal operations in a safe and secure manner. I'm sharing these with you today as part of our commitment to transparency, and because this incident is still under investigation, I cannot provide further details at this time. Turning to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q1 performance and ongoing backlog momentum. We are monitoring the dynamic market conditions and remain very nimble, and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you again for an excellent start to the year. These results show the impact each of you have as owners. However, we're still in the early stages and need to remain focused on our commitments to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency, and focus actions. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is stronger now more than ever, and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hopeful all is well. Vicente Reynal : Hey, Mike. Mike Halloran : So can you just help provide some more context on -- on Vicente's comments about the cadence and changing. So I guess twofold, right? I certainly understand the 45%, 55% splits, 1H versus 2H. Any help on the segment details? And then when you think about what the underlying demand would look like, is there any front half back half underlying demand cadence and not necessarily when it shows up in the revenue, but are you assuming anything or basically how are you assuming the underlying demand cadences as you work through the back half of the year? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Hey, Mike, let me take a -- I'll take the first -- sorry, the second portion around the underlying demand and then Vik will talk about the cadence as you were asking. I mean demand continues to be pretty healthy. And we expect you saw a book-to-bill above 1 here in the first quarter, which speaks to the resiliency of what we're seeing out there in the market, on kind of both book-and-turn as well as long cycle orders. And our expectation is that here for the rest of the year, we're going to continue to end with a book-to-bill of 1, which obviously assumes that the backlog continues to be pretty strong here through the rest of the year. Vik Kini : Yes. And Mike, to your first question in terms of phasing and the segment implications as Vicente indicated, we're expecting that whether you look from a total company perspective at adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share using about a 45%, 55% first half or second half split is generally in line. And I would say the segments should follow a fairly close split to that. The same should be said for corporate, which the corporate spend obviously is pretty ratable over the year in line with our revised guidance. So I wouldn't say that there's dramatic changes in the context of the segments versus the total company. And then as we've indicated before, and I think is still the case, we're continuing to remain prudent in terms of the back half of the year, particularly on the organic volume side of the equation. Just given that, you still don't necessarily have full visibility into the back half of the year. Mike Halloran : Thanks for that, Vik. And then, Vicente following-up on the first answer there, could you maybe get some context to how the long cycle trends are tracking in the portfolio relative to maybe how some of the shorter, quicker turn stuff is tracking in the portfolio? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Sure, Mike. I think the good news is that here in the first quarter, we actually saw good resiliency on both kind of the short cycle and the long cycle, which was very good news to us to see that continue momentum on both, which is also the reason why on that shorter cycle why we were able to even out deliver some of the price, right? So in terms of long cycle, we think that the tailwinds of sustainability on ensuring all of that continues to be really front and center. And at least our expectation is that even things like IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, all that funding still has to come through. We're seeing some early indications funnels look very strong. You saw also a lot of communication activity around carbon capture. So at least on the long cycle side, we think that there should be more to come from that perspective while the short cycle seems to be at least in our case and in our business fairly healthy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes on the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe a first question, if you could just size the backlog in dollar terms at the end of March. I saw you gave the percentage deltas, but maybe just give us a sense of the dollar scale of the backlog. And then, as we're thinking about the cadence through the year, are we assuming revenues are sort of flat to up slightly sequentially each quarter, and then EBITDA margins are up slightly sequentially each quarter? Is that kind of the main framework for the guidance? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Maybe Julian, I'll talk about on the backlog. The backlog as you recall on the last earnings call, we said that we have roughly $2 billion of backlog, and that sequentially that has grown about 10%. So I mean, that can -- that right there you can say, obviously you do a very simple math. So clearly above that $2.2 billion, right? And Vik, on the cadence? Vik Kini : Yes. Julian, on the cadence generally speaking, I would say we expect again, I'll refer back to the 45%, 55% split, as Vicente indicated, we do see potential of some revenues shifting from Q2 into the back half of the year as Vicente earlier indicated. But generally speaking here, the way we would think about it is, with the guidance array of the strong Q1 performance and still seeing 35% to 40% incrementals, we do still expect to see margin expansion on a year-over-year basis in each quarter and obviously the second half of the year will as it typically is continue to be the strongest performance both on the revenue side as well as the margin profile. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Brandon McCann : Hi, good morning guys. This is Brandon on for Josh. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Hi, Brandon. Vik Kini : Hi, Brandon. Brandon McCann : How much of the order strength was driven by particularly the inflection in process markets? And then as a follow-up on that, when would you potentially see some of these major LNG and hydrogen projects that are being discussed showing up in your pipeline? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Maybe Brandon on the orders, as we said, I mean, I think good momentum, good strength on both kind of the short cycle and the long cycle. If I get your question correctly, I think you were asking about maybe how much was price versus volume. Brandon McCann : Yes, exactly. Vicente Reynal : Yes. So I think in the first quarter, price and volume is roughly 50 :50. As we go into the second -- into the rest of the year, we think it's going to be more like 70 :30. And so that kind of give you an indication of kind of how we're thinking about price volume here. In terms of your second question about LNG, hydrogen, are we seeing -- I mean we're seeing definitely some clearly the -- on the long cycle, I'll say maybe more continuation what we see the most is on air separation systems and large call it carbon capture activity. So I think a lot of good momentum on these kind of good sustainability tailwinds that we have been speaking about for now the past few quarters. And so again funnel continues to be pretty strong and -- but like I said on the prior answer, I don't think that we have seen the full scope of a lot of these IRA or other green deal funds come through fruition yet. So that hopefully will give us a good indicator of that more -- a little bit more tailwind here to come. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. I wanted to ask I mean obviously ITS compressor orders are very strong, and you've touched on a couple aspects, but would you qualitatively talk about what is driving that order of strength? I know you have your oil-free, I know you've done a lot on demand generation, but is this mega projects coming through? Is it energy efficiency; is it just general CapEx renewal? Because there's a certainty in the economy and you're seeing really strong orders, so I just wonder if you can give any color around that. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Rob, I hate to say this, but I mean it's pretty much really broad-base and I think it has to do for a couple reasons. I mean, clearly you mentioned oil-free, oil-free strong order rate at roughly as we said, 28%. So clearly very, very strong order and on a revenue perspective, even way above that. But demand generation, as we clearly indicated on that slide, I mean we do hundreds of demand generation campaigns and activities through -- throughout a single quarter. And you saw some example of some of the things that we have done in the first quarter with kind of six examples, six out of the hundreds that we do. So that tells you that in our view, we continue to be solid momentum on MQLs, the Marketing Qualified Leads that then lead into some of these order momentum. As it relates to large projects, I mean, clearly, renewable natural gas, which is very continues to be a really great sustainable way here in the U.S. particularly carbon capture. We spoke about that on the prior earnings to as well with a large order that we received on the last time, on the last earnings call, but now even this time, how we're even capturing some of these kind of new technologies or new partners to continue accelerating carbon capture technology. So it was really a little bit of everything, strong book-and-turn as well, and good pricing momentum. So I'll say Rob, I mean we -- the team did a phenomenal job heating across all aspects in the business. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. Thank you. And if I may do another one that's a little bit less directly quarterly related, but the battery fluid pump you have on Slide 14, it's Seepex nine months from start to finish on i2V innovative value. I mean, that's fast even knowing how fast you guys move. I wonder if you could give us a quick sketch of just how that looks start to finish and how you -- how that process runs and how it goes so fast. Thank you. I'll stop it. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Rob, thanks for that question. I tell you, this is the exciting piece and it speaks tremendously to a lot of things that we've been saying in the past. And this is just a clear example of that. And that is that we're taking basically products that are call it you could argue standard products. And then we point these demand generation canon to specific end markets that we're seeing some very good growth momentum, and then we are able to attract customers to then work on very specific solutions. And in this case, we took configure, I mean items and components of standard products, and we were able to reconfigure that pretty quickly based on the request and from some customer and doing a lot of voice of customer and going to customer visits. So I think it's -- it speaks to the process that, that holistically is connecting all the dots from how we connect to the customer, how we generate the demand, how we instigate that customer to come to us, to utilizing processes then like i2V the innovative value process that we have internally to then redesign the product and then utilize all the other IDM, IMPACT Daily Management, which is part of the IRX to then execute in a pretty rapid way and flawlessly all along the lines by making sure that we're satisfying that that customer unmet need that is today in the market. So I think it is a beautiful example on how we have been able to connect all the dots and obviously many of these are happening throughout the entire company today, but this is just one that we thought it was great to highlight again new acquisition, but it speaks tremendously about how quickly we can continue to change the cultural perspective even on new M&A. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Vicente, the last couple of quarters of PST you've averaged I think something like 70% incrementals. You obviously gave us an update on the Seepex improvement, which I would imagine is a decent tailwind and your margin comparison is again I think pretty easy in Q2. But is there anything else going on within PST in particular that you're doing to really ratchet up performance? I would assume price/cost is helping, and I remember some acute supply chain issues earlier last year, but maybe you could elaborate on what you're doing there. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Andy, I think definitely price/cost is definitely helping. And as you also alluded the continue acceleration of the M&A bolt-on acquisitions that we have done, that's helping too as well. Seepex being one but even I point out to someone like ADI air dimensions, which again we acquired that at 50% EBITDA margins, and today it's above kind of call it 60%. So again, it's a combination of a lot of the things that we have put in action. So, yes, good price/cost, good synergy execution and the teams as we have said before, we're a little bit delayed on getting things like i2V in place at PST, but that is now ramping up and that's what we get the excitement that there should be more to come here. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. And then maybe you could give us a little more color into the M&A environment. Your funnel still seems significant, as you said. You reiterated the $200 million, $300 million inorganic target for 2023, but you mentioned you had the five LOIs left, I think you had 11 last quarter. I know you said that you had several potential targets close the LOIs stage. So is that really just timing or there fewer near-term opportunities than usual? Vicente Reynal : Sure, yes. I think you said it very well. Yes, I mean, I -- so five LOIs now which is obviously less than what we said on the park order, but that's because I mean, we closed some and we departed from some but I think the good news is that we still have a good handful of those at the stage that is right before signing the LOI. So that's why it continues to give us that confidence that we will be able to reach the target that we set and nothing that we're worried about that. In terms of the activity, we continue to see strong momentum activity out in the market. Again, it has to do because of a lot of the sales searching that we do in terms of finding good transactions that could be part of our company. So I think momentum continues to be pretty good on that M&A bolt-on strategy that we have. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Nice to hear and sorry to hear about the cyber issues. The maybe -- can we just try to square some of the commentary on the cybersecurity stuff? So appreciate the color that you gave earlier. I was just trying to size like the -- like sales and EBITDA impact and who knows whether my numbers are right. But my ballpark numbers were call it like roughly a $30 million to $50 million EBITDA impact. So I don't know, maybe a $100 million to $150 million revenue like am I ballpark correct in how much is shifting away from 2Q? Vicente Reynal : I think Joe; you're definitely on the high side on that perspective. I think if you do the math in terms of that 45%, 55%, you come with a much lower number, I mean, roughly half of what you just said. Joe Ritchie : Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks for clarifying. And then -- and then I guess maybe Vicente just is there any concern that that that some of the sales you were expected to ship in 2Q to push out, is there any concern that that that those sales go away? Or do you have high degree of confidence that you'll be able to ship in the second half? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, I think not at this point, because keep in mind that we're still living in a long lead time environment. So I think adding maybe kind of a couple of few weeks of extra lead time is not going to create any impact on what we have in the backlog that. So I don't think the answer to that no. And keep in mind that this is not -- this incident did not disrupt the majority of the company, right? So I think it's one that we think we have pretty good control sized and working diligently to get back in normal operations for -- by next week. And in the meantime also as we said, our team continues to minimize disruption by implementing workarounds. So there's ways on how you can continue to support customer and with different workarounds that, that you can do locally at some of the sites. Joe Ritchie : All right. Great. That's great to hear. And look, you gave a lot of really positive order data across your different businesses. I guess I'll be the one that asks about power tools. It's really nice to see that that pick up a little surprising honestly. So maybe just kind of provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in that business. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. I'm sure the team -- the power tool team will be glad to hear that you asked a question of power tool. I can tell you that the team has done a phenomenal job on new product development. So believe it or not, similar to the story that we talked about here on Seepex on kind of how we get to short lead time and then launching new product and audience solutions, the power team -- the power tool team has done just a phenomenal job on that kind of reinvigorating the line and reinvigorating the channel and reinvigorating customers to come to us. So I think it's been an innovation story and it is basically what we said all along. The first we needed to fix the cost situation, and then we were going to start accelerating investments to key on keep the business growing. And with the help of IRX, we've been able to accomplish the first step, which was fixing a lot of the cost although continue to see improvement on that and then move pretty quickly to innovation. And that's what the team is doing. I mean, they're doing a lot of good nice products and launching now in the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: I wanted to start on the updated guide and back half of the year expectations. I think going back a few months ago talked about embedding some prudence at the time just based on sort of macro uncertainty. Sounds like a continuation of that. But the way things sort of transpired over the course of the quarter certainly evidence of pretty strong demand. So if you take the cyber item aside and Vik, I think you talked about still seeing some or still sort of applying some prudence to the guide, but has anything changed in your underlying back half of your guide relative to sort of three months ago? Vik Kini : Yes, Joe, I'll start with that. I think obviously when you look at the revised guidance now at the mid-point the 7% organic guide versus our previous guides, which is about 4% at the mid-point, 300 basis points of improvement. And I think the way you could think about it in just broad strokes is about two-thirds of that is driven by the Q1 beat with the other third really coming in the back half of the year. So the answer is yes. We are actually seeing slightly better second half growth than our original guidance would've implied. And as Vicente indicated in his opening comments, we're still seeing a split of approximately 70%, 30% price versus volume. And I think we would also say that at this point in time, we're still continuing to take a prudent view on volume in the back half of the year. Still continues to probably be the biggest source of potential upside. Backlogs are still strong, but like I said before still don't necessarily have full visibility after the back half of the year. So we're going to continue to execute. And if that continues to be a source of upside that's something that we'll execute to. Joe O'Dea: Thank you. And then I also wanted to ask on cost opportunities, and as you see sort of raw materials coming down and supply chain easing, how you're approaching that in terms of the cost opportunity set and going out to suppliers, whether or not sort of the pricing that you've seen sort of applied to you on the -- on sort of the sourcing side of things. You've got some opportunities to push back on that and then similarly, are you seeing any of that from your customers and in any sort of more active kind of negotiations on the pricing side? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Thanks, Joe for the question. Again on the cost opportunity, absolutely, we see a lot of cost opportunity and as you can imagine, we're leveraging some of our IRX tools to drive a weekly cadence on how we go after we call it price clawback, which is kind of looking at 2019 prices from some of our suppliers and how do we want to get as much as possible as we see some deflationary marketing happen in some areas. Now, I will say too as well, that there's some areas that we see some continued price inflation and reason why we continue to do some pricing activity out in the market. So it's not a -- but net-net we see stability and maybe going down and to your point, absolutely you can expect, I mean, we started this process. I would say maybe a couple quarters ago, going back to suppliers and start doing a lot of what we call reverse auctions through our process. In terms of our customers, I'll say it's a slightly different there, because as you know, our customers, they don't buy our product basically every week or every month. Or I mean, if they buy a compressor today, they're not going to buy a compressor until a few years later down the road. And in many cases, it's configured to the specific order. So it is difficult, I say to compare price to price, so difficult to argue for a price reduction when there's different features and different options that are being selected. So no, I will say as long as we continue to add incremental value to the product with the innovation that we're launching, we should be able to still continue to generate price. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just starting with price/costs. So I know it was positive on a dollar and margin basis for the quarter. What is the expectation like of how the cadence of price/cost benefit trends through the year? Are you kind of at your maximum price/cost benefit at this point, or is it spread kind of evenly throughout 2023? Vik Kini : Yes, Nicole, it's a great question. I think the answer is, first of all, your commentary on Q1 quite accurate. We do expect to be price/cost positive and margin accretive for the balance of the year. It is worth noting here that obviously the pricing levels in the first quarter quite strong. Remember we did take a number of our pricing actions in 2022 in that first quarter timeframe. So now as those start to anniversary, the price realization as we move into 2Q in the back half the year obviously does step down. But our expectation would be that, so does the inflationary levels as we're now comping that. So they actually kind of move somewhat in tandem. And that actually speaks obviously to the fact that we took those actions really either in advance or in concert when we saw those inflationary levels rising in the first place. So I think the answer to your question here is we would expect to continue to see good price/cost delivery, and the requisite margin expansion with it as we move to the balance of the year. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thanks, Vik. And then just with respect to the order trends through the quarter, did you guys see like acceleration into March? How did things go from month-to-month? And if you're willing to comment on April, that would be awesome too. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Nicole, I'll say throughout the quarter, yes, we continue to see in Q1, we saw -- I'd say maybe a little bit more sequentially proven yes. As I mean, but that's I think typical that you see in the quarter in Q1 particularly, right, as people kind of come out from vacation December and now into January. So I think but that, I mean, nothing of note that I will kind of call out to be just a massive acceleration into March. Just basically the regular cadence that we see in a usual typical Q1 quarter and in April, I mean, continue to be the same as what we have seen here so far in the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Vicente Reynal : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Hi, so we covered a lot of ground, but maybe just going back to the cyber-attack, I mean, any more color on in terms of which business lines and geographies perhaps that have been impacted by this unfortunate incident? Vicente Reynal : No, Nigel, I mean I'll say that the only thing I will say is that, only certain item IT systems were disrupted that and that that did not impact the majority of the company. And as I mentioned, where things were impacted were proactively took immediate actions to maintain business continuity and minimize disruptions. And we expect to begin restoring the impacted systems to normal operation here coming next week. So I think it's -- it speaks volumes and I think you can read that as well in terms of what we're saying that we don't expect this incident to impact the full-year guidance, and we felt it was prudent just to kind of give you even more color as to what we see here in the second quarter. But yes, that's we're not probably going to get into any more specifics on that. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's fair. And then, Vik, on the 45%, 55%, obviously the simple math gets you to 2Q EBITDA slightly below, maybe flat slightly below 1Q. Obviously very abnormal compared to normal seasonality. And there's been a pretty pronounced pickup in the last couple of years from 1Q to 2Q. So is this just the cyber incident with perhaps a little bit of conservatism baked in as well? Was there some 1Q pull-in from 2Q? Any sense on just how would you think about that? Vik Kini : Yes, Nigel, I'll answer that. In the context of your second part of your question, were there any pull-ins into 1Q or any of that nature? The answer is no. I think the way you described it is very accurate. We mentioned that we're being prudent in terms of the phasing as a result of the cyber incident. And then as such, I think the way you're thinking about it and even how you've kind of thought about the EBITDA levels is fairly appropriate. So I wouldn't read into it any more than that. Nigel Coe : And since you answered the question really quickly, can I just throw in one more please. On these reassuring projects in the U.S. but these -- this has been quite top zero this quarter. I mean, from your perspective, how much roughly of these large projects have had the air compression bid out this stage, in terms of kind of what have you seen so far in terms of the order book and what's on the come? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Nigel, I -- yes. The one thing is that it's difficult to quantify specifically only because I mean when we take the order it could be reassuring or it could be something else. I mean clearly we know what goes into the Chips Act as an example and what goes into other things like that. But what we can tell you is what we said about the Buffalo facility, right? That we reopen Buffalo facility and that that business sold over $40 million in orders last year pretty quickly. And the momentum continues on that -- on that facility too as well. And a lot of that is really driven by the reassuring. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Volume growth for the company really stands out versus broader industrial. Seems like it was up low-double-digits range or so for Q1. And when we kind of look at the rest of the year, it seems to imply not much of any volume growth over the next three quarters. Does that more so reflect the macro uncertainty or potential supply chain uncertainty? What's that reflecting because it does feel like a pretty sharp fall off? Vik Kini : Yes. I think the way to think about it is fairly simple. First of all, I think your reading to Q1 is quite accurate. I'd say a couple things. One, remember our -- the comps as we move to the year, they do get more challenging, right? That's just the reality of kind of last year and the math and the comps. The other thing I would say and I'll go back to kind of what we said before, particularly in the second half of the year one, we have taken the organic guidance up. So obviously, we are seeing slightly better organic growth in the back half of the year than our original guidance would -- would've implied, which obviously speaks to kind of Q1 dynamics as well as backlog levels. But I do think that there's just a matter of continuing to be prudent in terms of back half expectations. And we would tell you right now that that organic volume growth in the back half of the year is probably the era we're being the most prudent on. So Chris, I wouldn't -- again, that, that's kind of my view in terms of -- in our view, in terms of how the organic volume side of the equation's playing itself out. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And the company really good track record on price and holding that price. When we see some of the year-to-date reflation in metals, does that change the way you think about incremental price throughout the rest of the year because potentially some of these commodity inputs are going higher into next year. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yes, I'll say I think, Chris, I mean so we take so maybe two-folds to answer your question. I mean, we go after the suppliers when we see definitely declines in our commodity or some other commodity numbers that we -- whether steel and things like that. Now if we see the re -- inflation, same things coming back, back up again. Yes, I mean, we definitely stay pretty nimble and we'll go out in the market with more price. Yes, absolutely. I mean, that's how we did it as we were seeing the inflationary markets, and we'll definitely do it again. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Nathan Jones : I'll go for a question on SPX Flow. You guys have highlighted many examples over the last few years of leveraging the portfolio to accelerate growth and significantly improving the margins of acquired businesses. Maybe you can give us some what kind of organic growth acceleration you're expecting and margin expansion you're expecting to be able to generate out of that business. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Nathan, as we say -- as we -- so I mean, first of all, I'll tell you we're super excited with that business only roughly about a quarter into it. And anything that we see is really exciting. I mean, five incredible brands within that portfolio that we're leveraging and doing a lot of work, as you can imagine, on demand generation, i2V, and the team is super, super engaged on really accelerating that. I think in terms of growth, yes, I mean, we see no reason why this set of businesses should accelerate the growth based on all the initiatives that we're doing much faster than what they were growing before. And in terms of margin expansion, yes. Same thing that we said when we acquired the business that we see that this business could get to roughly in the 30% EBITDA margins. Vik Kini : Yes. And Nathan, I would say we -- Nathan Jones : Where is it today? Vik Kini : Yes. We said it was largely when we had done that acquisition largely in line with kind of ITS segment margin. So it's fairly close in line with the overall ITS segment margins. And as Vicente said, we have good funnel and strong runway ahead of us in terms of good margin expansion opportunities. I would also say, now that we're at one quarter in from the acquisition here first quarter execution the team did a fantastic job and integration continues to move very nicely. So we're quite pleased with how things are trending. Nathan Jones : And then just on the power tools business, I think at the merger, the strategic plan was to divest that business. Has that changed or is that still the plan here at some point in the future? Vicente Reynal : I mean, we -- no change in plans. I mean, we still continue to be same aligned in terms of our long-term strategy. Operator : Thank you. As there are no additional questions at this time, I'll hand the conference back over to Vicente Reynal for closing remarks. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Thank you, Candice. Once again, I mean, the Ingersoll Rand team has demonstrated their own match ability to execute despite these ongoing microeconomic volatility. We're very appreciative of our teams and the outperformance. This quarter truly demonstrates the power of IRX and the ownership mindset from our employees. And with that, just want to say thank you all of you for joining the call today and your interest in Ingersoll Rand. Have a great day, Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Ingersoll Rand first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Have a great day ahead. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. My name is Kayla Baker, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ingersoll Rand Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to, Vice President of Investor Relations, Matthew Fort. You may begin. Matthew Fort : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2023 second quarter earnings call. I am Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more details. In addition, today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2023 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. Our employees continue to deliver on our commitments, despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, and consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners. I would also like to welcome, our new employees from our recent acquisitions. Together, we have a great opportunity to build upon our strong complementary brands, products and capabilities, providing customers and the industry with a broader spectrum of solutions. Beginning on slide 3, fueled by our competitive differentiator, IRX in the second quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We recently published our 2022 sustainability report, where we yet again delivered industry-leading results, while remaining on track to meet our 2030 sustainability goals. Finally, based on our continued robust performance in Q2, we're once again raising our 2023 full year guidance. As we move to slide 4, our economic growth engine is the key, to how we deliver compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in Q4 of 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic and quality of earning growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined in this page. On the next slides, I will provide you with deeper insights into our organic initiatives, which are centered, around product innovation and innovative value also known as i2V. In addition, we will provide an update on our progress towards our inorganic goals. Turning to slide 5, we start with our organic growth initiatives. Here, we have some examples of how in China, we have leveraged products localization as well as i2V to drive organic growth. On the left-hand side of the page, we show how localization has created new product offerings and enabled channel expansion all with a focus on high-growth sustainable end markets. Since the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand merger, our blower and vacuum product lines have grown organically at a 17% CAGR. On the right-hand side of the page, we have an example of organic growth through the combination of recently acquired M&A and i2V. As you can see in the pictures at the bottom right-hand side of the page, the Asia Pacific team conducted a turndown event with legacy products, recently acquired M&A and competitive technologies. The outcome of that turndown event is the development of a new oil-free screw vacuum pump. This new product will expand our addressable market by over $350 million, and will go from development to launch in approximately six months. Next, on Slide 6, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We are thrilled to highlight our recently signed M&A deal Roots. This iconic Roots brand is a leading provider of low-pressure compression and vacuum technology. This brand is synonymous with blowers in the same way that clinics and Bandaid are recognized in consumer markets. We're very excited to acquire this iconic brand, which has been in business for almost 200 years. The acquisition also expands our capabilities in both low-pressure technology and centrifugal technology. And this technology is a critical component in the process of green steel manufacturing. Our M&A funnel remains strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five time larger than it was at the time of the R&D. We currently have seven transactions at the LOI stage. And more importantly, we have several other transactions in process, which are close to the LOI stage. Based on acquisitions to date, the seven transactions under LOI at our current M&A funnel, we are reaffirming our commitment to an additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. On Slide 7, we recently released our 2022 sustainability report, showcasing the commitment and results of our strategic imperative leads sustainably. We have made significant progress in establishing ourselves as a top quartile ESG company by leveraging our competitive differentiator, IRX to deliver results in a very short period of time. In fact, we have received several industry-leading sustainability acknowledgments of our efforts, including being named to both the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Ingersoll Rand was ranked as the number one performer in the IEQ machinery and electrical equipment industry in North America and number four globally in 2022. As a very close 2023, Ingersoll-Rand received an ESG risk rating of low at 12.8% from Morningstar Sustainalytics. We also received an ESG rating improvement to AA in 2023 from MSCI and ranked as a leader among 47 companies in the industrial machinery category. More important, we're also leading the way in the social aspect of ESG with our employee ownership model. We believe employee ownership creates economic opportunity for our employees and their families while driving increased employee engagement as our long-term shareholder. To that end, we have awarded approximately $275 million since 2017 in equity to our employees, employees that are not already on the management equity program. This has increased to over $660 million in value as of June 30, 2023. We will continue to offer our ownership works program that grant equity to all new employees after the 1-year anniversary. Our employees are a critical element of our business and making life better for them begins with opportunity. Through their engagement and commitment, we are on track to meet our 2030 sustainability objectives. With this, I'll turn now the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks, Vicente. On slide 8, fueled by IRX, we again delivered solid results in Q2 through a balance of commercial and operational execution. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 5% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Book-to-bill was 1.03, and we remain encouraged with the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 12% year-over-year and up approximately 5% sequentially. The backlog is approximately 45% higher than it was at the end of 2021, which gives us good visibility and momentum as we move into the back half of 2023 and start to look into 2024. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $425 million, a 27% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.2%, a 190 basis point year-over-year improvement. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up 25% versus the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to the need to support backlog as well as continued global supply chain challenges. Even with these headwinds, free cash flow was up 24% versus prior year. Total liquidity of $3.2 billion at quarter end was up approximately $1 billion sequentially. This increase was driven in large part due to the recently amended, extended and upsized revolving facility, which took place in early Q2 of this year. Our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 1.0 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than both the prior year and prior quarter. Finally, I'd like to highlight an example of the power of our ownership mindset and the effectiveness of our competitive differentiator, IRX. Due to the team's resiliency in overcoming the cybersecurity incident, the Q2 revenue and adjusted EBITDA risk associated with the incident was mitigated within the quarter. This is no small task, and I would like to thank all of our employees that were involved in helping to overcome this impediment, enabling us to deliver tremendous results in Q2. Turning to slide 9. For the total company, Q2 orders grew 10% and revenue increased 18%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 27% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 200 basis points, while the PST segment margin improved 240 basis points. Notably, both segments remain price cost dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at approximately $43 million for the quarter, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IIoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 25% to $0.68 per share. This $0.14 year-over-year increase includes a $0.04 headwind from interest expense. And finally, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24%. Moving on to the next slide. I want to highlight that the company was assigned an investment-grade first-time issuer default rating from Fitch. We have now received investment-grade ratings from two of the three major rating agencies, and we remain committed to becoming an investment-grade rated across all of our rating agencies. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, including CapEx, which totaled $25 million. Total company liquidity was $3.2 billion based on approximately $1.2 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $49 million deployed to M&A and we returned $64 million to shareholders through $56 million in share repurchases and $8 million in dividends. M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash for the foreseeable future. We continue to have an active and healthy funnel of inorganic growth opportunities. This funnel consists primarily of bolt-on M&A relatively similar in size, scope and nature to the assets we have acquired over the past two to three years. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. On Slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 14% with volume growth slightly outpacing pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 200 basis points from the prior year with an incremental margin of 38%. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 8% and a book-to-bill of 1.05. Note that on a two-year stack, ITS organic orders have grown 19%. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which year-over-year was approximately a 1.5 percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenues. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low double digits. We continue to see oil free product orders outpace oil lubricated products. Orders were up low double digits in the Americas, with North America also up low double digits, demonstrating that we continue to see momentum from secular trends around ESG, on-shoring and near-shoring as well as continued investments on energy savings. EMEIA demand continued to be above market with orders up high single digits. The Asia Pacific team continues to deliver a great performance with order growth in the mid-teens, driven by continued solid execution from our team in China where they saw orders up in the low 20s. Today, we showed on Slide 5, an example of how the team in China continues to outperform the market conditions with our own self-help initiatives. Vacuum and blower orders were up mid-teens and every region saw positive orders with good strength from Europe. Orders in the power tools and lifting business was up low single digits. Moving now to the innovation and action portion of the slide, we're illustrating an oil free hydrogen compressor recently launched in EMEIA. This product is a perfect example of how we continue to focus our portfolio on high-growth, sustainable end markets with region-for-region manufacturing. The EMEIA team collaborated with a clean energy tech startup in the Netherlands to develop and build a system for our innovative hydrogen process, and the first unit was shipped in July. Turn to Slide 12. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment grew 5% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $90 million, which was up 16% year-over-year with incremental margins of 66%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.2%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven primarily by price cost improvements, synergy delivery on acquired businesses like Seepex, and the impact of China lockdowns in the second quarter of 2022, which did not repeat. Organic orders were down 10% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 0.95 times. It is important to note that the book-to-bill was one-time for the first half of the year. The primary driver of the organic order decline related to larger frame orders not repeating in the life science businesses, as well as the expected decline of longer cycle orders in the Agritech platform. Our book and ship business was solid, and we believe that the core business within PST remains very healthy. For PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our new peristaltic pump technology that is used for water treatment, industrial and life sciences market. This product innovative design provides a robust alternative for chemical dosing and transfer applications. The products are IoT-ready and complement our already strong portfolio of products for water treatment and chemical applications offering customers the opportunity to choose the best technology for each application. Leveraging this technology across both Albin Pump and LMI brands, we continue to execute our multi-brand, multi-channel strategy while expanding our addressable market by over $250 million. Moving to slide 13. Given the solid performance in the first half and continued momentum from backlog, we're again raising our 2023 guidance. As you may recall, during Q1 earnings, we guided an anticipated impact of approximately $20 million of adjusted EBITDA moving out of Q2 and into the back half of the year due to the cybersecurity incident that we experienced in late April. As Vik mentioned earlier, this risk was mitigated within the quarter and no significant revenue or adjusted EBITDA is now expected to have been pushed into the back half. We have included some additional commentary on the bottom right-hand side of the page, outlining the increase in full year guidance incorporating the impact from the Q2 outperformance and the improvement in organic growth expectations in the second half of the year. For the full year, total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 12% and 14%, which is a 200 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 8% to 10%, where price and volume is split approximately 60-40. FX is now expected to be a slight headwind, however, approximately flat on a full year basis. Our revenue from M&A has increased $30 million to approximately $300 million. This increase reflects the impact from all completed and closed M&A transactions as of August 1, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $165 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter throughout the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.69 billion and $1.74 billion, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and up 7% versus our initial guidance. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.70 and $2.80, which is up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate, total interest expense or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, all remain in line with both initial and prior guidance. Turning now to slide 14. As we wrap today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q2 performance and ongoing backlog momentum. We remain nimble. We continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions, and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you for an excellent first half of the year. These results show the impact that each of you have as owners of the company. However, we're still a long way to go, and we need to remain focused on our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your continued hard work, resiliency and focus action. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to invest with the highest return. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. So can we just talk about how the underlying trends you saw through the quarter, maybe any sequential commentary and a focus on where you saw any changes positively or negatively, or is the demand environment essentially cadencing how you would have expected -- on an underlying level? Vicente Reynal : Yeah, I'll say, Mike, we saw the sequential cadence in the quarter, very comparable to what we always see, which is typically lower on month one and kind of starts ramping up through the quarter, and we saw that happening pretty well. So nothing that, we will call anything different out of color. So -- which obviously continues to show that there is good cadence and momentum and that more important for us to as well is the leading indicators. And particularly as we always talk about the MQLs, those marketing qualified leads that we generate with our demand generation engine. And that continues to see good sustainable pace momentum across the product lines, which is encouraging to see. Michael Halloran : And on the PST side, can you just put those orders in context a little bit. I certainly understand the Agritech side and some of the larger projects, orders not repeating. But it sounds like things are healthy when you exclude those 2 pieces. And maybe a little bit of help on how you expect the order trends to track from here and recovery curves in some of those markets? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Sure, Mike. I mean I think you said it very well. I mean, I think what we continue to see that we get excited is that the book and turn business remains pretty strong in the business, which you could call it the short cycle side of the business. And then what we saw here in the quarter, it was just that lumpiness with Agritech with some of our businesses that last year, we're doing on some large projects and also some of the oxygen concentration business that kind of similar to what we spoke in the first quarter of kind of large frame orders that happened last year, not this year. So I guess -- so with that, I think we continue to stay very encouraged. We see that the trend in the PST segment continues to be to deliver that mid-single-digit plus. I mean, there's definitely no over the cycle and over time. So there's no change in that long-term perspective of what we can achieve here in the PST team with the PST segment, and we anticipate continued momentum here. So, yes. Michael Halloran : Thanks, Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Good morning. Maybe first question just around that split of sort of how you see the second half playing out between Q3 and 4. I think the guide embeds are sort of low 70s EPS figure each quarter, but just wondered about how much of that ends up being weighted into Q4 and if there's any big difference between the two segments from that standpoint? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Julian, for total Ingersoll Rand on revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin Q3 looks a lot like Q2. And I'll say for Q3 on a year-over-year basis, remember that comps get increasingly more difficult. And as we think about the segments, ITS, for example, ITS is expected to grow revenue still at low double digit, including the impact of M&A, and as a reminder, I mean, think about that tough comp where Q3 of last year, we grew 19% organically. So that's kind of what we talk about those tough comps. But we still see a good line of sight to about 100 basis points of margin expansion in ITS. And PST is expected to grow mid-single digits. And as a reminder, that's on top of 20% growth in Q3 of 2022 and margins to be expected back again into that 30% level of EBITDA. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just secondly, when you're thinking about the sort of firm-wide orders and backlog trajectory from here across both businesses. Are we thinking sort of orders flattish organically year-on-year in the back half and then the sort of backlog maybe starts to drift down a bit sequentially, just as those lead times shorten. And so sort of customers can adjust their orders a little bit? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Julian, yes, I mean, clearly, we don't specifically guide on orders. But again, as a reminder, our Q3 prior year is probably 1 of the toughest comps for orders. As I recall, Q3 last year was roughly 14% organic order growth momentum, so very solid. In terms of the backlog, I'll say, we do anticipate backlog to drift down a little bit in the back half as we mentioned in the past, I mean, the normal cadence for orders is typically a book-to-bill greater than one in the first half due to larger longer projects and booking in the first half has been -- and booking in the second half being kind of less than one due to those larger orders kind of getting shipped most predominantly in the fourth quarter. Having said that, as a reminder, I think the past nine quarters out of 10 quarters, we had a book-to-bill of greater than one, so -- which obviously speaks again to the comps that we're seeing here. Julian Mitchell : That makes sense. Thanks very much. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hi, good morning. Vicente, can you elaborate a little bit more on your talking about demand in ITS and compressors in particular, you noted reshoring and ESG? I guess on the ESG side, you're pointing to kind of energy efficiency sort of investments and retrofit. But a, is that the case? And b, can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in those two buckets? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Jeff. So absolutely. I mean, again, we're very pleased with the momentum that we saw on the compressor product line, and particularly, you saw that oil-free compressor outpacing the growth and that was kind of high 20s momentum that we saw on the oil-free. So very, very exciting to see that one of the core strategies that we launched continues to actually see some fruit and growth. In terms of ESG, I mean we continue to see that the energy savings, again, based on the return on the investment that we have conversations with customers still is resonating quite well and -- so that momentum continues. Our few earnings ago, we spoke about the air audits that we're doing. We continue to do that at a faster clip than ever before, and that's really driving a lot of good leading data points for us as we see kind of moving forward. And from a reshoring, yes, it's kind of whether you think about reinsuring companies expanding capacity or reallocating their supply chains more locally. I talked about also near-shoring because clearly, in Mexico, we're seeing a lot of expansion too as well. And we have a very strong team as well in Mexico there that is really capturing some good momentum to as well. But this reshoring is happening here in the U.S. We see it, that's why we reopened Buffalo at that time, but we also see it in India, and we see it in China as well. So we see good momentum of companies really investing in the core technologies and in particularly here, the compressor systems. Jeff Sprague : And maybe you could give us a little color on service too, Vicente. I would imagine if customers are going through the air audit process that creates quite an opportunity for service and stickier service attachment on the back end. Where are you at now on service as a percent of revenues? And how is that growing? Vicente Reynal : Yes, absolutely. Jeff, particularly the statistic that we said before is that roughly these are audience, we see kind of a 70-30, 70% leading to new equipment, but 30% leading to actually incremental service revenue. And we've seen good momentum in terms of -- we spoke a lot about Care and the Packaged Care solutions, the team in North America continues to really accelerate that. And we're seeing now better momentum as well in our team in Europe and also in team in Asia. So yes, this continues to be very front and center in our strategy and particularly as we continue to connect more compressors with our remote monitoring devices and be able to capture more recurring revenue here. So yes, we continue to be actually a one that we see good momentum to come. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Hey, good morning. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Rob Wertheimer : Vicente, I think you touched on China, APAC orders and compressors up mid-teens. I think that's comping mid-teens. And so -- I know you called out kind of the good job the team has done there. Is there any particular end market strength in China that's adding to that? I think we've seen China be a drag elsewhere in industrials. And then just in general, I don't know if you can expand on your market position there and the broader efforts you're doing? Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Rob, I think there's definitely some in markets that strategically we're going after more pronouncedly than others because we're seeing the growth in those you could think about electric vehicles, battery production, lithium, mining and things like that. But a lot of that, as you very well said too, as well, it kind of continues to change end markets. And I think the ability for us to pivot from 1 end market that has seen some growth to the other end market that are starting to see the spurt of growth, that is what I think is very core to what the team very nimbly is doing. In addition to that, I think what's exciting is the combination of the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand company, where the team in China is leveraging a lot of the kind of, call it, legacy Gardner Denver products of blowers and the vacuums to really accelerate growth. And that's, as you saw on Slide 5, how we see this organic revenue CAGR of 17% on this kind of core product line and technology. So I'll say, yes, the team is firing on all cylinders this morning as I was driving, I was actually chatting with our leader in China. He's actually -- was actually our -- he was with the team at our innovation center in China and doing a review of their new product technologies and he was living super inspire and excited. So again, it's just a good team, solid performance and very happy with how the team continues to navigate this tough environment in China. Rob Wertheimer : Excellent. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning everyone. Vicente Reynal : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Vicente, could you give us a little more color into the dynamics of your compressor order strength in the sense that, I think, historically, you've had 20% cycle versus 80% short cycle. The long cycle business is currently much stronger than short cycle in one end markets. If you could give us some detail or driving the most order growth right now? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. I would say Andy, maybe not a dramatic change. I mean, maybe instead of being 80-20, could it be 70-30, potentially? Yes. But not in such a dramatic way. So we see good momentum on the long and the short, I think what we're very happy with is the performance of the oil-free. Oil-free, which tends to be higher level of technology, more difficult for others to penetrate. So we still see this as a main market and a product line that we see continued momentum for growth as we continue to take more share in a good way. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful. And then Vik, it looks like it's just a tweak, but I think you actually lowered your incremental margin forecast for the year to 35% versus 35% to 40% previously despite you beating margin in Q2, and I would imagine price versus cost of anything is getting better in the second half versus the first half. So could you give us more color into what you're seeing there? Vik Kini : Sure. Yeah, Andy. I think in terms of the last part of your question on the price cost, like we said before, we were very early in our pricing actions. I think right now, the expectation is the back half looks fairly comparable to how we were guiding before. I wouldn't call that a meaningful change. In terms of the margin tweak as you put it, it's just that, just a minor tweak. A couple of things to note, we did call out that there's some slight increase on corporate cost. We did have -- you saw some of the capital that was deployed to M&A. So we did actually have a technology acquisition that we completed in Q2 that right now, I'd say minimal revenue base to the cost base but one that we're very excited about for the future. So again, when you put those two in perspective, that's probably the meaningful portion there. And as we've always said, we're going to continue to invest in the business. I mean, as Vicente said, whether it be in Asia or anywhere else around the world. We're going to continue to invest in growth resources to drive out-performance from an organic growth perspective as we look forward. So I think that's the way we look at it in totality. But again, nothing in terms of a meaningful change in our opinion, from where we've been operating or prior guidance. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it guys. Vik Kini : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Good morning. Vik Kini : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to maybe just take a different crack at the second half margin question, I think you talked about 3Q looking like 2Q, which makes sense. This feels like the guide doesn't embed much of a kick-up in 4Q and normally 4Q margins are substantially higher on volumes. So just wondering what are you expecting for 4Q. Maybe my math is wrong, that's -- please correct me. But it does feel like we don't have much of a seasonal uplift in 4Q? Vik Kini : Sure. Yeah. So Nigel, I think the way you've described Q3 is correct. If you think about ITS as Vicente earlier said, I think ITS will look fairly comparable to Q2. Now that being said, that still would embed nice margin expansion on a year-over-year basis. And we would expect on the PFT side for margins to get back to that 30% level, specifically in Q3. Now on the Q4 side of the equation, whether you're looking from a total company perspective or the individual components, I think it's actually going to be fairly comparable to what you've seen historically. Seasonally, it is the strongest quarter in the year. That's no different. So you will see a slight seasonal uptick from Q3 to Q4. But there is incremental margin expansion included in the Q4 guide, I would say it's not dramatically different than our prior guide in that respect. And the one thing to probably note here as we look and we got some of the questions about it earlier in terms of the cadence, kind of, like what we said before, we're still, I think, continue to remain prudent on the back half expectations, particularly Q4 on the volume side. And I think we would still acknowledge that's probably the single source of potential upside to the guide as we sit here, thinking specifically about organic volume in Q4. Nigel Coe : Okay, okay. That's fair. And then vacuum -- taking into wiz here, but the vacuum trends remain really strong, compressor. But I think Copco called out a bit of weakness in industrial vacuum, not just semi, but also a little bit of weakness in industrial. And you're obviously not seeing that. So are you seeing any signs of weakness developing in any of your end markets? And is there a reason why vacuum and compressor would be couple? Just curious there. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Nigel, I would say that the industrial vacuum is kind of what we call rough vacuum when you look at the total market segmentation of that. And I will say that we have a more bigger spectrum of technologies, whether it's crew vacuum, rotary vein, liquid ring. So, we will say that we have not only great technologies, but also good brands. In terms of what we're seeing in the market, I'd say stability from what we're seeing. You could argue that sometimes the industrial vacuum plays slightly different where the industrial compressors will pay. So industrial vacuum many times will play in chemical processes or petrochem and things like that, things of that nature. But in our view, we're very happy and very pleased with what the team again continues to do from my self-help initiative here on driving new technologies. I mean we spoke about some of the technologies, again, not only on that slide five on what China team is doing. But now there's also new technologies that the team in Europe are launching to as well to start capturing even more share. So, I'll say that very, very pleased with the performance of the team is driving. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s great color. Thanks a lot. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Hey, good morning guys. Vicente Reynal : Good morning Joe. Vik Kini : Hi Joe. Joe Ritchie : Maybe just following along Nigel's questions around just potential weakness. I know that you're seeing really good order trends across your businesses, but there's a real focus right now on companies that are seeing destocking across their channels. And so maybe just on your shorter cycle businesses, just maybe talk to us about whether you see any kind of risk to any piece of your business today on -- from a channel perspective? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, I'll say maybe -- I'll start with the two big buckets, obviously, the ITS and PST. On the ITS side, a lot of the product -- I say the majority of the product that we have in the ITS is really customized to specific applications. So, it's very difficult to kind of at least on our technology to really have stock of those compressors in the shelves. It's basically high working capital for the distribution channel network that we have. So, we don't see much of that. At the same time, we have a very loyal channel and we have access and visibility to what levels of inventory they have. On the PST side, PST will be the 1 that maybe plays a little bit more on what we call the national distribution, national industrial distribution, at least particularly in the US here. And on those, we track very on a monthly cadence, sell in and sell out. So, we have a visibility on how much we're selling to the channel and how much of that channel is selling out. So at least we get visibility with the level of inventory that is somewhat available in the shelves and whether it is getting destocking or overstocking, we're always proactively trying to prevent the overstocking. It's a situation that we just don't like to be entangled with. So I think -- I'd say we've been fairly proactive from that perspective to making sure that we're watching those trends carefully, nothing of material of note that we're seeing in terms of major destocking. But again, it has to do because there was not a lot of overstocking as well. So -- I don't know that helps, but that's maybe a little bit of color there. Joe Ritchie : No, that's great. I figured as much, but I had to ask the question. So that's helpful color, Vicente. And, I guess, the follow-on question really kind of want to maybe dig into this opportunity, this oil-free hydrogen compressor opportunity. Maybe talk a little bit more about what the opportunity is there and then specifically what the applications are today? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, I mean, I'll say this is a very, very exciting opportunity and one that this, we have now an engineering center inside in our facility in India. We're now considered to be one of the only India companies in India that has the capability of actually testing hydrogen compression systems. Hydrogen is going to be, we think, a good growth vector in the market in India. So we're happy to be the first, and we're happy to be the ones with the largest lab and technology center in India at this point in time, which is the reason why on the prior earnings call, we spoke about the expansion that we're doing. In terms of market sizing, I mean, I think I'd say it's still early stages from the perspective. We don't want to put numbers at -- I mean, obviously, if you kind of trust what market dynamics are saying, these are kind of huge markets, but we're not going to size it here on this call. I think on the Investor Day, we'll definitely give you a little bit more color on this one. But again, this is one super exciting opportunity that technology that the team in India was able to develop and actually work pretty closely with a company in Europe to develop something really unique. And in this case, we were kind of the only company that could achieve the performance requirement that it was required by this technology company. So again, it speaks volumes to the investments that we continue to make in R&D and continued investments that we make in technologies that we think will play well for us in the future. Joe Ritchie : Awesome. Thanks, guys. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Thanks, Joe. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So Q2 really showed strength across all three geographies. And I understand that comps are obviously getting a good deal tougher into the back half of the year and price contribution is easing. But when you look at these three geographies, is there any one or any place where you see demand softening on the leading edge? Vicente Reynal : I mean, I think, Chris, note that our MQLs are demonstrating or showing. We're -- even as we look here into the month of early days in July, I'll say that there continues to be that sustained momentum that we were seeing in the second quarter from an MQL perspective. So noting that we will highlight of specifically end market or maybe, as you said, regional view that has seen a dramatic decline. Again, I think, it's tough comps as we go into the third quarter. I think if I remember the ITS, America teams, I mean, had really hefty double-digit like close to 30% of growth in orders Q3 of last year. So I mean those are the difficult comps that we talk about. But -- having said that, I mean, I think when you think about it in perspective, we have been posting double-digit revenue organic growth for like 9 out of the 10 quarters. So that's kind of what we talk about tough comps. But again, the team continues to perform, execute and control what they can control. Chris Snyder : Yeah. No, I appreciate that. Obviously, with the tough comps, you're trying to sometimes separate like demand from \u2026. Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Chris Snyder : \u2026growth. So I appreciate all that color. And then, I guess kind of following up on that. In prior quarters, you guys talked about basically flat backlog year-on-year to exit the year, building the first half burn in the back half. I know that's still generally the trajectory. But is -- do you still expect not to add any backlog throughout the year, even if we burn a little off in the back half, just does feel like demand may be running a little bit better than expected six months ago? Thank you. Vik Kini : Yeah. Chris, I think right now, our expectation is fairly consistent with what we've kind of messaged before. And you're absolutely right. When we came into the year, we did expect backlog to be largely flat as we look towards the end of the year. But we did explicitly say that, book-to-bill above one in the first half build backlog and then you'd see that kind of drift down, I think, as Vicente mentioned earlier in the second half of the year. And that's very consistent with, I'd say, our typical cadence, our typical seasonality, and based on what we're seeing now, given the level of backlog, but then also kind of the expectations for what we're seeing in the second half of the year. I don't think anything changed in that respect. To the point that was said before, I do think there continues to be an opportunity on the organic volume side, particularly probably more in the Q4 side of the equation, maybe as the upside to guide. But in terms of backlog being flat year in -- at the end of the year compared to where we started, I think that's still a fairly good expectation at this point in time. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Appreciate that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Vik Kini : Hi Joe. Joe O'Dea: Hi. So first, just another one on back half, but the price and volume dynamic within organic, it seems like the way the back half is set up between the quarters, we're looking at pretty similar organic growth, 3Q and 4Q. Just curious, in terms of kind of pricing comps and if what we're thinking about at this point is that it's really volume growth in the back half? Vik Kini : Yeah. Joe, the way I would probably think about it in terms of the back half. I do think if you look on a -- like we said, Q3 will look fairly similar to Q2, particularly on the ITS side, if you're thinking about revenue and bottom-line. I think the way to think about it if you want to kind of think about the two quarters individual. I think the organic growth side will probably be a little bit healthier in Q3 than Q4. Remember, Q4 of last year, we had an exceedingly strong end of the year, particularly in ITS. I think ITS Q4 organic sales growth was in excess of 20%. So again, aside from the kind of timing between the quarters, to your point, we do expect to see pricing continue to, I'd say, normalized in the back half. A lot of that is just, frankly, due to the timing of when we took price increases in the prior year. So we are now lapping that. And we would expect to see price continue to kind of ramp down on a sequential basis, but very consistent with what we said in terms of our original guide. I don't think anything has really changed on that end. And then again, on the volume side, again, volume, we continue to slightly up-tick our volume expectations for the back half, each of our successive guides. This guidance note is no different. And with the backlog, hopefully there's some opportunity to outperform there, as we think about Q4. Joe O'Dea: Got it. And then, Vicente, I think your response to kind of Rob's question was interesting on the ability to pivot to growth. And I'm curious, just in terms of the internal approaches to identifying that growth and how you try to sort of position in advance of it. So it's not so much of chasing the puck, but just being well-positioned for anticipating that. And kind of how far out that goes? I mean, what we can think about what you're doing today in terms of what you anticipate for growth? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Joe you are right. Joe O'Dea: How far out it is? Vicente Reynal : Yeah. No, I love that question. Because we have a team -- I mean, a team for us, the team is like a team of one. But we have two people actually here sitting in our corporate offices that we're currently analyzing like 100-plus micro trends. And these are kind of trends that we're seeing early indicators of potentially becoming good vectors of growth. So that's one avenue how so early. We're looking at these new potential trends. I mean, give you one example could be lithium battery recycling. Clearly, with a lot of the production on electric vehicle and lithium battery production, there's going to come a time that batteries will need to recycle. So we're already looking at the technologies that we can incorporate in those and finding the early-stage development processes where we can actually incorporate a lot of our technologies and products. So -- and to think about it, I mean, we have about 100 of those kind of micro trends that at any point in time, we're analyzing and then we're leveraging our demand generation team to get close and closer to those customers to better understand how can we help and participate on those early trends. That's just one example of kind of how early we can do it. And then obviously, as you go to a country like China, I mean, the team, every year, we reassess the end markets that we expect to see a higher growth and then with pivot resources and technologies. And again, demand generation to be able to start attacking those early indications that we're seeing. Joe O'Dea: Very helpful. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Most of mine have been answered today, but I guess one thing that I want to dig into is just I think there's concern among investors about potential slowing in Europe. So I mean it sounds like everything from your commentary is going pretty well there, but if we could just dig into that a little bit on what you're seeing? Thanks. Vicente Reynal : Yeah, Nicole, I'd say continues to see good momentum. But again, I think I always like to put it in perspective in terms of the self-help that we're driving ourselves. It doesn't mean that the total market is actually seeing the same momentum as we're seeing. I mean we're definitely outgrowing the market by a lot of the focus that we're doing on these kind of vectors of growth that we're finding and whether it is in France, going after -- how can our technologies help with nuclear facilities and revamping that or in Germany. How -- whether LNG or the hydrogen push is actually helping us to refocus some of the technologies in that. So we get kind of variance on that kind of micro level for us to be able to decipher the best way for achieving that growth. So that's why we think that the view that we put out in this economic growth engine on how we kind of follow secular trends and leverage things like demand generation obviously, IoT, which we're very excited in terms of accelerating. We've been feeding a lot of new machines in the field and now how we're going to harvest all that packaged care and recurring service work that we can do because we're connecting machines. So there's multiple of places where we can find good growth that as you kind of add all these little buckets of growth kind of create a meaningful good growth momentum for us. Nicole DeBlase : Understood. Thanks Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Yeah. Thank you, Nicole. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Reynal, I'll turn the call back over to you. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Thank you. I just would like to end by thanking and acknowledging again all of our employees for their hard work, being helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. We're counting on our team to continue to execute, we're counting that we know that IRX continues to be our differentiator. And IRX, as we said, is rooted in our unique ownership model. So again, thanks for listening to our call and appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ingersoll Rand Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Fort : Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2023 third quarter earnings call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will reference these during the call, both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2023 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks Matthew and good morning to all. I would like to start, as we always do, by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q3. Despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, our employees continue to deliver on our commitments and consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners. I would also like to welcome our new employees from our recent acquisitions, Oxywise, Fraserwoods, Roots and [indiscernible]. Beginning on Slide 3, fueled by our competitive differentiator, IRX, in the third quarter, we again delivered double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We remain nimble and focused on controlling what we can control and continue to direct our demand generation activities towards high-growth sustainable end markets to accelerate market share gains. Finally, based on our continued robust performance year-to-date, we are once again raising our 2023 full year guidance. As we move to Slide 4, our economic growth engine is the key to delivering compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in November 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic and quality of earnings growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets as outlined on this page. In fact, we have so far exceeded our growth and margin commitments, including an organic orders and revenue CAGR of 12% and margin expansion of 170 basis points per year over the last three years. On the next slide, I will provide you with deeper insights into how we are accelerating organic growth in previously acquired businesses. So turning to the page to Slide 5. Here, we have some examples of how we have driven outsized organic growth and margin expansion from recently acquired M&A. This is a testament to how we compound growth on recently acquired businesses and have examples from both our ITS and PST segments. On the left-hand side of the page, we're highlighting our LeROI acquisition from June of 2017. We acquired this business for a purchase multiple of 11 times by pivoting our end market focus to high-growth, sustainable end markets, offering a complete ecosystem solution and leveraging our commercial footprint we have achieved over 540% growth since the time of acquisition. In addition, our post-tax ROIC is 155% resulting in a 0.5 times post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple. Just an impressive result on how and what we can do with technologies once we incorporate them into our IRX process. On the right-hand side of the page is our Air Dimension business, which was acquired in November of 2021, also at an 11 times purchase multiple. Air Dimension serves high-growth sustainable end markets like environmental services. And the team has delivered 27% revenue growth over the last two years by leveraging IRX, rapidly integrating our demand generation process and launching new innovative technologies. And given the outsized growth this business has delivered over the past two years, we're very well on track to exceed our three-year post-tax ROIC target demonstrated by already delivering a post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple of 8x. Next, on Slide 6, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy to compound value similar to the examples we displayed on the previous slide. We're pleased to highlight two recent closed transactions. With these two acquisitions, we have closed on approximately $190 million of annualized inorganic revenue, which puts us very close to the bottom end of the $200 million to $300 million of annualized inorganic revenue targets we set forth at the beginning of the year, and we have no doubt in our ability to deliver our target this year. Let me walk you through these two recent acquisitions. First, Oxywise, which is based in Slovakia, is a leading provider of on-site oxygen and nitrogen generation systems. This acquisition expands our technology ecosystem with a complementary product to the compressor and increases Ingersoll Rand's broader air treatment capabilities in point-of-use oxygen generation. Next is Fraserwoods, which is a leading provider of aftermarket services for blowers and pumps in the vacuum truck market. This acquisition expands Ingersoll Rand's technical expertise and service capabilities in Western Canada. Our M&A funnel remains very strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five times larger than it was at the time of the RMT. The characteristics of the target in our funnel continue to be bolt-on in nature with the exception of a couple that are approximately $1 billion purchase price. On Slide 7, as highlighted in the middle of the page, we continue to be recognized for our corporate responsibility and we're proud that 3BL Media recently named us as one of the top 100 best corporate citizens in 2023. We're recently ranked on the Top 3% Among the Russell 1000. Being a corporate citizen is part of our high-performance employee ownership culture. Our company purpose of making life better is deeply ingrained into everything we do, including partnerships with community-focused organizations such as the American Heart Association, FeedNC, Drop In The Bucket, and La Escuelita Bilingual Preschool. In addition to striving to be a responsible corporate citizen, we're thrilled to be named Best Companies to Work for in industrials and business service sector, receiving high marks in employee sense of belonging. We believe our employee ownership model drives increased employee engagement. And as a long-term shareholder, it creates economic opportunity for our employees and their families. I will turn now the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks Vicente. On Slide 8, fueled by IRX, we again delivered record results in Q3 through a balance of commercial and operational execution. Total company organic revenue increased 6% year-over-year with incremental margins of 38%. Book-to-bill was 0.94x, which was in line with expectations. As a reminder, we typically see book-to-bill above 1 in the first half of the year due to the longer cycle, large project orders received and a book-to-bill below 1 in the second half as those large longer-cycle projects convert into revenue. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 6% year-over-year. The strength in our backlog provides good visibility and momentum as we move into the fourth quarter of 2023 and begin to look towards 2024. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $462 million, a 23% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.5%, a 170 basis point year-over-year improvement. It is important to note that these results are closely approaching our long-term targets set forth during our 2021 Investor Day. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.77, up 24% versus the prior year. Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $369 million, up 46% versus the prior year. Free cash flow margins for the quarter finished at 21%. Total liquidity at quarter end was $3.2 billion, which was flat compared to the prior quarter. And our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 0.9 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than both the prior year and prior quarter. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q3 orders declined 2% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 23% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 260 basis points, while the PST segment margin improved 120 basis points. Notably, both segments remain price cost dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at approximately $44 million for the quarter, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 24% to $0.77 per share. This $0.15 year-over-year increase includes a $0.03 headwind from interest expense. And finally, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22%. Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $369 million, including CapEx, which totaled $29 million. Total company liquidity was $3.2 billion based on approximately $1.2 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $308 million deployed to M&A, largely driven by the acquisition of Roots. We returned $8 million to shareholders in dividends and no share repurchases were made during the third quarter, although we remain committed to our annual share repurchase plan of approximately $250 million for the full year. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash for the foreseeable future. We continue to have an active and healthy funnel of inorganic growth opportunities. This funnel consists primarily of bolt-on M&A, relatively similar in size, scope and nature to the assets we've acquired over the past two to three years. Turning to Slide 11. As we have always planned, we continue to transform our debt portfolio. After being upgraded to an investment-grade credit rating across all three rating agencies, we refinanced $1.5 billion of secured term loans through the issuance of unsecured investment-grade bonds in the quarter. Our capital structure continues to evolve and is designed to facilitate our capital allocation strategy, and we remain committed to having a fully unsecured investment-grade capital structure in the near future. As a result of this debt portfolio transformation, we have improved our fixed-to-floating ratio to 74% fixed and 26% floating, and our weighted average maturity on debt has moved from four years to six years. Finally, on an annualized basis, our interest expense has been reduced by approximately $20 million. This should deliver an annualized improvement of approximately $0.04 of earnings per share, which will be realized across both 2023 and 2024. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results. Vicente Reynal : Thanks Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 9.5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.8%, up 260 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin of 42%. I would like to take a minute to note that these high 20s adjusted EBITDA margins are in line with our 2025 long-term targets set during our Investor Day in 2021. So we're almost two years ahead of schedule in terms of achieving these results. Book-to-bill remains on track and finished in line with expectations at 0.94 times. Consistent with previous guidance, we anticipate a book-to-bill of approximately one times for the year. As a reminder, we typically see a book-to-bill of above 1 in the first half as larger longer-cycle orders are placed and below 1 in the second half as those larger longer cycle orders are shipped. Organic orders came in line with our expectations, down 8.7% as we are comping high teens organic orders growth from Q3 last year. Therefore, it is good to highlight that on a two-year stack for the third quarter, ITS organic orders have grown 8%. Moving to the product line highlights. Product lines continued to show strong momentum on a two-year stack, excluding FX and also excluding the recent acquisitions of SPX Air Treatment and Roots' blowers. On a two-year stack, compressor orders were up low double digits and revenue was up mid-30s. Industrial Vacuum and Blower orders were up mid-teens and revenue was up low 30s. And the Power Tools and Lifting was up low double digits on both orders and revenue. For additional detail information on product lines and regional splits, we have moved the chart which was previously included on this page to Slide 17 in the appendix. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting a new oil-free compressor, recently launched in North America. This product is a great example of Ingersoll Rand leveraging i2V to deliver new products with best-in-class efficiency. This IIoT ready compressor is 14% more efficient than the previous model, and it is 5% more efficient than the competition. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment declined 5% mechanically. The decline in orders and revenue were primarily driven by the Life Science business, which continues to experience softness in the oxygen concentration and biopharma end markets. We remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business and short cycle orders in the industrial businesses were positive both sequentially and year-over-year. The increases in the short-cycle business were driven by demand generation activities and lead time reductions. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments as illustrated on the chart on the bottom left-hand side of the page. The three-year organic order and revenue CAGR of 5% and 7%, respectively, are in line with the long-term Investor Day targets of mid-single-digit plus growth. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $94 million, which is up 2% year-over-year despite declines in revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.3%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. The continued year-over-year improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margins is driven primarily by price cost improvements and synergy delivery on acquired businesses. For our PSP innovation in action, we're highlighting our YZ brand partnership with the largest natural gas transmitter in Europe, GRDF. During the second quarter of 2023, we executed a 10-year contract with GRDF to provide mission-critical odorization equipment for renewable natural gas or RNG. We're very excited about this partnership and believe that there are plenty of future growth opportunities as the European Union has committed to replacing 20% of lost Russian gas supply with RNG over the next six to seven years. Moving to Slide 14. Given the year-to-date solid performance and continued momentum from backlog, we're once again raising our 2023 guidance. For the full year, total company revenue is expected to grow between 14% and 16%, which is a 200 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 9% to 11%, where price and volume remains split approximately 60/40. FX is now expected to show a slight headwind of approximately 1% on a full year basis. Our revenue from M&A has increased by $60 million to approximately $360 million for the full year. This increase reflects the impact from all completed and closed M&A transactions as of November 1st, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $170 million for the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.73 billion and $1.77 billion, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and up 9% versus our initial guidance at the midpoint. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.81 and $2.89, which is up 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. We're also reaffirming a book-to-bill of approximately one for the full year, which puts us in a solid position as we look to enter 2024. Based on our current full year outlook, backlog will finish at near record level highs, and we will end the year with approximately 40% higher backlog compared to the balance at the end of 2021. As Vik had mentioned earlier on the call, interest expense is now projected at $155 million, with a portion of the interest expense savings from the debt restructuring being realized in 2023. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue. They remain in line with both initial and prior guidance. On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we included some additional commentary, specifically around Q4. We do expect organic orders to be positive both sequentially and year-over-year. In addition, we anticipate all organic revenue to be positive in both price and volume year-over-year. Incremental margins are expected to be approximately 35% for both Q4 and the full year. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position, and we're proving how resilient we are even in difficult macro environment. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our year-to-date performance and ongoing backlog momentum. To our employees, I want to thank you for another quarter of record results. These results show the impact each of you have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. We will remain focused on our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine using IRX. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return. We remain nimble and continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions and are prepared for the challenges that may come. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the call up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead. Mike Halloran : Hey good morning everyone. Vicente Reynal : Good morning Mike. Mike Halloran : So, a couple of questions here. First, could you just put the order trajectory and trends in context for us? I certainly understand some of the life science stuff. But when you look at more of the industrial assets you have, why the confidence in the order recoveries as you look to the fourth quarter? Are you seeing any signs of software that points to the portfolio? And how do you think about the underlying momentum of the business as we look in 2024? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Mike, so maybe a couple of things here first. As we mentioned earlier on the call, I mean, Q3 -- what we saw in Q3 is really -- on a year-over-year is really been in large due to the tough comps from prior year as you saw kind of Q2 -- Q3 of 2022, ITS was up 16% and PST up 3%. So also Q3 orders finished in line with the expectations that we had even to your other question about what we were seeing underlying demand. We made a reference that even on the PST side, when you look at the short cycle business, which is really more driven by industrial side, I mean, we saw sequentially that business to be -- short cycle industrial being up Q2 to Q3 and also up year-over-year from an order perspective organically. I will also highlight that even our ITS segment, when you look at Mainland Europe, Q3 order momentum was actually higher than Q2. So, we still feel that the underlying businesses are performing to our expectations. We also, as you know, really look at this from an MQL perspective, the marketing qualified leads, we see stability, we see solid kind of continued momentum on that. And as we kind of head into the fourth quarter, the level of confidence on what we said about orders sequentially being up and also on a year-over-year is driven by a lot of these kind of data points as well as long cycle visibility that we have coming into the fourth quarter. Mike Halloran : Thanks for that. And then on the M&A side of things, I certainly appreciate all the color you gave on the slide on LOIs and funnel and everything like that. My question more is, have you seen any change in tone with the people you're interacting with from an interest rate perspective, lack of visibility on maybe where the demand picture is? Does that help to hurt the thought process and the conversations? And maybe just some thoughts on the sentiment around the people you're talking to and how you should think about close rates? Vicente Reynal : Yes, no different, Mike. I will say that the sentiment has been on the positive side for us as buyers and acquirers. And as you well know, a lot of our M&A is sole source driven by a lot of the outreach that we do to, in many cases, family owned companies. And I think the -- what you continue to see in the market for the macro environment, I think that is really enticing and encouraging others to really think about how to transition those multi-generation family companies to a great company like ours, where, as you know, we do a lot of work around employee ownership, employee engagement, and that's a big attractive factor for a lot of these companies to transition to us. So I think we're seeing continued very strong activity on the M&A. Mike Halloran : Great. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe -- so looking at the fourth quarter guide, it looks like it's sort of mid-single-digit organic sales growth and mid-30s incremental margin. I just wondered, as the Q4 probably represents a somewhat more normal price/cost and somewhat more normal sort of demand environment in the last year or two. So, as we look ahead, should we assume that, that sort of mid-30s operating leverage is a good placeholder for the period beyond Q4? And on the organic top line, maybe there's a little bit less price next year than in Q4, but that sort of low to mid-single-digit rate is a good starting point for sales growth? Vik Kini : Yes, Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think you're spot on both accords. In terms of the operating leverage, we've indicated whether it be Q4 or full year, and we've kind of been holding pretty steady to this, that mid-30s, call it, roughly 35% incrementals range is where we expect to operate in. And that's very consistent with I think where you've seen us historically, ITS maybe slightly on the higher side, but we think a mid-30s range is right kind of where we would expect to play, not just now, but on the go forward as well. And then in terms of the pricing side of the equation, yes, obviously, you've seen much more elevated price realization over the last few years. But quite frankly, you've seen a lot of that now starting to get comped and now you're falling into a much, I'd say, more normalized lower single-digit realm. And we would expect that kind of 1% to 2% net price to be a good proxy as we move into 2024. So yes, I think you're spot on, on both. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just my quick follow-up. PST specifically, it can be tricky from the outside to understand the moving parts on the revenue there, and you called out Vicente that the short-cycle industrial bid is pretty good. The biopharma bid is still bad, which everyone else has iterated as well. What's your sort of best view of that biopharma piece from here? And kind of how large is that medical piece now of PST as we exit this year? I think when we look at next year, some people have talked about a V-shape in biopharma. It's not obvious to me why that would happen at all, but just wanted your perspectives. Vicente Reynal : Sure Julian. So maybe a couple of things I'll say too as well. So when you think about the PST, think about it as -- even when you exclude the life science business, PST on 10 out of the 11 past quarters has been positive on organic orders and actually all organic revenue. So that tells you kind of the good strength of the rest of the PST segment. I mean clearly, the life science, which is roughly about a quarter of the PST has been on this kind of situation with biopharma, but also oxygen concentration. And the life science business has been pretty negative organic order growth momentum for probably the past six quarters. So it's been now a little while, while the non-life sciences has been positive. So, yes, I mean, we're experiencing these challenges that others have indicated on our life sciences. I mean, I think the way we think about it is that for us, biopharma, yes, we have some exposure. But it's not the biggest piece of our life science end market exposure within the PST. The biggest exposure for us is really oxygen concentration. And the oxygen concentration, when you think about it, really a great acceleration during the COVID days, and is the one that we saw building into negative, more pronounced earlier than even the biopharma. So it was almost like a leading indicator for us. So, as we kind of go here into the fourth quarter and maybe in the first half of next year, we see that more so next year maybe an uptick, not in a V-shape, but continue doing better from an oxygen concentration side of the business. So, we continue to think that PST, as even you saw on that segment slide, I mean, PST CAGR growth organically, revenue and orders momentum continues to be a segment that we'll see that mid-single-digit plus over the cycle and over time. I mean, it's with great characteristics on continuing to improve in that. So Again, I don't think it's going to be a V-shape, but even if it's a V-shape, it's not one that -- again, we don't have that big exposure into biopharma. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Vicente Reynal : Morning. Jeff Sprague : Hey Vicente, maybe elaborate a little bit on kind of this visibility on long-cycle orders that you mentioned in Q4. And kind of the spirit of my question is, we've heard from a few companies this earnings season, electrical companies, HVAC companies that kind of the mega project pipeline is building and becoming more visible. But there haven't been a lot of orders booked yet, and they're just starting to kind of come into kind of the booking cycle. Are you seeing any of that sort of dynamic? Or maybe, if not, maybe share a little bit more color on kind of the nature of the long-cycle orders you are starting to see come into view? Vicente Reynal : Yes, I think Jeff, that's exactly what I was trying to refer to there is that we're seeing definitely before if you remember a few quarters or even last year, we spoke a lot about a lot of these kind of large projects that were being in conversations. And now we're seeing definitely the release of some of those funds. And so yes, so that's what's giving us a bit of a higher level of confidence in terms of how the long cycle funnel continues to build in a company that gives us a good level of visibility, I'll say, not only Q4 but also as we go into 2024. Jeff Sprague : And then I think it was Vik, maybe it was you talking about deals saying there's a couple of billion dollar things in the pipeline. It sounds like you expect bolt-ons most likely, which would be, I guess, natural. But maybe kind of a little bit of color on what's going on in the bigger deals and the likelihood of getting something done in that size range? Vicente Reynal : Yes. So, that's right. I mean we said on the call that we -- and the funnel continues to be really strong and mostly bolt-on in nature, but there's a couple that are above $1 billion purchase price. And I'll say that those are very well in line with our M&A strategy. We should not think about it as being a third leg of the company. For competitive reasons, we don't want to kind of get into a lot of details, but we feel very comfortable with kind of even where we are from a balance sheet perspective and being less than one time on our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. It actually puts us in a very strong position to move forward with this transaction. But yes, we're very excited with how the M&A funnel continues to build and what we see in terms of getting things executed here over the next couple of quarters. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning everyone. Vicente Reynal : Morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Vicente, can you give us more color on what you're seeing by geography? I think you've been very active in really generating market share gains in your own demand in regions such as China and Europe. Are you confident for instance, that Chinese compressor growth will remain positive? And obviously, I think EMEIA compressor orders turned down, but I don't think you have big exposure to Germany, but how are you thinking about EMEIA as well? Vicente Reynal : Sure, Andy. So first of all, on the Chinese compressor, I mean, clearly, not surprisingly, the overall China market has continued to be, I'll say, choppy and soft; however, you saw how we deliver. The team in Asia-Pacific, and particularly in China, again, demonstrated one more time, another quarter of kind of growth organically in the compressor side from an orders and revenue perspective, which speaks to the continued self-help that the team is driving and leading relative to the overall performance in the market, and we'll clearly share more examples of that as we head into the Investor Day. I'll say in Europe, no significant changes in demand. I mean MQL activities remain solid. We continue to focus on our own demand generation for high-growth sustainable end markets, our economic engine is working. And as I made in the remarks, I mean, we saw even orders sequentially in Mainland Europe come for the compressor side actually grew sequentially Q2 to Q3. So that gives us continued encouragement that, again, these self-help initiatives are working. And this kind of year-over-year tough comps is one that we're just not worried about, as we see the underlying demand continue based on the self-help. Andy Kaplowitz : And Vicente, maybe just following up on that. As the environment has been normalizing and interest rates are up here a little bit at least in the US, your focus on energy efficiency and sustainability through your products, how do customers -- when you have conversations with customers, how do they balance sort of maybe higher cost of financing versus your ability to provide them energy efficiency and sustainability, that's still trumping the higher cost? Vicente Reynal : Yes, I'll say Andy, it's all about that ROI and the payback. And as customers prioritize CapEx as they go into 2024 and beyond, it's all going to be all about ROI. No different to how we do it ourselves internally. And these energy savings, energy efficiency is definitely driving the conversation at the top even at the C-suite level now where customers are looking for what could do -- what can they do to drive this great payback. So again, this is how our sales guys sell. They sell based on total cost of ownership and ROI. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. Just to kind of follow up on a couple of those comments because I think what you've done in China has been impressive and maybe increasingly so. Is the market in China weakening? Do you have any sense of the outperformance gap that you've been able to deliver, as it's not widening the continued growth in the market that's kind of blown up a few results this quarter is great? And have you seen a competitive response? And if I may, Vicente, your comments on New York are relatively constructive. Are they meant to reflect IRX and how you're generating better orders in a softening market? Or are you really just not seen softening? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Great. I think the two that are pretty well tied. I mean I think IRX is definitely what is helping us drive this outperformance that we're seeing against as the backdrop in the market. And even when you think about it, that ISM and PMIs have been below 50, and we still have been able to deliver over the past few quarters, really great strength in orders and revenue momentum. I think that is what gives us that uniqueness in terms of leveraging IRX as a differentiator. And clearly, we're not immune to the market, but it's all about controlling what we can control, and this is what our teams have done exceptionally well, guided and driven by how we leverage IRX as the execution engine to overdrive. And to the China slowdown question there, Rob, I'll say that China continues to be very soft and choppy. I was in China -- I've been in China now twice over the past five months, and -- just to see it myself firsthand. And I think what the teams continue to do there is just incredible. But as we always said, we're in China for China, and that is really also helping from a strategy perspective because we're being viewed in the China market as a local -- almost like a local player, obviously, with a great reputation of a multinational and the great quality and innovation that we're launching. But again, it's a lot of self-help that we're getting executed through the use of IRX. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks guys. Good morning. A couple as well. You covered a lot of ground. On PST, maybe could you just remind us after this, obviously, this correction where is biopharma as a proportion of that segment now? And then on the fourth quarter in PST, I think we're assuming a minus 5% to, I think, low to mid-single-digit growth there. I think the step up from Q3 to Q4 is a bit heavier than normal. So just wondering what you're seeing near term driving that improvement? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Nigel, first on the PST, overall life science is about a quarter of the PST segment. And biopharma, it is, maybe -- I'll say maybe I don't know, maybe a third of that quarter and the big life science here for us, more so is on the oxygen concentration side of the equation. I think it's important to note that when you look at PST segment ex life science, we have been able to kind of put organic orders and revenue positive momentum on 10 out of the last 11 quarters. So, that kind of shows the good strength and diversity of that segment, that gives us confidence on that overall over the long cycle or cycle the mid-single-digit plus. Vik Kini : Yes. And I think your second part of your question was the sequential movement from Q3 to Q4? Nigel Coe : That's right. Yes. Yes. Vik Kini : Yes. Yes, I think we do expect to see, what I'll say, a slight nominal uptick from Q3 to Q4. I would remind you that this business doesn't, I would say, have a tremendous amount of seasonality comparatively speaking to other businesses. It's a relatively consistent quarter to quarter. But that being said, I'd say a combination of a couple of things. One, still continue to have a relatively healthy backlog, and that is reflected in terms of what we expect to ship in Q4 as well as Vicente indicated, relatively healthy and good, strong momentum on the, what I'll call, the industrial side of the business, where you continue to see good order intake in Q3, and we would expect to see that continue into Q4. So again, for those reasons, we would expect to see a slight nominal uptick from Q3 to Q4. I'd say relatively consistent to what you've seen historically. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's great. Thanks Vik. And then on the -- I mean, Jeff asked the question as well, but I just want to follow up on a couple of the $1 billion type transactions. Are these typical properly sourced negotiated deals? Or are these more sort of investment banking driven auction-type processes? Vicente Reynal : No, they're property sourced. I mean they are ones that we have been cultivating for quite some time. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. Good luck with that. thanks. Vicente Reynal : Yes, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Hey guys, good morning. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Hey Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey. So just a lot of color today. Thank you. Just as you're kind of thinking through the book-to-bill and the order rates as you head into 2024, so is the expectation then that in the first half of 2024, we would expect a book-to-bill in IPS to be above one again, orders to continue to expand just based on what you're seeing today in your MQL? Vik Kini : Joe, yes, I think obviously, we're not going to get into guidance for 2024 yet, but I think the construct remains consistent with what you indicated. I think in generally any degree of a typical year, book-to-bill above 1 through the first half of the year, particularly as that longer cycle kind of orders funnel continues to progress through. And then book-to-bill below 1, what I'd say, a combination of normal seasonality combined with the longer cycle, larger project shipping through the back half, that will typically led to that normal dynamic of book-to-bill above 1 in the first half and below 1 in the second half. Right now, no reason to think anything differently for 2024. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. And then maybe just a follow-up to that. Are you guys like hearing any concerns around projects pushing out a little bit to the right, just given what the rate environment looks like today and there's been a -- there's been, I think, a lot of concern in the market with certain end markets, at least like seeing projects push to the right, like the renewable sector. I'm just curious what you're seeing specifically in the conversations that you're having with your customers? Vicente Reynal : Joe, I'll say nothing of significant or material change. And if anything, when we -- if we see projects pushed to the right, it is really mainly due to sites not been ready which has been more driven by finding the labor to just get the sites on track and be done having heard much about the context of interest rates being the driver for getting these projects pushed to the right. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Joe O'Dea: I wanted to start on just resource allocation planning for 2024. And I think you've got a model that allows you to be pretty nimble as you sort of exploit growth where growth is. And so what are you doing now? What's kind of underway in terms of how you want to position those resources. And thinking from a geographic perspective, from an end market perspective, where you see growth is most attractive and how you're positioning for that? Vicente Reynal : Hey Joe, it's an interesting question. I -- again, and also maybe a few weeks ago, we were actually -- we were together with our team -- our demand generation team in Poland where we had a long week session, particularly thinking and looking at what are we seeing today and what do we expect to see in 2024? And how do we position the next level of demand generation activities to really position us in good strength as we go into 2024? So, all of that work is undergoing. I can tell you that -- the one level of detail, I'll tell you, as you kind of double click on that is that it varies region-by-region and even country -- in countries within the region. Like for example, in Mainland Europe, what we might be doing in France is very different from what we might be doing in the UK. And a lot of that is driven by what we're seeing at the micro level. So that's the level of detail that we undergo and we, as a team, kind of put together to really understand those best growth vectors that we're seeing at the micro level versus not keeping it at the macro, which if you do it at the macro is, you're going to get a few products wrong. So, that's the exciting piece. As a team, we kind of get together, and we feel that we're in pretty good momentum here to start 2024 in a good shape. Joe O'Dea: Appreciate it. And then I just wanted to ask on the ROI side and the examples you gave on the oil-free compressor and 14% more efficient than the previous model. And just any more perspective on when that previous model would have been launched to get a sense of would customers be it sort of a natural kind of replacement stage? Or what about that ROI is compelling such that the payback would encourage them to replace ahead of the natural aging of the prior model system? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Joe, I would say that right now, ROIs -- and again, it could vary by region, but we're seeing ROIs between 12 to 15 months. So it's a really great payback, again, driven by a combination of energy efficiency, but also driven by higher energy costs. So, I think it's just one of those that we're driving really hard. And customers, when they see a payback of 12 to 15 months or call it, less than two years and combine that with the sustainability and what many of them had to do with Scope 1 and Scope 2 is the other kind of great factor that gives us a great tailwind. Joe O'Dea: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to ask on the fourth quarter. The guide -- a pretty wide range of outcomes in the organic growth guide, anywhere from down 1% to up 6% by my math. Can you just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes or the variables that would drive the range of outcomes from the high end to the low end? Thank you. Vik Kini : Yes. Sure, Chris. What I would probably tell you here is we kind of view it as probably, frankly, a bit of a tighter spread than that. But if I take it by the two components, and maybe I'll talk kind of year-over-year based on the guide here. Like we said, we do expect to see positive organic growth that includes across both segments, starting on the ITS side. If you're thinking, the guide would imply something in the range of roughly approximately 3% organic growth year-over-year. Again, given the pricing momentum we've seen as well as an expectation of organic volume growth, you can probably think of it as roughly speaking, two-thirds price, one-third volume. And I think I would fall back on kind of exactly what we said all year is that if there's kind of an upside opportunity in the context of the guide and as we think about Q4, it would really be that organic volume side of the equation, particularly on the -- I'm sorry, on the ITS side, where again, backlog continues to remain at effectively record levels. On the PST side, I'll go back to kind of some of the commentary we made earlier here. Again, continue to expect to see organic -- positive organic growth, probably a little bit more of a pricing tailwind comparatively speaking to what you've seen in ITS. And I would just really frankly attribute that more so to what we've said over the course of the last one to two years. ITS probably got out a little bit quicker than PST on the pricing front. And as such, now PST probably has a little bit of a longer-lasting tail on the pricing side of the equation. But again, those would be kind of the dynamics we would expect. But again, we would expect to see positive on both sides of the equation effectively falling at the midpoint of the guide as you saw us make in the prepared comments. Chris Snyder : Thank you for that. Really, really helpful. Maybe for my follow-up, just on prior commentary around the expecting sequential order improvement into Q4, it doesn't really seem like that's seasonal. It seems like typically, Q4s are similar to Q3, if not lower. So, should we take that? Is that just around timing of some of these bigger projects coming through? Or is that a signal of demand is at least stabilizing, if not improving? Thank you. Vik Kini : Yes, I would actually say it's probably a function of both. So for example, if you go back to last year, we acknowledged and you heard Vicente say in the prepared comments, Q3 was kind of a peak from an orders perspective in the context of some of these longer-cycle orders, some biogas orders, some things we saw last year that created that tough comp, right? And we did see -- we even indicated last year that think about it more on a second half basis, where you saw Q4 orders kind of normalize comparatively speaking to Q3. Now you're kind of facing the other side of that equation. So obviously, very tough comps in Q3, which we acknowledged. You saw that kind of play itself out. And now as you think Q3 to Q4, I think a combination of consistent, stable kind of MQLs, stable demand patterns, some of the longer cycle dynamics that Vicente spoke to. I think that sets up for what we're expecting to see in terms of the positive trajectory, both from Q3 to Q4 as well as on a year-over-year basis. Is there some degree of seasonality that is particularly a little bit more on the ITS side? Yes. I guess, obviously, with some of the other noise, you haven't necessarily seen that as prevalent, particularly in the last few years. But I wouldn't speak to any dramatic seasonality of no point itself out this year, whether it be ITS or PST. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead. Adam Farley : Thank you. This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. My first question is on channel inventory. What, if any, impact of channel inventory correction having on your business? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Adam, I would say, again, given the highly customized nature of our products, there's really no material risk on the destocking that serves -- that kind of serves really well for the ITS segment. And for the PST segment on those businesses that kind of sell through distribution, we monitor really closely the sell-in and the sell-through or the sell-out activities to ensure that we prevent our customers from getting into an overstock situation. And we -- we have been doing this that way for probably -- I mean, we have data points over the past five years to really have a good view as to what's going on in the distribution channel. Adam Farley : Okay, that makes sense. And then on my follow-up, the Power Tools and Lifting business continues to show really solid growth. That business has really improved under your ownership. So, what's driving the strength there? And I believe that business has been considered noncore in the past. So, maybe could you provide an update on, are you thinking about the portfolio and the potential for portfolio rationalization? Vicente Reynal : Sure. So you're absolutely right that the PTL business has really done incredibly well. And to point out, when we acquired Ingersoll Rand, PTL came in with mid-teens EBITDA margin and now it's pretty close to that ITS kind of blended average kind of get getting to that point. So great improvement while still growing the business. The real nature of a lot of this performance has really been new product introduction. So, the team has done a really great job of reinvigorating new product. And I think the exciting piece here is that as we look into 2024, they're going to be launching a next-generation set of tools as well as lifting mechanisms that we think could continue to see some good performance. Adam Farley : Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I will turn the call back over to Vicente for closing remarks. Vicente Reynal : Great. Thanks, everyone, for your level of interest. And as we said on the call, I want to thank, again, all of our 20,000 employees across Ingersoll Rand who are owners of Ingersoll Rand, and have a great performance here as we kind of close the year and as we go into 2024. So, thanks again for the interest and look forward to catching up with many of you. Thank you, thank you, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday afternoon, and we will reference these during the call, both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide full year 2024 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks Matthew and good morning to all. I would like to begin by acknowledging and thanking our employees for their hard work in helping us deliver another record year in 2023. We finished the year on a high note with strong fourth quarter and full year results, despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Our 2023 performance reinforces the impact our employee ownership mindset has for Ingersoll Rand. I would also like to welcome our new employees from our recent acquisition of Friulair, whom I had the chance to visit last week in Italy. I was very impressed by the entrepreneurial and technological spirit that has made this company grow at an impressive organic CAGR of 15% over the past three years. Starting on Slide 3, in 2023, we demonstrated again how we continue to outperform against our long-term Investor Day commitments with double-digits growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. As we move to 2024, demand remains solid. And while macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continue to be at the top of everyone's mind. We remain agile and focus on what we can control. IRX is our competitive differentiator and combined with our ownership model, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our commitments. We recently held our Investor Day this past November, and I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a couple of important highlights that we presented. On Slide 4, we highlighted how we deliver compounding results through our economic growth engine. With the use of IRX, we have created an increasingly durable financial profile underpinned by our employee ownership model. Since 2016, we have transformed the company into a premier growth compounder. We have reduced the cyclicality through divesting our club car and HBS businesses and reinvested approximately $2.3 billion into accreative acquisitions focused on high growth sustainable end markets. Today, our balance sheet is stronger than ever and we enter 2024 well positioned to build upon our progress to date. Moving to the next page, we show how we are uniquely positioned to grow market share within the $55 billion of highly fragmented addressable markets we currently play. The combination of our product portfolio, multi-channel, multi-brand strategy, massive install base and unmatched commercial and operational footprint provides an exceptional foundation for continued market share growth, both organically and inorganically.  On Slide 6, we demonstrate how we remain committed to delivering financial performance, while also doing good for the planet and our community. On the left hand side of the page, we have some very exciting news to share. S&P Global recently announced that Ingersoll Rand ranked first in the world within our industry, up for number two in the prior year. Also, Ingersoll Rand was named to the A list for its performance in tackling climate change and commitment to global environment leadership by CDP. CDP annuals environmental disclosure and scoring process is globally recognized as the gold standard for corporate transparency.  Finally, as shown on the right hand side of the page, we continue to make progress towards our aggressive 2030 goals, and we're already well on our way to achieve them.  On Slide 7, we show the catalyst for the progress, which is a highly engaged employee base combined with an ownership mindset. And as shown on the left hand side of the page, our employee satisfaction is over 600 basis points higher than the industry average. We believe our employee ownership model drives the increased employee engagement and as illustrated on the center of the page, we have created a massive economic opportunity for our employees and their families. That has been life changing for many, as expressed on the quotes from some of them.  All of these leads us to the next slide, where you can see that the combination of all these factors, executed through our economic growth engine is evidence that our model provides durable long-term performance. Our portfolio is positioned to capitalize on global mega trends such as sustainability, digitalization and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver on average mid single-digit organic growth through 2027. And as you can see, we outperformed this commitment again in 2023, delivering 10% year-over-year organic revenue growth.  In 2023, we also deliver 6% of in year growth from M&A. The combined organic and inorganic growth of 16% also surpassed our low double-digit growth commitment, and not only did we surpass our growth targets, but we also exceeded our margin expansion initiatives, generating 170 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and again, surpassing our long-term targets for this metric.  With IRX, as our competitive differentiator and over 400 impact daily management sessions or IDMS across our company each week, our high performance culture encourages a strong focus on execution. In 2023, we deliver adjusted EPS growth of 25% and a free cash flow margin of 18%. These results prove that we are premier durable growth compounder.  On Slide 9, to date, we're on track or ahead of schedule in delivering the 2025 targets set at our previous Investor Day. We have set new aggressive targets for 2027 long-term financial and our results give us confidence in delivering those targets that are on average over the cycle.  Turning to Slide 10, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We invested over $450 million across 13 acquisitions in 2023. These acquisitions have been both market leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies.  As of today, we currently have 10 transactions under LOI. Our M&A funnel remains strong and continues to be over 5x larger than it was at the time of the RMP. We expect an additional 400 to 500 basis points of annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2024. The 10 transactions currently under LOI are similar in size and nature to the Bolton deals we have done over the past few years. However, outside of these 10 LOIs, we still have a couple of deals in the funnel where the purchase price exceeds $1 billion.  I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 and full year 2023 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks Vicente. On Slide 11, we finished the year strong in Q4 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 3% and 4% year-over-year respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 8% year-over-year. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute on entry in 2024 and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance.  The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $501 million, a 19% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.5%, 160 basis point year-over-year improvement and a hundred basis point improvements sequentially from Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million and for the year we delivered nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow with an 18% free cash flow margin and 105% conversion to adjusted net income.  Total liquidity of $3.6 billion at quarter end was up approximately $400 billion sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve both year-over-year and sequentially. And 0.6 turns, we are 0.2 turns better than prior year and 0.3 turns better than prior quarter.  Turning to Slide 12 for the total company on an FX adjusted basis, Q4 orders and revenue both grew 11%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 19% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 260 basis points, while the PST segment margin was flat year-over-year, and corporate costs came in at $47 million for the quarter. Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 19% to $0.86 per share. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.7% with the full year adjusted rate finishing slightly above 22%. On Slide 13, total company full year orders grew 8% and revenue increased 17%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 25% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 240 basis points, while the PST segment margin increased 130 basis points. Corporate costs finished the year at $173 million, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IIoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Lastly, adjusted EPS for the year was up 25% to $2.96 per share. Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million, including CapEx which totaled $30 million. Total liquidity now stands at $3.6 billion based on approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 0.6 turns, which was a 0.2 turn improvement year-over-year. And in 2023, we returned $295 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Specifically within the quarter, cash outflows included $130 million in share repurchases, $39 million deployed to M&A and $8 million for our dividend payment. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash, as we look ahead. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. On Slide 15, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year organic revenue growth of 5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%, up 260 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 48%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. It is important to note that we have already achieved our 2025 high 20s adjusted EBITDA margin target for ITS, which is a full two years ahead of schedule. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders also up 5%. Moving to the product line highlights. Compressors were up low double-digits in orders and up mid-single-digits in revenue. Industrial vacuum and blower were down low double-digits in orders, but up low double-digits in revenue. The order decline was mainly driven by prudently de-booking an order from an electric truck manufacturer in Europe that had some battery supply issues. However, the prospects are starting to look better for this manufacturer in 2024.  Also, it is important to highlight that core product lines continue to show strong momentum on a two year stack, excluding FX and also excluding the recent acquisitions of SPX Air Treatment and Roots\u2019 blower. On a two year stack, compressor orders were up mid-teens and revenue was up high 20s. Industrial vacuum and blower orders were up low double-digits and revenue was up mid-30s.  As a reminder for additional detailed information on product lines and regional splits, we have moved the chart, which was previously included on this page to Slide 21 in the appendix. For our innovation in action section, we're highlighting a new compressor with advanced two stage technology. This product is a great example on how Ingersoll Rand is providing an innovative digitally-enabled sustainable solution with a 17% energy efficiency improvement versus the competition. Turning to Slide 16. Organic revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment was approximately flat year-over-year. The PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $94 million, which was up approximately 2% year-over-year with a margin of 30.1%. Organic orders were down 1.6%, driven by the Life Science businesses. We see organic orders growth stabilizing and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. In fact, PST excluding the life science businesses has seen positive organic orders and revenue growth in 11 out of the last 12 quarters.  In addition, short cycle orders in the industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in Q4. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our ARO piston pump system. This is a perfect example of leveraging both i2V and demand generation to pivot an existing product line into a high growth sustainable end market. Over the past 12 months, we have already taken $7 million in orders with a leading OEM solar panel producer, which has the potential for $1 million in annualized after-market revenue.  As we move to Page 17, we're introducing our 2024 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow between 5% to 7% with the first half growth of 4% to 6% and the second half growth of 6% to 8%. We anticipate organic growth of 2% to 4%, where price is approximately 2/3 and volume 1/3. FX is expected to contribute approximately 1% of a tailwind for the year, of which the impact will be realized relatively evenly throughout the year. M&A is projected as $160 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions in 2023, as well as the acquisition Friulair. Corporate costs are planned at $160 million and are expected to be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year.  Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.915 billion and $1.975 billion. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to fall within the range of $3.14 and $3.24, which is approximately up 8% at the midpoint. We anticipate adjusted tax rate to be roughly 23%, gross interest expenses to be about $155 million and CapEx to be around 2% of revenue.  On the right hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge showing the growth associated with both operational activity and the impact associated with corporate cost, interest income and expenses, FX, share count and changes in the adjusted tax rate, and based on the above guidance adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 6% to 9%.  As we sit here in mid-February, we would like to provide some commentary on Q1. We expect our normal seasonality to return in 2024 from a revenue perspective, which means that Q1 will be the lowest revenue quarter of the year. In addition, as a reminder, Q1 has a very tough comp as we deliver 20% organic revenue growth in Q1 of 2023. As a result, we anticipate organic revenue growth to be flattish to slightly up for a quarter with continued year-over-year margin expansion.  Turning to Slide 18, as we wrap up on today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a solid position. We continue to deliver record results and both our long-term and '24 guidance is reflective of our performance to date and our increasingly durable financial profile. To employees, I want to thank you again for another excellent finish to the year. We deliver strong results by demonstrating our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focus actions. These results show the impact you each have as owners of the company.  Our balance sheet is as strong as ever, and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market, our performance. We remain nimble, continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open it for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike Halloran : So let's start with where you ended there on the guidance piece. Certainly appreciate all the context and help and understand the relatively normal seasonality. But maybe you could just talk to what you're embedding from an underlying assumption perspective when it comes to the broader environment, broader end markets. Is this a year where you just see relatively sequential stability? Any specific pockets you're concerned about or where you see opportunities for acceleration? Less of an Ingersoll specific question meaning. I know you have a lot of drivers that you can use to goose growth relative to whatever the end markets are doing. More of just an end market specific in an environment question. Vicente Reynal : So maybe kind of give you a perspective here on how we think about it by region first. I would say in America as expected, we're seeing much better momentum. I will say mainland Europe -- I want to say America is -- I mean, not only the U.S. but even also Mexico and South America, where there's a lot of good progress going on with the teams down there. Mainland Europe remains relatively stable. I was just in Europe last week and really solid momentum from some good pockets of growth that we're seeing. But I'll say, I'll call it more stable. I'll say broader Middle East and India, also very good momentum. I mean, particularly in India and you've seen that we have done quite a few investments in India too as well. Not only from an inorganic perspective, but also organic.  And I'll say that APAC, Asia Pacific is the one that has the most headwinds specifically I'll say here in the first half of the year. And it is driven mainly by tough comps. I mean, we saw strong double-digit organic revenue growth in the first half of 2023 in Asia Pacific, mainly driven by China. And at this point in time, I mean, China is not a market that we call it that is perhaps booming. We're not immune to that, but we expect to outperform the market there to as well as the teams have proven that they could do that even in 2023. So that's kind of from a regional perspective.  I'd say from an end market perspective, nothing that I would call out to be highly differentiated in a sense, as you have seen us always pivot to these high growth sustainable end markets, we gave you one very good example here with arrow based on pump. This is a legacy product line that we kind of reinvigorated reutilized I2V as a way to relaunch the product. And with the use of the demand generation, we were able to position that product line into a very good growth end market on first of all take sales.  So, I say Mike, I mean I think the playbook continues to be the same. It is be agile, very nimble, leverage to demand generation and demand generation and IRX as a way to continue to execute. Mike Halloran : And then a follow-up on the Life Science side. The one area of PST that like a lot of the folks are seeing some headwinds here. You listened what the bigger players in the industry are saying. There is more stability front half, improvement back half, I don't know, at least modest. Is that similar to what your expectations are from a recovery curve at this point? Vicente Reynal : That's kind of what we think to as well, Mike. Again, as you said, maybe bottoming out here as we kind of come into the first half and then seeing sequential improvement. I don't say, I mean not in an exponential way, there is not that pent-up demand, but I would say in a very logical way to get back to the good growth that these end markets should continue to see over the long-term. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : First off just wanted to look at the sort of cadence through the year perhaps first off. Based on what you said, is it fair to assume sort of first quarter is about 21% of earnings for the year? And when we're looking at incremental margins, you call out that high 30s figure for the year. Is that fairly steady across both segments, as we move through 2024? Vik Kini : Yes. Julien, this is Vik. I'll take the first part of your question and I'll let Vicente probably talk on the margin front. I think the phasing -- generally I think you're in the right ballpark. Maybe other way to say it here is, if you look at the phasing in a manner that's consistent with, I'd say, revenue and earnings delivery as we saw in 2023, I think you'd be in the right ballpark in terms of our expectations here for 2024. And then in terms of the incremental margin piece, maybe I'll get started or -- Vicente Reynal : Yes. I can take that. I mean, I think the way I think to about that incremental margin, I mean, think about that 35% to 40% incremental margin. And when you look at the main buckets, I would say, the first bucket of that improvement or good incremental margin comes in from the initiatives that we always do, the I2V, price, very good continued growth momentum on the aftermarket, particularly the recurring revenues. The second bucket will be around the prior M&A improvement activities that we have always spoken about. The third bucket is, you probably saw on some of the appendix that we did some proactive restructuring at the end of 2023. This is kind of part of our continued to be proactive and nimble. And the last fourth bucket I would say in terms of this margin improvement is around corporate cost. You saw corporate cost going down roughly $13 million or so. Julian Mitchell : And just as we're starting out the year, looking at orders naturally, the sort of volatile quarter to quarter, reflecting what you said on a sort of a tough Asia environment in the first half of the year and sort of very tough orders comps. Do we think about orders being down perhaps in the first quarter year-on-year and then you pick up after that, as the comps and perhaps Asia get better? Vicente Reynal : Yes. We typically don't guide on the orders for the year or on a quarterly basis but we do definitely expect orders to be up sequentially from Q4 to Q1 on an absolute dollar perspective. The way we think about it too as well is that we typically book above one on a book to bill in the first half do typically to larger longer cycle projects being booked and then projects being booked, and then below one in the second half and we don't anticipate 2024 to be any different to that. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Vicente, can we just come back to Life Sciences for a moment, and just level set us here now after, kind of a couple tough years, what percent of PST is that business now and do you actually expect it to return to growth in 2024? Vicente Reynal : The Life Science business is roughly 25% to 30% of the PST segment today. I think as we think about going into the second half is when we expect that to be getting back to normal growth. Jeff Sprague : Thanks for the guidance on price versus volume. Just give a little bit of color on what you're expecting, just kind of the price cost equation, as we move through the year and maybe particularly in ITS. Vik Kini : Yes. Jeff, this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think simply stated here, I don't think you are going to see anything dramatically different than what you've seen historically. Meaning, we expect to generate approximately 2% price on a full year basis. We would expect to be both dollar and margin positive from a price cost perspective each quarter of 2024. So again, nothing different in terms of that equation as we move to the year. Obviously, ITS being the bigger segment clearly that comment pertains to ITS as well as PST as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Rob Wertheimer : Actually, one more question on life science. I mean, we've seen you guys use demand generation and just IRX to outgrow tough markets in China, and maybe Europe last year. Has that been a factor in life science? Is there anything different in that market that constrains it? And then I wonder if you could just kind of compare market dynamics for you and life sciences to some of the other companies and industrials we've seen and the long drag. What does the recovery look like? Is there a bounce back? Has there been a decent. I mean, maybe just explain the sales dynamic there. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Rob, I'll say, life sciences and I think you were referring to particularly in China. I mean, they have seen similar declines, like the balance of the life science businesses and biopharma related markets. I would say for the balance of our China exposure, it isn't that much different than the impact we have seen on the ITS side with the one item of node to call out perhaps SPX business that is more impacted by the water market. But that being said, I mean, we're excited with the prospect of SPX in China. And one example is that again, people tend to better end markets. So for example, the SPX took the same product and relaunched that to move away from the water market and move more into the lithium battery production with a very unique proposition without having to reconfigure that product too much. I think we just continue to navigate that. I mean, basically, how do we continue to agile and very nimbly move from one end market to the other without having to reconstruct the product lines. Rob Wertheimer : It was a little bit of two. So it was like, does demand generation -- has demand generation or other tools allowed you to outgrow the decline in life sciences? And then maybe the same question as Jeff asked in a way, but does the other side of this look like a bounce back or does it just look like a return to normal growth? I don't know whether destock or whatever at your customers has led to below normal sales and you kind of pop back up in '25, or whether you just resume normal growth? I will stop there. Vicente Reynal : To the first question, absolutely, demand generation is really helping us tremendously because then think about, I mean, our products can be applicable to pretty much any end market and we're being very selective and with demand generation, we can really reach this highly fragmented customer base in a very cost effective way, very rapid, very quickly. And then, provide a better solution to our customers underneath, call it energy efficiency, water efficiency, digitalization all these thematics that we think are important.  For the second question, the way we think about it is more normal. We don't expect this massive bounce back if that happens clearly upside, but the way we like to view it is more normal. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Vicente, I think you had an increase in your LOIs in Q4 to 10, I think from four last quarter. Are you seeing the M&A market open up a bit more? Is this more your team just finding more deals and those couple of deals that you mentioned that are over a billion, do you see the larger deal market opening up or is it still difficult to get those larger ones over the finish line? Vicente Reynal : I would say, yes. I mean, the M&A, we feel that continues to open up, and again, I'll put it in perspective that these 10 transactions in the LOI are similar in size and nature to the bolt-on deals that we have done over the past few years. And these 10 LOIs are also sole source, meaning, we have been proactively talking to the family on and have built some incredible relationships. This is exactly what happened with the Friulair acquisition to us, well, which have been in contact with the founder named Luigi. But so again, outside of these LOIs, we still have a couple of those deals in the funnel where purchase price exceeds $1 billion. So yes, there's still --- I mean, timing of that obviously difficult. But we still have a couple of those in our funnel.  I will also tell you that we actually -- also, we walked away from one of those billion dollar purchase price transactions, which again, speaks to the prudency and the discipline of our continued model that even after six to nine months of continued diligence, we decided that it was just not the best case for us to proceed. So, we remain highly disciplined in this environment and we see just a lot of good opportunities out there. Andy Kaplowitz : And then can you give us more color in terms of the end markets, you answered the question before, but if I look at Americas and EMEA, pretty continued durable growth. Is it more the 20% of your business that's longer cycle larger compressors? Is it more of the short cycle stuff that's supporting your growth? And what do you think the sustainability of the two markets is? Vicente Reynal : We think that maybe over the past couple years it was a lot more on the longer cycle. We see now, perhaps as you cannot continue to see PMI do better is that shorter to medium cycle will continue to see maybe a better momentum inflecting, we see some of that even already here. And you saw, we spoke about that particularly, let's say even PST on that we said, the industrial shorter cycle of mid-single digits year-over-year and then also sequentially. So, I will say that our teams continue to stay pretty agile in this -- in continuing to pursue energy efficiency in the compressors with our story around how we can save tremendous amount of energy, that is a very good thematic that continues to be out there. The thematic around reshoring is very strong. It continues to be the case in countries even like Mexico or even South America. I think the same thematic are still happening that we've been talking about for the past couple of years, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : All the big questions I think have been asked, but maybe just give us a bit of color on what you've seen in China looks like that was down in the quarter. Maybe just to quantify that and kind of like what's your sort of base case view on China? And then perhaps as part of that first half versus second half, it looks like core growth flat to 2% in the first half of the year and then we're going to lift the mid-single-digits in the back half of the year. Is that simply easier comps or are we seeing some acceleration, I don't know maybe in China or perhaps in life sciences? Any color there? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I was actually in China a few weeks ago, earlier here in January with the team and we were doing a pre-celebration of the Chinese Happy New Year. But in addition to just reviewing how the business is performing and to keep that in mind, I mean, I think over the past six to nine months, I've been to China now three or four times. I think it's just one that we continue to stay really close to understand how our teams continue to control what we can control. From an orders perspective, yes, I mean China in the fourth quarter was down mid-single-digits, but keep in mind that this is on top of low double-digits orders growth that they saw in Q4 2022.  Again I think on a two year stack, they still saw high single-digits order momentum, which is pretty impressive when you consider everything that is going on in China today. I will categorize the environment in China this time that I went to much better than what I saw in 2023, in the sense that there seems to be teams reenergized about maybe what's happening in terms of the stimulus and how the teams continue to leverage our technology into other end markets that they see some good pockets of growth. I was very encouraged to see how the team continues to navigate that difficult market by being very nimble and agile in terms of pivoting to those areas of good growth. Vik Kini : Yes Nigel on the second part of your question about the growth cadence first half versus second half. Yes probably a couple of factors I'd point to. One being, first and foremost, we do walk into the year with a still healthy backlog, including a good percentage of that that's longer cycle in nature. So that obviously gives us some good visibility into the back half of the year, when a lot of those projects tend to more naturally ship. And then yes, I do think there's a lot of truth in the statement you made about, clearly, comps gets a little bit more moderate in the back half of the year across the Board, but clearly whether it be China as well as the life sciences side of the equation on the PST business. So I think it's a couple of different factors. But again, like we said before, we think the phasing of delivery of revenue and earnings is actually very consistent in '24 versus what you've seen historically. Nigel Coe : My follow-up question is, the strength in European compressor orders is remarkable considering what's going on in the economy there. If you had to rank order these three, Scope 1 emission targets, CO2 pricing and high energy prices, obviously, IRX on top of that, but if you have to rank those three, what would you say is the most important factor? Vicente Reynal : I would say, high energy prices and Scope 1, which are I mean kind of interrelated one with the other one. But yes, I'd say high energy prices, number one, Scope 1 in terms of targets that many of the companies have put out there and then the third will be around the CO2. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : A nice sense of the year. Obviously, incremental margins were great. You hit your margin targets two years ahead of time. You think about this ITS business now, and I know that you have this incremental margin target for the year of 35 to 40. I guess just to -- I'm just curious, like how much of that do you -- would you say is volume dependent at this point? I know IRX is all about continuous improvement but just your ability to just deliver continued margin expansion if the volumes ultimately turn out to be weaker than expected. Vicente Reynal : Joe, I would say that, I mean even when you think about our guidance, I mean, it just shows that lower growth but still generating that very good margin. And that's driven by the activities that we have done call it i2V, also a price and even after market. So I think those are three core initiatives that we have continued to do really well. We always said that the ITS was very well ahead, because that was part of a integration between Gardner Denver and IR on how we did those three initiatives prioritize there. But I can tell you, I mean the PST team like even two weeks ago, they had like a worldwide i2V event and it was just highly, highly encouraging to see how our new leader is just driving that type of methodology into a segment that in the past -- they did it, but not in a way that we'd like that to be done.  In addition, I think what you saw here in the fourth quarter is that, we took some proactive surgical -- what we call surgical restructuring at the end of the year. Again, that's a prudency for us to continue to protect the P&L. I think that's controlling what we can control and taking the actions to ensure that we can deliver that solid margin improvement. Joe Ritchie : Look, it sounds like you've been on the road slow trotting the last several weeks. I'm curious, just from a regulatory standpoint, are there any kind of changes in regulations that you guys are seeing across any particular region that might be impacting your business or could impact your business going forward in the next we'll call it next 12 to 24 months? Vicente Reynal : I mean, nothing that I would say of significant dramatic change that is new. I mean, we know about clearly the energy efficiency standards that are coming into effect by the federal government in the U.S., there's some refrigeration standards that will drive basically our air treatment business. I would be it in a positive way, driven first in Europe and then in the U.S. too as well. But those are kind of known that we have known for a little while and but they're not new. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Steve Volkmann : Maybe just a couple of longer term ones here. Just kind of going back to orders in backlog, now that the world is sort of normalizing again over some period, should we expect backlog to decline or do you think it's kind of at the rate that it should be going forward? Vicente Reynal : I'll categorize that. I mean, so good news is that clearly we're still a pretty high backlog, which is encouraging to see. I think over time perhaps yes, it will get normalized. But again, I think when we think about the business that if we continue to get this book to build of one of approximately one that we continue to expect to see here in 2024, I think backlogs seem to be continuing at a pretty higher level than what we have done historically. Vik Kini : The other thing I would say there is, with the amount of, as they said with some of the longer cycle, we do fundamentally feel that compared to years in the past, there is just a higher amount of our backlog that's the longer cycle projects, which then clearly leads to the level of backlog you have now. So I think that you have seen a little bit of a structural change in the composition of the backlog as compared to more historic times. Steve Volkmann : And then switching gears a little bit, companies that are acquisitive and sort of have this flywheel that you guys have occasionally something comes over the transom that isn't quite what you thought it was going to be? And you may have a little disappointment in some piece of some business or something? So I'm just curious, any lessons learned, anything like that happening? And more importantly, should we expect some level of divestitures to be kind of part of this machine as we go forward? Vik Kini : So, you've seen us now since the merger done, we've done over 40 transactions and obviously not all of them have been a hundred percent the same. But what we would say here is, and we've acknowledged this before, probably the ones that maybe slightly below expectations comparatively speaking are probably the ones where IRX and that integration process probably didn't get embedded from day one, if not before. So if the lesson learned here is, we've got a playbook whether it's an ITS acquisition or a PST acquisition, we're going to continue to deploy that playbook on the IRX side because we fundamentally view that as the catalyst for success in terms of the integration and really embedding those businesses within the core. Vicente Reynal : Yes, I mean, the only thing that I'll add to that too as well is that, I think we said this before but my staff meeting, which happens typically on Fridays it's run as an IDM part of the IRX and one of the areas of focus is basically we have a dashboard of all the M&As as that are getting integrated, where we can clearly see if there's any issues or gaps. And that was an implementation that we did quite a few months ago, I would say 18 months ago as we saw maybe some businesses that were not properly integrated. So I think it's just part of that as Vik said, continuous improvement, good evolution and having the news travel fast, so that we can react and course correct if something is not going the right way. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Chris Snyder : I wanted to also ask on the M&A engine and maybe a more high level one. So revenue in 2024 is going to be about 40% above 2021. Does that make it more difficult for the company to add this 400 to 500 basis points M&A contribution every year? And does it change anything around the process of doing so? Just as the numbers have, again, I guess gone 40% bigger versus three years ago to keep that same run rate. Vicente Reynal : Chris, I would say that, I mean, it has become more difficult. I would say that when you think about it back in 2021, I think our addressable market, back in the Investors Day, we said it was maybe what $25 billion -- but it was $25 billion, $30 billion. And you saw our most recent Investors Day, our addressable market being $55 billion. Clearly, when we make an acquisition, we look at it also from the entrepreneur perspective of are we able to increase the addressable market and by increasing the addressable market. We're doing it in a highly fragmented market that gives us a greater pool of transactions to be able to be acquired. We're always very thoughtful on this kind of flywheel of the M&A engine as to just being one that is just an ongoing engine that can continue to grow. I think that's in terms of statistics and data points that's why we track number of transactions by tollgate and with the probability. I think the cadence of that M&A, it's pretty solid.  In terms of change in the process, I mean nothing that I will say has been dramatic change. We continue to always make some tweaks and improvements. I think about a year ago, we spoke about how we look at about 100 micro trends and that leads into new M&A transactions that we can actually possibly do. We're always trying to continue to evolve our process to make it better on an ongoing basis. Changing the process, yes, because we are always continually improving the way we do things. Chris Snyder : And then maybe just a follow-up on productivity and efficiency of the business. Obviously, margins have been really strong here the last three to four years. Do you feel like the efficiency of manufacturing has returned to pre-COVID levels? Obviously, there's a lot of disruption, coming out of the pandemic, which I'm sure was a headwind to margins in some capacity. Do you feel like that is fully back at this point? Vicente Reynal : I mean, I don't think so. Only because I mean, I think still there's a little bit of supply chain disruption here and there that happens, right? And so giving you, for example, I mean, the situation with the Red Sea, the situation in the Panama Canal, I mean, a lot of that creates supply chain disruption and we as a company that we're so global and being so good in terms of assembly, anytime oil supply chain disruption, it creates inefficiencies in the factory. I would say that, it is not back to the normal stability that we have seen maybe pre-COVID. That's my view. I think also we are pretty critical, Chris, in terms of how we want to continue to improve our factories and our operations. Is that lean mindset that of continuous improvement that always view as that -- we always have to do better than what we did in the past. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: I wanted to just start on the growth algorithm and if we think about a couple of points of price and a point of volume and just how you're thinking about the overall macro and the type of growth that you have kind of underlying on the volume side. Really just trying to understand how much demand generation is embedded in this initial guide. Is that one point of volume reflective of outgrowth, or is there potential sort of upside on the demand generation side of things? Vik Kini : I think we always view that there's upside on the demand gen side and frankly even on the volume side. Let me kind of unpack that a little bit. I think Vicente mentioned earlier, when you look at the regional trends here with primarily America is kind of at the top of the stack, EMEA relatively more stable and APAC which is largely China for us, probably facing the most headwinds at least as we enter the year. That's kind of the balanced equation that we looked at as we thought about the growth algorithm, as you said.  Now that being said, we entered the year with healthy backlog, solid backlog. Demand generation without question is part of the equation here. And clearly, we would say not to dissimilar from frankly, even years past. If there's upside opportunity in the context of the guide or in the context of the year, it really probably more so becomes that organic volume piece, probably more so into the -- as the year progresses. Again, I don't think the equation for us is dramatically different than you've seen historically. But we are conscious and taking into consideration, some of the regional trends that we're seeing, particularly as we enter the year, and we're going to continue to monitor those and pulse those as we get through the quarter and into second quarter in the back half of the year. Joe O'Dea: On ITS margins in the 30% in the fourth quarter, if you could kind of unpack that a little bit and bridging that sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q. Also, just to clarify, it sounds like the 35% to 40% incrementals applies to both segments. It's not like that exit rate sets up a tough incremental comp. Not sure if any restructuring that sort of hit the ITS side or if that was more on the PST side, but just some details there would be helpful. Vik Kini : Yes, sure. Maybe I'll take those in pieces here. So, if my memory serves in correctly, it went from about 28.8% EBITDA margins to about 30%. So a little over a 100 basis points, sequential margin expansion from Q3 to Q4. I point to a couple things here. One, frankly as the revenue and volume levels tend to pace to the year, a lot of our productivity measures are tied to volume activity measures the i2V to follow, I'd say that's probably one of the single biggest drivers. I think price cost continue to remain quite positive and overall just strong solid execution as we exited the year. The other thing that I think we continue to see good what I'd say momentum on is the aftermarket side. That really sets up nicely even during the Investor Day. We indicated that aftermarket as well as the whole recurring revenue side of the equation is a big focal point for us and we would expect to continue to see that not only ramp as we think about the next few years, but also that being margin accretive in the overall equation. Again, I think that's probably the way that we think about the equation in terms of what kind of drove Q4 specifically.  Now in terms of the whole incrementals and how we think about 2024 like we said, 35% to 40% is the kind of the overall average. The way I'd probably think about it here is, ITS is probably playing maybe towards the lower end of that probably in the 30s realm. PST obviously probably has a little bit more outsized opportunity. But I think that also goes with the fact that we said, that while we're pleased with PST delivering 30% EBITDA margins in the full year of 2023, we know that that business can get up into that mid 30s realm. And as such, there should be a little bit more of an outpaced opportunity. So there's a little bit of puts and takes there as well as Vicente mentioned earlier, a little bit of upside on the corporate cost as we think year-over-year. So hopefully that kind of gives you a little bit of a sense of how we're thinking about the airplane itself out. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : A couple fairly narrow questions. I know one of the strategic additions you've made in M&A has been to add drying to the portfolio. So I was just hoping to get an update on the benefits that you're seeing there, revenue synergies that you're generating there, whether or not you think that portfolio is built out or it's still an opportunity to add more of that capability? Vicente Reynal : Yes, it's definitely a very exciting addition to -- and you have seen that we made quite a few acquisitions on that. I mean, not only the SPX flow or treatment side, Oxywise, we acquired Holtec, we acquired a couple years ago and now Friulair to as well. And then in China, even also Hanye.  And the reason for this is that because air treatment is very good from the perspective of being attached to a compressor. If you think about the attachment rate, it should be like 70% attached to a compressor. So clearly, that\u2019s in terms of a KPI of a metric that we use with our teams is exactly that. What is the attachment rate? When you say a compressor, how often are you attaching that air treatment to that and that definitely drives some good growth momentum. And then to think about it too as well, air treatment is roughly 50% of aftermarket. So it generates a very good solid aftermarket. So the combination of those two factors, we like it a lot.  And then the third item of why we like it is because you can actually optimize energy efficiencies much better when you have the combination of the compressor and the air treatment talking to each other in a common way and being remotely connected and then fine tuning that connectivity. So, I think it is a multiple levers of strategic growth that we see on this dryer portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. David Raso : Just a couple quick questions. A clarification on the M&A comment. I thought I heard the word incremental 400 to 500, but you already have 2% to 2.5% of acquired revenues booked that'll flow through this year. Was that truly 400 to 500 above what's already booked or just getting up to the framework of 400 to 500 basis points of acquired revenues? If you can just clarify that. Vik Kini : So, I think, take them in pieces here. So you obviously have the carryover as well as the Friulair acquisition. So you see in our guidance be approximately $160 million of revenue contribution, that's the carryover and the completed to date, obviously would expect to book to close more acquisitions as the year goes by. But embedded in the guide is that 160.  The comment about 400 to 500 would be the acquisitions that we expect to make in the year and the annualized revenue contribution. So for all the deals that we expect to make here, based on the funnel and all the comments that Vicente made, we would expect that to be 400 to 500 basis points on an annualized basis. So you should take those kind of two statements separate from each other. But again, I think, the short answer here is we expect to continue to operate well in line with our stated economic growth engine and how you've seen us operate in years past. David Raso : And on the call out to that EV truck manufacturer in Europe on the vacuum and blower order weakness, you made a comment like I think prospects are improving potentially for that again. Just so I'm clear, do you think that order could come back on the books because it seemed to be of some size must be $20 million, $30 million or so, not small? Is that something that can come back on the books? Vik Kini : Let me take the first part of that and I\u2019ll let Vicente to answer. The way I would describe it is, interestingly enough, we de booked it in Q4 of \u201823 and the original order happened to have come in Q4 of \u201822. So interestingly enough, it kind of it hit us both ends, both in the quarter as well as the comp. Vicente, I'll let you speak to the prospects going forward. Vicente Reynal : And the prospect going forward is that, I mean we we're still in touch with them. I mean, basically they had a situation where the battery supplier went bankrupt, and that led to these truck manufacturing not being able to produce the trucks. This is needless to say what we're seeing now is that it's been acquired, the assets have been acquired and they have great technology. I mean, this is for the last mile delivery trucks in Europe, which is very highly needed. And so the conversations continue to happen, which obviously means that there could be some good prospects here as we go into 2024. Operator : Your last question comes from Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole Deblase : Maybe just starting with the free cash question. So conversion of 100% all the CapEx plans. How are you guys thinking about working capital for 2024? Vik Kini : Sure. I think in the call, I think broad structure, we still see an opportunity here. I think is the long and short of it. While we were pleased with our kind of exit momentum heading into '23, particularly on the inventory side, which was very much a source of cash in the quarter. We frankly still sit at elevated levels, comparatively speaking to, I'd say, the pre-supply chain dynamics and things of that nature. So I think that's definitely an opportunity as well as I'd say some of the just core -- I'll just call it blocking and tackling, whether that be just kind of the collections and things of that nature, fair to say that we still have a component of our portfolio whether it be part of the PST organization as well as a lot of some of the bolt-on M&A, that's not in the shared service environment, which obviously, for us, is a big catalog of working capital improvement. So you put that all together, I think that still lends itself as a good source of opportunity for '24 and beyond. Nicole Deblase : And then -- and just -- it doesn't look like you guys have any buybacks in the guidance based on the share count outlook. So how is your view on potential buyback activity in 2024? Vik Kini : Yes, that's correct. We do not have any, I would say, incremental buybacks as part of the guidance. Now that being said, I think the way you should expect us to operate here in 2024 is similar to the prior years, meaning a requisite amount approximately. We've always said approximately $250 million is probably a good proxy and a placeholder in terms of expectations for the year. But you are correct that it's not formally in the guidance. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Ingersoll Rand's CEO, Vicente Reynal for any closing remarks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Brian. And as we wrap up here, I just want to pass 1 more thank you to our employees who will continue to think and act like owners because they are owners of the company. And it's very exciting to see as I travel around the world, the high level of engagement and energy that we have across our organization. I think our economic growth engine is powered by that momentum on the ownership mindset and leveraging our IR. So again, very encouraged, very happy and to see the performance and look forward to another great year here in 2024. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Matthew Fort : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2024 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging our employees for their hard work, dedication and continuing to think and act like owners helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q1. Starting on Slide 3. Despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, our team delivered another solid start to the year, demonstrating the continued strength of our execution engine IRX. We remain nimble, and we're prepared to pivot if market conditions were to change. And based on our solid Q1 performance, we are raising our 2024 full year guidance. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine continues to deliver compounding results. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined on this page. IRX is our competitive differentiator. And combined with our unique ownership mindset, we expect to continue to deliver above-market growth in 2024. With that in mind, I would like to provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. On Slide 5, let me start with our inorganic growth initiatives. We're pleased to highlight two recently closed transactions. Let me walk you through these two deals that are adjacent to our core. In other words, both companies' products can be used by attaching them to our existing compressor or pump technologies. First, Ethafilter, which expands our technology by extending our reach into highly attractive end markets with the addition of sterile filtration technology. Next is Controlled Fluidics, which expands our technology with specialization in thermoplastics, high-performance plastic bonding and custom plastic assembly products for life sciences, aerospace and industrial applications. And finally, on the right-hand side of the page, I would like to highlight that with the announced acquisition of ILC Dover, which is expected to close later this quarter, we have already exceeded our annualized inorganic revenue target of 400 to 500 basis points. Having said that, we continue to execute our bolt-on M&A strategy and expect more deals to be announced later in the year, further exceeding our annualized inorganic revenue target.  Turning to Slide 6. I want to provide some additional information on the acquisition of ILC Dover with an overview of the portfolio. This slide details the breakdown of the business by end market as well as the long-term CAGR for each portion of the business, core competencies and future growth creation opportunities. Approximately 75% of the total business falls into life sciences end market which can be split roughly 60-40 between key markets of biopharma and medical components/CDMO. We expect this portion of the business to grow in the high single-digit plus range over the long term. Let me dive a bit deeper, starting with biopharma, in which the core competencies are in powder and liquid handling, where we see future growth opportunities for pull-through on pumps and compressors as well as the new customer and direct channel access to these customers. Some of the most exciting growth drivers in the biopharma market where ILC Dover has great presence is in supplying single-use and containment technologies in support of the manufacturing of fast-growing monoclonal antibodies and antibody derivatives in therapeutics to treat cancer and rare diseases. ILC Dover also plays a crucial role in the growing markets for novel diabetes and obesity therapies and the increase in demand for flexible next-generation cell culture facilities to serve the cell and gene therapy market. The primary benefits for the single-use equipment produced by ILC Dover are a lower cross-contamination risk, reduced cleaning and sterilization efforts, a highly flexible manufacturing process, much shorter batch turnaround times and reduce planned footprint and capital investment, respectively, all of which play an important role in the customer ROI which is core to how we at Ingersoll Rand support our customers with our current products and solutions. Moving on to the medical components/CDMO portion of the business, where the core competency is extrusion and molding of complex custom silicon and thermoplastic components as well as sub-assemblies. This business gives us access to a wide range of new customers on the medical technology side, focusing high-growth segments like cardiovascular and neurology. In addition, we see a lot of future growth opportunities to leverage this niche technology for the creation of high consumable items like tubing for the biopharma business, as well as pull-through on pumps and compression systems in the subassemblies they produce today. Moving on to the aerospace and defense end market, which accounts for approximately 25% of the total business, although small in nature, we're very excited to have this business within our portfolio for multiple reasons. First, this is a very solid business in terms of growth and profitability. And second, it has given us a great point of entry into the global space market, which is estimated to be worth $1.8 trillion by 2035, nearly tripling from $630 billion in 2023. As described on the slide, the majority of the volume is comprised of human mobility and habitation. Over the long term, in this end market, we anticipate a mid-single to high single-digit growth rate. With core competency of space suits, inflatable habitats, lighter and air vehicles and other inflatables, we believe that there is an opportunity for pull-through on our core technologies and a future growth opportunity.  For example, oxygen generation is needed across all these products. And we're currently a market leader in compression technology for portable oxygen concentrators. And this is just one example to provide some additional perspective on how we see the pull-through of our technologies where today we're not present.  As we move to Slide 7, let me spend some time talking about the alignment of ILC Dover against our stated strategic importance for M&A. First, we start with an example of adjacent technologies. Within the life science end market, we have always targeted the consumable portion of bioprocessing, which focuses on single-use technology, including powder containment, liquid management, tubing and components, isolator protectors and many others. With ILC Dover, we get exactly that, a very clear adjacent market in which we can combine our pumps to build consumables and offer a more complete product portfolio to our customers.  An example of this is combining our peristaltic pump technology with the newly launched ILC Dover tubing technology to deliver liquids to single-use devices which are also made by ILC Dover. This is merely one example of how we can help support customers across multiple steps within their biopharma workload.  Moving into the aligned category. First, we're getting mission-critical equipment like flexible isolators for biopharma manufacturing. Isolators made by ILC Dover are best-in-class, single-use and an essential step in the manufacturing process of therapies requiring high potency APIs, one of which it is antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, which is a fast-growing class of biopharmaceutical drugs designed to target and treat cancer.  Second, the medical components/CDMO business enabled us to enter a highly fragmented high-growth segment of med tech and biomanufacturing. As mentioned on the previous slide, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for pull-through on our existing pumps and compression technology and also access to new customers and a direct channel of communication with them. Finally, ILC Dover has given us the optionality to access the fast-growing market of aerospace and defense, with ILC Dover's deep relationship with NASA, Boeing and Sierra Space, to just name a few, we believe that we can leverage these relationships for pull-through opportunities on many of Ingersoll Rand's existing flow creation technologies. The acquisition of ILC Dover now provides us a larger platform to continue to build our life sciences business through bolt-on M&A and optionality with the fast-growing market of aerospace and defense. Moving to Slide 8. Let me touch base on our organic initiatives. Total organic orders in the first quarter were down 7%, due primarily to a large project order timing. As we have discussed before, large loan cycle projects usually driven by mega project investments tend to be lumpy in nature. And this can create a dynamic of tough comparisons in a single quarter. We believe that we're getting an outsized share of these projects, and we continue to be focused on book-to-bill. In Q1, as expected, we saw book-to-bill greater than 1%, building backlog, which was up 2% year-over-year.  Moving to the chart on the left side of the page, we're encouraged by both the organic order acceleration through Q1 and the increased marketing qualified leads or MQL activity in the second half of the quarter. On the left-hand side of the page, we illustrate the sequential orders we saw throughout the quarter. February saw 5% sequential order growth as compared to January and March organic orders were up 18% sequentially versus February. Consistently with our initial guidance, book-to-bill was above 1 at 1.02x in the quarter, continue to build backlog in support of our organic growth targets. As we had mentioned on our last earnings call, Q1 2024 had some very tough comps due to large and long cycle project order timing. For a 2-year stack, organic orders remain positive.  Moving now to the right hand side of the page, we illustrate our MQL activity acceleration throughout the first quarter of this year. In Q1 2024, MQLs finished up 4% year-over-year and this is on top of 9% growth in Q1 of the prior year. We remain encouraged by sequential momentum in MQLs throughout the quarter, where we saw an 11% increase in MQLs during the second half of the quarter as compared to the first half of the quarter. We do acknowledge that market conditions are constantly changing, and we remain nimble and prepared to pivot with those changing market conditions. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance. Vikram Kini : Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 9, despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we delivered solid results in Q1 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders and revenue declined 7% and 1% year-over-year, respectively. Both organic orders and revenue finished largely in line with expectations given the tough comps from the prior year. However, we did see approximately $15 million of revenue shift out of Q1 and into Q2 due primarily to customer site readiness. An additional headwind of approximately 1% due to FX as compared to our initial guidance.  The year-over-year decline in organic orders was primarily driven by the timing of large long-cycle orders. It's important to note that on a 2-year stack, total company organic orders and revenue grew 1% and 20% year-over-year, respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which was up approximately 2% year-over-year as well as our book-to-bill for the quarter, which was 1.02x. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute on for the balance of the year and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance.  The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $459 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.5%, a 290 basis point year-over-year improvement. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.78 for the quarter, which is up 20% as compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million, and total liquidity was $3.5 billion, with $1.5 billion of cash on hand at quarter end. Our net leverage was 0.7 turns, which is 0.4 turns better than the prior year. Turning to Slide 10. For the total company on an FX-adjusted basis, Q1 orders declined 4% and revenue declined 3%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 370 basis points while the PST segment margin increased 50 basis points year-over-year. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 290 basis points. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven by 390 basis points of gross margin expansion, largely driven by our continued execution of I2V initiatives and pricing. Partially offsetting this gross margin expansion were investments in SG&A centered around commercial footprint and R&D initiatives. Corporate costs came in at $44 million for the quarter. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 20% year-over-year to $0.78 per share, and the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21.3%. On the next slide, I'd like to take a minute to highlight the $1 billion increase to our share repurchase program. This repurchase authorization is incremental to the remaining amount on the existing $750 million authorization and is currently expected to start being executed against in the first quarter of 2025. Much like the prior authorization, we would expect to utilize the new $1 billion share repurchase authorization over a 3-year time period. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and share repurchases are an important part of that strategy. M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million, including CapEx, which totaled $62 million. The year-over-year decline in free cash flow of $49 million was driven primarily by two factors. First, approximately $40 million of CapEx timing. As outlined in our guidance, our expected CapEx spend remains unchanged at approximately 2% of revenue for the full year. And second, approximately $20 million of interest payment timing. Due to the bond issuance completed in August of 2023, interest payments on those bonds are now made twice per year as compared to our prior structure which was generally paid evenly over the course of the year. This will normalize as we move throughout the year. Total company liquidity now stands at $3.5 billion based on approximately $1.5 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 0.7 turns, which was a 0.4 turn improvement year-over-year. And specifically, within the quarter, cash outflows included $143 million deployed to M&A as well as $81 million returned to shareholders, of which $73 million of the share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on top of outsized growth in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were approximately 30%, up 370 basis points from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.02x with organic orders down approximately 7%.  Moving to the product highlights, compressors were down high single digits, primarily driven by large long-cycle project order timing, primarily in the renewable natural gas in the U.S. and EV battery and solar projects in China. Excluding these items, organic orders in compressors were approximately flat year-over-year. Important to note that on a 2-year stack compressor orders are up low double digits and revenue is up mid-30s. Industrial vacuum and blower orders were up high single digits and revenue was up mid-teens. On a 2-year stack, vacuum and blower orders were up mid-single digits and revenues up low 40s.  For innovation in action, we're highlighting Elmo Rietschle's new vacuum pump technology, which was recently launched in EMEA. This patented oil free technology ensures no air contamination or waste which is ideal for high-growth sustainable end markets like food and beverage, pharma and medical. This product also offers an almost 50% reduction in energy consumption compared to equivalent liquid ring technology, enabling productivity for customer and also reducing total cost of ownership. Turning to Slide 13. The PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $91 million with a margin of 30.8%. Organic orders in the PST segment were down approximately 5% year-over-year. The decline in orders was driven primarily by softness in life sciences and expected declines in China wastewater end markets. It is important to note and encouraging that life science business saw more than 15% increase sequentially in order momentum in Q1 2024 as compared to Q4 of 2023. In addition, short cycle orders in the PST segment remained strong with book and ship orders up high single digits sequentially. We see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. For PST innovation in action, we're highlighting a great recurring revenue opportunity with Aircom. Aircom is a range of comprehensive end-to-end IIoT solutions that seamlessly integrate into existing infrastructure that enable monitoring, controlling and optimization of operations. In this slide, we show one application of Aircom system to monitor and control gas pressure on the distribution grid that can help utility companies reduced emissions by up to 10%. We see these as a great opportunity for recurring revenue through subscription-based software and services.  As we move to Slide 14, given the solid performance in Q1, we're raising our 2024 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 4% to 6%, and which is down 100 basis points versus prior initial guidance, driven entirely by FX. We anticipate positive organic growth of 2% to 4%, consistent with prior guidance where price and volume remains split at approximately 70-30. FX is now expected to be relatively flat for the full year, which is a 100 basis point headwind as compared to our initial guide. M&A is projected at approximately $170 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of May 1 of 2024. ILC Dover is not included in the figures and is expected to close later in the quarter.  Corporate costs are planned at $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. The increase versus initial guidance is driven by investments for growth in demand generation activities, as well as investments IR digital and other IT-related investments. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.94 billion and $2 billion, which is up approximately 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.20 and $3.30, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint. On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we have included the 2024 full year guidance bridge showing the changes in our latest guidance as compared to our initial guidance provided in February. As you can see, the primary driver of EPS growth is associated with operational activity related to improved incrementals and operational performance. As I mentioned earlier, FX is the largest headwind, driving approximately 100 basis points of total revenue declines and a $0.04 of EPS headwinds. Total interest expense is now expected to be approximately $130 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. No changes have been made to our guidance on the full year adjusted tax rate. CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion or share count, all remain in line with initial guidance.  Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a very strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q1 performance and ongoing momentum. Our M&A funnel remains strong and with acquisitions announced and closed to date, we're poised for a record year of annualized inorganic growth. We remain nimble and we're prepared to pivot with the constantly changing market conditions.  To employees, I want to thank you one more time for an excellent start to the year. These results show the impact each of you have as owners of the company. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focused actions. We believe the power of IRX combined with our ownership mindset and leading portfolio strengthens the durability of our company while delivering long-term value to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Michael Halloran : So simplistically, what's changed from a trend line perspective? If I listen to your comments, it feels like things really haven't changed that much organically from a trend perspective. So maybe talk about any areas where you're seeing maybe a little better trends or the worst trend, some sort of inflection? And also maybe talk to what you think the orders look like on a full year basis and how those might track through the year? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Mike, I'll say that the only real change has been the increased funnel activity since we last reported or spoke publicly. Despite the headwinds we saw in Q1 from large projects on a year-over-year basis, the very encouraging sign is that the funnel activity for large projects on a global perspective, as we look forward, is still quite healthy. And what we saw, it was definitely a very increased activity and improvement in China in particular as well as other places in -- across EMEA that are related to kind of large mega project investments that are mostly in region for the region. So we view, again, the messaging very consistent versus what we said in February, and that is kind of quite encouraging. Michael Halloran : And then the order expectations as you think about the year? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Sequential orders... Vikram Kini : Yes, maybe I'll jump in there, Mike. I think -- in terms of the order activity here, first and foremost, we did see book-to-bill above 1 for the first quarter, about 1.02x, which is very much in line, I think, with how we intended for the year to start. And as a reminder, we typically are above 1 for the first half of the year and below 1 in the second half, largely due to normal seasonality as well as the shipment of -- for long-cycle projects. I think as we move into Q2, I think that the Q2 comps, particularly on a year-over-year basis, are still, I'd say, a touch challenging, and I think they normalize a bit more as we move into the back half of the year. So again, very consistent, I think, with how we saw things coming into the year. And I think by and large, Q1 played itself out largely as we expected. Michael Halloran : And then maybe talk to the sequential trends you're expecting for the year from an earnings perspective and a cadencing. Anything different from normal seasonality as well as the 1Q margins in the compressor segment, ITS, is that the right run rate? I mean, it's a pretty healthy first quarter margin. So I just want to make sure that's the right base to build off? Vikram Kini : Yes, sure. Let me maybe start with that latter point there. Let's start with the margins. So I think maybe in the context of the total company, I think the full year guide implies slightly more than 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. And it's worth noting that's actually ahead of our Investor Day targets that we communicated late last year, which was about 75 basis points. So we're actually quite pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing. And yes, as you indicated here, clearly, ITS probably is the leader of the pack in that respect. But what I would say here is Q1, our expectation certainly will be our highest margin expansion on a quarterly basis for the year, and we expect the levels of margin expansion to kind of moderate as we move into the latter half of the year. Now that being said, Mike, I think we would say, we continue to be really operationally focused, QFD focused, and we'll continue to try and drive outperformance where possible. To the first part of your question in terms of I'd say the phasing and the seasonality, nothing I'd point to that's dramatically different than what you've seen in prior years, whether you want to look at it from an earnings perspective, first half versus second half as well as what I spoke to earlier on the book-to-bill cadence. So again, I'd say relatively consistent with what you've seen, but we're very encouraged with the strong start to the year we saw in Q1. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : So maybe just without going down the rabbit hole of sort of monthly orders and so on, I guess maybe help us understand in the second quarter it sounds like orders are down again year-on-year firm-wide. Just wanted to make sure that's the case, and sort of when you see those returning to growth again on a firm-wide basis. And then on the revenue line, is the point that revenues are up sequentially sort of low mid-single digits in Q2, like normal? You have the tailwind of the $50 million push out that maybe the top line environment is also soggier now than it was a few months ago. Vicente Reynal : As a reminder, we don't really guide on orders, but just to provide a little bit of color here on Q2, I mean, April orders really finished relatively in line with the expectations. Generally, the same trend as what we saw in Q1, meaning China is the most noted headwind, again, based on that year-over-year comparison, due to the outgrowth that we saw Q1 and Q2 in China. And EMEA and America is performing comparatively much better, clearly. Q2 comps are still a bit of a challenge from a year-over-year perspective. But that being said, we do believe that Q2 organic order growth will definitely perform better than Q1. And we do expect Q2 organic orders to be up sequentially as compared to Q1.  So our confidence level here is based on the fact that we continue to see momentum on MQL activity. And as we explained also that kind of intra-quarter sequential momentum that we saw in the first quarter, which is relatively much higher than what we have seen historically that kind of continue to build the confidence that things are kind of losing up and freeing up as we continue to see better visibility from -- on a customer perspective. Vikram Kini : Yes. And then, I mean, I'll take the revenue side of that question, Julian. So I think to answer your first part, yes, we do expect to see Q2 revenue performance sequentially trend upwards from Q1. So I think that's a completely fair statement. I think specifically with regards to Q2, and maybe I'll focus my commentary a little bit more year-over-year here. We do expect to see Q2 up, what I'll say, low single digit on an organic revenue growth perspective, with continued year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion. And then I think as far as kind of the other kind of moving components, not dramatically different than, frankly, what you saw in Q1, meaning M&A contribution comparable to what you saw in Q1, FX, I mean a slight headwind on a year-over-year basis. And we would obviously expect to see that organic growth be roughly speaking, maybe 2/3 to 1/3 price to volume split. So again, I think relatively consistent with the same messaging you've seen before. But yes, we do expect to see continued good momentum into Q2. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just my quick follow-up on the second quarter. So if the revenue is sort of up sequentially, the margins may be down sequentially. Is that the point? I mean, often, you have revenue up sequentially second quarter and then sequential operating leverage with it and EPS up sequentially. But if you're saying that EPS can be up sequentially, it puts the first half at 50% of the year's earnings, which I think is abnormal seasonality, but I think you're saying seasonality is normal this year. So just maybe help us understand on that second quarter EBITDA and EPS. Vikram Kini : Yes. And Julian, maybe I'll keep it at relatively high level. But I think the way we would think about it here is, obviously, Q1, really strong performance, particularly on the margin side of the equation, over 27% EBITDA margin profile. I think the way we should think about it here is we do expect revenue and EBITDA dollars to grow sequentially. We would expect EBITDA margins to continue to be healthy. It's probably worth noting when you think about that in the translation down to EPS, we did benefit a little bit in the first quarter from a tax rate perspective, which we do expect to normalize a little bit. So that will create a little bit of some of that sequential noise from Q1 to Q2, but again, nothing that we'd point to from an operational perspective. We continue to expect good healthy flow-through, good margins. And yes, we do -- just to be very clear, we do expect to see sequential improvement on the revenue and the EBITDA dollar side of the equation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Maybe could we just unpack actually the Q1 margins in ITS a little bit more, the stuff that you mentioned, I2V, and price cost and everything. But Obviously, a very impressive performance in the quarter. So I'd like to get a little more color there on what happened. And just on the change in incrementals, Vik, I assume the FX change helps that number a little bit, maybe speak to is there any change in kind of the underlying expectation for incrementals for the year? Vicente Reynal : Jeff, on the ITS, yes, I mean, we're very pleased with the performance. And you saw -- you heard the commentary that solid gross margin expansion, and that's basically kind of what we saw also on the ITS side, I mean, phenomenal gross margin expansion. And driven by a lot of the initiatives that we have been talking about over the past few years, call it these I2V, the innovative value activities as well as some of the restructuring that we also did in the fourth quarter that we saw also benefiting here early on in Q1. So again, it speaks pretty highly in terms of what the team continues to do to control what we can control. And the fact that we're -- what is very exciting and very pleasing is to see clearly getting to that 30%, but even more so at this kind of still fairly highly inflationary market situation. So meaning that as we eventually over time continue to see deflationary, that continues to also help expand our margin even further. So that is very -- we were very pleased that with -- I mean, no surprise, but also excited to see that continued performance on that. Vikram Kini : Yes. And then Jeff, to the second part of your question on the incrementals. The way I would probably think about it is just, frankly, a continuation of what Vicente spoke to. When you think about the biggest drivers that Vicente spoke to, whether it be the I2V, the direct material kind of productivity initiatives, frankly, really solid price cost flow through where as we messaged coming into the year, we expected inflationary headwinds kind of move sideways. That's frankly what we saw, and we saw good price realization in the first quarter. There's really no expectation that should be dramatically different for the balance of the year. And then the restructuring actions, which just to even provide a little bit more color, we took some targeted restructuring actions at the tail end of last year. You actually saw, we also did some in Q1 of this year. So again, that's all leading to that kind of incremental that we would expect for the full year, which is getting now closer to that 50%. Jeffrey Sprague : And then I think coming out of this quarter, right, those of us who haven't dialed in ILC yet will -- just any -- assuming kind of a mid, late quarter close, should we expect some EPS benefit in 2024? Or are there kind of integration and other costs that would kind of negate that? Vikram Kini : Yes, Jeff, let me take that one. So yes, to your point, just to be very clear, obviously, our guidance does not include ILC Dover as the deal has not closed. To Vicente's kind of earlier comments, we do expect to close later in the quarter. So again, we would expect nominal if any impact in Q2. As far as the balance of the year, which I'm really now focusing on the second half, we would expect to see some nominal EPS impact. But again, as we get through the quarter and frankly, as we give our next earnings where we expect that the deal will close later this quarter, we'll give you a little bit more color for the back half of the year as we kind of get to deal closure. But again, I'd say nominal EPS impact as we sit here right now for the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : I guess I'd like to take it a little bit more towards the strategic end. And thinking about what ILC Dover opens up for you, which you kind of talked about in the prepared remarks on acquisition, on runway and on deals. And more specifically, is that kind of a landmark deal where you can tuck in other things at valuations that look either more like your traditional or in between the two? What does the pipeline build look like? How are you thinking about the timeline and so forth? And if I may, just one last one. Does that sort of satisfy the larger, I don't know, at a second half leg of the stool kind of things in the backlog? Or is there potentially more out there? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Rob, we feel definitely that the acquisition of ILC Dover, we have now a very strong life science platform to build around. It's not only on the biopharma, but also on this kind of CDMO medical component technology that you even saw that we actually closed already on another acquisition, Controlled Fluidics, even in the quarter, and that's going to get added to that team. So that is just one example on how we expect to take a similar approach of tuck-ins that you have seen us do in the past, and particularly around life science platforms. We -- the exciting piece here too as well is that ILC Dover comes in with a phenomenal team and with deep experience and that already has a very strong funnel for bolt-ons and tuck-ins. So again, putting our M&A engine into action is going to be very good for us and pretty fruitful. So the pipeline is very strong, not only on things that we had, but also on things that now the ILC Dover is bringing to the table. In terms of your question about the larger acquisitions, I mean, I still see that we'd like to say we still have a couple of these kind of handful, one or two very large or larger above $1 billion purchase price that we keep track outside of this funnel that we talk about all the time, the funnel is really more on the bolt-on and tuck-ins. But yes, we still have a couple of those above $1 billion purchase price that we have at play. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Can we just start on the growth in the quarter? It was a touch lighter than we expected. Maybe this is just a follow on to like Mike's question from earlier. But was there anything in the quarter that either shifted out or just potentially surprised you, was a little bit softer than you expected, maybe which is all on PST? Just any comments around that would be helpful. Vicente Reynal : Joe, if you remember in the Q4 earnings call, we talked about being flattish organic revenue, and we feel that the results came in kind of roughly in line with that. And when you think about the difference between the Q1 results and the implied Q1 organic guidance, essentially, the change was basically largely attributed to the couple of revenue orders that Vik mentioned on the call that got pushed out into Q2, roughly $15 million of orders are basically attributable mostly to customers, and it was just basically site readiness, nothing to be worried about. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. All right. That's great to hear. And then I guess you've been talking about the life sciences business for a while now and the softness in that business. It was interesting to see that you've seen this sequential order improvement in 1Q. Are you starting to kind of see green shoots in that business? Should -- are you feeling better about the growth trajectory of that business throughout the rest of the year? Vicente Reynal : We are, Joe, and particularly not only all the sequential improvement, but also the conversations that we're having with customers and even also including some of the biotech funding that we're starting to see here kind of coming through as well. So yes, I mean, I think it's one that we're encouraged to see not only from the numbers that we just posted, but also from the conversations that we're having with customers about new applications and new technologies. So yes, very encouraging. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : You mentioned large project order timing was a big reason why organic orders were down in Q1. But how would you characterize the large project order environment in '24? Do you have visibility that you'll see another large project bookings quarter like you had in that Q1 '23 at some point soon. So is it truly a timing issue? Or is it more difficult market for large projects to get over the finish line? Vicente Reynal : No, I think we definitely categorize it more as really timing. And we do because as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, I mean, these renewable natural gas saw a lot of acceleration early in '23. And it has not stopped, but I mean it's basically a very, very fast start and then kind of tapering down. Still, we're seeing renewable natural gas growth or good orders. It's just that comparable to what we saw back in Q1, it was just difficult to overcome.  And same thing with the electric vehicle investments that happened in China. Again, very strong investments happening in terms of expansion in the first half of last year. And do we see electric vehicle continue? Yes, we see it, but not at the pace of what we saw there. Now having said that, I think what -- the remark that we made on the -- or one of the answers that I made before, funnel activity is really strong. I mean, so I think that's what is very, very encouraging to us is that and it is not on those same projects. It's kind of now new type of megaprojects that we're seeing, whether petrochem expansions or things of that nature that are kind of encouraging that we're seeing. Andrew Kaplowitz : That does sound encouraging. So Vicente, just following up on your geography comments specifically on China. I think last quarter, you suggested the China team was pretty energized. It looks like APAC orders still had enough tough year-over-year comp. But does China turn here as you go over into the second half in terms of orders? Like any sort of more characterization would be helpful. Vicente Reynal : Yes. I think the team is still very energized and very encouraged about what they're seeing, clearly tough comps. But even in the tough comp environment, when you look at -- and we've done a lot of kind of work with the team to better understand the kind of core business. The core business still is pretty solid and seeing some good momentum. It was just basically one of those where, again, difficult comps based on some of the expansion that we saw rapidly happening in China in the first half of last year, particularly on electric vehicle and battery production and solar energy. But again, we're encouraged with what we're seeing here. As a matter of fact, I mean, next week, I'm actually in Southeast Asia with the team to look at some of the growth initiatives that we have across Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore. And I'm super energized to just be with the team there next week. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Just wanted to perhaps come on the back of Andy's question. I think you mentioned as well, Vicente, Europe where you're seeing sort of a pipeline of larger orders, kind of rather larger projects developing. And it sounds like it's more sort of reshoring into Europe. So I'd be curious if that's the case, whether you think this could be something we see happening pretty quickly? Or is this more sort of '25, '26? And any sort of color on some of the sectors where you see that activity. Vicente Reynal : It's definitely a little bit of reshoring. And even I was actually talking to a very large chip manufacturing company earlier this week. And it is also about the \"Chips Act\" put in Europe. I mean so there's also some investments of that happening, whether you think about it in the U.K. So there's some of that. There's some of -- going back to the energy crisis, there were some projects that get scoped around nuclear facilities and upgrading, things like that, whether in France or in other locations, and that takes time. But we're seeing that better approvals coming through. So perhaps that is another bucket area that we're seeing some good excitement there where we have a very unique application with our blower technology that is already expecting.  And the third area that we like is Middle East. I mean we're seeing a lot of good investments happening in the Middle East. Our team in Middle East and India are seeing the fruits of that. And even also India and particularly that as we have said in the past, doubling down on some of the investments in India are paying off based on the results that the team is driving. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. And then ILC Dover, the 25% that's space and defense, I think the question we were asking ourselves was how strategic is this business. And it sounds like it's very strategic. And it feels like you could actually -- it sounds like you want to be a space player, I mean, for want of a better word. So is that the case? Do you think that it's not just life sciences. yes, this is also an A&D play as well? Vicente Reynal : Yes, I mean, I think that's what we call a very highly opportunistic in the sense that -- I mean, we're learning a lot. But even before owning this space business, we were looking at already some compression technology and pump technology that is actually used in space. And even our sales internally within PST, we have a company called Haskel, and Haskel is already a big player providing compression technology for SpaceX as an example. So we were already kind of playing on the peripheries. I think this is now giving us a deeper penetration with some very strong customer base like NASA, Boeing and Sierra Space. And we're learning a ton. So at this point in time, yes, I mean, we're very excited with what we see here, and we'll continue to progress our learnings. But yes, I mean, the funnel for bolt-ons is there. We have it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: Can you just expand on the MQL trends during the quarter, the degree to which that surprised you? Not sure if it was primarily China and Europe that drove that increase over the course of the quarter, if there was anything in North America, but just any additional color on what you attribute that to. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, I would say that the reason why we wanted to kind of share the data points with everyone is because of not only on the MQL but also the intra-quarter momentum that we saw that we also put on that page, it was just much more accelerated than what we had historically have seen in the first quarter. And I would say that the MQL fairly balanced across all the regions, delivered in all -- particularly one of the regions that we saw good acceleration was around EMEA. But call it, EMEA as well as Americas, I mean, very, very strong on that. And -- but yes, I mean, I think it's just fairly good across all the regions. Joseph O'Dea: And that continues in April? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I mean April MQL activity was actually strong, 14% year-over-year growth on top of 5% growth in 2023. So again, it shows that the good solid momentum. I mean I think 14% is very good. And I would say also April, MQLs were also up 9% sequentially from March. Joseph O'Dea: Okay. Very helpful. And then another one on ILC Dover. And I think the legacy of that business is aerospace and defense and that the life sciences is a relatively newer kind of addition to it. But could you just expand on what they did to build that out and now a $300 million business? And so what happened over the last several years to sort of put that together? Vicente Reynal : Yes, absolutely, Joe. So you're absolutely right. I mean, I think the legacy here comes in from the space. And you remember that we mentioned that Dover is the one that put the man on the moon basically with their spacesuit and leveraging a lot of that kind of layering technology to really expand into inflatable habitats and things like that. So very, very specialized material technology that basically requires multiple layers. I mean, call it nine different layers in order to create containment, in this case, containment of humans. So they did is that they took a lot of these kind of layering technology and material technology and knowledge and know-how to then move into the biopharma. And in the biopharma, it's basically about the containment of powders and liquids. And that's why they have the single-use powder and liquid containments. And then from there, they took it to then however they continue to expand and then they acquire basically a CDMO, Flexan, the Flexan business. And they acquired it particularly because of the technology, specialized technology around silicon molding and extrusion, again, all thinking about containment. And in this case, leveraging that very niche silicon production to create tubing for containment of liquids and move the liquids in biopharma production. So yes, I think the team was very strategic in terms of taking the core of the knowledge of the technology around material and material later in for containment to then go into other diversifying very high-growth end markets. And I think that's just the beginning, I think, in our view. Joseph O'Dea: So is that more an organic than inorganic, building of that $300 million? Vicente Reynal : For them, it was basically a good blend of both. I mean they have to acquire some companies, but then once they acquire, they continue that organic momentum. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Nathan Jones : I'm going to pick up on ILC Dover as well. On the original acquisition call and again today, you guys have been highlighting revenue synergy opportunities with the current portfolio. Can you just talk a little bit more about that, are the products that you have today directly transferable, does there need to be some investment in development? And then just talk about what you think the market size for that potential revenue synergy is? Vicente Reynal : The products are definitely transferable. This is basically taking pump technology that today we have in the industrial space like peristaltic technology and taking that and then penetrating that into the biopharma market. I think what we get from ILC Dover is basically they have a phenomenal commercial footprint. So they go direct to a lot of these customer base. So we get immediate access from that perspective. I think the other thing that we get here is the access of new customer base. So if you look at that CDMO, very, very solid med technology customer end base that today, we're not doing a lot of work. Now what ILC Dover has in these facilities is very large clean room facilities. A lot of our customers that are in the medical space have been asking us to create sub-assembly. In many cases, so take the pump and connector to and create a sub-assembly that is much easier for the customer to be able to put it on to the end device. For many of these applications, we needed a clean room. We don't have clean room facilities. So in many cases, we have to pass on that. Now we have that access. We have that access of the clean room facilities as well as the ISO procedures and standards from a quality management system perspective to be able to penetrate these customer base that has a high level of requirement because of being the customer base being FDA regulated. So I think that's clearly the exciting piece here is that we get not only the use of our products and penetrate that through that customer base but we also get access to new customer base that we never had access before. I mean in terms of the size, the potential revenue synergies, I mean, we haven't disclosed that yet, Nathan. And -- but we did say that with the acquisition of ILC Dover, we're expanding our addressable market by like $10 billion. So it's basically the potential is there. Nathan Jones : Still figuring out the revenue synergies, I'm sure. Just one clarification or something I don't know on MQLs, which maybe I should know is what's the average duration for you guys for getting an MQL to an order? I'm just trying to figure out how far in advance is that a leading indicator of potential improvement in demand? Vicente Reynal : For us is anywhere -- it's averaging between 6 to 8 weeks. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Vicente Reynal for some final closing remarks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. I just want to say thank you for the interest in Ingersoll Rand, and most important, thank you again to the entire team of Ingersoll Rand for another solid quarter performance and note that everyone is focused here on continuing to make life better for the employees, the customers, the planet and the shareholders. And we move forward to closing ILC Dover later here in the quarter, and we can tell you that our integration plan is going well, and we look forward to formally welcoming that team to our family. With that, we close the call. Thank you again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ingersoll Rand Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Please note that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matthew Fort : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will discuss these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2024 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging our employees for their hard work, dedication and continuing to think and act like corners helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. Starting on Slide 3. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, our team delivered another record quarter results demonstrating the continued strength of our execution engine, IRX. We remain nimble and are prepared to pivot as market conditions change. And based on our solid performance, we are once again raising our 2024 full year guidance. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine describes how we deliver durable compounding results. We remain committed to our strategy and over the cycle, delivering our long-term Investor Day targets as outlined on this page. IRX is our competitive differentiator. And combined with our unique ownership mindset, we expect to continue to deliver long-term value creation. With that in mind, I would like to provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. On Slide 5, let me start with our inorganic growth initiatives. We're pleased to highlight 3 recently closed transactions, which together are expected to achieve an average of mid-teens ROIC by year 3. Let me quickly walk you through these deals. First, CAPS, which is a leading provider of complete air and power generation services. This is a great example of strategic channel expansion, giving us access to a large install base, strong end-user relationships and robust technician network. Next is Fruitland, which expands our technology with low-flow applications. And lastly, we have Del Pumps, a mission-critical, high-margin pumping solution across high-growth sustainable end markets in India. On the bottom of the page, I'd like to highlight that with the closure of these transactions, along with the closure of ILC Dover within the quarter, we have already far exceeded our annualized inorganic revenue target of 400 to 500 basis points, setting us up well for a good start in 2025. In addition, the funnel continues to grow and stay very active with deals mostly bolt-on in size. On our prior earnings call, we mentioned that we had also a couple of $1 billion purchase price deals in the funnel. During the second quarter, we decided to walk away from one of these larger transactions. And this is proved that we continue to remain very disciplined in our approach to M&A and committed to long-term shareholder value creation through effective capital allocation. We expect more bolt-on deals to be announced later in the year, further exceeding our annualized inorganic revenue targets. Turning to Slide 6. On this slide, I want to take a minute to walk you through why we're so excited about the ILC Dover acquisition, and deep dive into the biopharma business, which accounts for approximately half of the total business. With exposure to high-growth therapies like GLP-1 and ADCs, this business is well positioned to deliver double-digit growth in 2024 and beyond. The performance in biopharma is much better than the current market and speaks to the niche and unique nature of the product solutions and offerings we have. Let's start with GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide-1 therapies, which are used in the treatment of type-2 diabetics and weight management. With the projected annual market growth rate of 20% to 30% over the next 5 years, GLP-1 manufacturers are rapidly expanding their capacity to meet both the current and growing market demand. We have deep and long-lasting relationships with our customers, where our proprietary single-use technology is already qualified into their production process, becoming an integral part of the validated bill of materials for GLP-1 production. As our customers expand capacity, either within their own facilities or CMOs, our products, all required inputs for these new production lines to minimize validation time lines, start-up cost and risk. As illustrated on the right-hand side of the page, ILC Dover provides proprietary best-in-class technology in terms of single-use containment bags, liners and other consumables that are used across a variety of steps in the GLP-1 drug manufacturing process, giving our customers the assurances they require to deliver compliant products to the market and reducing their cross-contamination risk. Moving on to ADC or antibody drug conjugates, which are used primarily in cancer treatment therapies. This market is expected to grow double digits annually over the next 5 years, driven by the efficacy of the technology. There have been several new ADCs approvals in recent years with a robust drug development pipeline for this type of therapy. Our patented containment technology is proven to perform better than both clean-in-place and single-use alternatives. And we believe our technology is 80% to 90% more cost-effective than a clean-in-place technology. We continue to see customers convert their existing production lines and install new capacity leveraging our single-use containment technology. I will now turn the presentation to Vik to provide an update on the Q2 financial performance. Vikram Kini : Thanks, Vicente. Starting on Slide 7. Despite the increasingly challenged macroeconomic environment, we delivered solid results in Q2 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders declined 1%, finishing largely in line with expectations. We saw strong sequential orders growth of 5% for the total company with the book-to-bill of 1.0x. Consistent with our guidance, book-to-bill finished above 1 in the first half at 1.0x. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute in the back half of the year and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance. Organic revenue was up 1% for the quarter and up 13% on a 2-year stack. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $495 million, a 16% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.4%, a 220 basis point year-over-year improvement, driven predominantly through gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments for growth in SG&A. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.83 for the quarter, which is up 22% as compared to the prior year. This marks 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth and 12 out of the last 14 quarters of double-digit EPS growth beginning with Q1 of 2021. Free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million, and total liquidity was $3.7 billion, with $1.1 billion of cash on hand at quarter end. Our net leverage was 2.0 turns, which is up 1 turn versus the prior year. This increase is primarily driven by the $2.325 billion acquisition of ILC Dover. For the full year, we do anticipate net leverage finishing at approximately 1.5 turns. Turning to Slide 8. For the total company on an FX-adjusted basis, Q2 orders were up 5% and revenue increased 8%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 16% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 230 basis points, while the PST segment margin increased 110 basis points year-over-year. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 220 basis points. Corporate costs came in at $44 million for the quarter, largely in line with expectations. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 22% year-over-year to $0.83 per share including an adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 21.3%. On the next slide, free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million, including CapEx, which totaled $22 million. Total company liquidity now stands at $3.7 billion based on approximately $1.1 billion of cash and $2.6 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 2.0 turns, which is a 1 turn increase year-over-year. As noted earlier, this increase was driven primarily by the purchase of ILC Dover, which was funded through $2 billion in bonds and $325 million in cash. Specifically, within the quarter, cash outflows included $2.6 billion overall deployed to M&A as well as $71 million returned to shareholders through $63 million in share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with M&A being our top priority and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. On Slide 10, I'd like to take a minute to highlight the transformation of our debt portfolio. This transformation has been underway for several years, and I'm pleased to say that we now have a fully investment-grade structure. Also important to note that within the quarter, we received a 1 notch upgrade from each of the 3 rating agencies, which you can see highlighted on the right side of the page, further solidifying our investment-grade status. In terms of the overall capital structure, in May, we issued $3.3 billion of unsecured investment-grade bonds. The proceeds of the bond issuance were used to repay $1.23 billion of our legacy secured term loans and $2 billion was used to partially fund the acquisition of ILC Dover with the remainder retained for general purposes. In addition, we took the opportunity to increase the size of our revolver from $2 billion to $2.6 billion, which further provides flexibility to execute on our strategic initiatives. As a result of this debt portfolio transformation, we now have a fixed-to-floating ratio of 84% fixed and 16% floating and extended our weighted average maturity on our overall debt from 6 years to 10 years. Our new capital structure is designed to facilitate our long-term capital allocation strategy, and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade status. Finally, our 2024 gross interest expense outlook is now approximately $215 million. On an annualized basis, we expect gross interest to be approximately $260 million as we move into 2025. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 11. Our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 6% on top of approximately 20% growth in Q2 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 29.7%, up 230 basis points from the prior year, which was driven primarily by gross margin expansion. Book-to-bill was onetime, with organic orders down 2.6%, which was largely in line with expectations. Important to note that we saw sequential order growth of 5% which were primarily driven by compressors. Moving to the program highlights. Compressor orders were up low single digits while still comping a low double-digit growth in Q2 of 2023. It's good to note that we saw positive order growth across Americas, EMEIA and Asia Pacific, excluding China. Compressor revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter, which we view still healthy after mid-teens growth in Q2 of 2023. Industrial banking orders were up low single digits and revenue was up mid-teens. For innovation in action, we're highlighting Elmo Rietschle new high-speed blower technology, which was recently launched in Europe. This patented oil-free technology offers a 60% reduction in energy consumption compared to a traditional blower technology, enabling productivity for the customer and reducing total cost of ownership by up to 50%. Turning to Slide 12. The PST segment achieved 6% organic order growth and deliver adjusted EBITDA of approximately $103 million with a margin of 30.3%. It is encouraging to see that the legacy Ingersoll Rand Life Science business saw organic order growth of 8%. In addition, short cycle orders in the PST segment remained positive with book and ship orders up mid-single digits year-over-year. We see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business and it remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting an extremely innovative technology within the legacy Ingersoll Rand Life Science business. Combining multiple technologies across different brands, we have developed a product offering in micro-fluidics to create a customized liquid handling automated system for biotech R&D labs as well as the production of personalized therapeutics. This innovative technology drives up to 50% productivity versus existing processes in a market that is expected to grow approximately 20% through 2027. On the next slide, I would like to spend a minute discussing the current market trends as we always get a lot of questions about our leading indicators. A key leading indicator of our short-to-medium cycle business is marketing qualified leads or MQLs. As illustrated on the top chart, our MQL continues to grow. In Q2, we saw organic MQLs up 13% year-over-year. As for the longer-cycle component of our portfolio, one key indicator we look at is the funnel activity for engineered-to-order compressor systems. We remain encouraged as the funnel activities up 27% in the first half year-over-year. While the leading indicators have been encouraging, we have seen an elongation in the decision-making process with the prolonging of the time to convert an MQL to another. The feedback we hear contains multiple reasons. But some of the most often cited are customer site readiness and too many projects happening at the same time which is impacting EPC engineering capacity. Having said this, this situation is encouraging as we look to 2025. Switching back to 2024 expectations, from a regional perspective, Americas is on pace to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. EMEIA remains stable, and we see very good pockets of growth, primarily in the emerging markets of India and the Middle East. Asia Pacific and specifically China is a key driver of the reduction in our organic growth guidance. Moving next to inorganic growth. We're anticipating approximately $270 million of incremental revenue from our recently acquired M&A. ILC Dover is the largest driver, contributing approximately $220 million of revenue in 2024. The biopharma business as highlighted earlier in the deck remain strong and on track to deliver double-digit growth. However, we do anticipate that the Aerospace & Defense revenue to be down approximately $30 million versus our initial expectations and this is driven by lower-than-expected activity levels in our space business, predominantly related to the next-generation spacesuit, which is often referred to as xEVAS. As we move to Slide 14, given the solid performance in the first half, our recently acquired M&A and our expectation of continued operational execution fueled by IRX, we are once again raising our 2024 guidance. The company revenue is expected to grow overall between 6% to 8%, which is up 200 basis points versus our initial guidance. As discussed on the previous slide, we anticipate positive organic growth in the range of 0% to 2%. The reduction in the range versus our prior guidance is largely attributable to lower organic growth expectations, specifically in China. FX is now expected to be a 1% headwind for the full year, which is down approximately 100 basis points as compared to our previous guidance. M&A is projected to contribute approximately $440 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of July 31, 2024. Corporate costs are planned at $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $2.01 billion and $2.06 billion, which is up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.27 and $3.37, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge, showing the changes in our latest guidance as compared to our previous guidance provided in May. As you can see, the primary driver of adjusted EPS growth is associated with operational execution partially offset by increases in the net impact from interest and FX. We're also seeing a $0.02 improvement in our adjusted EPS as compared to our previous guidance from an improvement in our full year adjusted tax rate. Gross interest expense is now expected to be approximately $250 million and net interest expense will be approximately $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. The adjusted tax rate is expected to finish in the year between 22% and 23%. No changes have been made to our guidance on CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow to adjusted net income curvation or share count, all remain in line with our previous guidance. Finally, as we turn to Slide 15, I'm very pleased with how our teams continue to execute despite overall market conditions. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our first half performance and ongoing momentum. With our most recent guidance, we continue to expect to deliver results above of our long-term Investor Day targets. Based on the midpoint of our 2024 full year guidance, the 4-year CAGR for organic revenue growth will be approximately 10%. We think this continues to show durable outperformance over the cycle. That in combination with our inorganic growth, robust margin expansion and execution of IRX, we expect to deliver a 4-year CAGR in excess of 25% for adjusted EPS. To our employees, I want to thank you for the strong results thus far showing the impact each of you have as owners of the company. Thank you for your resiliency, hard work and focused attention. We believe the power of IRX, combined with our ownership mindset and leading portfolios, strengthens the durability of our company while delivering long-term value to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike Halloran : So let's start with the change in the second half organic assumptions. If I look at how the second quarter progressed, it feels generally consistent with what you were talking to on the top line coming into the quarter. The book-to-bill, orders down a little bit. Revenue levels came in at a reasonable level, all else equal. I certainly understand the commentary about a little longer to close on some of these transactions and pushouts of the orders as well as the China piece. So twofold question. One, was there something about July that you saw that maybe change that trajectory? And two, could you parse out some of the underlying things you're seeing from a demand environment excluding some of the project pushouts and if there's any changes elsewhere beyond just the China comments? Vicente Reynal : Yes. No, thank you, Mike. I mean I think you priming up actually quite well. So the answer to your first question is definitely no. I mean, nothing that we saw in July that gives us the concern and the change in kind of how we think about it. I think also, as you said, I mean I think things kind of are operating in the first half exactly as we expected. You saw that even we saw some very good sequential improvement Q1 to Q2 orders improving 5% and actually improving on both segments, not only the ITS but also in PST and -- but kind of when we think about the guidance and also you can see that in the second half, we do anticipate still organic revenue growth to be positive with a very good phase-in between revenue and EBITDA similar to prior years, which obviously implies that we'll continue to see some kind of good improvement here sequentially. But in terms of the guidance, I think the reduction is really predominantly driven by China. Again, although we also were fairly encouraged with what we saw improvements Q1 to Q2 in China, which was positive. And we're also encouraged by kind of what we hear from our teams in terms of level of activity in the month of July, driven by these new programs in place of replacing equipment that the government is putting out together in the market. We feel that we're taking the approach to be prudent and not necessarily see that the market materially changes in the second half in China and kind of keep it more, I would say, stable from here onwards. I will also say kind of in terms of what -- I mean any other changes in terms of market dynamics. I mean, not necessarily, we were very transparent here in terms of leading indicators that we always talk about, which is MQLs and funnel acceleration, just to show that market activity continues to be actually pretty good. I think is this elongation in what we call the velocity of converting some of those either formal or MQLs through the process, it seems to be kind of a little bit more elongated. Could that be driven by elections or could that be driven by geopolitical and obviously, what we hear about EPC capacity constraints and site readiness. There's a little bit of a few different points. I think, in our view, what we wanted to do is just kind of be more prudent as we go here into the second half. And again, based on these good visibility that we see on leading indicators, feeling good about how this could play out as we kind of head into 2025. Mike Halloran : That makes sense. And does that change how you guys were articulating the book-to-bill and order cadence from last quarter, if I remember correctly, it was orders slightly negative front half, but positive back half and then the inverse on the book-to-bill. Is that still the way to think about it? Or do these pushouts shift some of that numbers? Vicente Reynal : No, that's exactly the way to think about it, Mike, spot on. Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe Vicente, it seems like China was the sort of the pivot point on the organic guide. So maybe a little bit more color there. You mentioned the teams on the ground sound more optimistic, but maybe just put some numbers around it, sort of remind us, I guess, total China revenue exposure of Ingersoll Rand and then what were organic sales in China down in the first half of the year? And what does the midpoint of the guide embed for second half revenue trends year-on-year in China, please? Vikram Kini : Yes. Julian, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start and I'll let Vicente add some color as well. In terms of the first part of your question, I think fairly consistent with how we've described it historically, and it's important to note that this is a consistent statement about -- across both segments, both ITS and PST. Total APAC is roughly about 20% of the revenue base. And China is the lion's share of that, probably somewhere in the high-teens percent so the preponderance of that revenue base in APAC is China. To kind of give rough numbers in terms of the growth expectations, and I'll focus my commentary on the revenue side. In the first half, total APAC, which, of course, China is the biggest driver is effectively down, let's call it low double digits on the revenue base. It's important to note, obviously, the comps still pretty meaningful in the first half of the year. And as we move to the back half of the year, as Vicente just indicated, we do continue to see stability and some sequential, I'd say, progress from first half to second half. And then year-over-year, we actually expect probably to be closer to flattish year-over-year, both that stability moving from first half to second half, but also important to note that the comps do get a little bit more easier, comparatively speaking, in the back half from a revenue perspective, specifically in China. Vicente Reynal : The other thing to add there, and I think in terms of kind of some of the color that we see is that if you were to even exclude some of these kind of large projects, long cycle projects, China order is kind of that core business, which excludes this long cycle, especially fairly still good momentum there, Julian. So I'll say that even though in this challenging environment, they're still performing actually quite well. Julian Mitchell : And then just my quick follow-up. Just within the sort of second half guidance as we think about kind of seasonality. I realize there's some distortions sequentially into Q3 because of the acquisitions that closed in early June. But when we think about sort of third versus fourth quarter in your guide, are we thinking kind of Q3 is, I don't know, 25%, 26% of the year's EPS. And then revenue-wise, you kind of have just under $1.9 billion in Q3 and maybe just over $1.9 billion in Q4. Is that the way to think about it? Vikram Kini : Yes. So, I think you're close enough around it, and I think that's probably the right way to think about it. So interesting enough, I'd say the seasonal phasing, whether it be on the revenue side or on the earnings side, not dramatically different than what you've seen in prior year, slightly more weighted towards the back half than the front half. That is correct. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Vicente, can you drill in a little bit more on kind of PST in general, but kind of biopharma markets in particular? It does sound like you're seeing and feeling kind of the turn in those markets. But just kind of speak to what's going on in the channel or the channels cleared, what the outlook for maybe the remainder of the year is there. Vicente Reynal : Yes, absolutely. Jeff, so let me kind of break it into a couple of things. I mean, first of all, let's talk about the legacy Ingersoll Rand Life Science business and medical business as you saw, very, very good momentum in the quarter in Q2 with very nice growth at 8%. So that's actually very encouraging to see. And some, I'd say, good wins as we continue to -- you saw the product in action, the innovation in action that we put there. And so I'm getting -- that team is getting some very good exposure to personalized medicine, particularly around cancer treatment, which is very encouraging to see that. And I think on top of that, I mean, I think we're now 2 months into the ownership of ILC Dover with biopharma. And I think the team continues to stay pretty encouraging on what they're seeing now there and as we go out and meet with the teams, we see some continued good momentum there. And you saw in the prepared remarks that we still expect that business to be able to generate that kind of double-digit growth for this year. So again, speaks to the good kind of product innovation and nicheness of our technology and how we're particularly trying to be very focused on specific end markets that are seeing outside growth. Jeff Sprague : And then maybe just shifting maybe this is total IR, maybe biases a little bit more towards industrial tech. But what's going on with kind of service, service attachment? Is it growing here? How does it look into the back half? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Great, Jeff. Thank you for asking the question. I think we continue to be very excited about all the actions that we're doing around the care packages and the service attachment. As a matter of fact, I mean, even this week right now here, we have a team kind of getting together to talk about the continuation of taking service activities to the next level. So we continue to be very encouraged of what we're seeing and whether it is with just regular kind of service attachment, but also Ecoplant as Ecoplant continues to see some progression. And you saw that even also we acquired a company called CAPS in Australia, and that's ready to give us more better channel, better access with a larger footprint on service. So service continues to be a very high priority for all of us as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Rob Wertheimer : So my question is on gross margin. It was great in the quarter. I wonder if you could touch on price cost a little bit, price and competitive dynamic and how you're kind of winning or not share in the market. And then just out of curiosity, when you have that higher gross margin, you can lean a bit more into spend. Curious how you manage that and what that kind of increased -- it wasn't but increased spending might be. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Rob, great question. The gross margin expansion, very pleased to see a lot of that. And driven through the execution of initiatives like [indiscernible], as you mentioned, but I2V as well as the higher recurring revenue streams that we were just even talking about on the last question. So all of that is really inflecting some very good expansion into our gross margin that helped us deliver that expansion into our EBITDA margin. And absolutely, we're definitely investing. I mean, we can do to invest in areas like demand generation, R&D and many other areas as needed, whether sales force activity and service technician to continue to grow the recurring revenue. I'm sorry, on price cost, Vik, do you want to comment on that? Vikram Kini : Yes. On the price cost side of the equation, so specifically in the quarter, price was, let's just say, approximately 2.5% across the entire enterprise, fairly comparable between the 2 segments. And then from an inflationary perspective, I'd say the commentary is very similar to what we saw in Q1. I'd say the direct material side, it kind of continues to move sideways. So not a lot of what I would say, headwinds on a year-over-year basis, but kind of sideways. And then I'd say on the labor side, relatively normal course. So again, continue to see good pricing momentum from the organization, good translation to the bottom line and you see that reflected in the gross margin profile, along with some of the other initiatives that Vicente spoke to. Rob Wertheimer : Got it. And then just a minor follow-up. Just pricing looking forward, roughly the same. And what does the new normal and price feel like now? Is it going forward as far as you can see or 2 or 3 years? Or any commentary? And I'll stop. Vikram Kini : Yes. Just to keep it relatively simple. I think we've said that pricing will kind of return to, I'd say, a little bit more of the norm that you've seen historically, which is probably around that 1% to 2% gross pricing levels or net pricing level, I should say. And if you think about where we're headed in the back half, I think that's kind of where we should be. We were still benefiting from a little bit of some of the carryover pricing actions from last year here to the first half. But we would expect between 1% to 2% is probably a good indicative range for the back half of 2024 as well as expectation for '25 onwards. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Vicente, can we double-click on that commentary around the MQLs and the plays that you're seeing? I'm just curious, like, obviously, there's a lot of activity, particularly happening in the U.S. with mega project activity. And I'm just wondering if that's just a function of, look, these projects have started, but you guys aren't really seeing the orders as quickly at this point, but they're on the come because projects have broken ground. Just any other color you could give us around that would be helpful. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, I think good question. And I would say on that slide, we try to separate 2 things, the kind of short to medium cycle and then the long cycle. And I would say that the mega projects perhaps view more on that kind of more on the long cycle, where we continue to see funnel increases, but there is that continued elongation driven by -- in some cases, we have seen some of the EPCs having 2 to 3 years of backlog and kind of creating a delay in how they continue to release those basically large projects into orders. So I think it's just -- that's why when we made the commentary, we said, \"Hey, I think it's good news as we think about ahead and particularly maybe as we think even around 2025, that there is this perhaps a lot of projects that as they get released, we will see some better momentum on that.\" So -- and from an NPL perspective, which is kind of the short to medium cycle, I mean we made some commentary around PST. I mean, PST on that short cycle business continues to be actually quite good at mid-single digit growth even in the second quarter. We just wanted to show that MQL, it is double-digit kind of growth on a year-over-year. Clearly, all of that doesn't translate into the orders as we're not seeing that double-digit orders, but is a great indicator as to the market activity on how we're instigating them and how we're getting really penetrated into new accounts and new customer base. And I think that's just for us a good leading indicator on an ongoing performance for us. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's super helpful, Vicente. And then my other question, like, look, to take this a variety of different ways, but congrats on shoring up the balance sheet from a leverage standpoint and from a debt standpoint. I know how important M&A is for you guys going forward and how it has been a great value creator for you. It is interesting to see you take down the aerospace and defense number for the year by $30 million. I know that's a small number. And I think that, that's the part of the piece that came out of the ILC Dover acquisition that you just completed. So I guess the question is, as you're kind of thinking through these acquisitions and there might be pieces of these acquired companies that you buy that you'll have inherent volatility. How are you thinking about like managing that going forward as you look through your evaluation process? Vicente Reynal : Yes, great question, Joe. I think particularly if you think about ILC Dover, we're very excited about the business. And if you remember when we talk about the company, very excited about that exposure into the Life Sciences, which is basically 75% of -- approximately 75% of our total business for ILC Dover is Life Sciences with a good blend between biopharma and medical device component. And we always spoke about, in this case, aerospace being a bit of an optionality. Good exposure, good things to learn, but also good to better understand. So as we continue to go forward and learn more about the business, what we can do with it, you know that historically, we have always been pleased with doing -- whether it is carve-outs and then selecting bases that we like or emphasizing more on one versus another. But I think it's the purpose of the strategic view that we had with ILC Dover is a higher penetration on to the Life Science side of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Andy Kaplowitz : In the center, Vik, you started out essentially flat in terms of organic revenue growth in the first half of '24. So I think in order to hit the midpoint of your guide now you need to grow the high end of that 0% to 2% for the second half. So we know you have easier comps, but do you need to see any incremental acceleration in your short-cycle businesses to achieve that midpoint? Are you basically just assuming more status quo in terms of short-cycle markets now remaining somewhat constrained in long-cycle markets contributing more growth? Vikram Kini : Yes. Andy, this is Vik. I think the way you've described it is correct. So just to calibrate the numbers. I think you're right, 1% to 2% organic growth in the back half of the year is probably the right way to think about it system-wide. I think in terms of the components and the moving pieces, yes, I think what we would say here is relative stability, no dramatic, let's just call it, hockey stick improvement or anything of that nature in the back half implied. Obviously, we've taken down the China expectations, which is effectively the preponderance of what changed the organic growth guide. So I think now it's execution of the backlog. You know that we typically do have a little bit of seasonality in the business where second half is stronger than first half, that's no different this year. And I think the other factors you mentioned here are largely accurate. So I think we feel comfortable with the guidance as provided. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful. And then maybe can you talk about what happened to PST adjusted EBITDA margin in Q2? I mean it's down sequentially despite significantly higher revenue. I think we recognize there's a fair amount of acquisition-related revenue in there. But I thought ILC Dover was coming in at accretive margins in the segment. Are there acquisition margins or something else happens in the quarter? Vikram Kini : Yes, Andy, so just to address the second part of your question first, we did have 1 month of ILC Dover results in Q2. And I'd say largely in line with expectations both from a top line and bottom line and profitability perspective. I think, generally speaking here, about 30.8% EBITDA margins to about 30.3%. I wouldn't attribute that to anything more than just some of the normal course revenue mix and things of that nature from the balance of the business. Nothing that I think you should read into any further than that as we think, frankly, going forward here into the back half of the year, those numbers closer trending sequentially better from Q2 and into Q3 and then Q3 to Q4, absolutely. So I don't think anything has changed in our context as far as that getting to a mid-30s EBITDA margin profile over the next few years in line with our Investor Day targets for PST. So nothing has really changed in that respect. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Most of my questions are answered. But I'm curious to go back to your kind of indicators, the MQL and the funnel activity. You must track kind of win rates or conversion or something over time as well. Any changes to note there? Vicente Reynal : Yes, we do. And no changes on that. I think the change has been basically more because we also track the velocity of those kind of projects or orders through the funnel and that is basically what I would say has maybe changed and then the reason why we call it that elongation. But in terms of win rates and all that, no change in that. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. And then I'm curious about this CAPS acquisition. I'm not sure if I'm reading this right, but this sounds like you're actually providing power and air to customers, which is kind of a different kind of service, I think, than most of the rest of what you do. Does this open up sort of a new area where you can be more of a power-by-the-hour type supplier across a bigger addressable market? Vicente Reynal : Yes, Steve. I would say that, I mean, they're mainly primarily a compressor distributor. They do have some power side of the business that is small in nature, but interestingly enough, I mean they actually have provided power for some -- even including data centers, I mean, amongst all things. So I think it's just an interesting area that we're learning, and we have some chiller technology with Friulair that we're seeing how can we interact. So I mean, we're definitely learning a lot on that side. In terms of air, air by the hour or things like that, we do have some of those programs already in place in Australia, even with our legacy Ingersoll Rand side of the business, and we call it air over the fence in many cases. But I think we're very excited about CAPS. I mean it gives us a tremendous amount of footprint in Australia and great connectivity to a very good level of customer base in addition to the great strong base of revenue that we already have with Ingersoll Rand. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Yes, we've got a lot of ground already. I just want to make sure that we've got the second half book-to-bill sort of lined up here. I think in response to Mark's question, I think you talked about the inverse of the first half. So are we talking about sort of like a high 0.9, maybe like close to 1x book-to-bill in the back half or ITS? And obviously, that would suggest orders up mid- to high single digits. So I just want to make sure that's the message. And what do we see getting better here? Do we see China improving? Are we expecting some of these larger projects that start breaking free? Because it sounds like the EPC project bundle is not really breaking for until 2025. So just want to just try and dial into that comment. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Sure, Nigel. So book-to-bill, yes, definitely less than 1 in the second half, which is kind of back to our normal way of -- we always said [indiscernible] and 1 in this first half and then it's basically less than 1 in the second half. And that would imply kind of since I would say, maybe to the numbers, I mean, think about it, Q3 and Q4 is slightly different, but low single digits year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. That's kind of what we imply there. Although keep in mind that we don't tend to guide on orders, but you can do the back of the envelope calculation there. And on the second question, I mean the EPC and the large project continues to still be at play here in the second half. I think what we're saying is that this elongation of decision-making is taking much longer. And for better or letter way of saying it, we're discounting that even further. But these are projects that are active and whether they might happen in the second half or they may happen as we go into 2025. We view that as great visibility as to what's out there in the market that will be eventually coming back to us. Nigel Coe : Okay. So low single digit growth in the second half of the year, okay. That's helpful. And obviously, China is the issue here. I had battery EV as maybe 15% or so of the China business. I want to make sure that's still the sort of the right zone there. And just thinking about your verticals across the globe. I mean, we are seeing some noisy trends in food and beverage. So I'm just curious if you're seeing stable trends in food and beverage or whether there's some noise there as well. Vikram Kini : Yes. Nigel, on the first part, we don't typically talk about kind of like end market, let's just call it, designations within our specific regions, but I think it's fair to say that EV battery, solar were too meaningful end markets in terms of the order and revenue contribution in 2023. I'd still say they are active markets, but just, frankly, obviously, not at the same level as what you've seen in prior year. And Vicente, I'll let you comment on the food and beverage. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Food and beverage, I mean, nothing of note to be honest here, Nigel. I mean I think food and beverage will continue to sell based on just as we always do in terms of sustainability, whether it is return on investment based on energy savings, the ability to be able to provide service agreements. So a good combination of all and it's about prioritizing the spend in those facilities. And as long as we show a great return on investment, which we are with our technologies and our solutions, we can get that into us. Nigel Coe : And just to clarify, Vicente, the low single digit, that's organic, not reported, right? Vicente Reynal : That's right. That's exactly right, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea : So I also wanted to ask on some of the site readiness and EPC dynamics you're talking about. And just your evaluation on why that's emerging now. It doesn't seem like the demand environment has changed all that much. I'm not sure if this is more of a reflection of kind of mega project funnel, but just what you've seen over the course of the past 2 or 3 quarters such that this would be emerging as a challenge now. And then as it relates to the guide and expectations in the back half of the year, does that embed kind of any expectation that some of these sort of projects move forward that the EPC capacity eases or if any of that happens, should we think about that as more kind of upside? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I'll take the first one and let Vik kind of talk about the second one. As you know, and I think you said it and someone said it as well. I mean, there's been a lot of megaprojects approval for the past few years. But not all those orders and revenue have been seen from those projects. And so there's definitely bottlenecks throughout the process. And what we hear is basically that customer site readiness due to labor but also that EPC capacity. I made an example about an EPC in Europe that currently has something like 2.5 years of backlog in orders that they got to kind of push through the process. And what we're saying here is that it seems to bring to light, but potentially of having good 2025 as some of those projects get released and perhaps hear some as well here in the second half. Second question, Vik? Vikram Kini : Yes. I think, Joe, in terms of the second half, is there anything directly embedded? No. I think this is a simple answer. Obviously, our second half includes execution on existing backlog. Obviously, there's a component of longer-cycle projects like you've seen in prior years. To the degree, as Vicente said, some of the solutions up or things like that, great. I would view that as potential maybe some orders. But remember, most of these are 6- to 18-month lead time type project. So reality is those will not convert to revenue until 2025 or later. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. Yes. No, makes sense, comments helpful. And then also just in terms of China, is it right that, that China kind of played out as expected, more or less in the first half of the year? And so the guidance adjustment would be more reflective of the second half of the year, a little softer than anticipated. And if so, it seems like it's more kind of stable in China first half to second half. And so what did you think might get a little bit better at this point in time doesn't seem like it's going to play out that way? Vicente Reynal : So I'll say that China definitely played out very well in terms of what we kind of saw in the first half. I will say that even in some regards, slightly better because we saw that Q1 to Q2 sequential improvement in orders in China, which we were surprised to see and the team building some backlog. We just decided that based on everything that we can see coming out of China and whether geopolitical elections and all of that kind of put together, we decided to be more prudent and kind of put China more as being stable here in the second half versus seeing any material improvement from here onwards. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : We've had a lot of discussion around the large project activity in ITS. I guess can you talk a little bit about what you guys saw on the short cycle part of the business from an order perspective throughout the quarter? Vicente Reynal : Nicole, I would say that one data point that we talked a lot about is that kind of short cycle on the PST side, mid-single-digit kind of growth in Q2, which is actually very good to see. And when you think about all the other in the ITS side, I mean, all the regions, including -- except obviously China, they saw actually some very good momentum too as well. As indicated, as you can see in terms of some of the product line aspect that we talked about compressors and compressor has been up from an orders perspective, kind of in the second quarter, which obviously a lot of the compressor that's driving to as well, the majority for us is on that kind of short cycle side, short to medium cycle. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. And then on the ITS margins, is the expectation that margins kind of remain in this slightly below-30% zone in the second half? Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Nicole, that's a fair conclusion. Yes. Around 30% is a pretty good number. Operator : Our final question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. David Raso : Two quick things. Maybe I missed it, I apologize, a lot of earnings this morning. But you made a comment about deciding to walk away from one of the larger transactions. Can you provide a little color? Was that strictly a price-related decision to walk away or something about the markets or anything you could enlighten us on why you'd walk away to maybe -- to learn more how you think about other larger deals that could be coming? Vicente Reynal : Yes. Good question there, David. I think the reason for that is that, first of all, I say this is a transaction that we cultivated for past kind of 3 years. So we've been kind of watching them on the sidelines and learning a lot about them. And this transaction, I would say, fell really more into the adjacent category as compared to our core offering of compressor blower and vacuum. But yes, I mean, I think, ultimately, it was all about valuation. I mean we continue to be highly disciplined. And we assume very well know, we tend to do a lot of our ROI analysis around the line, so things that we can control and how do we view that business on areas that we can control versus extrapolating on revenue activity that we tend to discount heavily. So I will say that, ultimately, that led to a performance that we've decided that it was just not the right timing for us. David Raso : And one follow-up, maybe I should know this, but I don't. The new -- with ILC, right, PST is going to be, call it, a run rate, a $1.7 billion business. I think $700 million or so will now be a Life Science piece and then the other $1 billion is the Precision Tech. Within the total segment margin of, call it, 31% this year, something like that, what's the difference between the margins of Precision Tech and Life Sciences? Vikram Kini : Yes, David, interesting enough. Yes, quite comparable to each other. I wouldn't tell you there's a meaningful mix differential between the 2. Both are playing in and around that, I'd say, segment average profile. So actually quite comparable. Operator : This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Vicente for closing remarks. Vicente Reynal : Thank you, Briana. I'll just say thank you for your level of interest, and I appreciate all the questions and all the participants that I know many of our employees are actually listening to the call and to those that are listening to the call, I'd just say thank you again for another great quarter performance. And let's get out of here now to execute again here in the second half of the year. With that, thank you very much, and have a good day. Operator : This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you. I'd now like to welcome Matthew Fort, vice president of investor relations, to begin the conference. Matthew, over to you. Matthew Fort : Good morning, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2024 third quarter earnings call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2024 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. Starting on Slide 3, our team delivered another strong quarter of results by leveraging our competitive differentiator, IRX. And for that, I want to thank and acknowledge our employees for continuing to think and act like owners. Our strong execution was highlighted by record orders and revenue, over 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, 9% adjusted EPS growth, and 20% free cash flow margins. And despite the difficult macro environment, we expect to deliver on our long-term Investor Day targets of double-digits adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow generation in 2024. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine describes how we deliver durable compounded results. As stated on the right hand side of the page, ultimately, the intended outcomes are double-digits earnings growth and strong free cash flow margins. We remain committed to our strategy of delivering over the cycle, our long-term Investor Day targets as outlined on this page. Our unique culture of ownership combined with IRX is our competitive differentiator, which will help to drive that long-term value creation. With that in mind, let me provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. On the next slide, we'll start with our inorganic growth initiatives. I am pleased to highlight four transactions that closed this past month, which together are expected to achieve a mid-teens ROIC by year three. Let me walk through these deals. First, APSCO, which is a leader in the design and manufacturing of fluid power systems for mobile transport equipment. This is a great example of strategic market expansion, which further strengthens our position in the dry and liquid blower and vacuum markets with energy efficient-innovative solutions. Next is Blutek, which expands Ingersoll Rand technology capabilities, expertise and aftermarket potential in high growth sustainable end markets, including biogas and carbon capture. Continuing on Page 6, on the left hand side of the page, we have UT Pumps, which adds new high pressure pump technology to our portfolio in end markets including water, wastewater, food, beverage and life sciences. And finally, next is Penn Valley Pump, which is a leading manufacturer of positive displacement pumps with patented double disc pump technology for use in the municipal, industrial, chemical and food industries. On the right hand side of the page, I would like to highlight that year-to-date, we have already closed on a total of 15 transactions in 2024 and we have far exceeded our annualized inorganic revenue target, which bodes well as we look towards 2025. In addition, the funnel continues to grow and remains very active with 10 additional transactions currently under LOI, including deals that will fit into our recently-created life sciences business. The funnel including the deals under LOI are primarily bolt-on in size. Turning to Slide 7, I wanted to take a minute and highlight how we are driving organic growth across our digitally-connected assets as we often get asked two questions. First, what do we do with the data we receive on our connected assets? And two, how do we leverage that data to drive additional revenue. And simply stated, our teams are focused on creating a meaningful positive impact for our customers around energy efficiency and uptime. Example on the slide demonstrates the agility, with which we operate. We recently gathered 45 employees across seven countries over a period of just two days. The goal was to do a deep dive into real time connected asset data to unlock new revenue opportunities. The outcome was that, we identified over 40 different revenue-generating insights that collectively could translate to over $25 million in incremental revenue, a figure that speaks volumes about the potential of data-driven innovation for our products. As you can see in the middle of the page, we have examples of those insights, and these range from the optimization of energy consumption and maximizing machine uptime. When we empower our people at every level of the organization to think and act like owners, they make us better by defining new customer experiences, improving our ways of working, and bringing innovative thinking to advance our mission of making life better. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance. Vik Kini : Thanks, Vicente. Starting on Slide 8. Utilizing our competitive differentiator of IRX, we were able to deliver strong results within the quarter despite the continued challenging macroeconomic environment. Total company orders grew 10% or up 1% organically, finishing largely in line with expectations. Book-to-bill was 0.97x, which is in line with our previous guidance of above 1x in the first half and below 1x in the second half. Total revenue was up 7% as reported or down 2% organically. Worth noting that, we did see some customers pushing out orders due in large part to site readiness and local approvals. However, we have not seen order cancellations, nor do we feel that cancellations are a significant risk. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $533 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.6%, a 210 basis point year-over-year improvement driven predominantly through gross margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.84 for the quarter, which is up 9% compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $374 million delivering a solid 20% free cash flow margin in the quarter. And total liquidity was $4 billion with $1.4 billion of cash on hand at quarter end, which demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet. Our continued strength in free cash flow generation will enable us to remain focused on our capital allocation strategy. As Vicente mentioned earlier, we still have 10 additional transactions currently under LOI, and we continue to have momentum in building our M&A funnel. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company on an FX-adjusted basis, Q3 orders were up 10% and revenue increased 7%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. And ITS segment margin increased 190 basis points reaching a new high of nearly 31%, while the PST segment margin decreased 30 basis points year-over-year, but remains above 30%. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 210 basis points, and corporate costs came in at $35 million for the quarter due in large part to a year-to-date true-up of management incentive costs. Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 9% year-over-year to $0.84 per share, including an adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 22.8%. On the next slide, free cash flow for the quarter was $374 million including CapEx, which totaled $30 million. Total company liquidity now stands at $4 billion based on approximately $1.4 billion of cash and $2.6 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 1.7 turns, which was a 0.8 turn increase year-over-year and a 0.3 turn improvement sequentially versus Q2. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily due to the purchase of ILC Dover earlier this year. Specifically within the quarter, cash outflows included $15 million deployed to M&A, as well as $71 million returned to shareholders through $63 million in share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with M&A being our top priority, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results. Vicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 3% on top of approximately 19% growth in Q3 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins finished at a record high of 30.7% with incremental of over 100%. Adjusted EBITDA margins finished up 190 basis points from the prior year, which was driven primarily by gross margin expansion. Book-to-bill was 0.97x with organic orders up low single-digits finishing largely in line with expectations. Moving to the product line highlights. Compressor orders were up mid-single-digits and we continue to see positive orders globally excluding China. Compressor revenue was up low single-digits in the quarter, while industrial vacuum & blower orders were up high single-digits and revenue was up low single-digits. For innovation in action, we're highlighting our new patented oil-free technology that is focused on high growth sustainable end markets like food, beverage and clean energy. This patented technology offers a 30% reduction in total cost of ownership, driving a great return on investment for the customer and helping our customers achieve their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission reduction targets. Turning to Slide 12. The PST segment achieved 3% organic order growth and delivered adjusted EBITDA of approximately $118 million with a margin of 30%. We continue to see many encouraging signs within the PST segment, with sequential order growth of 13% and sequential revenue growth of 16%. Book-to-bill was 0.96x or 0.99x on an organic basis. In addition, short cycle orders in PST segment remain positive with book and ship orders of high single-digits year-over-year demonstrating the continued ongoing momentum of organic orders driven mainly by our demand generation efforts. We're pleased to see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. Finally, I wanted to highlight the performance of ILC Dover within the quarter. Sequentially, total ILC Dover revenue improved low double-digits with the biopharma business up low-20s and the medical device component business up low double-digits. Year-over-year revenue for the biopharma business is up double-digits. We're very pleased with the business performance, and we're optimistic about the potential to drive above-market growth. Our PST innovation in action example shows how our mission-critical products can help a community in need. Planet Water Foundation provides safe drinking water access in the wake of emergencies and natural disasters. Using our Dosatron pumps, the Planet Water system can provide clean drinking water for up to 6,000 people without the need of electricity. The system was recently deployed in Nashville, North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. I also would like to take a moment to talk about the recent hurricanes, which impacted our Dosatron site in the Tampa area, where several of our team members experienced flooding that damaged many of their homes. And despite this, they worked late nights and weekends to support our customers. So to our Dosatron team, a special thank you for your dedication, hard work, and resiliency. Your actions show what we can achieve with our ownership mindset and culture. On the next slide, let me provide an update on the current market trends as we always get a lot of questions about our leading indicators. Marketing qualified leads or MQLs are a key leading indicator of our short to medium cycle business. As illustrated in the chart on the left hand side of the page, our MQLs continue to grow. For the quarter, organic MQLs are up 12% year-over-year and are up 7% sequentially. As for the longer cycle component of our portfolio, one key indicator we look at is the funnel activity for engineered to order compressor systems, and we remain encouraged, as the funnel activity for Q3 is up 22% year-over-year. Consistent with what we discussed last quarter, the decision-making process remains elongated. The feedback we hear continues to be centered-around customer side readiness and too many projects happening at the same time, which is impacting EPC engineering capacity. As we move to Slide 14, we have updated our full year 2024 guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Total company revenue is now expected to grow overall between 5% to 7%, which is down 100 basis points versus our prior guidance. For adjusting, our organic revenue guidance down 200 basis points, driven predominantly by the timing of orders converting into shipments. While we are very encouraged by the improvement in Q3 organic order momentum and continued strength in market activity, we continue to see customer delivery delays, driven largely by customer-side readiness and other factors including the upcoming election. We expect these orders to be delivered in 2025. As we look at our MQL data, long cycle project funnel and Q3 organic order growth, this situation remains encouraging as we move into 2025. FX is now expected to be approximately flat for the full year, which is approximately 100 basis points as compared to our previous guide. M&A is projected to contribute around $455 million, which reflects all completed and closed transactions as of October 31, 2024. Corporate cost remains at approximately $170 million. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $2.01 billion and $2.04 billion, which is approximately 13% year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.28 and $3.34 which is up approximately 12%, year-over-year at the midpoint. On the bottom right hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge, showing the changes in our latest guidance, as compared to our previous guidance provided in August. No changes have been made to our guidance on interest expenses, tax rate, CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, and free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion, all remain in line with our previous guidance. Finally, as we turn into Slide 15, before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that, I am very pleased with how our teams continue to execute despite the current market conditions. As we look to close out 2024, our teams continue to execute well in terms of targeted share gains and driving momentum in geographies, where we have historically been under penetrated. And despite lower organic growth expected in 2024, we're on track to deliver a nearly 10% organic growth CAGR for the total company over the past four years, which is 2x our stated goal. What continues to differentiate Ingersoll Rand is our economic growth engine, where even in a difficult macro environment, we're able to add differentiated technologies to the portfolio with a distinct focus in high growth sustainable end markets. Year-to-date, we have added 15 companies through M&A with 10 more bolt-on targets under LOI, and we don't see this momentum slowing down. The real power continues to be in the value we're able to unlock as part of this model. We're on track to deliver again triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion through strong initiatives focused on improving gross margins, which translate into strong double-digit earnings growth and solid free cash flow generation. We believe that, we have created a durable model that will continue to deliver exceptional financial results, differentiating Ingersoll Rand as a premier growth compounder. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Mike Halloran : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 13. And I certainly heard the prepared remark commentary around project push-outs. But maybe you could put that slide in context to, what you're seeing on an underlying basis right now, because I think the MQLs as an example, that's been improving as you've worked through the year here, but the organic growth guidance has moved down, again, partially project push outs. But maybe kind of correlate all those moving pieces, because I'm guessing the MQLs is probably a little bit of a shorter term lead time or leading indicator. Excuse me. And so, kind of just maybe put all that in context and then related, what needs to happen to have that slide sync with the order trends and the underlying demand and the underlying trend in your portfolio? Vicente Reynal : Mike, I mean, first of all, I'd say that, we're definitely encouraged by what we see in terms of that market activity and I will also categorize the MQL market activity, as you recall, we always say that's our demand generation engine that we're instigating demand. Basically, this is how we continue to penetrate new customer accounts. We always said that, 50% of those MQLs go into customers that have not purchased anything from Ingersoll Rand over the past, call it, two years. It's about how do we continue to take share. Now, clearly, in the past historically, we said that an MQL will translate into an order over a period of six to eight weeks, but what we're saying now is that that is definitely getting elongated. We're not making a commentary as to how elongated that is, but it is definitely much longer than what historically has been. And a lot of that has to do with kind of what you see in the market. I mean, clearly customer readiness, here lately could be some of the election instability or kind of predicting as to what might happen and kind of some of the holdups that not only us, but maybe others are seeing. So I think the encouragement for us is that, these are real customers, really interested in real products. I mean, this is not just a customer asking a question, right. This is now a qualified lead of an activity that the customer is just very interested in putting in a purchase order that is going through our funnel. The good news too as well is that, we don't see cancellations. We don't see customers leaving our funnel. It's just a matter of continuing to nurturing those customers until we get the closure. We have continued to see good close rates. And so, that's why we continue to be very encouraged about the activity that we're seeing, that we're generating. And as to the long cycle project, kind of fairly similar in scope. Keep in mind, over the past few years, there's been a lot of mega projects that have been announced. And I think you have seen maybe in the market that not a lot of those have translated yet into the orders. And that has to do, because these mega projects, when they get designed, they need to get designed, they need to get designed and processed through typically large engineering contracting companies, we call it EPCs, and there's just a lot of projects that are going through. What is encouraging is that, we're seeing good movement on those. I spent -- over the past two weeks, I did a lot of travel around the world. I spent actually an entire weekend in Middle East, in Dubai and Saudi just to even talk to customers about specific projects and just to get that perspective firsthand from those customers, and it's very encouraging with what we're seeing. What we're seeing here is that, it's just taking longer. But again, that to us bodes well, as we continue to look forward, and in the meantime, we'll just continue to execute in control what we can control and deliver the performance that we can deliver. Mike Halloran : So, if I take your comments then, the optimism, the fact that these indicators are tracking the right way, does that mean that, when you think about next year, it starts tracking towards a more normal growth algorithm for the company? And if it doesn't, what do you think prevents you from getting there at this point, market, timing of these projects, any other variables? Vicente Reynal : Yes. I think Mike, I think the way we view it is that I mean, we don't view that the margin is going to see a V-shaped recovery. We'll just see that gradual recovery as we go into 2025. And as we always do, we want to kind of see continuation here in the fourth quarter, how everything kind of lays out in preparation for our 2025 and we give guidance on our next earnings call. But the other point too, that bodes well for us is that, here even in the Q3, our backlog actually grew year-over-year and sequentially. Again, it kind of continues to bode well as we think about 2025, but we'll be able to provide better color and guidance, as we go into our next earnings cycle. Operator : On the line is Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a first question around sort of current demand trend, just flesh that out a little bit more. I think the last quarter, it was very clear that China was the big headwind or surprise factor back in, the early summer months. And I see your compressor orders ex-China are good. But since the last call, have you seen kind of a broadening out of those project push-outs? Is there maybe weakness in more geographies perhaps than just the China factor? And I understand that, orders are good, backlogs are good. It's the conversion of those two things into sales that's sluggish at present. But when we take a step back and look at the overall kind of process industries exposure of ITS, is it fair to say that, those generally would lag kind of earlier cycle markets and that speaks to your point on a very gradual recovery pace next year. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Thanks, Julian. China, back to that commentary about the travel, actually two weeks ago, I spent a weekend in China with the team, and as I always do, spend a good amount of time with customers, I can also give you a little bit of color on that as well. I think China clearly the market has been challenged this year and has remained largely, I would say unchanged as we move through Q3 and into early parts of Q4. I think the good thing, I guess, the good tone as I spend time with customers and give you maybe a data point of this kind of customer that, it's a very large account. It's a company that has over 400 facilities just in China alone and close to 1,000 facilities across the world. And the tone from this customer was fairly positive towards what we, as Ingersoll Rand, can do for them around our service-oriented initiatives. I mean, the customer was very enthusiastic on leveraging all the M&A in terms of technologies that we have done across, not only in China for China, but also in the U.S. and bring technology back to China to be able to help them, and particularly with the same growth themes and thematics that we say, energy efficiency and how do we continue to improve the operational ability of their facilities. Customer was very -- commented incredibly well about our ownership mindset and how they feel that our employees when they go to their factories kind of take care incredible care of them. And the customer was, I'll say positive in terms of what they're seeing around investments, not only in China for China, but then now starting to expand outside of China, particularly in countries like even Africa. So, I think we see customers are willing to invest and willing to continue to accelerate how they continue to see their efficiencies. In terms of this question, do we see anything broadly across any other regions that inflected negatively? I'll say, not for the most part. I mean, I think the guidance here, as we said is driven largely by the shipment timing. And this is just the willingness of the customers to take the product now versus we're saying, -- we're seeing -- we have seen delays and customer getting some of those push-outs and we're just going to say and assume that this is going to actually now move into 2025 some of them and that's really the driver of our guidance, organic guidance takedown. In terms of your question about the ITS business driven process industries and how do we traditionally see, you're absolutely right in the sense that, we expect to see that gradual movement. I think we view ITS as a very diverse in nature and we have said always that we can pivot our products and technologies to the pockets of growth that we may see. And clearly, you have seen PMIs that have been in contraction territory for over 24 months. We believe that, we have outperformed that. I mean, example, last year, we grew organically at double-digits versus this year will be more flattish, but again, we think it's better than contraction territory that PMS are showing. But, yes, I mean, having said that, we believe that growth will continue to come more gradually as we expect these PMIs to improve and we don't expect that V-shaped recovery or kind of snap of growth from one quarter to another, but more gradually. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. Just my follow-up on the margin front. So maybe just put a finer point on the sort of EBITDA margin rates in Q4. I think it may be down a little bit sequentially, but maybe I have that wrong. But that would be I know historically you're normally up sequentially in Q4. And as we think about 2025, exceptional incrementals this year, any sort of giveback or normalization of incrementals, as you think about next year, because of investment spend or anything like that? Vik Kini : Yes. Julien, this is Vik. Let me take that one. So, I think, first and foremost, frankly, exceptional margin performance by the teams in Q3, really proud of what the teams were able to deliver. I think it's worth noting, that largely driven by gross margin expansion and you really are starting to see, I'd say, the fruits of the labor and things like recurring revenue and things of that nature that we've been talking about for quite a while. I think as you move to Q4, I think sequentially, you're still going to see essentially two segments that are in the 30% EBITDA margin range. It's probably the easiest way to say it. I think corporate costs will probably normalize a little bit in that $40 million to $45 million range. And so that's kind of the way to think about that margin algorithm for Q4. Now, I think as you've always seen us do and say, we're going to continue to make the requisite investments for ongoing growth. And if there's room to probably outperform on the margin front, specifically in ITS, I think, you've seen us do that for several quarters. I don't think you'll hopefully see anything necessarily different in Q4, but we think around 30% is probably the right levels as you think about Q4 specifically. To your question about 2025 and obviously not giving necessarily guidance at this point, but is there anything that we would say is giving back margins or anything of that nature? No, I don't think that that's the way to think about it. We think that, next year will be a bit of a normal margin expansion kind of in line with what we've historically laid out. But, we feel really good about where we are, and most importantly, we continue to make the right investments in areas like innovation, demand generation and commercial resources. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe, simply just kind of back to the project delays and uncertainty. What you said about the EPCs is interesting. But a lot of companies are pointing to election uncertainty. What is your view on that? Is that a reality or an excuse? And, do you see the outcome impacting your business substantially one way or the other or just having an outcome and getting this over with just lift some uncertainty, we can kind of try to move on with whatever hand we're dealt? Vicente Reynal : Yes. It's interesting, I mean, and the reason why we don't call it out too often is because, it is -- we do a lot of voice of customer, and we are pretty close and intimate to them as they go through their buying cycle. It doesn't come off top of the table or top of the chart in terms of as the reason why the elongation. Now naturally, as we have been kind of getting closer to the election here, has it been more verbally said more often? I'll say, yes. It is definitely not the top of the list, but it is definitely mentioned more often. So I think, there's a little bit of that. I mean, how big of a reality it is or how much pent-up demand is going to be after the election kind of snaps or kind of is over with and we see a better outcome. I think still there's a lot to be determined based on clearly what happens at the election time. But again, we'll remain focused on controlling what we can control, and that's our play basically here, Jeff. So, to answer your question, yes, how we heard that a little bit more often? I would say, maybe yes, but it is definitely not the number one reason for the elongation. Jeff Sprague : Do the project delays though skew to the U.S.? It sounds like it's actually just quite global. Vicente Reynal : It is quite global, Jeff. Yes. Very global. That's why the election is definitely not the only reason, to be honest. You know, due to Saudi Arabia and spend time with customers, it is project late delayed because of site readiness and EPC. I mean, it's basically those two. Jeff Sprague : Yes. Just pivoting real quick. Just mix obviously or seemingly would be positive, given equipment softer and Vik just mentioned service. Can you just maybe give us a little bit of an update on how service is performing, sort of what the growth rate is, how you expect to close out 2024 on the service side. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Jeff, very encouraging on the service side. Service positive, good momentum that we saw clearly organically in the quarter. And I think everything that we said at Investor Day is working really well. That recurring revenue and the focus of the teams are giving it and not just, I mean, the U.S. is 1 of the biggest engines that we have, how we see now the momentum in Europe and even also in China and India. India was the other country that I spend amount of time with the team. And again, that service-oriented, it's a great solution that not only our teams are launching but also customers, they really want. So I will say, yes, it's good. Good momentum that we're seeing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : Your margin performance continues to be extraordinary. And I'm a little bit curious just about how much opportunity lies ahead, maybe we do ITS versus behind if you still see as much potential there if you're shifting your workflows to be more growth-oriented than margin oriented. Just maybe comment that because obviously, you've done amazing things over the last couple of years. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Rob, I'd say internally, I'll start with the last question. Internally, we'd like to say is the power of the end is about growth and margin. So we always look at the quality of earnings. And we look at making sure that, yes, we're growing, but that we're growing profitably. So I'll say that we go for both. Yes, I mean year-to-date, we've seen exceptional incrementals, and that speaks to -- as Vik said, the gross margin activities that we have done despite the market volatility we continue to make a lot of investments, investments not only around recurring revenue streams and things like that, also new product technology. Part of my trip here in Asia spent a full day with the team in China, specifically on innovation. And I think the innovative solutions that the team has developed are very unique and very exciting to see and things that we're leveraging now also from a global basis. So the example that we put out here in terms of the [indiscernible] that will definitely drive some incremental revenue as well. That's also part of our investment. So I'll say we continue to be positive about where we have margin expansion here in ITS. Vik Kini : And Rob, maybe I'll just add maybe to your question about thinking about the 2 segments to percentage point, I think we've been incredibly pleased with the momentum we've seen in '24. We're poised for another triple-digit margin expansion year and as you can -- the guidance implies and as you've seen, largely right on the ITS side, I think as we flash forward, it's kind of back to kind of how we laid things out. We expect that there still is opportunity in ITS. Are you going to see the pace probably as much in ITS as you've seen historically, maybe not as much. I think there's still opportunity there. But I do think there's probably a little bit more outsized opportunity in PST and that very much fits with our stated Investor Day targets of how to get back to closer to a mid-30s EBITDA margin. So still really pleased. And I think that we see a lot of great opportunity as we now think about the PST business and particularly also with the ILC Dover business now being fully integrated. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Vicente, can you talk about -- or give us a 1 color about the acquisition landscape as you start to think about '25. You obviously have been very active, as you said, for '24. Your LOIs, I think, went up a little bit sequentially. So do you see '25 as potentially as robust a year for incremental M&A activities 24? And I know you said the other is more bolt-on in nature. Is that generally the type of activity that you would expect in '25? Vicente Reynal : The answer -- the simple answer to that is yes. I mean we definitely see we're seeing a lot of good activity. Clearly, you heard on the opening remarks to as well with ILC Dover acquisition that gave us a $10 billion expansion into an addressable market and that comes in with looking in terms of bolt-on acquisitions, and we already have a few of those in our funnel. So yes, I mean, 2025, I'll say, it looks to be still also very encouraging as we see the momentum that we have today. Yes. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay. Helpful, Vicente. And then you mentioned in PST book and ship, it's still up high single-digits year-over-year. You mentioned sequential orders up 13%. I know organic revenue growth has been stubbornly negative for a while now in that segment. So does the better order environment suggests that you do you have relatively good visibility to improve growth in '25? Maybe just on ILC Dover, in particular, a lot of positive commentary on it, but just an update there. Vik Kini : Andy, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start, and I'll let Vicente add in. I think with regards to just kind of the base PST business, and we'll kind of comment on ILC Dover separately, we've been very encouraged by the positive order momentum that you've seen now for a few quarters. We are starting to see that translate a bit better. We do expect that, for example, in Q4, to be part of that growth algorithm, specifically as part of our Q4 guidance as you kind of get to the full year guide. We'll pause on necessarily 2025 commentary. But I think the good news here is a combination of both the base business as well as a lot of the acquisitions, which have now really been fully integrated, I think, positions us well as we move into 2025, and we're encouraged by kind of what I'll say, the base PST business. And Vicente, I'll let you comment -- Vicente Reynal : And then on the LLC, I'll say that the integration continues to go very well. You saw some of the numbers in terms of biopharma and the medical device component business are doing really well. And I think the most important piece is that we continue to make investments for growth in the ILC Dover already as we see opportunities to accelerate growth in both at the biopharma and the Medical Device business and investments are not only just on demand generation, target commercial and innovation of product investment but also investments in talent. We have multiple new general managers. We -- I think we said before, we structured the business now into 3 distinct P&Ls with new general managers in the P&L and we're reinforcing the functional support area. So we're making a lot of the good prerequisite investments to scale that up and scale that business as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Just wondering if we could maybe just hone in on the PST sort of outlook for 4Q. It looks like we're sort of pointing towards a return to growth in the fourth quarter, obviously conflict and easier. I just wanted to make sure that's the case. And then I just wanted to just try and nail this M&A contribution. You definitely had a bit more revenue from, I guess, ILC Dover in third quarter. And just want to know what your kind of penciling in the fourth quarter from ILC Dover. And just maybe just if you just within that address the book-to-bill 0.97x for reported 0.99x for core. Does that suggest there's a bit of book-to-bill below 0.9x for acquisitions? Just maybe just unpack that for us. Vik Kini : Yes. Nigel, I'll try to answer all of those. So specifically, in terms of PST on the growth algorithm into Q4, return to a positive organic yes, that is the expectation, just to kind of state that 1 simply. In the context of the M&A contribution, specifically in Q4. I think you'll see it comparable, maybe a touch lower than what you saw in Q3. But again, I wouldn't take that as anything in the context of any market trend like that. Specifically with an ILC Dover, as Vicente said, I think the biopharma and the medical device business is very stable, continuing to see what you would expect to see the normal growth and the sequential momentum you expect a lot of what you're seeing and quite frankly, even now to your book-to-bill question, it really comes much more from the space side of the equation, where typically, you see orders, they can be lumpy at times because they, quite frankly, are tied to larger what I'll call, platform level kind of -- contracts. And then they tend to ship over a multi-quarter, multiyear time frame, that's exactly what you saw in Q3. So you did see a book-to-bill that was below fleet average. That was literally driven by the space business. And the reality is in subsequent and future quarters, you'll see the exact inverse once you book some of those normal course contracts, nothing that we would speak to that's outside the norm and actually very consistent with how the business operates. So again, we actually look -- I would say it's very consistent. We're very pleased with the performance there. A little bit of noise, but I think the way you have characterized it and the numbers you're calling are fairly accurate. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just to be clear, are we still on track for 215, 220 guide for ILC? Vik Kini : Nigel, can you repeat the question? Nigel Coe : Yes. Are we still on track for full year contribution from ILC at I think the 215, 220 is the range. Vik Kini : Yes. I think that's in the right ballpark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Vicente, could you just elaborate on what the site readiness actually means? I know you referenced the Middle East. I'm assuming this is brownfield project and very separate than the like EPC discussion that we had earlier. And then also -- and I know people are asking all these questions around orders and book-to-bill I guess that there's a concern that the book-to-bill will kind of nose dive in the fourth quarter. And so just any kind of comments around what the expectation is for the book-to-bill, fully recognizing that typically in the second half of your year, it is typically below one. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Joe, in terms of the site readiness, I mean a pretty wide range in terms of -- as to the reason why in some cases, what I mean it could be permits you be permitting in terms of greenfields or even [ brand ] about project expansion capacities is basically permitting, it is the labor to be able to get some of the things on. In some cases, we're a piece of the entire process. So in many cases, the other pieces are not ready, and we have to come in a certain time. So it has to do with just the logistics I'm just getting a lot of these activities kind of put in place. In terms of the book-to-bill, I mean, I think keep in mind that we said that we don't guide on that on orders, but we said that for the full year, we expect book-to-bill to be approximately 1%. And what you can see, kind of, basically, we are in that range. So we expect that book-to-bill to be and we said the first half of the year is going to be usually above 1. The second half of the year is usually less than 1. And as we kind of came here in the third quarter, that kind of exactly -- that's exactly what happened. And as we will see in the fourth quarter, that will be the same case. So we'll continue to expect that for the full year, we expect that book-to-bill to be squiggly approximately 1, and that means basically organic orders should bode well in the fourth quarter. Joe Ritchie : Great. That's super helpful. And then I guess just -- maybe just elaborate a little bit more on biopharma, really nice to see out 20%. Typically, we thought of that as being very margin accretive to the business. And then we're hearing from others that there's places like radiopharma or theranostics that could see really good growth in the coming years. So just maybe elaborate on that piece of your business and specifically where you're seeing good momentum. Vicente Reynal : Yes. I think the exciting piece is that, as we said before, is that the biopharma is very well focused -- laser-focused on approach in terms of high potency APIs all of these high potency APIs, that is for the next-generation of gene therapies and whether you think about presentation of cancer treatment research or even as simply stated as these GLP-1s and drug weight reduction medicines. And there's now even new developments. I mean, I think, so far, a lot of these drugs have been kind of on the monoclonal antibodies and now they're going into by model activity. But I think there's just a lot of good development. And for a lot of that development, you need these high potency compounds. And in order to generate these high potency compounds, you need to move the powder, and that's basically where we come in. We come in with a great customization of powder handling and powder containment processes that are single use in nature. And so I think our team intends to be very focused on accelerating growth, very focused on the early development on drug. So I'll say you said it very well. I mean, I think there's just a lot of good growth momentum on that biopharma business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder from Morgan Stanley. Chris Snyder : I want to follow-up on the commentary around site readiness. Much of it appears tied to labor capacity and constraints there. So when you speak with customers, is there an expectation that, that gets any better? Because I know that employment, at least here in the U.S. continues to go higher, and it seems like demand for these projects and the activity is pushing higher. So seems like that could remain a constraint. Vicente Reynal : Yes. No, Chris, I mean, I think it varies country-by-country, for sure. But yes, I mean, I think that's exactly why we are smart about thinking about how we think about this gradual recovery and the momentum because that's -- you said it very well. I mean labor will continue to be a constraint is a constraint here in the U.S. and continue to be constrained in many other countries across the world. And main cases is that skilled labor is very needed for this very highly complicated protect. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then maybe on China specifically. I know you said you're not really seeing any impact in the operating environment or from the stimulus of the early part of Q4. But I guess, do you think that the stimulus will have an impact on the economy there into 2025? Any way to think about the timing between when that could filter through. And just for all of us in the U.S. When you look at the policy measures, I guess, is there anything that stands out as potentially being impactful to Ingersoll. Vicente Reynal : Yes, great question, Chris. I think the most impactful one is that these latest stimulus is really around upgrading all the equipment and you get a higher priority in many cases -- and again, this is at the total national level and then you got to go region by region. So -- but the high priority goes to those projects and those conversions are going to deliver energy efficiency. And clearly, this is exactly the story that we have been saying all along in terms of what we are capable of doing on energy efficiency improvement. So I think that is where we see that the stimulus could be impactful for Ingersoll Rand. In terms of timing, it takes time. I mean, central government announces the stimulus, and then it has to trickle down to the provinces and to the regions, and that takes time. Now when I was in China just a week ago, did we hear more often and the teams were talking a lot about? Yes. Have we seen it yet come to fruition? Not yet. But again, that's why we say it could bode well for 2025, and we'll see how kind of the fourth quarter on that perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: Vicente, could you talk about Ingersoll's kind of engagement in the time line of a large project when we think about a growing pipeline of what can be multiyear projects how to think about your involvement relative to when shovels go in the ground when you're engaged with the customer when you get an order, when you ship it relative to, say, shovels in the ground in a multiyear time frame? Vicente Reynal : Yes, sure. Also, Joe, from the early beginnings, we get involved. I mean, a lot of these large projects they have at the EP side, they have what they call SME, subject matter experts. They're subject matter experts on a typical specifically processing technology like rotating components. And so we have really great relationship and contact with those educating what our products can do. When the project gets decision, the typical lead time is call it 12 to 18 months between the order to the time of a shipment. And that could be maybe 12 months later after the shuttle goes into the ground. So call it, it could be up to 2 years by the time that when the initial kind of gets removed to the time the project gets to completion. But it varies. I mean it clearly varies on the size of the project and the scope of the project. But our lead time is -- could be anywhere between 12 to 18 months based on when the customer puts the order and when the customer is ready for the site. Joe O'Dea: Got it. That's helpful. And then just wanted to come back to PST and some of the trends. I mean when we look at the organic growth, the stacks, whether it's 2 years, 3 year actually softened sequentially from Q2 to Q3. The guide suggests that those would improve sequentially from Q3 to Q4. It seems like within sort of the order framework as well and book-to-bill outlook that PST orders would sort of lead the growth in the fourth quarter. And so just looking for any color on lumpiness within the third quarter and how that's improving in the fourth quarter. Not sure if weather events were a factor, but any details there would be helpful. Vik Kini : Yes, Joe, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start, and I'll let Vicente add in as well. Would I point one, I'll start with the latter part. Any major weather-related things or any of that nature? No, nothing of that note that I'd point to. I think the piece that we are -- continue to be encouraged about in terms of PST is that we've now had 2 sequential quarters of positive year-over-year organic growth. And obviously, I think we've kind of now fully consumed or comped a lot of those, what I'll call the legacy of Ingersoll Rand Medical or life sciences headwinds that we've been talking about for a while. Have we seen necessarily any meaningful recovery or anything there? No, not necessarily at this point in time. But I do think that, that was what was clouding and I would say a lot of the historical comps I think the good news, as we said in the prepared comments was, one, I think the kind of more what I'll call industrial or book and ship continues to do nicely. It's been multiple quarters of that. I'd say, showing good trends. And then remember, the PST business, it does also have some of the longer cycle type projects that can create some of the noise that Vicente are speaking about. I think we talked about it much more prevalently in the ITS space, but there is some of that in PST. So I think the good news here is when you put that all together, and particularly a couple of sequential quarters now of positive organic orders growth. Now we expect to see that to start translating a little bit, and we do expect to see positive organic revenue growth, specifically in Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. David Raso : Just a quick question. The organic orders within ITS. I know Page 18 provides sort of the all-in ex currency. But just given the acquisitions, can you help us between compressors, vacuum, power tools and other the 0.4 million. I'm just trying to figure out how much -- what a bottoming China be as a boost to the organic is? It's not that easy on Page 18, just given those are all in ex currency. Can you give those same splits organically to get to the organic order of 0.4 for the quarter? Vik Kini : Yes, David, I'll give you -- I think, probably the way to think about this, at least at a high level, a couple of components. Probably the 2, I'd say, detractors for lack of a better way to say that when you think about the stack and I'll do it by region was clearly Asia specific. And clearly, that's more of a China comment, and we called that out in the and there hasn't been, I would say, special China the commentary, that's essentially all organic, right? There isn't a lot of M&A impacting that on the China side has obviously been the big negative comp, negative organic meaningfully or negative. That's what's driving that number closer to flattish. The power tools business, again, a smaller piece of it. It was also, I'd say, below kind of the overall fleet average, that's slightly bringing the numbers down. The more positive trends you're seeing are definitely in the, I'd say, Americas is definitely kind of the leader of the pack comparatively. We also thought about that probably having 1 of the easier comps comparatively speaking, on Q3, just given some of the timing of projects in terms of last year. And the middle Europe, Middle East, India, Africa is kind of been in the middle. I'd say India and the Middle East, frankly, places that Vicente and myself were in [indiscernible] have been solid organic growth drivers. Western Europe has been a little bit of, I'd say, mixed in terms of some of the different regions. So to give you the spectrum there, I would say the 2 biggest attractors definitely have been China and to a lesser or power tools, Americas comparatively stronger and Europe is kind of in the middle is probably the best way to think about it. And I wouldn't delineate dramatically between the product technologies tend to follow those regional trends fairly well. David Raso : I guess asked directly, if China is say, at this point, down about 15% of ITS, maybe even slightly smaller. What were the organic orders ex-China year-over-year in ITS ex-China con? Vik Kini : Yes. David, we haven't given that, but what I will say here is, would it -- would you be much more positive in that low single-digit realm, that's probably a fair statement. David Raso : Okay. So something like up 3% and China down 15%. So something like that is sort of the math. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia from BNP Paribas. Andrew Buscaglia : Something that caught my eye was kind of interesting is your comment on some incremental activity in water treatment. Can you comment more on that, is there more behind that? And I guess what are you seeing in that market? Because it really seemed to accelerate quite a bit. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Andrew, so yes, we do play very well in the water treatment. I mean you saw the example Dosatron example that we give here. But even within the -- we have good technologies with [indiscernible], which is basically 1 of the market leaders for progressive cavity pumps in waste treatment facilities as you have Milton Roy, which is basically doing a lot of [indiscernible] as well for wastewater facilities. And even when you go into the ITS segment, we have technologies like lower technology that we're one of the market leaders for creating the aeration in the wastewater facility. So yes, the wastewater facilities and wastewater treatment processing has been an end market that we have put a lot of attention, even including acquisitions, about a couple of years ago, we acquired a company called Everest in India that is a market leader for wastewater lower aeration if you think about India, only 30% of the water is treated. So great growth in that market. So yes, water and wastewater and water treatment are areas of opportunity for us to grow. Andrew Buscaglia : Interesting. Another comment I was hoping to get some color on -- I was obviously trying to gauge your 2025. But what -- your free cash flow is a good story for a long time. Do you see incremental tailwinds as some of these projects, especially some that are kind of delayed here, really move forward? And maybe any other comment other than fundamental sort of EBITDA margin expansion. Any other puts and takes you keep in mind as we try to model out next year. Vik Kini : Andrew, just to be clear, was that on the cash flow side of the equation? Was that the nature of the question or? Andrew Buscaglia : Yes, cash flow. Yes. It seems like you have incremental certain tailwinds, especially with some of the pent-up projects. Vik Kini : Yes. I think maybe a couple of things in not necessarily particular order. Sure. I think just frankly, the business growth whether it be the projects or just the base business, absolutely. I think working capital continues to be a huge focal point. I think we continue to make great strides in some of the more transactional pieces, accounts payable country. I think inventory continues to be an opportunity to unlock that especially given the model that we have. I think a big piece that's probably -- we don't probably talk about it as much, but maybe a touch underappreciated is also the M&A side. Generally speaking, the vast majority of M&A that we bring in, it frankly has a much higher working capital profile just because, quite frankly, a lot of them are smaller privately held companies by less focus on working capital comparatively speaking to kind of where we are. And so as we bring them and integrate in across the full spectrum of working capital, that's generally an opportunity. And then listen, we'll continue to optimize, I'd say, what I'll call more of the blocking and tackling, cash interest opportunity as we look forward, cash taxes things of that nature. So I think there continue to be a lot of levers. And that being said, I continue to be really pleased with where the teams have operated. We've been in that 100% free cash flow conversion realm, and we will continue to target those levels with some of the opportunities that I mentioned. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Nathan Jones : Just a couple of questions back on the velocity of the MQLs through the funnel. Vicente, you said historically 6 to 8 weeks and that is materially longer now. Is it still getting longer? Or has it stabilized? Are things getting shorter? And if the major reasons are customer site readiness and insufficient EPC engineering capacity, these things will naturally move through that process over time. Is it really just time that we have to wait for these -- the decision-making to accelerate again? Or are there other conditions that need to exist. Vicente Reynal : Yes, Nathan, sure Yes. I would say that the elongation -- no material change in getting much longer, to be honest, but definitely, clearly, it's simply much more above that 6 to 8-week conversion rates. In terms of the additional question, it is just time. I don't think we don't see interest rates to be -- clearly, we never saw as that being the impact for any of this to be kind of the driver. We made a commentary about here how elections really not the dramatic change. Could that maybe accelerate as we kind of finalize and get this order with next week potentially, but not something that we're counting on. But yes, it's just mainly time here in this case. Nathan Jones : You guys have a little bit more visibility than we're going to have from the outside into those kinds of things. Is there an expectation? Or do you have intelligence into the markets that would suggest kind of when that MQL lead time might start to shrink and these things might start to move forward? Vicente Reynal : I mean I would tell you, Nathan, it varies dramatically country by country depending on situations and depending on customer projects. So I would say -- do we have intelligence on a lot of the projects and a lot of data Yes. Are we going to verbalize that externally? Likely not. But yes, we do know very well. Nathan Jones : Fair enough. And you made a comment that things are boding well for organic orders. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit? Vik Kini : Yes. Nathan, I think the comment was, I think it was positioned in the kind of the math around the book-to-bill. And if you kind of run the math out now with 3 quarters behind us and you kind of know all the variables, would it imply kind of something in the maybe low single-digit organic growth realm for orders. That's kind of what the math would imply. And you'll still kind of be around that onetime book-to-bill. I think to Vicente's point and kind of what you're seeing, like I said, you've seen 2 quarters of good sequential -- good year-over-year orders, organic orders growth in PST. You did see ITS return back to positive organic realm in Q3. So again, what we'll say is the leading indicator, the general market continues to remain relatively stable and relatively healthy. So we're encouraged kind of as we kind of move here into the fourth quarter. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back to Vicente Reynal for closing remarks. Vicente Reynal : Yes. Thank you. I'll say my last remark will be, again, a big thank you to our teams for another great quarter and the fact that our economic engine is working very well to deliver very good results even despite macroeconomic environment, it's very exciting to see. So again, thanks, everyone, for the interest and look forward to speaking with you any time soon. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.",
