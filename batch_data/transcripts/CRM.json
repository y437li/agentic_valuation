Marc Benioff : Thanks, John. And I\u2019m thrilled to kick-off our fiscal 2014 to be another great quarter at Salesforce.com. Revenue for the first quarter rose 28% from year ago to more than $890 million. At constant currency, revenue grew faster at 30%. Operating cash flow exceeded $280 million for the quarter also an increase of more than 30% year-over-year and deferred revenue grew to more than $1.7 billion also up 30%. Based on these great results, we\u2019re raising our full fiscal 2014 revenue guidance which we project at $3.835 billion to $3.875 billion and will roll on our way to first $1 billion quarter. In addition, I\u2019m thrilled that after a decade of growth and market share gains, Gartner announced this quarter that Salesforce is now the largest CRM platform in the world. We\u2019ve displaced SAP to become the number one CRM market share leader regardless of On Premise or Cloud, Salesforce is number one. I\u2019d like to congratulate all of our employees, our customers; our shareholders on this important achievement of become the number one CRM company. Salesforce has always been a catalyst and evangelist for innovation and enterprise software. We pioneered the shift to cloud, to social, to mobile and today with this next generation of technology, our customers are connecting with their customers in entirely new ways. They are becoming customer companies and they\u2019re transforming for managing systems record to systems of engagement and we\u2019re leading the way. With our full product lines, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce Platform, customers have the tools to become customer companies and unlock greater levels of growth, innovation and success. That\u2019s why our customers have made us the clear leader in each of our four core markets. First, our flagship Sales Cloud is the number one app for sales teams helping customers to drive phenomenal sales productivity and top line growth. It\u2019s the only sales platform with built-in tools motivating line teams through Work.com and continuously refresh company and contact information through Data.com and with the latest release of Salesforce Chatter customers can access sales clouds records and files right from their mobile devices. The new Chatter mobile app is available now from the Apple app store and from Google Play and I recommend that you download and see this incredible new vision of how CRM works in the mobile environment. The Service Cloud is the world\u2019s number one app for customer service and support and it\u2019s the only service platform that ties customer service with sales and social. In the quarter, we announced our latest Service Cloud mobile innovations including mobile co-browsing, mobile communities, mobile chat and a touch based agent interface and are divided down to just last week. Gartner named Salesforce the clear leader in both vision and execution in the most recent Magic Quadrant for Customer Service. And if you didn\u2019t already know SAP continue to fall behind in the challenge of Quadrant which is why more SAP customers move to Salesforce in the quarter than ever before. The Marketing Cloud is the world\u2019s number one app for sales, social marketing and the only marketing platform that seamlessly connects with sales and service. Marketers want a unified platform to listen, to publish, to engage, to advertise and giving them the power to target individuals of scale, that\u2019s why we want social.com the quarter, the filtered only advertising app that ties ad campaigns on Facebook and Twitter with real time customer and social listening data. Social.com is already managing 500,000 social ad campaigns for customers and is Facebook\u2019s largest advertising partner today. The Salesforce Platform is the world\u2019s number one enterprise cloud platform and it\u2019s the only platform with social and mobile built right into the core. Customers while having a fast and easy development platform to go next generation apps that instantly work on any mobile device and with the launch of new mobile services in the quarter including developer mobile packs and Salesforce Mobile SDK, Salesforce then accelerate mobile app for all of our customers. In addition, we\u2019re filled with attraction of our ISI ecosystem and we\u2019ve doubled the number of ISVs in the app exchange since the first quarter of last year. The combination of our customer company vision and our clear leadership within each of these core markets is what\u2019s driving our success with customers today. That\u2019s why we continue to close some of the most exciting and strategic transactions in the industry. I am thrilled to announce that we closed on our key transactions a quarter, which have been small and medium enterprise agency, a government agency that serves more than 3 million companies nationwide. We have new partnership with Japan\u2019s government, Salesforce platform and Chatter will touch nearly aspect of the agencies engagement with millions of SMEs. Companies are going to tap in the online marketplaces with service professionals, like attorneys and tax advisors and by connecting Japan to SMEs to each other and information real-time, Salesforce is helping us critical Japanese agency, bolster competition, innovation, and growth in this phenomenal time into the Japanese economy. This continues our commitment to partner with the Japanese government as our most important and largest customer. And on May 28 at our customer company tour in Tokyo next week, you\u2019ll be hearing more from me about how this agency plans to create millions of SMEs together so onto the Japanese governments first, social business collaboration network. We are thrilled to have you join me in Tokyo. Also on May 28, I\u2019ve been selected to deliver a key note to government leaders at the U.S., Japan, counsel symposium along with U.S. ambassador, John Roos and I hope I look forward to see you there. We continue to deliver tremendous success with companies like General Electric where we had great momentum with major divisions including GE Capital, GE Oil & Gas, GE Energy, GE Power and Water, GE Transportation, GE Aviation and now GE Healthcare joining the Salesforce family. GE Healthcare is the world\u2019s biggest maker of medical imaging equipment. They are standardizing on Salesforce as their global CRM platform and by connecting their entire front office team directly to the millions of physicians and hospitals they serve. GE will be fueling an order level of customer intimacy. Another great win in the quarter is Toms Shoes. In the quarter Tom selected Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Chatter to build the central hub for his entire team of service agents and listen, engage and service customers wherever they are. While they are great for large companies, we are great for small and medium companies too. And by linking of SAP and Oracle back office systems with Salesforce, Toms would be able to arm agents with a full view of the world that is around each and every customer. In everyone of these examples, companies are transforming their business of Salesforce\u2019s next generation technologies. Our ability to deeply integrate our cellphone and mobile front office solutions with legacy back office systems like Microsoft, SAP and Oracle is helping many of our customers transform into customer companies. Our other new or add-on transactions in the first quarter included Belkin and Bristol-Myers, Cree, Metso, New York Life, Novartis, Panasonic, and (inaudible) and we continue to crush the competition in the quarter against Microsoft and own significant new or add-on business in companies like Jonathan Press, KDDI, LodgeNet, McGraw, Old Mutual, Regence, and TalkTalk. Against Oracle we won at Baxter, VP, DirectTV at ING at National Australia Bank at NTT, at Virgin and against SAP at Deloitte, Fujitsu, at Juniper, and Lenovo and Millipore, Nokia, Sony, Toms Shoes, (inaudible) HANA, Home Depot and the list goes on. The pace at which these are companies are embracing our social and mobile cloud technologies is phenomenon. During this last quarter, we passed our first 1 billion transactions day, and already in this quarter we\u2019ve delivered an average of 1.2 billion customer transaction each and every business day, that speaks more to the value of Salesforce. Then the actual usage of our products with the speed, reliability interest that we\u2019ve become known for. In closing I\u2019d like to invite all of you to join me at one of our customer company tour events to see our new products, to hear our new message, to visit with the customers and prospects we\u2019re making these decisions, I\u2019m transforming our industry into the cloud and seeing why Salesforce has become the number one CRM provider in the world. You could join me in Tokyo or Sydney, Australia on May 28 and S\u00e3o Paulo Brazil on June 11, and New York City on June 14 and Rotterdam on June 18, and Toronto on June 19 and at Munich, Germany on July 2. More than 15,000 customers across 11 cities have already tendered or sold out customer company tour events. And we hope to see you at one of them soon, so you can feel the energy, the excitement, the momentum and the growth and what\u2019s driving Salesforce into this incredible new position as the world\u2019s largest customer company. I\u2019m also thrilled to announce that registration for Dreamforce 2013, the world\u2019s largest technology vendor conference has opened today. We expect more than 120,000 registered attendees to join us in San Francisco from November 18 till 21 and I look forward to seeing you there. With that, let me hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Graham Smith. Graham Smith : Thank you, Marc. We delivered another solid quarter in Q1 with strong year-over-year revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow growth. Our success during the quarter was driven by continued demand across all of our cloud solutions supported by further declines in attrition. Let me take you through these another highlights from our first quarter results, starting with the income statement. Q1 revenue was $893 million, that\u2019s up 28% over last year, excluding an approximately $10 million FX headwind, first quarter revenue was up 30% year-over-year. Looking at year-over-year growth on a regional basis, revenue in the Americas grew 30% to $631 million. revenue in Europe grew 38% in dollars, and in constant currency to $163 million and revenue in Asia increased 7% in dollars and 17% in constant currency to $99 million. As I mentioned previously, our dollar attrition continued its steady decline in the first quarter and is now in the low double-digit percentage range. Our first quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 80.2%, that\u2019s about a 160 basis points lower than Q1 last year. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 10.5% or about 100 basis points lower than last year, leading to the first quarter non-GAAP operating income of $94 million, that\u2019s up 18% over the last year. Our results in Q1 included an approximately $8 million charge for an IP licensing agreement, which was recorded in costs per revenue. This represented about 90 basis points of margin dilution in the quarter. We added more than 480 new employees in Q1, bringing our total head count to 10,300, that\u2019s up 23% over Q1 last year. Turning to EPS, non-GAAP EPS was $0.10 for the first quarter. the licensing agreement charge that I just mentioned represented approximately $0.01 of GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. Turning to cash flow, first quarter operating cash flow was a record $283 million, up 33% over the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect full-year growth in the low 20ish percent range. CapEx in the first quarter was $54 million, up 20% over Q1 last year. CapEx continues to be primarily driven by new office buildouts related to our growing employee base and remain flat year-over-year to approximately 6% of revenue. Free cash flow which we defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $229 million in the first quarter, that\u2019s up 36% over Q1 last year. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from approximately $1.7 billion last year. As you\u2019ll recall in the first quarter, we successfully closed a $1.15 billion convertible senior note. Accounts receivable was up 35% over the last year to $503 million. Deferred revenue ended the first quarter approximately $1.7 billion, that\u2019s up 30% over Q1 last year. Excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately $18 million, deferred revenue increased 31%. On a sequential quarter basis, deferred revenue was reduced by an FX headwind of approximately $16 million. In addition, please recall that in our most recent fourth quarter we build and collected an approximately $30 million invoice, that was initially build as new business early in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. This also created a sequential headwind to deferred revenue in the first quarter. Deferred revenue continue to benefit from the shift toward annual billing were just under 70% of all invoices in Q1 issued with annual terms, this was about five percentage points higher than Q1 last year. The dollar benefit to deferred revenue from the shift to annual invoicing together with multiyear invoicing was approximately $100 million, that\u2019s down from $145 million at the end of Q1 last year. Unbilled deferred revenue or revenue that is contracted, but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet was approximately $3.6 billion in Q1. That\u2019s an increase of 33% over Q1 last year. Before I turn to our guidance for the second quarter and full-year, I want to highlight the impact of foreign exchange particularly the Yen is having on our financial results. We\u2019ve had great success in Japan and today our Japan subsidiary represents approximately 6% of total corporate revenue. When we updated our fiscal 2014 guidance in February, the Yen was around 92 to a U.S. dollar. This week, the Yen dollar rate has been in the 101 to 103 range, devaluation of about 10%. In fact, the Yen has been the fastest [growing] major currency in the world this year. This and other currency fluctuations have reduced our full-year revenue outlook by approximately $35 million, including the $10 million in Q1 that I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, FX rates impact not just revenue, but also operating margins, deferred revenue, and cash flow. So with that context, we are pleased to be raising our full-year revenue outlook to $3.835 billion to $3.875 billion for growth of 26% and 27%. Taking into account a difficult FX environment and the IP licensing agreement charge, we are also pleased to maintain our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $0.47 to $0.49. This range assumes a full-year effective non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 35% and no mean for contribution from below the line interest or other income and expense. For Q2, we anticipate revenue in the range of $931 million to $936 million for growth of 27% to 28%, and we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.11 to $0.12. We expect second quarter year-over-year operating cash flow in the mid to high teens percentage range, and then in addition we expect Q2 CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 11%, that\u2019s a little high than normal, it\u2019s due to the phasing of new office build outs, increased data center investments, and the capitalized portion of the previously mentioned IP licensing agreement. For the full year, we expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be about 7%, which is in line with previous year. We anticipate reported year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the mid to high 20% range. As Marc mentioned earlier, Three Force is being held in the fiscal fourth quarter. For modeling purposes, this will affect EPS, linearity for the year as we expect Three Force to reduce non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, Three Force was in our fiscal third quarter last year. All of the underlying assumptions through our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance, a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation to be found in our earnings press release issued today. So to conclude we kicks off fiscal 2014 with a solid first quarter delivering strong revenue, deferred revenue, and operating cash flow growth, our dollar attrition continues to decline is now the lowest level since we began measuring it more than three years ago. We continue to see strong demand across all of our cloud solutions and are well positioned to deliver another great year of growth. So with that, we\u2019ll open the call out for questions. Operator? Operator : : Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Hi, great. Marc I was curious if you could just give us your view on the next steps for the Marketing Cloud and if you could also address with Social.com as you mentioned, your pricing is now based on the percent of the ad spend a little different than your past pricing model. Can you talk about \u2013 should we expect more changes going forward in some of the pricing methodologies that you\u2019re unveiling some of the new products going forward? Thank you. Marc Benioff :  Well, thanks very much for that question. An area where I spent a lot of my time, initially say how I look at this, strategically. number one, Salesforce is now the number one CRM Company in the world. I mentioned that in the script, and that\u2019s an incredible accomplishment for the company. And for us to continue to be number one in CRM world, it means that we have to be number one in three main areas. One, we have to be number one in sales, which we are, and if you can see the new Gartner Magic Quadrant in sales it\u2019s clear as they were number one. And it\u2019s not any clear, and then if you get the new Magic Quadrant for our customer service and then support and customer engagement that just came out about a week or two ago now. It\u2019s credible market in customer support. we\u2019re number one in service. And that has been an incredible journey, it\u2019s been a fight, it\u2019s been tremendous accomplishment, and especially gratifying when we saw SAP got pushed into the challenge of Quadrant, as we assume this strong position in the Leader Quadrant. And that\u2019s very important to us. so, number one in sales, number one in service. And that\u2019s true in revenue, that\u2019s true in market share, and that\u2019s true in feature functionality. Now, marketing is an area that we\u2019ve recently entered into, as you know. and it\u2019s not really an area that we\u2019ve gone through into organically or grow our own development, but we\u2019ve acquired our way into marketing, first by purchasing Radian6 and then by buying Buddy Media. Buddy Media had purchased just before, we bought them Brighter Option, which we then have rebuilt and now relaunched as Social.com. And by no means, are we number one in revenue, in marketing. This is the year-over-year marketing revenue well enter its nine digits for the first time and but it\u2019s not a $1 billion cloud yet. It\u2019s a $100 million plus cloud and our goal is to be number one in marketing, but we realize that to be number one in marketing, we\u2019re going to have to achieve more than $1 billion in revenue in that cloud and these not just number one in listening, not just number one in publishing, not just number one in social advertising but in a number of other key areas as well, I\u2019m strategically, I believe that this is very important to the company and so, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of my time, looking at this and we, you\u2019re going to see us experiment and try things and innovate in as you saw in acquisition which you\u2019ve seen us doing last two years, in pricing like you\u2019re seeing with Social.com, in features and functionality, in position and messaging like we\u2019ve seen us evolved into the customer company messaging. And what that has meant to our customers is they\u2019re looking to us more and more and I advised you to the customer company tour, presentations, you can meet these customers and validate this but they look to us to help them understand how to connect with their customers in this kind of incredible new way. And our goal is to be the trusted advisor and to do that, it means that we\u2019re going to have to deliver world-class market functionality, we\u2019re focused on that, we\u2019re excited about that, not just in B2B, but in B2C as well and what you\u2019re seeing in those changes or in those pricing that you\u2019re asking about Brent is our innovative and ideas and experiments as we move from $100 million business in marketing, $1 billion plus business. Operator : Your next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, great. Good afternoon gentlemen. I was just wondering Marc, we have a good number of private companies telling us they\u2019re starting to write ease some very big checks for Force.com. I was wondering if you could talk about, what we should be expecting in that business, what type of milestone should be we looking for, I know you mentioned what you did in Japan this past quarter, but is there anything else you could share with us on kind of things we should use to benchmark the business? Marc Benioff : Yes. There are \u2013 the way to look at this business, which we call the Salesforce platform, is the following way. First of all, where our customers were buying our sales or service or marketing products they\u2019re extending those products with applications that are customer centric and they are customizing, they are enhancing, they\u2019re configuring using the Salesforce platform, which includes Force.com, which includes our APIs, which includes Heroku, which includes Site.com, our website capability, which includes our app exchange where we have approximately 2,000 applications in there. And that stuff, they are extending and complementing the work they have done with sales, service and marketing. Step two is, a lot of those companies are building their unique custom applications. And those applications are the applications that they need, the apps that they need to run their business. Used to be back in the day, the big companies by Sequel Server, Visual Basic Powerbuilder, sequel forms whatever it was to basically do structured and unstructured data management, and have rapid application development capability. We see those customers turning to our platform to get that same kind of capability rapidly. And we\u2019re very excited about the growth of that brings us, the stickiness that brings us with the customer by starting to manage their metadata, not just the data and delivering those next-generation apps. And three, the AppExchange, you\u2019ve seen a number of really great ISV\u2019s converge on our AppExchange, many of them who are building natively on our platform. And these app, application companies, I mean just great, great, great companies some that are even going public now, I\u2019m sure you know, with native apps. And we could be more excited for them. And we\u2019re continuing to grow and also partner from a revenue and go-to-market perspective with a lot of those companies. And we have a whole Salesforce dedicated to selling to ISV\u2019s, to help them unify with our platform and to go-to-market to our customers. And as these three things together that are working really well with the platform. The extending and complementing the CRM capabilities, building entirely new apps and a traditional app dev space, route space. And three, a platform for independent software to the vendors to build their own applications to target our customers or their own customers or to the big industries. And if these three things have their together then you hear, for some of these what might look like very small companies riding us extraordinary checks as you said, but it\u2019s really because we become partners with them, much in a way that we are partners by the way was our key software vendors. Of course, companies provide us core technology that we write very large text to like Dell, or like Cisco, or like EMC, or especially Oracle, where it\u2019s very important for us to have a strategic relationship with them. They were writing significant checks to them for their licensing, and then it\u2019s a very important part of our business. You\u2019ve seen that now 14 years of business we wouldn\u2019t be in business without those relationships with those vendors providing us our technology and in the same way that they fuel us and we write them the checks. Those ISVs then write big checks back to us. So, it\u2019s very much a symbiotic relationship between us and those customers or between us and our core vendors. And our job is that rising feel will raise all boats and that\u2019s the economy that you\u2019re getting feedback on today. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Yes, thank you very much. Marc, how do you think about the scale of the opportunity in the long-term for becoming the customer company and offering the Force.com platform? And specifically, if you compare the size of that opportunity or that market to other markets such as human resources or financials, what do you think has a more profound impact on an organization between modernizing the front office or automating the back office and therefore what do you think is a bigger opportunity? Marc Benioff : Well, I\u2019ve got two words for you which is transaction volumes. And I think that you see that with Salesforce, we make public, as you know. In nauseam, we\u2019ve talked about this. I don\u2019t got a revelation anybody on this call or in this room that we publish our transaction rates every single day. But the reason that you don\u2019t see other vendors provide their transaction numbers is because they\u2019re actually quite low. Now, when we publish a transaction number, that\u2019s a complex transaction; it\u2019s a complex transaction that we deliver. You saw that in the first quarter, we delivered 78.7 billion transactions in the quarter. And if you think about other cloud providers, who else is telling you how many complex transactions. Now, when I talk about a transaction, what I mean is as defined by the late Jim Gray who basically define in transaction as a complete unit of work in the computing model and the ability to not only to commit that transaction, which is a technical term, but also to be able to roll back that transaction into unit work. And we\u2019re reporting that transaction number and we\u2019ve done that for quite a few years. I think that you can determine the value that a company is placing on its customers by the amount of data that it holds the amount of metadata that it holds and that is reflected most accurately in the number of transactions. The transaction number is really the sum of all capabilities of the system and saying we\u2019ve delivered when we are on our way to delivering more than a 100 billion transactions in the quarter. Okay, what\u2019s another one that we follow closely tweets the way that really judge the success of Twitter is, of course, when they had a great quarter, I think it was almost $300 million for the quarter, they are a great customer of Salesforce to keep our eye on Twitter, and how do we manage Twitter, say transactions, we look at their transaction number how many tweets are happening in for Twitter. And in the same way, you can really look and you can track and graphing is quite analytical Salesforce\u2019s transaction number over a period of time. So I will look to that and what I\u2019ve seen is, I continue to come back to an amount with customers constantly that\u2019s my job. This week I was in New York with dozens of customers and working with one of our \u2013 working with Bank of America\u2019s, one of our largest customers on their next generation. Systems are and it\u2019s all about their customer, you\u2019re following the customer and how do you \u2013 the path of organic growth for our customers is the work with their customers. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re right in the heart of all these companies\u2019 business. We want to help them grow their revenue. We want to help them grow their top line, and the way we are going to do that is by helping them optimize their sales, service, and marketing capabilities grow their channels, and as we do that, it\u2019s reflected in the transaction numbers. So look, what is my call to arms? My call to arms is for all cloud ISVs to publish their transaction number on a quarterly basis just as we do, because it will give you more prospective on the stickiness and the intimacy and the integrity between the vendor and the customer. I hope that answers your question. Operator : Your next question is from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities : Thanks. Hi, Marc, I wanted to follow-up on \u2013 it\u2019s been a while since the Rypple acquisition, and at that time you talked of sort of building a whole new class of apps that had more social integrated into them. I was wondering if you could give us a little more update on which of those have been most successful and sort of where you see that effort going. Marc Benioff : Well, I of course, I\u2019ll talk about Rypple, which is now known as Work.com and if you haven\u2019t seen the new version of Work.com, it\u2019s phenomenal. We\u2019ve owned the company I think for just a little bit over a year now, a couple of incredible founders that joined our company from that company with Daniel Debow and David Stein. And under the leadership of a tremendous executive in our industry, John Wookey here at Salesforce who is running that capability, as well as our GoInstant acquisition, which is also another phenomenal story underway. but in the case of these small acquisitions that we\u2019re doing like Rypple, like GoInstant and others, a lot of these are, what we are \u2013 acquisitions that we\u2019re going to acquire talent and it\u2019s a kind of extend and complement our capability. The one that we really kicked all this off with was Jigsaw. You probably remember when we bought Jigsaw for about $150 million and I don\u2019t remember the exact amount. It\u2019s not in front of me obviously at the table. And of course we\u2019ve worked on that. We evolve the team. We evolve the products and the technology. We loosely coupled it into our architecture. We\u2019ve rebranded in Data.com. And what this year Data.com had a phenomenal quarter they\u2019re probably going to \u2013 I think they\u2019re going to do more than $100 million this year. It\u2019s pretty exciting or approximately that. They\u2019re well on their way to doing that. And it\u2019s a great success story here at Salesforce and it\u2019s a commitment. I have to tell you we\u2019re in quarter one or quarter two or even quarter five or six after buying a small company that\u2019s not when we\u2019re looking at is this a success or is this a failure. We want to get down the road, the year three or year four and that\u2019s really when we can really judge it. In our industry, people always overestimating what you can do in a year and they\u2019re underestimating what you can do in a decade and that is really true in these kind of technology acquisitions that we make. Now don\u2019t make any mistakes, these are high risk moves when we buy a small company, there is a high risk that it\u2019s going to fail and exceed. We have to keep these founders in the boat and it\u2019s complex. But I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve had a lot of great success and other great success in addition to Work.com, which is Rypple in addition to Data.com which was Jigsaw is the company called Heroku. And Heroku has also had some incredible growth rate. It hasn\u2019t gotten yet to $100 million in revenue. We bought the company approximately 2.5 years ago for about $200 million to $250 million. It\u2019s a phenomenal piece of technology and they have just done a great, great job at Heroku, it\u2019s really become a great standard in the industry, it\u2019s huge extension to our platform and gave a lot of confidence to our customers that we\u2019re in the platform area. In the same way getting back to your original question, Work.com has become a tremendous performance in productivity enhancer to our sales application. And we see customers who are buying the sales cloud look to Work.com as a way to motivate and align and compensate their sales organizations. And you will see in the new version of Salesforce. This summer I\u2019m not going to tip my hat too much, but the deep integration of Work.com into that next gen sales application. We\u2019ve already seen us include some components of Work.com in the current vision of Salesforce and some customers have been able to deploy that. But soon all customers will be able to and it\u2019s given us a great vision for the future of our company, and I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to have that group with us. They\u2019re based in Toronto, Canada, and they\u2019re doing a fantastic job. We want to keep them going fueled, and exciting. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Nandan Amladi with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Nandan Amladi \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, question on the off-balance sheet backlog. That seem to have slowed a little bit. We\u2019re still up 33% year-on-year. But compared to where it was last year, was it tough comps or were there some other moving parts we need to understand? Graham Smith : Sure. There\u2019s a couple of things. I think firstly, in Q1 last year, you\u2019ll recall that we signed a largest deal in the company\u2019s history that was signed in Q1 that added a big boost to the off-balance sheet, because it\u2019s multiyear agreement. And also, we renewed one of our largest customers Japan Post for several years, and that\u2019s also I think top five customers worldwide, and so those two transactions in the first quarter of last year made it kind of a tough comp. And then secondly, I think over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen extension of our average contract length. We talked about that on our fourth quarter call that our average contract length is now just over two years, and at some point that the pace of that contract extension length will slow, and so that will provide a bit of a drag on that off-balance-sheet but it is still a very healthy growth rate of the tough comp. So we were happy with the number. Operator : Your next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Keith Weiss \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Excellent, thank you guys for taking my question and nice quarter. I just want to drill down on margins a little bit and one with a clarification, the licensing impact that was 90 basis points year-on-year on gross margins or operating margins? Graham Smith : It\u2019s about the same, it\u2019s about $8 million on our revenue numbers, so it basically got the same 90 point impact on, its recorded in cost of sales, so it was in the gross margin number and it was also obviously in the operating margin number. Operator : Your next question is from David Hilal with FBR. Please go ahead with your question. Samad Samana \u2013 FBR:  Hi, this is Samad Samana for Dave. We\u2019ve been hearing lot of attraction in the government space; can you give us an update on the government focus and amongst your existing products where you see the biggest opportunity and which could be the most successful there? Marc Benioff : Okay, yes, I will do that. As you know, Salesforce.com has not focused on the U.S. Government as a major opportunity over the last 14 years. We\u2019ve been too emerged and amassed really in the commercial markets. It just has not been a major focus for us. A couple of years ago, we started to get much more excited about that opportunity and we really looked at how would we start to build and expand our capabilities. What we realized was that that would require us to do a couple of things; one, bring in new leadership to focus on not only the U.S. government but also the global government opportunity, which includes the Japan government or the U.K. government et cetera, as well as a new technology capability which would be to build the government, we call it government pod; that is, to build a pod that is a special version of our product that would be accessible only to the government, and that would allow critical agencies that we saw becoming interested in our technology like the GSA for example or others to become more invested in using our technology. We also had to bring in a new set of leadership and we hired Vivek Kundra who is our Executive Vice President of our Global Government business unit and he is based in Washington D.C. In addition to that, in addition to focusing upon building a new technology platform in addition to focusing on that next-generation leadership, we also recognized we had to spend a lot more time with the government and also do more marketing events in Washington D.C. And just as an example, yesterday, we had more than 2,000 customers attend our Washington D.C. program. Now, in addition to that, you may know that about 60 days ago, I also personally led a program in Washington D.C. myself which was a sub-1,000 seminar focused on government agencies as well. Now, these are primarily federal agencies; this is not \u2013 this does not also include our work in cities and also in states or in foreign governments. Overall, we see that as a tremendous opportunity for growth and we\u2019re continuing to invest there. And as you know, it\u2019s a long process, but we\u2019re very excited by our work in a number of agencies, in a number of states, in a number of cities and we\u2019ll be doing more to communicate that progress and success stories in the future. It\u2019s wide-ranging from automating the GSA, which is the government\u2019s determining arm to 311 call centers in a number of cities around the country to foreign governments, and I think a great example is Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry that we talked about today with METI and what\u2019s going on in Japan. So all of those things together make us very optimistic about our work with the government in the future, and I do think that the government is ready to go to the cloud. Operator : Your next question is from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Phil Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse : All right. Thanks, guys. A lot of focus has been put on obviously Force.com and the Marketing Cloud. But just wanted to focus back in on the Service Cloud, just curious what trends you are seeing there? Obviously, you\u2019ve had very strong momentum in the past, is that continuing? Then also competitively with write-down having been inside of Oracle for a bit, wondered if you could just talk about the competitive environment? Thanks. Marc Benioff : I think that it\u2019s really fascinating the competitive situation, because in our industry CEOs like myself tend to basically have to predict the future or do their best to predict the future and then focus in certain areas. And it\u2019s a great example is \u2013 of course, Microsoft is extremely focused on Windows 8. That\u2019s a huge part of their story. They\u2019re trying to save their operating system business and their Office business through Windows 8, which they\u2019ve seen Windows to accelerate very aggressively as the world has moved away from the personal computer and towards the phone and the tablet and with launching Windows 8 this year, Microsoft basically have said they want to be the Windows 8 company and that in all situations the answer is Windows 8. That\u2019s true for SAP. You saw Sapphire last week and the main focus of Sapphire was HANA. The focus of HANA \u2013 this HANA application or that HANA implementation or even HANA in the cloud and SAP has said it\u2019s the HANA company. And Oracle, I know Larry extremely well. He has a very impressive piece of technology with Exadata and he is very much wants to be the Exadata company, he views that as the future of the database and the future of its applications, and I get that and Oracle wants to be the Exadata company. But we don\u2019t want to be the Exadata company or the HANA company or the Windows 8 company, we want to be the customer company. We want to enable our customers to help their customers connect in a new way, and that is along the lines of sales, service and marketing and the development of a customer platform. Number one, how do you market the customers when they are everywhere? Number two, how do you sell to customers as a team? Number three, how do you service the customers when they\u2019re everywhere? Number four, how do you build a customer platform? Number five, how do you transform the way that you work in the world of social and mobile? These are the five things that I\u2019m personally focused on each and every day at Salesforce. And look, when I\u2019m working with customers in designing next-generation solutions, we\u2019re looking at doing that. Let me give you an example. This quarter, we had really enjoyed working with Frank Blake, he\u2019s the CEO of Home Depot, and his team on \u2013 they\u2019ve got incredible new business in roofing and sidings and windows, and they need new applications rapidly, and we want to help build those applications, and we want to help connect them with their customers and help them build the quotes and the orders and the sales and service systems for their RSW business, which they see as a tremendous opportunity going forward, and I agree. And we have to get in there; we have to deliver with speed; that\u2019s critical for their future success. And we also have to build and deliver that technology in radically different form factors than we were delivering in just 24 months ago. So when we\u2019re working with our Home Depot in that environment, we\u2019re coming in against existing and mass competitors in that organization. Of course, they really work with every customer and every vendor in the industry. We have to show that we\u2019re different, and the way we\u2019re going to show we\u2019re different is, we\u2019re able to take any device that they show us, rapidly deploy an application in that device and make it world-class and that\u2019s what we did with Frank and his team this quarter. And that\u2019s we have to reproduce in each and every situation around the world. And honestly, I think we\u2019re doing a great job of that. I think you\u2019re going to see \u2013 you saw some great new technology from us this quarter. If you haven\u2019t seen what we\u2019ve delivered on the app stores, it\u2019s incredible. And this summer you\u2019re going to see some more amazing things. We\u2019re going to completely transform the CRM market, and by the time we get to Dreamforce, at the end of this year, I promise you, we will have completely transformed our vision and our core for CRM market and how we\u2019re operating and we\u2019re going to do in whether it\u2019s a user interface or application programming interfaces. And I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s not a focus of our competitors, because if you go and look at their conferences that are seminars, they\u2019re webinars, which I do, it\u2019s my job to do that, they\u2019re not focused in this area, they\u2019re focused in other areas. And you know what; they probably should be focused in other areas because that\u2019s their core. But our core is the customer here at Salesforce. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on moving forward in sales and service and marketing and every day we want to move that technology down the field to make it more social, more mobile, more capable with Big Data, the ability to build and develop new next-generation communities, helping our customers become software companies like we just did with Home Depot in building these next-generation apps for them, get it deployed on the cloud and helping our customers build the next level of trust with their customers. And those seven tenants and those things that we\u2019re doing every day, that is not what our competitors are doing. They\u2019ve got a different focus. You can read their earnings \u2013 you can attend their earnings calls and read their scripts. It\u2019s not what they talked about. So that\u2019s how I look at the competitor situation and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve become the number one CRM company in the world. Operator : Your next question is from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Jason Maynard \u2013 Wells Fargo : Good afternoon guys. Marc, in your comments you\u2019ve made some really interesting points about the shift to engagement apps and this new customer company point of view. Can you maybe share your vision around how Chatter, the new mobile apps, and the UI changes drive that positioning change? Marc Benioff : Well, I think it\u2019s a great question, and I\u2019ll tell you that I am not ready to spill the beans which I\u2019m very good at doing. What I\u2019ll tell you is that the world is changing faster than ever and in our industry it\u2019s no different. And you can really see it by what users are carrying with them when they even travel. I used to always have my laptop with me when I traveled, but now I mostly just have my phone. And that\u2019s amazing to me. And I switch off between an iPhone and an Android device probably like a lot of people. Sometimes I have both with me. LTE networks have really changed this device performance everywhere I go in the world. And the phones are actually quite a bit bigger than they were just a couple of years ago, and I have seen some of the new phones that are coming, and they\u2019re all starting to stretch a little bit more towards the iPad. I think that that is a very unusual and interesting change in our industry. It\u2019s subtle, but it is seminal. And the reason why it\u2019s seminal is, because it\u2019s not the focus of the enterprise that all of a sudden I feel there like go in the pocket of my jacket and run my whole company, but that\u2019s really my focus. My focus is and really has been that in the shift to mobility, which is way bigger than tablets and just phone \u2013 the billions and billions of devices are phones. In the world of social, which is billions of users in the social world and the world of next-generation Big Data, which is a lot about the APIs that are coming out of all these systems that we have to reconceptualize what does it mean to manage and build and create compelling enterprise software. The things that we were building when we started our company, we said hey, why are all enterprise apps not like Amazon? In 2010, we started to ask the question why our enterprise apps not like Facebook? Now, that was about a decade, but I can tell you that by the time that we get to \u2013 by the time that we get to Dreamforce, we have to build ask that same question. But in the same way that Facebook has reconceptualized their company and they run entirely on the phone. And they have these great new phone apps, which I use every day or Twitter \u2013 Twitter is another great example of phone apps. We have to be at that same level of acuity and excellence in that environment, not just for our fixed apps but in the ability to build and deliver custom apps, like I just referenced with some of these big customers. And this transformation or kind of the re-platforming \u2013 we\u2019ve already re-platformed successfully a couple of times in the company, but I strongly believe we have to re-platform again in today\u2019s world. I don\u2019t see the competitors doing that honestly. And I really think that we have to do it again and we\u2019re going to have to get ready to do it again because the market is changing. And it\u2019s exciting and I think it\u2019s getting bigger. I think our ability to reach more users is out there, and we want to build or provide a broader solution that\u2019s agnostic across all operating systems and devices. That becomes the dominant applications that our customers use to manage their businesses. To back to Heather\u2019s point that we want to have all of those apps right there in the palm of your hand and I think that we\u2019ve got it figured out and I think we\u2019re imminently ready to deliver the next-generation of our platform and our capabilities. Shinal we probably have time for about two more questions. Operator :  Your next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citi: Hi thanks. Graham, I wonder if you could talk about deferred sales commission. If we look at the new deferred commissions on the cash flow that was actually down substantially year-over-year, but $32 million comes into about half of that. Can you talk about what the drivers of that number were? Graham Smith : Well I think we still have some comparison issues with Q1 and Q4 of the previous year, where we had sort of really, really spectacular large transactions closing that drove very high commission payments to sales teams that were involved in those transactions and clearly we have a strong fourth quarter here but we didn\u2019t have some of these marquee transactions that really drive the big, big commission checks. So I mean other than that, we haven\u2019t I would say year-over-year growth in terms of hiring is a bit slower this year versus the previous year but we haven\u2019t changed the comp plans particularly or anything like that. So I think it\u2019s really the profile and the distribution of the transactions that creates a lot of that change. Operator : And your final question today comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Raimo Lenschow \u2013 Barclays Capital : Thank you. My question, just a quick one on the regions, I noticed that Asia has been decelerating of the two quarters and is actually growing at a growth rate, it doesn\u2019t look overly exciting. Could you just talk about some of the drivers there? Thank you. Graham Smith : So Raimo, I think we have highlighted that on previous calls that in spite the fact that we obviously have some very large, very successful customers in Japan. Generally that market has been quite tough for us, over the last couple of years particularly in the enterprise. I think small businesses continue to kind of move along very nicely but enterprise in Japan has been slow and of course that takes time to kind of feed through into our revenue numbers. Now you are seeing obviously a different approach to managing the Japanese economy. We will be there next week for a customer company tour and I think our sales team over feel much more excited about the prospects for large enterprise transaction this year but it\u2019s primarily Japan that is affecting that revenue growth number, the rest of Asia, which is sort of Australia, New Zealand and ASEAN has been relatively consistent performer over the last few years. Marc Benioff : Great. Well, thanks everyone and thanks for joining us today. Just encourage you all again to register for Dreamforce, do that early and we look forward to updating you in August. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you everyone for joining today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I have really never been so excited about Salesforce.com and everything that's going on with the company and that's why I am so delighted to get on the call with everybody today. We are having an outstanding year of growth and I am absolutely delighted to share our second quarter results right now. Revenue for the second quarter rose 31% from a year ago to $957 million, In constant currency, revenue grew even faster at 32%. No other software company, there is no other enterprise software company of our size is growing faster. Deferred revenue rose by more than 30% year-over-year, finishing the quarter at nearly $1.8 billion. Just outstanding. Operating cash flow exceeded a $180 million for the quarter, an increase of more than 30% year-over-year, and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet now tops $5.6 billion, also up more than 30% year-over-year. Based on these fantastic results, I am thrilled to announce that just four years after delivering our first $1 billion year, we expect to breakthrough our first ever $1 billion quarter in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, our next quarter, an amazing milestone for Salesforce.com and for the entire cloud computing industry. In addition, we are once again raising our full fiscal year 2014 revenue guidance, the high end of our guidance puts us on pace to deliver fiscal year 2014 revenue of $4.025 billion with a full year growth rate of 32%, just spectacular growth. Salesforce has always been a catalyst and evangelist for innovation enterprise software. We pioneered the shift to the cloud, to social, to mobile and we have been recognized for innovation by Forbes Magazine, who just ranks Salesforce.com as the most innovative company in the world for a third year in a row. Congratulations to the entire team at Salesforce.com for this incredible achievement. Now, more than ever, companies are turning to Salesforce.com as their platform for innovation. With our social and mobile and cloud technologies, our customers are connected with their customers in entirely new ways and they are becoming customer companies. Customer companies have a deeper connection with their customers. They can market on any channels, sell as a team, service customers everywhere.

With our four product lines, sales cloud, service cloud, marketing cloud and the Salesforce platform, our customers have the tools to become customers companies, unlock greater levels of growth, innovation and success. They can build faster. That's why our customers have made Salesforce.com, the world's number one CRM platform and then clear leader in each of our core four markets, our flagship Sales Cloud is now the number one app in the world for sales and it's helping customers drive phenomenal sales performance and top-line growth that's why Gartner once again named us as the undisputed leader in its Magic Quadrant for Sales Force Automation for the seventh year in a row. In addition to the incredible capabilities from Work.com and Data.com, the Sales Cloud now delivers a complete lead to close solution with Pardot fully integrated into the Sales Cloud giving our customers one of the leading apps in B2B marketing automation and a unique asset from our acquisition of ExactTarget, we couldn't be more thrilled with Pardot and how it brings a full range of marketing, campaign management and solutions deeply embedded into our Sales Cloud. The Service Cloud is now the world's number app for customer service and support and the only platform that ties customer service with sales and social and that's why Gartner declared Salesforce.com as the clear leader in both vision and execution in its most recent Magic Quadrant for Customer Service making us again the number one solution for customer service. And I am excited to announce that we doubled down on the Marketing Cloud this quarter with the acquisition of ExactTarget, the largest acquisition in our history. We believe that ExactTarget, Marketing Cloud will define the future of marketing. It is a powerful one-to-one customer platform that makes it possible for companies to bring in customer data from any source and deliver highly personalized digital marketing to any customer across any channel. With the combination of ExactTarget, Radian6, Buddy Media and social.com, we have the platform of choice for CMOs with powerful and are power house in marketing across email, social, web, and mobile. And the Salesforce platform is the world's number one platform for developing enterprise cloud apps and the only platform with built-in social and mobile capabilities right at the core. Companies who want to build the next generation of apps that work instantly on any mobile device, that's why we doubled the number of developer mobile packs this quarter, giving them more freedom to choose the tools and frameworks they need to build apps back and the Salesforce platform continues to be our fastest growing product line and as the only solution rated by Forrester as the leader at every single public cloud platform category. The combination of our customer company vision and our clear leadership in each of these core markets is what's driving our success with customers today and that's why we continue to close some of the most exciting and strategic transactions in the industry and let me just touch on a few of them right now. We had an amazing win in the quarter with Sysco, not CISCO, but SYSCO one of the world's largest food service distributors. In over last two years, Sysco has been standardizing on Salesforce as it CRM platform across sales service and marketing wrapping its SAP implementation. An incredible relationship, where Salesforce is the front-end and SAP is the back-end and delighted amounts that in the quarter Sysco decided to bring the Salesforce platform into the core of its company-wide Sysco 360 initiative and we are looking forward to helping Sysco deliver on its vision of enriching their customers experience and driving growth. Sysco is one of the most exciting companies in the world in its industry and we are delighted to be partnered with Sysco and delighted to be partnered with the SAP and delivering this incredible capability. This is a great undertaking from Sysco and one of the largest platform transactions in our history. I want to congratulate our entire team on the incredible success with Sysco We closed an exciting transaction in luxury retail this quarter with one of the world's most iconic brands Louis Vuitton. Retailers going through a incredible transformation with every major retailer having to decide how they will connect their customers in a whole new way.

So, please register now while there is still availability. Go to dreamforce.com. Now with that, I want to hand it over to Graham Smith, to touch on the incredible financial results of Salesforce.com's second quarter. Graham? Graham Smith : All right. Thanks, Marc. We delivered another strong quarter in Q2, driven by solid business fundamentals and we showed great results across key financial metrics, including revenue, deferred revenue, and operating cash flow. In fact, we exceeded the high-end of our revenue guidance even when we exclude the revenue contribution from ExactTarget. Let me provide you with the detail on our second quarter results, starting with revenue. Second quarter revenue was $957 million, up 31% over Q2 last year. Excluding an approximate $7 million FX headwind, second quarter revenue was up 32% year-over-year. ExactTarget contributed $16 million dollars of revenue in the second quarter, which was higher than we had forecast as a result of the transaction closing earlier than we had anticipated. Looking at year-over-year growth, on a regional basis, revenue in the Americas grew 34% to $679 million. Revenue in Europe grew 39% in dollars and 34% in constant currency to $174 million. Revenue in Asia increased 6% in dollars and 19% in constant currency to $105 million. That's a slight improvement for the region. Dollar attrition continued its slow and steady decline in the second quarter marking it the 16th consecutive quarter of sequential decline and remained very solidly in the low double-digit percentage range. Turning to margins. Our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 80.7%. That's about 60 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 10.2% or about 240 basis points lower than last year. The decline in both the gross and operating margin was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget, as well as increased costs related to the agreement we signed with Oracle during Q2. While the two transactions are impacting near-term profitability, we are working hard to find synergies in cost savings which will mitigate their impact this year and into the future. From a headcount perspective, we added more than 2,200 new employees in the second quarter including approximately 1,900 from ExactTarget bringing our total headcount to more than 12,500. That's up 43% over Q2 last year and double where we were in Q2 of fiscal 2012. Turning to EPS. Second quarter GAAP EPS was $0.12. Our Q2 GAAP EPS reflects a non-cash benefit of approximately $129 million related to a partial release of the tax valuation allowance we established in Q3 last year. Our consolidated deferred tax balances changed primarily due to the acquisition of ExactTarget's intangible assets. These acquired intangibles result in future book amortization expense, but no equivalent tax deduction, which gives rise to future tax liability. We were able to reverse the valuation allowance to the extent that our deferred tax assets will be offset by the ExactTarget deferred tax liability. On a non-GAAP basis, second quarter EPS was $0.09. Non-GAAP EPS was better than we expected due to the higher than anticipated ExactTarget revenue and a slightly lower share count and forecast offset by a higher non-GAAP tax rate. Turning to cash flow. Second quarter operating cash flow was $183 million, up 34% over Q2 of last year. Operating cash flow in the second quarter benefited from higher than anticipated collections, offset by about $30 million in transaction fees and other acquisition costs. CapEx in the second quarter was $102 million, up from approximately $30 million in Q2 last year. The year-over-year increase in CapEx was principally related to new office build outs and the IP licensing agreement that we discussed on our call last quarter. As a result CapEx, as a percentage of revenue, in the second quarter was 11%. That's up from just 4% in Q2 last year. For the full year though, we expect CapEx, as a percent of revenue, to be around 8%, slightly higher than in previous years. Free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx was $81 million in the second quarter. That's down from $107 million in Q2 last year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $930 million in cash and marketable securities, including proceeds from a $300 million term loan utilized in connection with the ExactTarget acquisition. Accounts receivable was up 34% over last year to just around $600 million. Deferred revenue in the second quarter was $1.79 billion, up 34% over Q2 last year. Deferred revenue in the second quarter benefited from approximately $44 million related to our acquisition of ExactTarget, and from a year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately $1 million. On a sequential quarter basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind to the tune of around $4 million. Deferred revenue also continued to benefit from the residual effects of the multiyear invoices and from the continued shift toward annual billing. The combined benefit to deferred revenue in Q2 was approximately $85 million, down from approximately $100 million, sequentially, and from a $120 million in Q2 last year. ExactTarget will undoubtedly add an even greater level of complexity to our billing frequency metrics as we seek to move ExactTarget customers to annual billing over time. Excluding ExactTarget, approximately 70% of all Salesforce invoices were issued with annual terms in Q2, compared with approximately 65% of invoices in Q2 last year. This five-point improvement to annual invoicing in the second quarter compares with an eight-point improvement in Q2 last year. That's the headwind to year-over-year deferred revenue growth. Unbilled deferred revenue, or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and that's off the balance sheet was approximately $3.8 billion in Q2. That's an increase of 36% over last year. This unbilled deferred revenue balance excludes the fair value of ExactTarget's unbilled deferred revenue which totaled approximately $137 million. Even though this amount is unbilled because of purchase accounting rules, it has to be recorded on our balance sheet under accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities as both current and non-current customer liability. The invoices related to this balance are issued and now should roll into a regular deferred revenue balance. Before I turn to guidance, I want to give you a brief update on ExactTarget, combining ExactTarget with our existing marketing cloud, is providing greater level of synergies. And as a result, we are reducing our total headcount by approximately 200 people. We anticipate that the cost of this reduction will reduce fiscal 2014 non-GAAP EPS by about $0.01. Scott Dorsey, ExactTarget's CEO will lead the newly combined organization. Turning to guidance, we are pleased to be raising our full year 2014 revenue outlook range to $4.025 billion as Marc mentioned the year-over-year growth of 31% to 32%. This guidance includes approximately $140 million to $145 million revenue contribution from ExactTarget, and that's up from prior guidance of $120 million to $125 million as a result of a $16 million revenue contribution we got in Q2. For Q3, we anticipate revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.055 billion. Inclusive of ExactTarget, that represents year-over-year growth of approximately 33% to 34%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS estimate to $0.32 to $0.34, and we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.08 to $0.09. As a reminder, our biggest Dreamforce ever that Marc just talked about will be held in our fiscal fourth quarter which has a significant impact on our Q4 EPS, and is reflected in our guidance. These EPS ranges imply a full year non-GAAP tax rate of 38% and a Q3 non-GAAP tax rate of 39%. On higher net interest expense, which we anticipate will trend at similar levels to the second quarter throughout the second half of the year. We continue to expect FY'14 operating cash flow to grow in the low-teens percentage range year-over-year as we discussed when we announced the ExactTarget transaction in June. For Q3, we also expect year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the high 20% range, excluding ExactTarget. At our forecast exchange rates, we will also face a roughly two-percentage point FX headwind to year-over-year deferred revenue growth. We anticipate the deferred revenue from ExactTarget in the third quarter will be flat to slightly up from the Q2 number of $44 million. As a reminder, all of the underlying assumptions for our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance and the complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued today. To conclude, Q2 was a very exciting and transformational quarter for Salesforce. In addition to solid financial results, we closed the largest acquisition on history and added proven leader to Salesforce including Keith Black to lead salseforce's Global Sales Service and the Alliance Organization and Scott Dorsey, of course, to lead the market in cloud. We have never been in a better position to capture new market and penetrate deeper into the enterprise than we are today. We look forward to seeing many of you during our analyst sessions at the ExactTarget Connections Conference in Indianapolis on September 17. With that, we will open the call up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : One question for you, Marc. As you have begun to integrate ExactTarget, you have also brought on board two high profile executives from Oracle, Keith Block and Tony Fernicola. I guess my question is, what are the changes that you foresee in the sales organization, go-to-market, as a result of a lot of important developments that have happened this quarter. A question for you, Graham. The ExactTarget, the program, the contribution is a lot higher than we would have expected. I am just wondering if the invoicing terms also change in particular that side of the business and how you foresee that impacting your billings? Thanks very much. That's it from me. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks so much for that question, Kash. I want to tell you that as the CEO of Salesforce, I have really got three priorities that are extremely important to me. The first is, the continued development of our flagship products, Salesforce.com, our sales service platform. All I am focused on right now is delivering an incredible new version of Salesforce.com at Dreamforce. An incredible new version that is anchored to the cloud, to mobile and social capabilities. Number two, I am extremely focused on the success of ExactTarget. I couldn't be more excited about this acquisition, about Scott Dorsey, about the leadership team in Indianapolis and also the speed at which the acquisition and the integration is going and how it's going to impact our company and provide our customers the ability to connect with their customers in a whole new way. Number three, I am extremely excited about Keith Block. We are able to bring in a fantastic new executive to help lead our global customer facing operations. Keith, as you know, runs all sales and service and vertical solutions, anything that we are going to market with Keith is responsible for. He has done a phenomenal job and he is completely rebuilding his management team. As you have already seen, he has brought in perhaps the most successful sales executive from Oracle of all time, Tony Fernicola, somebody who we have had a relationship with since we started the company, but never had the motivation to join the company before Keith came in. We are so excited that we are able to say that we are taking what was a world class sales and service organization and taking it to a whole new level under the leadership of Keith and he has put in an incredible new management team. So those are the three things that I am really excited about and I will turn over to Graham for the second part of the question. Graham Smith : Yes, Kash. So obviously there is a haircut on deferred revenue that calculates at around 30%. We haven't yet, I think Scott and the team at ExactTarget are really just at the beginning of implementing some of our annual billing policy. So right now, there is clearly no effect from that. It's very difficult for me to estimate at this point just over a month into this how quickly that will go. We will give you an update on that as things progress. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill - UBS: Just a quick follow-up on the go-to market. You have unveiled numerous offerings and I am just curious if you could give us your view of how you are simplifying the packaging in that go-to-market? Whether through the use of social ELAs or it looks like even then the new performance edition coming in November that package is more for a higher price? Can you give us a sense of how you are thinking strategically about that? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Sure, that's a great question, Brent. I really appreciate it. Number one, we have simplified our product line into really four critical products which is our sales cloud and it's highly differentiated offering that gets the competition especially with our human performance capabilities at work.com, with our integrated data capabilities with data.com and with the integrated campaign and marketing capabilities of Pardot and of course it is uniquely position as being mobile, social and cloud. Number two, we have really redacted that to not just the sales cloud, but also the service cloud, the marketing cloud and the platform and those four core offerings give us the ability to then package those in a variety of additions ranging from products that are uniquely created for small businesses all the way up to the enterprise. And as we tune those packages, we found opportunities to bundle in a lot of these new features and functions that we have built, but perhaps have not been able to sell or fully delivered to our customers either because they didn't know about it or there wasn't something that was available at their time of purchase, so we have a tremendous upgrade opportunity and that's how we look at the performance addition. It's a phenomenal product, it's an incredible new capability for existing customers to take their capabilities to a new level and it's a tremendous level of optimization on our existing pricing structure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with BMO Capital. Karl Keirstead - BMO Capital : Yes. Quick question for Graham. Graham, you mentioned that the ExactTarget revenue [contribution] for year would be [140 to 145]. At the time of the deal, you mentioned 128. I'm just wondering what the cause of that delta is versus our performance or anything else? Thanks for any color. Marc Benioff : Sure, Karl. It was the $16 million that we recognized in Q2 that related to ExactTarget. When we built the deal model it was tough to know exactly which day the transaction would close on, so we clearly planned conservatively and we got transaction closed much earlier than we anticipated and so picked up about $16 million in Q2. So you add that to the 120 and 125 and a little extra and you get to the 140 to 145. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray : Thank you very much. Marc, regarding Keith Block and the concept of trying to take enterprise sales to the next level, it seems to be challenging to name an enterprise software company that's been more successful than Salesforce.com with enterprise sales. Because in the last 18 months you have closed several transactions that were roughly $100 million each and they have been transformational and Fortune 100 companies and on a scale that seems to be unparallel in this industry, so just wondering how can it be the case that something can be improved there. Also, do you think the Keith Block's impact on ELAs and other large transactions would be positive or neutral or negative in the second half of the fiscal or will the changes happen more in Q1? Marc Benioff : Well, thanks for that set of compliments. I really appreciate it. And Salesforce.com has done incredibly well. One of the ways that Salesforce.com has done so well is, that we have a full portfolio of transactions for small, medium and large business. One thing Salesforce.com has never fully optimized for is, enterprise distribution and the ability to reach the largest customers in the world with highly customized solutions for their industries and their verticals. To do that, we have to bring in a team and a leader who is able to speak to the executives the largest and most important companies in the world to show them that it's not just a one-off solution in this industry or with this company, but they can do it for their whole industry and for all the companies of that industry. You saw how Keith executed that strategy extremely well at Oracle over the last 26 years and we look forward to seeing him execute a very similar strategy enhanced for Salesforce and our unique capabilities and we have already seen him make major changes and we are very excited about his strategy. Of course, this is a time of extreme growth for Salesforce we are always doing, which has been so exciting. Here is a quarter, 31% growth quarter, and at the same time, we are bringing in phenomenal new distribution leaders to take the company to a whole new level. And not just at Keith's level or at his direct report level, but in every layer of our distribution team, we have found opportunities for optimization, for change, for growth, for evolution to bring in real enterprise leadership to make this a world class effort, and Keith has all of my support. We have also added him to our Board of Directors and given him the title of Vice Chairman to make it crystal clear to our organization that he is the leader of our distribution organization going forward, and is responsible for all customer facing operations. He is helping us to lead this incredible transformation that's been unbelievably positive so far and we couldn't be more thrilled with having him on board. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne - Evercore: Marc, I was just wondering if you could comment really quickly on what we are seeing more broadly around the marketing cloud with the Omnicom and Publicis deal earlier this quarter. I guess what does that say about some of the trends we are seeing in terms of bigger organizations trying to shift to this customer competent paradigm. I guess, how should we view these bigger advertising agencies in relation to CRM, in terms of partnering and/or potentially competing overtime? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, those are two great organizations. You look at them, these leading marketing agencies, both as the leaders in those field and I have relationships with both of those CEOs. They are phenomenal executives, phenomenal companies. They have a phenomenal presence with these very large customers helping to articulate their strategy. They have grown really dramatically through acquisition. It's a strategy that both companies very much have deployed. I think they are probably at the end of that at this point. I don't know what other companies are going to get combined into those organizations. What our hope is, is that we are going to be able to partner with these marketing agencies to provide them with the technology necessary to enable their customers to connect with their customers in a whole new way. It doesn't take a very big leap to see that these agencies are phenomenal in so many areas. Coupled with our capabilities of delivering world class cloud, social, and mobile solutions, we can really take their customers' capabilities to new level. I view marketing as a huge growth area for Salesforce. By 2017, Gartner says, CMOs will spend more than CIOs on technology. It's one of the reasons we bought ExactTarget and many other companies as we positioned to be the number one player in marketing and you will continue to see us to focus on that effort. As I said, one of my top three priorities is making ExactTarget a major success for Salesforce.com. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Rick Sherlund - Nomura: First congratulations on Keith and Tony. Marc, your comments on SAP seemed a little more muted this quarter. You mentioned partnership with Sysco. I am wondering, if perhaps, there is an opportunity for you to do greater product integration with SAP as we just heard about from Oracle. For Graham, you mentioned the billing terms for ExactTarget being different. I wonder if you could share with us what those are? Marc Benioff : Well, Rick, I really appreciate that. I will tell you that I think that companies like Oracle and SAP who have not been able to bring their product lines to the cloud, who have not been able to make the movement to social, who have not been able to make the movement to mobile can benefit from alliances with Salesforce.com, with our brand luster, with our innovation and you heard in the quarter a phenomenal call between myself and Larry Ellison, where Oracle has announced that they are going to be using Salesforce.com as their CRM. That was incredible to hear Larry talk about that. Certainly it's my hope and I believe that we will be able to develop and trade a similar alliance with SAP. I believe it's in the interest of their customers and our customers that Salesforce works well with Oracle. It works well with SAP and even works well with Microsoft because our customers have these existing investments that we want to leverage. That SAP relationship is a great relationship with, as I mentioned this quarter, the huge success with Sysco where we were able to take their huge investment in SAP back office and put on a customer facing capability that they badly needed but SAP was not able to deliver for them. I believe there is a lot of SAP customers that are in a similar position, who can use highly customized applications maybe with our force.com platform or even with our primary capabilities of our sales and service cloud and will have the ability to both, those on to these existing SAP infrastructures or even put those on top of these emerging HANA implementations, where we can really bring more value and applications to these data stores. Graham Smith : I was just going to answer Rick's question on the billing terms for ExactTarget. At the moment, a little over half of their billings are done monthly. Then there's around about a quarter of their billing are done quarterly and then the rest is and at least so it looks very different to salesforce and clearly as I mentioned earlier, Scott and his team will be working on transitioning their customers towards annual over time. They have a slightly different revenue make up. They obviously have more services than we do for example and services is typically always build monthly, so I am not sure we will get to exactly the same ratios as the salesforce has, but clearly big opportunity over the next few years to generate strong cash flow and to reduce administration costs by moving them to more to annual billing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Raymond James. Terry Tillman - Raymond James : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Marc, the question for you in terms of post-closing of the ExactTarget transaction. Will your salesforce have pre-range to sell ET products and when do we think about maybe potentially starting to see some revenue synergies from such activity? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, that's just a fabulous question and I will tell you it's something that we already are seeing revenue synergies. It's something that we are already focused on and our core salesforce which is, as multi-thousand person sales organizations, something that ExactTarget did not have, is getting the key aspects of having that relationship where we are giving our core salesforce the ability to have a sale with ExactTarget is like a sales of any other of our other clouds. I believe that's extremely important for us to be able to truly get the value out of ExactTarget, but there is no difference between selling the salesforce ExactTarget marketing cloud, the sales cloud, the service cloud or the platform if you are a core salesforce.com sales professional and to that extent, we are partnering them very closely with the existing ExactTarget sales organization. We are also working very hard to expand the existing ExactTarget sales organization which is something that's been rather boutique and I believe it has the opportunity to be expanded as well and give us the ability to have that tremendous core confidence and we are doing that by combining our existing marketing cloud sales team with the ExactTarget sales team and having one unified marketing cloud sales team. Now that process will take a period of time to come to a complete fruition, where we have a total synergy, but we've made tremendous gains in the short period of time. And, as I said, it's one of the important things that I work on every day and I expect us to make continued gains this quarter and the following quarter and be able to give some very good updates on that as we start our next fiscal year. Certainly, ExactTarget is a critical part of salesforce.com's growth engine. It's something that every salesforce.com customer wants to know about and we have a huge vision for ExactTarget, where we can really show our customers how they are able to connect with customers not just through their sales force, not just through their customer service organization, but through email, but through text. Through social, through all these other customer touch points that are so critical to them and ExactTarget is a critical part of that and a huge part of our message and we will be tightening that message. By the time, we get to Dreamforce, you will see it fully delivered. You will also see the beginning of that message at the Connections Conference in September with ExactTarget in Indianapolis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of with Nandan Amladi with Deutsche Bank. Jobin Mathew - Deutsche Bank : This is actually Jobin sitting in on behalf of Nandan Amladi. Two questions. So you mentioned ExactTarget billings comes from, that a part that comes from your business comes from services. So what portion of ExactTarget's billings comes from services? Marc Benioff : It's about 20% Jobin, just over 20%, and obviously just compare with that, it's less than 10%. So what I pointed it now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Schneiderman with Roth Capital. Nathan Schneiderman - Roth Capital : Marc, it seems like Facebook is enjoying accelerating momentum as an advertising platform and that would seem to be positive for your Buddy Media business. I was curious what metrics you are tracking for Buddy that you can share with us to help us understand the progress with that business line? Marc Benioff : Well, we continue to focus on Buddy Media and also another really exciting offering that we have which I am sure you have seen which is social.com, where you can actually buy Facebook apps directly online and help us to deliver that distribution capacity. It is part of and becoming part of, what I call, our complete Salesforce.com ExactTarget marketing cloud. The Salesforce.com ExactTarget Marketing Cloud has to include not just all the capabilities of ExactTarget, which so many folks have become known for their tremendous capabilities with the email, their tremendous capabilities with mobile, their tremendous capabilities in social but also with our ready and fixed asset, with our Buddy Media asset and also with our social.com asset. What you will see emerge is a comprehensive application that allows our customers to manage all aspects of those customer touchpoints. That is going to continue to expand our work with Facebook and you didn't mention it but Twitter is extremely important to us and other social graphs that are providing advertising support. We want our customers to be able to connect with all of these and have a comprehensive solution that manages all of their customer capability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan will Jefferies. Ross MacMillan - Jefferies: Marc, I am just curious about timing. As you bring ET into the fold, you have obviously had success with Pardot on the Sales Cloud. Is it premature to assume that you would have ET fully integrated into the product lineup by the time your reinforce or should we be really thinking about it being integrated for the next fiscal year? Any color on that would be great. Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, there is different levels of integration. I think you have got to look at integration as a spectrum because today, of course, we have AppExchange integration where we have already done some integration with these products but we can do more. Because we own these assets now, we can do native integration. The first area where we were doing tremendous work and really want to have deeply integrated native capability and this is one that is certainly by Dreamforce, we want to able to show our customers how Pardot is deeply integrated into our Sales Cloud, not just at user interface level, but deeply integrated in to our core as well. Our Chief Technology Officer, this is a major goal for him, for this quarter as to make sure that Pardot is well integrated into our Sales Cloud and that our Sales Cloud customers have the ability to start using that capability as fast as possible and with outstanding integration. Number two, with ExactTarget, this very much is something that not only we see ExactTarget integrated into our core clouds, but we will integrate our core clouds and reverse into ExactTarget. If you have seen ExactTarget capabilities with its Fuel user interface, we have the opportunity to bring in our services from our core clouds. into ExactTarget, a great area where today they don't do a lot of work, for example might be in customer service or maybe in another core area we are able to start to leverage our core services back to ExactTarget and that's something that we are going to want to do overtime as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Mr. Winslow, your line is open. Marc Benioff : We will take the next question, operator. Thanks. Operator : Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird: The marketing cloud. In terms of capability to support corporate website marketing, I know ET recently acquired iGoDigital, giving them some capability there. Is that a capability that you would look or want to build out further in the future? Marc Benioff : Well, there is no doubt that mobile is a critical part of what we are doing. And, whether it's, iGoDigital or some of the other capabilities in those areas as well as our investments in some of these great MDM companies, we are going to find some really great leverage and the ability to deliver a world-class offering through ExactTarget. I think a lot of folks didn't really understand ExactTarget's capabilities. Their technology in this area is probably as deep as anyone or anything that I've ever seen and what we really need to do now is, we need to help them to communicate. It's a tremendous asset that they have and we need to do that through product marketing as well through development of a world-class sales organization. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of David Hilal with FBR. David Hilal - FBR: Marc, regarding the upcoming release of winter 2014, are there a few new features functionality that you think are more than incremental that will help maybe catalyze prospective customers who are on the fence to get on the right side of the fence. Anything you might offer up or maybe have a little more interest with that platform? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, I think that there is more than a few a few, but you are going to have to wait until June for us to articulate the full value proposition of what we are doing and our exciting new vision for the future and the changes that we have made to our core platform that is going to enable a whole new generation of capabilities in sales and service, in marketing and building custom mobile applications as well.

Thanks, John, and welcome everyone to Dreamforce 2013 and we are coming to you live right here in the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Today, we are kicking off our 11th annual Dreamforce, now the world's largest software conference with an all-time high of more than 130,000 registered to attend with today's early start and we expect even more tomorrow. And I am thrilled to report just absolute monster quarter and a new all-time high in our financial results for the third quarter. Just four years after delivering our first $1 billion year, salesforce is now the first enterprise cloud computing company to report more than $1 billion in revenue in a single quarter and we are projecting more than $5 billion in revenue next year. Pretty awesome. A phenomenal milestone for salesforce and the entire new cloud industry. Congratulations to all of our customers, our partners and our employees for this amazing achievement. Now let's get to the financial results. Revenue for the third quarter rose to nearly $1.08 billion, up 36% from a year ago. There is just no other Top 10 enterprise software company that is delivering this kind of growth and we are delivering this growth while pushing through the $4 billion dollar revenue milestone and we are heading right to $5 billion. I don't know any company who has delivered a $1 billion quarter and was growing 36% in our enterprise software industry. Deferred revenue rose by more than 34% year-over-year finishing the quarter at more than $1.7 billion and operating cash flow rose to $138 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% year-over-year. The dollar value of booked business, on and off the balance sheet, is now nearly $6 billion and our momentum going into Dreamforce positions us for a strong finish to the year. We are increasing our revenue guidance range by $30 million to finish fiscal year 2014 now at over $4.05 billion, a growth of 33% year-over-year and we are well placed for even more success next year. I am thrilled to announce that we expect to deliver fiscal year 2015 revenue in the range of $5.15 billion to $5.2 billion. Yes, it's true. salesforce.com is going to be the first enterprise cloud company to deliver more than $5 billion in revenue next year. s salesforce.com has always been a catalyst and evangelist for innovation in enterprise software. We have pioneered the shift to cloud, social, mobile and connected. And today, with the next-generation of technology, our customers are connecting with their customers in entirely new ways. We are now entering the third wave of computing where everything is connected and soon there is going to be 50 billion connected products on the internet of things and behind every device, every app, everything is a customer. That's why customer relationship management have just never been more important than it is today. You have got to be ready to sell, to service, to market to your customers regardless of where the customer touch point is. This is really the internet of customers, where companies connect to their customers through the next generation of devices, apps and services. Here at Dreamforce, we are unveiling Salesforce1, a radically new customer platform that was built from the ground up to deliver the speed, agility and power of salesforce, but re-imagined for a social, mobile and cloud and connected devices world. A world that we call the internet of customers. It's the world's first CRM platform for everyone, for developers, for ISVs, for admins, for end-users and, most of all, for your customers. So you can go social, mobile, cloud and get connected. At my keynote, we will demonstrate how Salesforce1 connects everything, all of apps, all of your devices, all of your customer data to completely transform the way customers sell, service, market and innovate. And you know what, in today's world, everything has changed. One of the key tenets of Salesforce1 is that was built API first. It was built mobile first. It was built first for the phone. It was billed first for the tablet. Everything has changed and we realized at salesforce.com that we have been completely changed ourselves in that why customers have made Salesforce the world's number one CRM platform and clear leader in each of our four core markets with the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the ExactTarget, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce1 platform. Our flagship Sales Cloud is the world's number one platform for sales and it's helping customers drive phenomenal sales performance and the top line growth that everyone wants. Partners rated the Sales Cloud of the undisputed leader in its magic quadrant for sales force automation for seven straight years and I am thrilled that Salesforce was recently recognized by CRM Magazine. It's a number one CRM solution and every single category again for enterprise, for midmarket and small business and I want to give you a little secret. If you want to know how salesforce.com deliver that phenomenal growth at this phenomenal scale, it was through the Sales Cloud, [via through the] Salesforce and the Sales Cloud is a great example where is the key to growing our business at this incredible rate. The Service Cloud is the world's number one platform for customer service and support and the only platform that ties customer service with sales and social and that's why salesforce.com is the recognized leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for customer service as well as the leader in the latest Forrester Wave for customer service and you are going to see some phenomenal, phenomenal demonstrations of the service cloud and the new version of the Service Cloud built on Salesforce1 in tomorrow keynote. In fact, one of the phenomenal demonstrations you will see is Philips, who has built an incredible new Ultrasound device built with the Service Cloud platform right into the right into the product. You just hit the product and you go right to our Service Cloud, so if you are Ultrasound technician and you are in a hospital and you need help right there in there, the Service Cloud is always available to you. And the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud is the next-generation customer platform for one-to-one marketing. It's the only platform that makes it possible for companies to bring in customer data from any source and deliver highly personalized digital marketing to any customer across any channel whether it's e-mail, social, web, mobile or any type of product. With the combination of ExactTarget and Radian6, Buddy, media and social comp, we have a powerhouse in marketing which is why Facebook recently gave the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud it's word for innovation. The Salesforce1 platform is the number one platform for developing next-generation cloud apps and the only solution rated by Forrester as a leader in every single public cloud platform category that's why the growth of our developer and ISV communities been nothing short of spectacular and you are going to see just an increase in that as you see our new Salesforce1 platform now with 10 times more APIs than ever before. We now have more than 1.4 million developers on our platform, an increase 75% from last year ISV community grew more than 70% since the third quarter of last year and we have already had more than 250 major ISVs including DocuSign and Evernote; and LinkedIn who signed up to build next-generation of apps on the Salesforce1 app exchange. In addition, more than 15 ISVs, who are live on Salesforce1 today, tomorrow you are going to see a phenomenal demonstration using this Rocketship that's Sony just released called the PlayStation 4 which has been built on top of the combination of the salesforce.com, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce platform, giving them the ability to reach their customers in entirely new way and you are going to see that live in the keynote. The combination of our vision and clear leadership in each of these four core markets is what's driving our success with customers and that's why we continue to close some of the exciting, those strategic transactions in the industry. Now, first, I am delighted to announce, we have extended our relationship dramatically with Hewlett Packard in the quarter. HP started sales transformation with the Sales Cloud, and now with the addition of the Service Cloud and the Salesforce platform, HP plans to transform the way they connect with their entire ecosystem of customers and partners. Just moments ago, Salesforce and HP also announced a new strategic partnership in cloud computing to jointly develop and market the Salesforce HP Superpod. The Superpod gives our largest customers the choice to have all the speed of performance of the salesforce multi-tenant software with a dedicated instance running on HP hardware and you will hear more about our partnership tomorrow when Meg Whitman joins me on stage with my opening keynote to announce the Salesforce HP Superpod. It is phenomenal what our two companies have done by working together. Another great capability in the quarter came out of Roche, the global leader in research-focused healthcare. In the quarter they decided to standardize globally on the Service Cloud for its major divisions to create a 360 degree with every customer. Roche will be able to connect their diagnostic equipment with doctors and lab technicians giving them real-time alerts and notifications on patient tests and with salesforce communities powered by the salesforce platform Roche, we will be able to instantly connect sales reps and service engineers and all of their healthcare stakeholders to create a community that puts the patient at the center of their care. And I am thrilled to announce that we have closed an exciting transaction with Safeway, one of the largest and most important grocery retailers in North America and Safeway chose salesforce to be its new e-mail, mobile, push and notifications platform for the internet of customers. Safeway will us the exact target marketing cloud to scale its personal customer communications and deliver a consistent experience across through e-mail and mobile channels and with the salesforce platform, Safeway will be able to connect its entire team of marketers, giving them a single place to manage and track campaigns. No matter what the customer touch point, Safeway will be there to reach them with a consistent clear message using the new salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and it's a new capability to connect to the Internet of customers. And in every one of these, examples companies are transforming their businesses with salesforce's customer technologies. Other new or add-on transactions in the third quarter include Ace Hardware, AMEX, Australian Post, Bristol-Myers, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Fujitsu, Intuit, Merck, Nippon, Nissan, Novartis, Pfizer, U.S. Department of Labor, and we also welcomed Vanguard as a new customer for salesforce. The pace at which these companies are using embracing our sales, service, marketing and platform technologies is phenomenal. Our service continues to support and deliver transactions for customers at an unprecedented scale. I am thrilled to announce that we delivered nearly 100 billion transactions in the quarter, up 47% from a year ago, an average of more than 1.5 billion customer transactions every day. And guess what, that's just salesforce's core service. It doesn't include the 1 billion transactions every single day in ExactTarget. Nothing speaks more to the value of salesforce than the actual usage of our products with the speed, and reliability and trust that we are known for. I look forward to seeing everyone at our Dreamforce keynote tomorrow at 9 :00 AM Pacific and you better get there plenty early if you want a seat. Because with 130,000 people arriving here in San Francisco to attend this conference, it is going to be hard to get in pretty much anywhere. With some of the world's leading companies, ADP, HP, Philips, Sony and others that I have mentioned on this script are going to making major announcements and showing some phenomenal new technology in the keynote. Now if you can't get there physically, it is also going to be broadcast live on Dreamforce.com. So tune in that way. It is just like having a front row seat, while without having one. So, also joining me on this week on that stage will be a number of special guests including Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer, Prime Minister of Haiti, motivational guru Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, oncologist David Agus, UCSF Chancellor, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, as I mentioned, Meg Whitman and don't forget about some phenomenal events that we are going to have this week. Tomorrow night, we are going to host a spectacular evening of entertainment for our annual benefit concert, the Concerts For Kids. We have raised over $6 million for our two Bay Area children's hospital, the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital and the Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland. And I am thrilled that Green Day is going to be headlining this event in its first private concert ever. Awesome. And with special performances by Blondie and also MC Hammer, this is going to be a spectacular event. Also don't forget about our top customer event, happening on Wednesday night featuring Jerry Seinfeld and Tony Bennett. Look there is still time to buy tickets at www.theconcertforkids.com. I am looking forward to seeing everyone there. And with that, I am going to turn this over to Graham to discuss the financial details of our third-quarter. Graham Smith : All right. Thank you, Marc. We posted another great quarter in Q3, delivering outstanding growth in revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow. We saw strength across the enterprise and commercial businesses in both Americas and Europe, with the added bonus of ExactTarget delivering a fantastic first full quarter as part of salesforce. Let me take you through the highlights. Starting with revenue. Third quarter revenue was $1.076 billion. That's up 36% over Q3 last year or 37% in constant currency. ExactTarget and Pardot contributed approximately $81 million to revenue in the third quarter which was well above what we had anticipated. The sales and renewals teams executed well and in addition messaging and professional services revenue were also really strong. While on the subject of ExactTarget and Pardot, let me just take a moment to provide a quick update on integration efforts. The sales teams are working well together with lead processes yielding some great new customer wins for ExactTarget and Pardot. The engineering organizations are coordinating development plans and you will see some of the initial results as soon as tomorrow's keynote, which are integrated into the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud. We are really pleased with progress today. Looking at year-over-year growth on a regional basis, revenue in Americas grew 41% to $769 million. Revenue in Europe grew 46% in dollars and 39% in constant currency to $195 million, and revenue in Asia increased 4% in dollars and 17% in constant currency to $112 million. Dollar attrition continued its slow and steady decline in the third quarter marking more than four years of sustained improvement and remains in the very low double-digit percentage range. Turning to margins, our Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 79.3% or about 116 basis points lower than Q3 last year. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 8.6% or about 118 basis points lower than last year. This is largely the result of the acquisition of ExactTarget and also the Oracle license agreement we signed back in May. From a headcount perspective, we added approximately 200 net new employees net in the third quarter, which means we have added about 3,000 year-to-date bringing our total headcount to nearly 12,800. That's up 37% over Q3 last year. I would also like to remind people that we did have a reduction enforce of approximately 250 people early on during the third quarter. Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.09. Our Q3 non-GAAP effective tax rate came in lower than expected, which offset some of the extra investments and marketing programs we made ahead of Dreamforce in our fourth quarter. Our third quarter operating cash flow was $138 million. That's up 30% over Q3 last year. Operating cash flow was a little ahead of our expectations due to strong collections and improving ExactTarget cash performance. CapEx in the third quarter was $73 million, up from approximately $51 million in Q3 last year. The year-over-year increase in CapEx was principally related to ExactTarget capital expenditures and new office build outs. CapEx as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter was up slightly to 7% from Q3 last year, and for the full year we now expect CapEx overall as a percentage of revenue to be about 7%. That's a little less than we had previously anticipated. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx was $65 million in the third quarter. That's up $10 million or 90% from Q3 last year. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Accounts receivable was up 44% over last year to $604 million. Deferred revenue ended the third quarter at $1.73 billion. That's up 34% over Q3 last year, including approximately $65 million related to ExactTarget and no meaningful impact from year-over-year foreign exchange. On a sequential quarter basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $12 million. Deferred revenue also continued to benefit from the residual effects of our multiyear invoices and from the continued shift toward annual billing. The combined benefit to deferred revenue in Q3 was approximately $67 million. That's down from $85 million sequentially and from $110 million in Q3 last year. We were delighted to record a strong deferred revenue results for Exact Target. When we started our efforts to be more deliberate about annual invoicing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the deferred revenue benefit from the shift was about $150 million or about 11% of the deferred revenue balance versus the benefit of approximately 4% of deferred revenue in the third quarter results we are reporting today. Given this declining impact, Q4 will be the last quarter. That's next quarter, we will provide the next, the specific dollar impacts to deferred revenue, however we will continue to get a sense of proportion of invoicing issued on an annual terms each quarter. In the third quarter, approximately 72% of all subscription and support related invoices. This is excluding ExactTarget, were issued with annual terms compared with approximately 65% of invoices in Q3 last year. Unbilled deferred revenue or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet, was approximately $4.2 billion in Q3. That's an increase of around 40% from last year. Turning to guidance, we are delighted to be raising our full year 2014 revenue outlook by $30 million, so the range is now $4.05 billion to $4.055 billion. That's for year-over-year growth of approximately 33%. This guidance includes approximately $180 million of revenue from ExactTarget and Pardot. That's up from prior guidance of $140 million to $145 million. The full year guidance implies fourth quarter revenue in the range of approximately $1.124 billion to $1.129 billion, again that's inclusive of ExactTarget and that represents year-over-year growth of approximately 35%. As Marc mentioned, we are initiating fiscal 2015 guidance today at $5.15 billion to $5.2 billion. At the mid range of the guidance range is or the midpoint, I should say, of the guidance range is this initial view implies fiscal 2015 full year revenue growth of approximately $0.28. Clearly this guidance is provided without the benefit of knowing our fourth quarter new business and attrition numbers and they can both have a significant impact on the following year. So will clearly update this in February on our call. The guidance also assumes that FX rates remain in approximately the same range as they are currently. We are narrowing the range on our full year non-GAAP EPS estimate for fiscal 2014 to $0.33 to $0.34. That's versus $0.32 to $0.34 range we gave on the last call, which implies Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.05 to $0.06. As a reminder, Dreamforce will cost approximately $0.02 cents of non-GAAP EPS and, of course, that is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance. These EPS estimates assume a full year non-GAAP tax rate of 35%, a Q4 non-GAAP tax rate of 36% and a Q4 net interest expense at a similar level to Q3. The cash flow, we reiterate our expectation for fiscal 2014 operating cash flow will grow in the low teens percentage range year-over-year. Excluding ExactTarget, we expect year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the mid to high 20s percent range. Of course, on top of that, we expect ExactTarget to contribute about $70 million to deferred revenue in Q4. And our forecast exchange rates, we will also face a roughly 2 percentage point FX headwind for year-over-year deferred revenue growth. As a reminder, all of the underlying assumptions for our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier today. All right. To close, Q3 was just another great quarter for salesforce. We saw strong execution from our sales and renewals organizations, including ExactTarget. We were delighted by the many exciting customer wins and expansions which reflects our broadening role as a strategic CRM solutions provider. We couldn't be better positioned for a strong finish to fiscal 2014 and for the continued strong growth in fiscal 2015. So with that, we will open the call up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch : (inaudible) much. I think it's the 36th to 37th quarter I am following you guys as a public company. Nice to see the $1 billion mark. You have said some time that you could hit the $1 billion in revenue annual but here on a quarterly basis. So congrats on that. Marc, question for you. With respect to the platform business, it looks like we are seeing a big inflection point here, a number of developers and your optimism surrounding the ISV community seems to be ramping up. Can you talk a little bit more about what could be the impact of Salesforce1 in terms of incremental new platform opportunities that you can pursue that you couldn't before? That's it for me. Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, Kash, you are going to hear about it tomorrow but let me just give you some highlights. Salesforce1 is a completely new approach to our platform as well as to our sales cloud, service cloud and marketing cloud. I have been using it myself from the last six months and it's completely changed how I run salesforce.com and I think it will completely change how our customers run their company and also connect with their customers as well. And what I can tell you, is the power of Salesforce1 is all the things that our customers expect of salesforce, that is the huge ability to manage information, stored procedures, stored triggers, custom user interfaces but things that they did not think that we would feel to do we are doing. Number one, Visualforce1. You are going to see that all the huge amount of seen all huge amount of Visualforce development that our customers have made, it's going to start running immediately on phones and on tablets. That's phenomenal and you can see that already happening. All you have to do is go to the App Store or Google Play Store now and you can get the iPhone as well as the android versions of Salesforce1 to mobile app, but all that Visualforce capability coming right down to mobile devices, Visualforce is a phenomenal technology for user interfaces and you are going to see that. Number two, you will also see 10 times more APIs now available, because if you are going to actually write like we did with these mobile apps directly to Salesforce, you need a huge amount of new API coverage so that you can build super high functionality in your in your app. Number three, not only via Visualforce not only via the APIs you have this phenomenal new Salesforce publisher, which looks a lot like Line from Naver. The idea is that you can have a portfolio of actions in apps to access Salesforce1 is. So what Salesforce1 is? Number one, you can build all your own custom actions and those actions appear right inside the publisher. Number two, you can add apps directly into the publisher. Things like Evernote and Dropbox and all kinds of cool ISVs and you are going to see new ISVs appear where you have a ton of ISVs who built these custom objects and it's off the hook. Then it's not just great for developers, but it's also great for admins. You will see that there is a new app in the App Store called SalesforceA. In SalesforceA, is, A is for admins, and that app lets administrators manage their Salesforce applications for the first time right from the phone or a tablet and you can even customize Salesforce directly from SalesforceA. You are going to see tomorrow the ability to have custom branding right from SalesforceA, so you can make it exactly for your company. Then it's not just great for developers and admins, it's also great for end users as well which is super important, because you know I don't use a laptop anymore. You know that. I don't even use an iPad. I only use this iPhone 5, and I need to run the company from that and I do and that's the power of Salesforce1, which is just tremendous capability, so you got tremendous support for developers, tremendous support for ISVs, tremendous support for admins, tremendous support for end users. Finally, tremendous support for your customers because with Salesforce communities that is the glue that connects everybody back into Salesforce1. When you [equate] stop one of these Salesforce communities, those committees automatically then integrate into the social network that's built-into Salesforce1. You are going to see a whole new range of applications. I don't know any other enterprise software company who has built both, core apps and platform ISVs for developer support and delivered it on the phone. The phone dominates how we use computing today, but has enterprise software made it to the phone besides e-mail? I don't think so, but Salesforce1 does it and it's a phenomenal product. We have already had this in the hands of hundreds of customers over last six months, we have been doing extensive testing on it and the feedback has been phenomenal and I expect the feedback will continue to be phenomenal to show and this is only version one, so we have plenty more planned over the next year, because as you know we are doing three releases a year. Okay. Did you have the second? Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch : No. That was it. Marc Benioff : Okay. All right. Very good. Thanks, Kash. Operator : Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. I had a couple of questions for Graham and one for you, Marc. I guess, one, Marc, given how successful you continue to be in the top line growth that your are posting on top of very large number, how do we think about the leverage that you can start flowing through to the model as we look out and I know that you probably don't want to give fiscal year '15 guidance on that, but if you could just share with us some qualitative thoughts. Then for you, Graham, I was wondering if you could share with us where you are in the process of migrating ExactTarget customers to annual billing terms. Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, here is how I look at it, which is, you know, there's a balance between growth and profitability and we want to continue to do both. We want to continue to grow and deliver these outrageous growth numbers, but honestly we also want to continue to increase our margin. We continue to want to become more profitable. Now there's times when that slows down when we buy a company or we go through a hiring surge or something like that, but for the most part, our goal is to increase our margin and we want to continue to do that in a very strong way and we also, though, want to continue to grow this company and get it over the $10 billion revenue mark. That's also a super strong goal of this company. So those two things have got to go hand-in-hand. We have learned a lot about how do that. You can see here, Heather. You were there with me in the client server world. You can look back, how many companies when they hit the $1 billion revenue line work delivering a 36% growth quarter. One of the results we are able to do it is because we have got that balance right. We have it right but we also know that there's more that we can do on profitability and that we are absolutely actually committed to that. And as I said, the only time that really ever gets slowed down in a serious way is when we acquire something or do one of these hiring surges. So, Graham? Graham Smith : Yes. On annual billings, Heather, we are really pleased with what we saw. I am not ready yet to give a ton of detail on all of the ExactTarget billings performance here. I think we want to see a couple of quarters but suffice to say, when we look at the new business trends versus last year, the annual billing percentage was up very significantly, more than, in fact, on new business. More than we had seen on our salesforce ship. So really very exciting on the new business side and of course, that shows up on the deferred revenue number. We had guided more or less flat on ExactTarget deferred revenue of $45 million and they came in around $65 million. So we were delighted to see that. It's clearly a function that we are shifting customers to annual billing. Operator : And your next question comes Tom Roderick with Stifel. Tom Roderick - Stifel: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So I noticed you spoke very highly about the ExactTarget acquisition, of course, and the numbers keep coming in better than expectation. Can you just maybe give a little more detail in terms of how the topline synergies have worked here? What is bringing the numbers ahead of expectations and relative to any potential cross sell, particularly I am thinking about service cloud opportunities in retail? Can you talk about how the cross sell of that has been going? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, that is phenomenal and you know, I have to say of the reasons we see this increasing growth, one of the reasons you see this kind of accelerated revenue growth this year is, we have got a lot more focused on our core mission which allowed us to cross sell more. You probably remember that a couple years ago that we were really focused on defining the social and enterprise and that was very exciting to us. A highly collaborative enterprise built on social technologies. But what we recognize was, when we went into a customer, who is the buyer of the social enterprise, and it was a little tricky to find that buyer. Now when we go in to find the sales cloud buyer, the service cloud buyer, the marketing cloud buyer, the platform buyer, we know who they are and that has been an accelerator on our growth. We bundle that together in this approach called the customer company and that we are really the first enterprise software company to be focused on customer technologies because we know who the buyers are and our customers for customer technologies and that has really been an accelerator for us, a focuser for us. And to your point, it lets us cross sell because we have a clear point of focus with our employees that we are the customer company, we are the company that helps you to connect with your customers in the new way with the sales cloud, the service cloud, the marketing cloud and the platform built entirely on Salesforce1. And once you start to build and deploy on Salesforce1, you can have this phenomenal experience. I was just with Jeff Immelta couple of weeks ago and he took out his iPhone and he said, you know Marc, there is only two apps that use every single day to run General Electric and one of them is salesforce. And he showed me exactly how he uses what is now Salesforce1 and I will just tell you, it just completely blew me away that I can use to it run my company, he can use to run his company. When we are customer focused executives and when we get that kind of environment where a company that has a culture so focused on their customers, we know we are going to have phenomenal cross sell opportunities. When you are here at the show, make sure you talk to our customers. You are going to see a lot of them are starting to buy multiple clouds and that's a huge compensation opportunity as well for us with our own account executives. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard Wells Fargo : Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations. Marc, I had a question for you. Years ago there was all these (Inaudible) of the sales force automation market and you clearly expanded tam there. As you move in and start messaging more about internet of customers, can you talk a little bit about how you guys are in solve what, I think you are hearing more in the industry that app gap, all of this sort of unautomated you know process and stuff that happens in companies that doesn't really benefit from packaged applications, maybe touch a little bit on what are you guys trying to do to, if you will, drive deeper into organizations and really close, if you will, that technology gap that so many companies have? Marc Benioff : Well, I will tell you that that's going to be a big part of my keynote tomorrow that most companies don't know who their customers are still. I know that's hard to believe and that most companies feel that they are not ready for this social mobile cloud world and the third one is there is that app gap, which is the half of all companies who want to build and deploy mobile/tab apps or mobile apps to their employees, customers or partners, don't know how and we are going to fill that gap and that's a huge part of Salesforce1. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie. Brad Zelnick - Macquarie: Thank you very much and nice job, guys. Marc, with Keith Block on board, there's an expectation around visibility to drive more quarters like this one, particular by driving large enterprise deals given his background. Can you talk at all about large deals in this quarter and the large deal pipeline? Also, with all these great things that Keith should be able to deliver, how do you think about the transition risks associated with changes that he is making? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, there are three things that I have been focused on this year and the three things that are critical for me are that I felt were mission-critical for fiscal year '14, one is Salesforce1, which now I can finally talk about openly and show tomorrow and get everybody on and I think it's an incredible accelerator for this company and really future proves our customers and helps them take that huge investment that they have made in our platform and they thought was kind of glued to PCs and laptops and is running now natively and perfectly in the mobile world. Number two is, ExactTarget in the Marketing Cloud, we had seen this tremendous demand for marketing technology and we are able to analyze it together and ExactTarget had this monster quarter with us and we are feeling phenomenal about that acquisition. Three is, Keith Block. We have been after this guy for a long time and the we were very, very fortunate that he became available and he has hired several dozen executives now to come along with them into re-conceptualizing and rebuild our customer facing organization. He is on our board of directors, he is our President and Vice Chairman. He is doing a phenomenal job and I couldn't be more excited about the having him as part of our Salesforce management team. I mean it's been really a joy and I think he's absolute the best the customer facing executive ever worked within our industry. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill - UBS: Thanks. Marc, the reasons Americas and Europe are growing at twice the rate of Asia Pacific, I am just curious, if you could talk through what you are seeing in Asia Pacific? Is there some type of macro overhang or is it execution? How do you think about the gap there that you can close relative to the other geos that you just posted? Marc Benioff : Well, for us Asia Pacific really consists of two countries Australia and Japan. Japan has been a massive country for us and so as Japan goes so does our Asia Pacific revenue. We continue to see great execution in Japan of our organization, but we also see tremendous opportunity that still needs to be fulfilled. I was just in Japan two weeks ago. I conducted one of our events there, customer company tour, we had 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people there, I don't know how many. It was our biggest event ever in Japan, phenomenal. What I see is, all the same things I see around the world, which is a phenomenal opportunity for companies to automate themselves in new ways and our ability to grow this Asia Pacific line is really all about our ability to grow Japan. When we look back over the last several years in Japan, it's been tough in the enterprise world there. Yet we have grown really well. It's been much easier in the SMB world, it's constant flux back and forth. It's about building a full portfolio of customers which we have done. And you are going to see it here at this conference. We have almost 500 guests who have flown from Japan to attend Dreamforce and I think that when you talk to them, we will have an opportunity to introduce them, I think you are going to see incredible demand opportunities for Japan. Our new Japan data center is now open. Our new office in Japan is also now open in JP Tower, which the government invited us into one of their buildings in the Marunouchi district, which is traditionally reserved for native Japanese companies. So they view us very much as a Japanese organization as do we ourselves and I really expect this to be an accelerator for our business there over the next several years. Operator : And your next question comes from David Hilal with FBR.. David Hilal - FBR: Great. Thank you. Marc, on your comments on Keith's, can you share with us some of the plans to go up the enterprise and more solution selling. I know you guys talked about verticals, maybe timing on when we might see some specific vertical solutions and just other changes that might help you move even further up the enterprise? Thanks. Marc Benioff : That's definitely part of the strategy. He has a comprehensive strategy developed that the board has approved that he's executing. One of the key parts of his strategy is bringing in a new management team, which he has done and that's now in place. Second part of the strategy is to put in critical new programs like a focus on verticals. And there's other key parts of the strategy as well. I don't want to go through all of it because it is somewhat, I would say, proprietary and competitive and would probably let our competitors know some things that we are going to do which may surprise them. Operator : And your next question comes from Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray : Thank you, Marc. I wanted to ask about your potential opportunity to offer Big Data and analytics in the cloud. Specifically, if you look back on it, most traditional data warehouses are on premise technologies, and so as the applications move to the cloud, do you think that the analytics will follow and also move to the cloud? And if it does, do you think there's a bigger opportunity to be providing analytics for HR data or for customer data or for financial data? So, in other words, maybe the relative size of that opportunity for Workday versus salesforce versus NetSuite and other companies. Marc Benioff : Well, number one, we are the largest provider of cloud based analytics and dashboard in the industry. You just have to look at the millions and millions of dashboards that we deliver to our customers each and every day, reports, analytics on their customer data and you are only going to see that expand and become more detailed with Salesforce1. You are also going to see phenomenal new graphics capabilities directly within Salesforce1 that will let our customers deliver those dashboards and analytics directly to their device. Now to your point, it's not a general purpose analytics and data warehousing solution, though many customers do use it in that way. Certainly one of my dreams has been to build and deliver a world-class analytics and data warehousing solution with the same type of acuity that salesforce has on CRM, and we have tried that approach quite a few times. We have done a lot of research and development in that area. We have also bought companies in that area but we have not yet created a product. When we find kind of the magic secret sauce that we somehow can put together at salesforce where the price and the technology and the ease of use is clearly in order of magnitude better than our competitors, like you are seeing with Salesforce1 today, then we will have that type of solution where we will come to you and say, well, yes, we have a world-class analytics and data warehousing solution. Today we are 100% focused on sales, service, marketing and platform. Those are the only four markets that we are addressing. And analytics is within those four, but not analytics as a fifth, if that answers your question, specifically. Operator : Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne - Evercore: Hi. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Can you guys just talk a little about Europe? You guys are clearly outperforming than most of your peers in the industry overall. Can you just talk a little bit about what is going on there and some of the efforts you have done in terms of putting in place new sales capacity? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Europe's execution over the last several years has been phenomenal and I think perhaps some of the best execution I have ever seen in my career. We are continuing to work in that area and a lot of that is because we narrowed our focus in Europe, we realized that the key markets in Europe were the U.K., France and Germany and that we needed to double down in those markets and that we were too prevalent in smaller markets that were not material to our organization. When we made that strategic shift that was led by George Hu, our COO in an analysis that he did that basically yielded our eight country focus around the world which impacted Europe the hardest, we saw this acceleration in Europe and we continue to see great things ahead there and we have talked about that in previous calls that we continue to see world class execution in Europe. We also saw that same phenomenal execution in North America as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley : Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking my follow-up. Maybe just one on the overall (Inaudible). There has definitely been some mixed signals from some larger legacy vendors out there, how are you guys feeling about just the overall tone of IT spending heading into your fourth quarter, and particularly your ability to get those very largest deals done in your last quarter? Marc Benioff : Well, I don't think we gave out the specific numbers on large deals and all that, but we will probably talk about that next quarter. We had a monster quarter, okay? And, it was a monster quarter in big deals and small deals in the enterprise and SMB in Europe and in the U.S. and a lot of it has to do with these three kinds of things coming together that I talked about. We have a phenomenal new distribution management team with a phenomenal new acquisition and we have a complete refresh of our whole products family and we are ready and we are excited. Look, the world has changed it has gone cloud, it's gone social, it's gone mobile and it's gone connected. The companies that are struggling in the market today have not gone cloud, they have not gone social, they have not gone mobile, they have not gone connected. They are still trying to sell the same old stuff. You could see it in this article that in The Wall Street Journal about Steve Ballmer over the weekend, interview that they had where he basically talks about, well it's time for him to move on because he is too representative of the past. I think for a lot of these companies that quote could be about them. I thought that he articulated it really well. That there is an old philosophy of computing and those companies that are executing that old philosophy are not growing and they are not competing and they are not succeeding and the companies that have adopted the new capability, they are going to see hundreds of those companies here at this show. They are growing and we are one of them and I expect good things ahead, because we got the right products that everybody needs right now and a lot of companies don't, so my message to them is the same as before which is the future is cloud computing. The future is social computing, its mobile computing and it's all about this new connected world or what we call the Internet of customers. The companies who are aligning with that, I expect will have tremendous success whether they are small, medium or large, but the companies who deny that the world has changed and that they can continue just to sell this old stuff and that people still want it, well, I think that those companies and those CEOs are the ones who are having the problems and they should transform and they should move forward. Operator : Our final question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Rick Sherlund - Nomura: Thanks. Marc, I am curious whether the issues with the NSA has created any concerns on part of customers or prospective customers about multi-tenants and your discussion earlier about HP. Is this to suggest that you could have a private cloud solution if customers were concerned about having data outside their own firewall or potentially outside their country? Marc Benioff : Well, first of all, the new Salesforce HP Superpod is a Superpod right in our data center with our other pods. It's just a pod that is dedicated to a specific customer that is willing to spend a significant amount of, what we call, AOV with us or Annualized Operating Value, that is the amount of that customer has to be at a certain threshold before we even consider a Superpod and the Salesforce HP Superpod, the first customer is HP because they have exceeded that threshold. Now we have other customers who are also exceeding that threshold and this is a phenomenal opportunity for us and these very large customers to align to offer them our multi-tenant software in a dedicated instance. Okay, so this is not as other companies call it, you can't get this on your premise. There's no hybrid. There's none of this stuff that other people do. This is our same software but in a dedicated instance in our data center and just for you. And it's our same software and those organizations will still have multi-tenants. So big companies like HP or other companies that use our product, they will still have multiple orbs within one pod, but it will be a Superpod or a dedicated pod. In regards to changes in the marketplace regarding all these news reports and all this stuff, it's not our world. We haven't seen it. We don't participate in it. We don't hear about it. This isn't an area that we are knowledgeable in. We don't do communications technology or those types of things. We are doing sales forecast and opportunity management and that just isn't part of the world that you have been hearing about. So we feel very much extracted from that. Operator : And we have no further questions. Back to you, John. John Cummings : Thanks so much. Thanks, Josh, and thanks everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can e-mail us at investor@salesforce.com and we look forward to seeing many of you tomorrow during our Analyst Day tomorrow morning. Marc Benioff : And again, if you want to have a seat in my keynote, I really recommend you get here early. Also I am looking forward to seeing you all. I will be on Mad Money in about four minutes. So I will see you then. Thank you. John Cummings : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CRM Q4 FY14 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. John Cummings, Senior Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Christie. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2014 results. Our fourth quarter results press release, SEC filings and a webcast replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at www.salesforce.com/investor. We will also be post the highlights of today's call on Twitter at the handle @Salesforce_IR. With me today, are Marc Benioff, Chief Executive Officer and Graham Smith, Chief Financial Officer. Marc and Graham will open with a few remarks. Then we will open the call for questions. Our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier today. During the call, we may offer additional metrics to provide further insight into our business or results. This detail may or may not be provided in the future. We may also reference certain unreleased services or features not yet available. We cannot guarantee the future timing or availability of these services or features and so recommend that customers make purchase decisions based on services and features currently available. The purpose of today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fiscal fourth quarter 2014 results. Some of our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

A description of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other risk factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, included in our most recent report on Form 10-Q, particularly under the heading, Risk Factors. With all that, I will turn it over to Marc. Marc Benioff : All right, fantastic. Well, thank you so much. Really appreciate it and first of all, before we get started, John I just wanted to tell everyone that I am thrilled to announce that just this morning salesforce was named by Fortune magazine as the world's number one most admired software company. It's the second year in a row that we have received this tremendous recognition from Fortune magazine. I just want to thank them so much and we are delighted to have that honor. And I would also like to congratulate our team here at salesforce for just an outstanding performance for our fourth quarter and fiscal year. I just want to thank all of our employees, our customers, our partners, everyone, as I am sure everyone can see by our numbers we had a spectacular finish to yet what is absolutely another year of just exceptional growth. Now, if you haven't had a chance to look at the numbers, you will see that revenue for the fourth quarter rose 37% from year ago to $1.15 billion, and our full fiscal year 2014 revenue grew 33% to more than $4 billion and we are about to push through this $5 billion milestone run rate and any minute you can see that. No other software company of our size and scale is growing at this speed. Deferred revenue grew by 35% year-over-year to more than $2.5 billion and the dollar value of book business on and off the balance sheet is now $7 billion and I am sure everyone has seen that we have raised our guidance by $100 million, which is really unusual and just really speaks to the acceleration that we have had in our business to $5.3 billion. We are going to get into that detail in a moment. Now, during the quarter, we significantly grew the number of seven and eight figure transactions compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we had more than 200 transactions in the quarter that were seven figures or more, including more than 10, 8 figure transactions and that is just really exceptional for a software company in the CRM space and CRM to do see more than 200 transactions that were seven figures or greater is just incredible and I know that none of our peers are seeing these large transaction volume like this. In addition, I am also delighted to announce that we are raising our fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance by $100 million to $5.3 billion, which is the full year growth rate of 30% at the high-end of our range. We couldn't be more happy about that and we are committed to improving non-GAAP profitability by 125 to 150 basis points, which is a huge goal of mine for this year and increasing cash flow growth this year, while also continuing to deliver on this outstanding pace of top line growth. Just a great job by the company, I just want to congratulate everybody. For 15 years, salesforce has been the catalyst and evangelist for innovation enterprise software and now we can really see the next-generation has occurred. Customers are really connecting with their customers in entirely new ways. We are benefiting from that. We are absolutely entering this third wave of computing where everything is connected and customer relationship management really is the heart of all this, because behind every [tweet] [ph], behind every app, behind everything is a customer and this is our message as we get out on tour that everything that is happening is about the customer and this vision has opened the door for thousands of companies and empowered them to connect with their customers in a deeper way through this next-generation devices, and apps and products, and if you are at Dreamforce, more than 140,000 people registered to attend and experience the power of Dreamforce this year they saw Salesforce1. Salesforce1, everyone has used it, for the 250 ISVs that are building on top of it, for all the custom codes that already been deployed on it by our customers, is just a radically new customer platform for the Internet of customers that is social, that is mobile, it is cloud, it connects everything and I use it every day myself and I will tell you the story, we are closing out our fiscal year, it was the end of January and I was invited by a friend of mine Walter Rob who was at Dreamforce [inaudible] to come down and be at a dinner in Arizona and you know everyone of course is enjoying their dinner and under the table I have my iPhone and I am able to see all my analytics and everything exactly how the quarter is closing; I don't think there is probably too many CEOs who have that power today, but it is something that everybody needs, because everybody wants to run their business on their phone and because Salesforce1 was built API first, because it can connect with anything and everything that runs on all these mobile devices completely transforms how you run your business, and I am thrilled to announce that we have more than 250 major ISVs who\u2019ve signed up to build Salesforce1 apps on our AppExchange and more than 30 Salesforce1 apps like Evernote and Dropbox, LinkedIn and HP are live on the AppExchange today that is really exciting. Our focus on the customer success, the adoption of our technology, making this technology market transitions, the movement to things like mobile, the movement to cloud, the movement to the social, the movement to the world - connected world that really have defined salesforce over last 15 years and is why you see today, the service cloud is the world's number one platform for customer service and support, and in this new Forrester Wave, which I look at these Forrester Wave as my guide to where the industry is going. Forrester is a phenomenal research organization. They really just changed the game when it comes to research in the technology industry. And I was with their CEO at The World Economic Forum. He keynoted and lad the kickoff panel for The World Economic Forum this year. We have really seen this incredible shift. In addition to our Service Cloud with Desk.com, we are bringing the small customer service concept to small business as well. That has been just an incredible addition to our momentum. The ExactTarget Marketing Cloud is the world's most powerful customer platform for one-to-one marketing, probably one of the really great accomplishments of the year, not just Salesforce1, but also the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud really defining that salesforce as the absolute leader in marketing today. And I mentioned Forrester, according to them, spending on digital marketing is going to double in five years to represent 30% of total marketing spend by 2017 and I think you have heard me say that I really think that it's imminent that CMO's are going to be spending more on technology than CIOs. Our flagship Sales Cloud is the world's number one platform for sales. Undisputed leader in CRM according to IDC another phenomenal research organization. In addition, we are consistently ranked as well in that area by Forrester as well. So really cool growth in sales, in service, in marketing which are huge growth areas for our industry and in our platform, the number one platform for developing next generation apps. Of course, we have got this incredible trifecta with force.com, Heroku and Fuel which is the ExactTarget platform, the ability to build these next-generation apps is why more than 1.5 million app developers are now in our platforms, up 50% from last year. Thousand ISVs developing on our platform, so much activity on the AppExchange, so many new mobile apps happening on Salesforce1, so many new marketing apps happening on Fuel, phenomenal productivity of developers with Heroku, especially these Ruby developers that love Heroku. And now with our next generation of service, marketing, sales and platform technologies these companies have all the tools they need to connect with their customers in these new ways. For example, Humana, who is one of the largest healthcare providers in the U.S. selected our Service Cloud in the quarter. They will get a service button, right inside their apps. We saw that also at Dreamforce. We saw Philips embed a service button right on their ultrasound machine. That's obviously a huge trend and everybody needs a Service Cloud and everybody needs a help button on their product. A physical button or a virtual button. In the quarter, we also strengthened our partnership with General Electric and their oil and gas group. They\u2019ve selected Service Cloud, ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and the platform to connect drilling and exploration equipment. Great, obviously. I am huge fan of General Electric and their CEO spoke at Dreamforce in the previous year. Maersk, one of the world's largest shipping and transportation companies selected our Service Cloud and Salesforce1 to bring all their customer product and supply chain together. So the pace at which these companies are embracing our next generation customer platform is phenomenal. Our progress with Salesforce1 is phenomenal. Our progress with the Marketing Cloud is phenomenal. Of course, we also brought in an incredible new distribution leader this year with Keith Block who has completely transformed how we are going to market. Taking those three things into consideration, I am absolutely thrilled to tell you that our service delivered more than 100 billion transactions in the quarter, up 49% from the year ago, an average of more than 1.7 billion transactions every single business day. Nothing speaks more to the value of salesforce than the actual usage of our products, their adoption, the speed, the reliability, the trust that our customers have come to expect and that customer success is also why I am also very pleased to announce that our attrition is down to the lowest level we have seen in the history of our company, so very exciting progress by our organization in that area. Look, it has been a spectacular year for salesforce, for our customers, our partners, our employees. We are looking forward to being the first enterprise cloud computing to achieve more than $5 billion in revenue this year. Before I close, I do want to let you know we are out on tour again. We have our Salesforce1 world tour. You may have come to see me, already kick that off in New York, you can come to Philadelphia on March 6, Pennsylvania Convention Center, you could come to Melbourne on March 26, Boston on April 2nd Chicago on April 24th, London on May 22nd, Amsterdam on the 27th Washington DC on May 29th, Atlanta on June 12, Toronto on June 25th, Paris on June 26th, I am going to be really busy this year, but we have got a huge message to get out there that the world is going social, it is going mobile going clouds and it's getting connected. It's an Internet of customers and behind every app, behind every device, behind everything, behind the Internet of everything is the customer and you can connect with that customer in a whole new way. You can have the same great success with your business that we are having with our business and that we wish that for all of our customers this has been a better year and I am absolutely thrilled to do that and I want to say Graham, your contribution with company success over past six years can't be overstated. It has been amazing and we are announcing your retirement on the call. You are going to be leaving the company a little bit more than a year from now in March of 2015 is something that you and I have talked about for some time, something that you wanted to do and I respect very much, because you just delivered phenomenal success for us and you are leaving our company in an incredibly great financial position and we are thrilled to have one more exciting year for you coming up. We will be sorry to see go, of course, and we have a world-class set of the financial professionals who worked closely with Graham, but Graham you are a phenomenal CFO, so thank you. Graham Smith : Okay. Thank you, Marc. Yes. We are all going to have 2015, so that is hopefully going to be just a fantastic year to finish my spell here at salesforce on. Before I get into that, let me just spend a little bit of time on the financial details. As Marc described, we had just a great year at salesforce. We closed the largest acquisition in our history. We launched our Salesforce1 platform and we added a number of industry-leading executives and our financial results this year were just outstanding with strong growth in revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow. We saw strength across both, our enterprise and commercial businesses and ExactTarget posted just a terrific finish to the year. In addition, we achieved a new milestone for customer success with the attrition dropping to record lows. I will give you little more detail on that in a second. Let me take you through the highlights for the quarter and the year, starting with revenue and EPS, so fourth quarter revenue was $1.145 billion, that's up from 37% over Q4 last year. If you excluding the FX headwind of approximately $3 million, Q4 revenue is actually up 38%. ExactTarget contributed approximately $96 million to revenue in the fourth quarter, which was higher than we expected. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.07. That was a $0.01 ahead of our expectations. Full year revenue was $4.071 billion. That is up 33% over fiscal '13, excluding an FX headwind of approximately $24 million, full year revenue was up 34% year-over-year. ExactTarget contributed approximately $194 million for the full year. Full year non-EPS was $0.35. Looking to Q4, year-over-year growth on a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 41% to $821 million. Revenue in Europe grew, also, 41% dollars 35% in constant currency to $210 million and revenue in Asia increased 12% in dollars and 24% in constant currency to $115 million. As mentioned dollar attrition in the fourth quarter, now that is excluding ExactTarget, it's all attritional, all of this is excluding ExactTarget get below 10%, so it's a high single-digit number of the post office in numerical low in our history company, so just a phasing result process finish the year. Turning to margins, fourth quarter fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 80% while our Q4 non-GAAP operating margin 6.9%. For the full year non-GAAP gross margin was also 80% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 89%. The reduction in our fully margins reflect the acquisition of ExactTarget, as well as the Oracle license agreements this time during the year. Our Q4 operating margin was further impacted by the occurrence of Dreamforce in November, whereas last year, Dreamforce was included in our Q3 results. Turning to hiring. We added more than 500 people in the fourth quarter and more than 3,500 new employees in the full fiscal year bringing our total headcount to just over 13,300. That is up 36% over last year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. That is down from approximately $1.8 billion last year. Accounts receivable was up 56% over last year to approximately $1.4 billion. Deferred revenue ended the year at $2.5 billion, up 35% over last year, including approximately $99 million related to ExactTarget. Excluding approximately $8 million of year-over-year FX headwind, deferred revenue increased 36%. On a sequential quarter basis, deferred revenue also had an FX headwind of approximately $8 million. Deferred revenue continued to benefit from the residual effects of multiyear invoices and from the continued shift toward annual billing. The combined benefit to deferred revenue in Q4 was approximately $75 million, up from $67 million sequentially, but down from $125 million in Q4 last year. As we had mentioned in Q3, given the declining impact from the shift to annual invoicing we initiated actually over two years ago now, this will be the last time, we provide the specific dollar impact on deferred revenue. However, we do plan to continue to provide the proportion of annual invoices issued in the quarter, excluding ExactTarget or approximately 83% of the value of all subscription of support related invoices that were issued with annual terms in Q4. That is compared with approximately 80% in Q4 last year. For ExactTarget, we are really pleased to see improvements in their mix of annual billing in Q4, which increased approximately 10 points over Q4 last year. So great progress there. Unbilled deferred revenue or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet was approximately $4.5 billion in Q4. That's an increase of approximately 29% over the last year. Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $271 million, down 4% over Q4 last year but actually above our expectations. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow was $875 million, up 19% over fiscal '13. So very strong result, when you consider that ExactTarget reduced our full year operating cash flow by more than $50 million during the year. CapEx was $70 million in the fourth quarter, up 38% year-over-year and $299 million for the full year. That's up 70% over last year. The year-over-year increase in CapEx was principally related to new office build outs and to a lesser extent ExactTarget. CapEx as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter was 6% unchanged from Q4 of last year. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $201 million in the fourth quarter, down 13% from last year. For the full year, free cash flow was $576 million, up 3% over fiscal '13. Turning to guidance. With our strong finish to fiscal 2014, we are expected to be raising our full year 2015 revenue outlook by $100 million to $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. And that gives a year-over-year revenue growth range of 29% to 30%. As you have heard from Marc and me, we are committed to improving non-GAAP margins. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of the $0.48 to $0.50 which implies an increase in our non-GAAP operating margin of 125 to 150 basis points. That assumes no significant M&A activity during the year. Our FY15 non-GAAP EPS also assumes that other income expense will continue to be a net expense and we are also assuming a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5%. We have made some changes to our non-GAAP tax forecasting. So let me just spend a minute to provide some color on that. In an effort to provide more consistency for guidance and reporting purposes, we will be, or I should begin using a fixed long-term non-GAAP predicted tax rate. In this case, 36.5%. This non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of nonrecurring and few specific items which can vary has varied in size and frequency. We will provide updates to this fixed rate annually or if a situation arises, of course, a significant change to our assumptions around the projected rate and continued by reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate in the detailed financials on the income tax effects and adjustments. For fiscal 2015, we expect operating cash flow to grow in mid-20s percent range and expect CapEx to be approximately 5% to 7%, in line with historical averages. Turning to Q1, we anticipate revenue in the range of $1.205 billion, to $1.21 billion, representing year-over-year growth 35% to 36%, expect non-EPS in the range of $0.09 to $0.10 and we expect Q1 deferred revenue growth in the low 30% range. During the first quarter, we are committed to retain in cash an aggregate principal balance of more than $280 million - conversions of our $575 million, 75 basis points senior notes, which we issued in January, just four-and-a-half year ago, due January 2015. We will likely see continued conversions during fiscal 2015, which will have an impact on our cash flow, as well as our financing cash flows and cash balance - financing cash flows throughout the year. As a reminder, all of the underlying assumptions for our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued today. Just before moving onto Q&A, I want to briefly address my future retirement that Marc talked about and we announced today. I could not be more convinced of salesforce.com's long-term success this year. We will celebrate our 15 anniversary and also our 10th year as a public company and am sure the next decade we will see salesforce.com growth to be one all the very largest software companies in the world and I really enjoy being part of the salesforce team for the past six years and I want to thank everybody who I had worked pretty close within salesforce panel advisors for helping me and the company be so successful. I look forward toward helping executive team with the CFO search process and obviously ensuring at very smooth transition takes 13 months. With that, we will open the call up for questions. Marc Benioff : Okay. Before we do that, I just want to come back and just say, Graham, thank you so much contribution of our success for the last six years. I really cannot overstate what you have done to the company and when you are with this retirement, you are going to leave an unbelievable legacy and I could not be more grateful, so thank you very much. Graham will be speaking next week at the Raymond James conference in Florida, so come and see Graham there and I will also be speaking at the Morgan Stanley conference here in San Francisco on Tuesday at 12 :00 pm to 12 :40 and I will be also joined by our Chief Accounting Officer. Joe Allanson, so please come and see me and Joe on Tuesday. All right, so with that I will turn it over to questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. Graham, if you are looking for career advice on what to do next, I highly recommend sales side equity research, but Marc, for you, can you talk more about the platform? Obviously you launched Salesforce1 with a mobile-centric approach to the market. Can you talk about some of the largest transactions that the company is pulling down, especially post Salesforce1 and how does the composition of your business (Inaudible) now vis-\u00e0-vis a healthy sales cloud and service cloud all relative to platform. Thank you very much. That's it from me. Marc Benioff : Well, I really appreciate that question, because it is really the heart of our strategy and something where I will spend a huge amount of my personal time this year getting salesforce1 right. You know Kash because you follow enterprise software so closely that I do not think there is any company whose enterprise software has moved as well as our has to the phone. Not only do we have a compelling mobile experience for our sales, service, and marketing clouds, but you can also build your own custom applications and deploy whatever you need to automate your company right onto the phone and as an ISV, you can also publish right into Salesforce1. It looks a lot like Facebook or Twitter does on an iPhone or an Android, but you are running your business and we are the first ones there. It's a huge competitive advantage for salesforce. It's a critical part of every sales cycle and we are moving into a phone world. I have said this on the call before, I strongly believe in the future of phone. I think phones are getting larger, faster and that your software has to run really well on the phone and ours does and perhaps only ours does. I think that's certainly true today. I don't know for how long that will be true for but I haven't seen anyone else really deliver a vision of enterprise software on the phone. On my phone, I can manage my feed, I manage all of my groups, all my employee information, my analytics and dashboards, my schedules and all the critical ISV apps as well that I use as well as custom apps and in the salesforce we have just some really great apps that we have deployed internally that are custom to us. Everything from managing our IT trouble, tickets, to even giving feedback on Salesforce1 to creating a task for our Customers For Life organization and it's the heart of everything we do. Now we have got a lot of horses in the race here and we are not a single product company anymore. We are a multi product company and we have got many products. Sales Cloud is certainly a phenomenal success story. It's a multibillion dollar product line. Service Cloud is incredible. Marketing Cloud, you know what those numbers are and you see that growth rate. Platform is right there. So we have got four incredible product lines and that's our focus today, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Marketing Cloud and the Platform and it is certainly our goal that each one of those are multibillion dollar products. That's our strategic direction and we are very focused on the strategies, the communication, the branding, the acquisitions, necessary to make sure that those four things are all multibillion dollar products. And there aren't that many companies in our industry who have been able to deliver that kind of multi product success, but we have and we have a clear strategy. Those are the four legs of our stool and we going to continue to execute on that and we believe that the customer is the heart of that strategy that we have everything necessary to connect with the customers in a whole new way and for these customers who are signing huge deals with us, with Salesforce1 as the core platform, with this Sales, Service, Marketing, Platform strategy, we have got the right story and we have the right solution. You can go to the App Store or Google Play Store right now and download it and use it and try it and you can see it. It's phenomenal. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys. Graham, it has been a pleasure working with you over the past six years. I am going to direct the question your way. The reduction in the attrition rate to under 10% is a great accomplishment. I think it talks a lot about business stickiness up, (inaudible) solution and increasing [strategic initiatives] [ph] solutions. But I think it also talks to the operational controls that you guys have put in place. The question after that is, do you think there is room for further improvement in that? As your product offerings get more strategic, then maybe from an operational perspective to get that attrition rate even lower? Graham Smith : Yes, thanks. We are obviously delighted to see that rate finally drop below 10%. It feels like I think it\u2019s 18 [inaudible]. It has been a long journey, but I think there is certainly still room for improvement. I think we\u2019ve talked in the past about the different programs we have, the early warning systems we have, the shift to enterprise and I think clearly bringing in the new leadership team with Keith Block and Tony Fernicola has certainly I think added to that just absolute credibility in the enterprise space. We frankly see very, very low attrition rates in enterprise. So for us, I think, it's a lot more about working on the big market and small business. I think you will see us continue to do that. I don't think you should expect \u2013 you\u2019ve seen the rate of decline has been slow and steady. And I think we will be working hard to basically keep that going over the next few years. It's impossible for me to give you a credible forecast, but I think it certainly can go lower over time if we keep working at it. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Mark Murphy : Yes. Thank you very much, Marc. When you consider how the marketing battle is developing and in particular as it relates to Adobe, how are you thinking about some of Adobe's competencies including content management and website analytics and also how do you think that Adobe and maybe Oracle feel about trying to take on salesforce's dominant leadership position in some of the areas that are going to be so synergistic to marketing and in other words, the Sales Cloud and the Service Clouds, do you think it is really feasible to try to become a system of engagement, if you do not own those assets? Marc Benioff : I love Adobe. I mean, I used their products since I was at Apple, when they created a postscript for the laser partners and those founders who still guide - that company are two of the most visionary people I think in the Industry and it is a great organization. They obviously participate in the marketing market and said do we and so do others because it is a big market. As we said, CMOs are going to be spending more on technology than CIOs and I don't think that this is not a zero-sum game. I think there is plenty of room for everybody and I have been investing as you probably know for the last two or three years now, because we believe so strongly in this and we have bought quite a few assets and tried a lot of different things, because we had to kind of find our way through this opportunity and we certainly have done that, and you can see we have bought [the premier] [ph] asset in the market last year. There is just no question we are number one in email marketing or number one in social listen in, we are number one in social publishing. We are number one in social advertising with social.com, which is the number one provider of services to advertisers on Facebook. I think it manages about 10% of Facebook's ad spend approximately and we just see a lot of potential going forward. One of the most exciting things with ExactTarget is the complete reconceptualization of their product into Journey Builder, and for those of you who have seen us now, demonstrate that it is a whole new vision for the marketer that's getting great response. As part of the ExactTarget acquisition, I think we also ended up with phenomenal asset called Pardot, which was actually a huge part of the quarter. It was one of the absolute fastest growing products we have ever seen. It's tightly integrated with our Sales Cloud and would be even more tightly integrated. It competes in that lead nurturing marketplace and that's another area. There's a lot of different places to play in marketing and I think that we are absolutely a player in marketing. I think one of our key assets, of course, is our large and extremely well-run direct sales organization and also that customers want that marketing cloud to be tightly integrated with what they are doing with sales and service, but I want to make it clear. I really think that there is plenty of room here for everybody. There is a lot of great companies out there. Adobe is a great company and we are going to be the number one marketing cloud in the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Graham, it's great working with you and maybe don't listen to cash-only career type. Quick one, this quarter, we saw a big increase in large deals. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? How much of that was Keith Block already and how much can we expect more from him? How much was the customers' buying into division of salesforce in terms of the day in force in terms of his employment the extent of product. so, just kind of had a discount at the beginning of the trend will continue. Thank you. Graham Smith : Thank you. I think if you look at large deals for salesforce, they do tend to be quite seasonal. It's the end of our fiscal year, our sales reps and architect, you know, their own compensation plans to accommodate in a large transaction at the fiscal year of the fiscal year. It's kind of the nature of the enterprise software business, and if you go back and look at we tend to reported at the end of every year the number of the large transactions in the fourth quarter that occur, I think you will see that we have just had really good symmetrical growth of our large transactions, but also our small and medium transactions as well. We run a full portfolio of business on full portfolio of geographies. There are large enterprises are important, the small business is important, the medium business is important. We have a complex distribution organization which is why we are so fortunate this year to attract a great leader, Keith Block, to run that for us. He is also a member of our Board of Directors and he has done a great job. He has hired a great management team and we know we couldn't be better positioned for continued excellence in distribution. Graham Smith : And Raimo, just a reminder on the numbers. So we reported more than 200 seven and eight digit transactions this quarter. Q4 a year ago was over 150. So that more or less mirrors that growth irate of 30% plus range. So as Marc says, very symmetric growth. Marc Benioff : And I think that that's really the most important thing because as the CEO, I want all aspects of the business to be growing with equanimity and that we don't leave any one segment or any one geography behind because the strength of the company and the reason why we see salesforce delivering a 37% growth opportunity here, is because we manage that full portfolio of revenue. We talked about that on a number of calls, but we have done that very well and that's a key part of our strategy. I don't like to overemphasize any one area, but in the enterprise, like I said, I don't know any other company that got close to more than 200 transactions in the seven and eight digit category in customer relationship management enterprise software this quarter or any quarter before this. Operator : Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. Congratulations and yes, Graham I echo everyone's thoughts and you will definitely be missed. My question, Marc, is, I guess I have two questions, one for Marc and one for Graham. Marc, how do you think about the integration of your Marketing Cloud asset and how important will the ultimate integration of these assets be to further inflecting the growth that you are seeing in that cloud to get to the vision that you are talking about a few years down the road? Then I have got a follow-up for Graham. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks, Heather. As usually, I think that your question is actually something that is very relevant for where we are right now and I will tell you exactly how I think about this. You know, the marketing area, some parts need to be very deeply integrated and some parts can be loosely coupled. In the deeply integrated area, lead nurturing for example, with Pardot, you go to pardot.com and you look at the website, you look at the integration, that we have done so far. I think between now and Dreamforce, you will see an extremely deep integration between salesforce and Pardot. We continue to scale that business and grow it and make sure that it's integrated extremely deep into our core. With ExactTarget, that unit is a more loosely coupled because many of the key areas that it focuses on do not need to be as deeply integrated as the Pardot asset. Still we can have shared contacts. We can integrate our Service Cloud. We can bring in our consoles, but at the end of the day, I believe that those marketers are going to want a control panel to build and run their business, and I believe that that's going to look a lot like ExactTarget. You can see how we have already integrated salesforce core services and salesforce platform with Journey Builder. You are going to see more things like that. This is just a very, very exciting time for the marketers. You won't hear me say enough that I think we have the premier asset, premier platform and you are going to continue to see some real excellence out of ExactTarget. Heather Bellini : Okay, great, and just a follow-up for Graham. Graham, I might have missed this but could you give what exact type of target you gave deferred for the quarter? Graham Smith : Yes, it was $99 million. Right, $99 million. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Ross MacMillan : Thanks a lot, and Graham congratulations on your private salesforce and all the very best for what you do ultimately leave the company. Marc, I had a question also on platform, which I guess is with the success you are seeing with Salesforce1, does that change your view on the timeframe in which the platform could get to $1 billion, where they are and does it change your view on the platform addressable market? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, I think Salesforce1 is accelerator on platform, I also think that Heroku here was accelerator on the platform I think Fuel you from ExactTarget is accelerator platform that these three things together really make a phenomenal platform. I could not be more excited with Salesforce1 out how it is going for customers. As I said, our own success with that inside the company speaks to what it can do for our customers, to our ability to compete in the market, differentiate ourselves, to make our customer successful in the phone environment. We are all-in our iOS, we are all-in on android. It's great on phones, it's great on tablets and I know that it. It has got a lot of upside if you have not followed the success of Heroku in the Ruby's world, since we acquired assets, it has been a rocket ship and that continues to be a huge part of our message to developers, especially in building interaction applications. We saw some great stories, especially in the enterprise this quarter with Heroku. One very large retailer, I don't want to get into the details, because I don't know if we have approval to use their name or not. Mean it, in a crisis situation to rapidly deploy a very large application and they built and deployed it Heroku and it was a huge success for them. I can tell you with Fuel, that one of the real assets of ExactTarget, is that it is not just an app, but it's a platform and they very much have our strategies integrated with lot of key iOS apps and it is that trifecta Salesforce1, Fuel, and Heroku you just give us three tremendous platform assets to really go after any casting building the custom capability for customer. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Graham, congrats on a great run. Marc, Keith spoke at Dreamforce about the transition to vertical engagement with customers and I know earlier you had mentioned you didn't want to go more vertical product, but can you just talk about this progression and the potential change in strategy and how do you think this impacts your engagement in the field with customers? Graham Smith : Well, I think it is a very important our strategy. It is actually strategy that we have executed in the company, but Keith is definitely emphasizing and customers by segment want more value from us and want us to be able to speak to them in their language to build a bring value to them to bring systems integrators and I think a great story is our tremendous success in the pharmaceutical area with Depot. You could see that's been very much a one of our key focuses, making sure that we have dominant position in pharmaceutical, we have a key ISV that we work with their and it has been a great story talk to big pharmaceutical companies, well that's a model for us for other industries. We want to align ISVs, we won align marketing, branding, we want to bring in the other key resources so that we can the great success by vertical. I think, Keith has a vision and clarity around that. That's even bigger than we had before he came here and we are letting him run that with all of his gusto. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick - Macquarie. Brad Zelnick : Thank you very much. Graham, not only would I be an outlier if I didn't echo the sentiment of my peers, but I truly mean it and I wish you the best and congratulations on your achievements. Marc, question is for you. Can you talk about what you are doing with Edge, Spring and specifically when it comes to Big Data and in-memory analytics, how much of an opportunity is there to embed these capabilities into your existing clouds versus a separate, distinct analytics cloud. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks for that question because I am a huge believer in Big Data. I am a huge believer in analytics and reporting, dashboards. You will see with salesforce that probably is the most undercovered, underreported story at Dreamforce is what we delivered in analytics and reporting. A lot of that was some of these great new leaders that we acquired this year and if you go and take a look at what we to do for customers today with our new next-generation reporting engine, next-generation dashboards, I don't think there is a company that delivers more dashboards and more reports and more analytics to customers every day than salesforce. I haven't seen it. I know that in my own cases, I have said in my story of January 31, I am in Arizona, I am at a dinner. It's a great dinner. But I wanted to know how the quarter is doing and I am just able to look down and glance at my phone and I got incredible real-time analytics happening and dashboards and reports and I know exactly what's happening with the quarter. I think every CEO, every head of sales, every head of service, every head of marketing, manager, mid- manager needs that same capability and we are delivering that. In a social world, it shows up in my feed. In a mobile world, it shows up in my phone. In a cloud world, it shows up deeply integrated with our services. We are definitely evaluating and looking at all the places that we can put those analytics and dashboards and customers have come to us and said that there is more for us to do which is why we have made these investments, and I think that if you go and look at what you have already delivered, you would be hugely surprised and you will see the emergence of some great new capabilities. Operator : Your next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities Brendan Barnicle : Thanks so much. Marc, I wanted to ask a follow-up to Brent Thill's question. As you move more into the verticals in the salesforce, how do you make sure that you not perceived as some sort of threat to the next generation of Veeva's in vertical specific ended that might want to build on the platform? Marc Benioff : Well, I really appreciate that, when there is an ISV or there is someone building on our platform, we want to invest in them and partner with them. We have been a very partner friendly organization. We have a huge investment fund. I think it's probably one of the largest investment funds in the industry. We don't talk about it or brand it, but I can tell you that we invest and we have had great returns. I just reviewed our investment fund returns. We invest in some cloud computing companies that are building on salesforce and our platform. And we want to help these ISVs be successful. We want to give them the seed capital. We want to give them growth capital. We want to help them with distribution relationships. We want to help them with their marketing, with their branding. We want to partner closely with them. And we have got some great success stories. You mentioned Veeva. I am sure you know ServiceMax. I am sure you know Kenandy. I am sure you know FinancialForce. I mean you go to the AppExchange and look under native and look at all the native apps that are there and you will see that we are investing in those companies and one of the reasons they are getting growth is we are aligning to make them successful. We want those native app providers to be successful. And we want to partner with them. We want them to grow and be a core part of our vertical strategy, absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow : Hi. Congrats guys on another fabulous quarter. Again, Mark, just that you said behind any tweet there is customer, behind any great CEO there is a great CFO. So congrats on you guys' partnership, at least another year of it. But my question is, Marc, on the Service Cloud. A lot of time you have spent on marketing and platform. I wondered if you can touch on just what you are seeing there in terms of trends across both Service Cloud actually and Desk.com? And just what do you think competitively out there? Thanks. Marc Benioff : I think customer service is absolutely one of the most exciting areas. I mean it has been a big investment area for us. We believe that there is huge opportunity in the enterprise, huge opportunity to mid-market, huge opportunity in the small-market. We have Desk.com, which if you have not seen the new version of Desk that we just released a few weeks ago, it's doing incredibly well and we are continuing to invest in the success of Desk.com, which was an acquisition that we made all over year ago and we also have our Service Cloud, which was an acquisition that we did about five years ago, the leader of that company called InStranet, that was the based in Paris is now the head of our product organization, Alex Dayon, and he has done a phenomenal job building that product. I am very excited about service, but you know I love all of my children. I love the Sales Cloud, I love the Service Cloud, I love the marketing cloud, and I love the Platform, and I love all of our partners too, so all of ISVs, I would say, I guess that would be the fifth thing fifth thing I probably do not talk about that enough. Graham Smith : Christie, we have time for one more question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Samad Samana with FBR. Samad Samana : Hi. Good afternoon. Marc, Japan had the best time constant currency quarter in a while after struggling in the prior three quarters. Were there any particular strategy changes that drove the improvement or was it just a better demand environment and in that region? Then as a follow-up to that, how penetrated is the core sales cloud outside of the United States? Marc Benioff : Yes. Well, I think that, I will answer part of this and then I will turn it over to Graham. I really think international remains a huge upside opportunity for salesforce. We have invested very heavily in the United States market, which was a very good decision because it is the mega market for enterprise software. We really only do business in a few countries, we do business in the United States, in Canada, in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, all which also performed really well this Europe, a great year, we do business in Japan. That has been a great story for us. We just moved into our new headquarters in Japan invited by the government to move into the JP tower the Japan Post our which is a brand new our Marunouchi district and we do business in Australia and that is basically it, so we have a lot more opportunity internationally, but so we have a lot of opportunity in a lot of areas, so every time a dollar comes up for investment, we debate it very closely here where are we going to put it, internationally, in a city, in the country, in a product, because in our industry there is a lot of opportunity for growth and we have been very fortunate to place those dollars correctly and you saw a great outcome here on this fiscal year delivering a 37% growth quarter and 33% a year. Then the question is, okay, how much more are we going to put in all these various first pieces. Graham Smith : Yes. Remind people that obviously Asia-Pac, not just Japan, it's Japan and Asia and Australia and New Zealand and certainly we saw a little better sort of executions in Japan and Australia in the fourth quarter, so I think that is really what's helped lift that constant currency growth really good in the fourth quarter. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, thank you very much. Again, I want to just come back before we do end this call. I want to just come back to Graham and thank you again for your great contribution with company for last six years. We are looking forward to working with you for the next 13 months, so, I know you are not going anywhere. Graham Smith : I am not going anywhere. Marc Benioff : We want to signal it now, so that we have an orderly transition of power. Many of you followed the salesforce, know that Graham was not our first few Chief Financial Officer. He is our third and he has absolutely done a phenomenal job and as we have gone through the CFO transitions before, we know that investors want to have a lot of heads up and transparency into the process, so that is why I am so thrilled to be able to talk about this today with Graham. Graham Smith : Yes, Marc. It's obviously been amazing experiences as I stated. I would like to make sure everybody I am going to be working just as other over the next 13 months to make sure that everything goes right. Marc Benioff : I will be making sure that as well, so don't worry about that. I want to thank everyone for all their support for this fiscal year. We will look forward to seeing you next week at the Raymond James conference or at the Morgan Stanley conference. And please come on the road with us. We have got a great tour coming up. And come and see us in Philly, come and see us in Melbourne of Boston, Chicago, London, Amsterdam and DC, Atlanta, Toronto and Paris. We have got many more that coming. Come and meet our customers, our partners. Come and see Salesforce1 in action and get ready for Dreamforce, because the Dreamforce is coming in October, only a few short months away, the world's largest and most important technology show in the world of cloud computing, social and mobile and enterprise software coming back to San Francisco and we are going to have another incredible Dreamforce this year as well. So thanks everybody, and I will see you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So with that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Okay, hey thanks so much John, I really appreciate it and I am absolutely delighted to be with you once again and so have been over 15 years of customer success here at salesforce.com. This quarter was a very important birthday for us, it gave us an opportunity to look back, and how we\u2019ve helped shape this new world of enterprise software. How we\u2019ve grown to be the world\u2019s largest CRM company and the world\u2019s largest provider of enterprise cloud computing and as you can see from these results the fastest growing top-10 software company in the world today. All in just 15 short years. It\u2019s been an exceptional journey and we\u2019re very grateful to all of you who\u2019ve been with us through this incredible decade and a half. The new world of enterprise software the world is in the cloud it\u2019s a world of mobile, it\u2019s a world of social and it\u2019s a world that\u2019s connected. Our customers are connecting with their customers in entirely new ways. They\u2019re consistently turning the companies like salesforce to make this customer connection. And this has driven this incredible business for us. Whether you are looking for solutions for sales, for service, for marketing, for engagement, or building custom apps, salesforce has consistently delivered the world\u2019s best customer platform. And I\u2019m proud of our employees, our customers and partners and what they\u2019ve accomplished over the last 15 years and I\u2019m looking forward to our very bright future. We\u2019re delighted this quarter to be once again chosen by Fortune magazine as the world\u2019s most admired software company for the second year in a row. An incredible accomplishment, and earlier this year salesforce was recognized by Fortune as the world\u2019s seventh place to work, seventh best place to work and we were Forbes magazine most innovative company in the world three years in a row. And through our pioneering 111 model, we\u2019ve now delivered more than 700,000 hours of community service, a little bit more than $50 million in grants, and are running more than 20,000 non-profit organizations in our service-for-free. Through all of this, through all of these accomplishments nothing is more important to us than the trust and success of our customers. This deep commitment to our customers and their success is why salesforce delivered these exceptional results especially now in this first quarter. Revenue grew by 37% from a year ago to more than 1.2 billion, pretty incredible. Deferred revenue grew by 34% year-over-year to more than 2.3 billion. Operating cash flow grew by 67% from year ago to more than 470 million. And the dollar value book business on and off the balance sheet grew by 34% from last year to 7.1 billion. And while we delivered world class growth we also grew operating margins sequentially this quarter which is why we\u2019re able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.11 exceeding our guidance. And we\u2019ll deliver 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement this year. Given our strong financial results and pipeline of new business, we\u2019re once again raising our full fiscal year 2015 guidance by 40 million to reach 5.34 billion. With billions of users all over the world now using cloud services, mobile devices and software networks the technology world has deeply changed. And salesforce continues to lead this change in enterprise software. Today, I run my business from my phone. I could never have imagined that just a few years ago. I don\u2019t need a PC, a laptop, a desktop, to connect with my customers, employees or partners. I just need my phone. And that certainly isn\u2019t where software was a decade ago.  At salesforce we go with flow of our services, under the new Salesforce1 Platform giving our customers the ability to use phones, tablet PCs or whatever they choose to manage and share all of their customer information. The Salesforce1 Platform has far exceeded our wildest dreams and has accelerated the success of our customers, our ISDs, our developers, our administrators, and their ability to be successful in this new world. And it\u2019s why our flagship Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, our ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and our platforms are all leaders in the categories and growing faster than their competition. Our Sales Cloud is once again the undisputed leader in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Salesforce Automation in fact we extended our lead this last year according to Gartner, our multichannel sales now larger than the three next competitors combined. Service Cloud is the clear leader in both vision and execution in Gartner\u2019s most recent Magic Quadrant for Customer Service and with Salesforce1 Platform we are bringing our world class customer service solutions to small businesses as well as to enterprises.  The ExactTarget Marketing Cloud doubled its market share, according to the recent Gartner report adding more share than any other top-10 marketing vendor. And the Salesforce1 Platform is the only solution rated by Forrester as a leader in every single platform category and recognized leader in Gartner\u2019s first ever Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Platforms. Now I am delighted to welcome our Vice Chairmen and President, Keith Block, to the earnings call and I would like to ask Keith to introduce himself, but also to give me a review of the quarter\u2019s results. We are very fortunate to bring in Keith over a year ago now. He is a member of our Board and runs our distribution organization which represents more than half of our inflows. Keith? Keith Block : Hi. Thanks Marc, it\u2019s great to be here and I have to say that salesforce is an absolutely incredible Company. Over the past year I have spent a great deal of time speaking with customers and partners all around the world, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly consistent, it\u2019s been about great vision, it\u2019s been about great products, and it\u2019s been about great people. And it\u2019s really rare to find a Company whose customers and partners, has such a high degree of respect and admiration on a consistent basis. And the great news is, our customers and our partners, they want more from us. They want us to go deeper with them, they want us to have a more strategic relationship, they want us to help them innovatively transform their business models, they want us to help them scale their business for the future, and ultimately at the end of the day they want us to be their trusted advisor on their journey to connect with customers in entirely new ways. And this applies to every customer, from the smallest to the largest enterprises in the world. Now in the quarter we had some terrific success with companies of all sizes and across all industries, everywhere in the world, and I would like to just share a few thoughts with you. For example, we entered into a new relationship with Manulife, one of the world\u2019s largest insurance and financial services providers. They selected the Service Cloud to create a single customer engagement platform and delivered personalized service across all of their life insurance wealth management and investment products, just a terrific story. Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance, one of the oldest and largest insurance in Japan, we\u2019re thrilled to have that brand as part of our family. They selected salesforce in the quarter and this will be the first enterprise-wide cloud implementation in Japan\u2019s life insurance industry, absolutely excited about this. They selected our Service Cloud that allow agents to close deals and service customers right from their phones and they are also building out their next generation apps on Salesforce1, very-very exciting. And in communications and media, Sky Italia selected Service Cloud, the Salesforce1 Platform, Salesforce communities, all of which for an engine for the company\u2019s B2C communications business from call centers to self-service department channels. In healthcare, another great brand that fit us started sales transformation with our Sales Cloud and in the quarter they expanded with ExactTarget Marketing Cloud delivering to the power of social and connect directly with millions of people shopping for insurance. Many-many-many stories that we can go on to, but again some terrific brands and terrific story and I certainly want to congratulate the team for their outstanding accomplishments in Q1 and I also want to thank our customers and our partners for their continued commitment to our collective success and features, and I do want to say again that I\u2019m absolutely thrilled to be part of this just outstanding organization. So with that I will turn the call over to Graham. Graham Smith :  Thanks Keith. And we started fiscal 2015 as you have heard with a really strong first quarter, growing revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow at more than 30% and coming in ahead of our EPS guidance. We are well positioned to deliver another year of industry-leading growth. Let me take you through the financial highlights of our first quarter starting with the income statement. First quarter revenue was $1.23 billion, that\u2019s an increase of 37% and which did include an FX benefit of approximately $6 million. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.11. On a regional basis revenue in the Americas grew 39% to $876 million, revenue in Europe grew 42% in dollars and 35% in constant currency to $231 million and revenue in Asia Pacific increased 21% in dollars and 26% in constant currency to $120 million, that\u2019s a nice uptick in growth after some of our recent quarters. In Asia-Pac dollar attrition continued its slow and steady decline for the 19th consecutive quarter and remains in the high single-digits percentage range. Our non-GAAP growth and operating margins continued to reflect the acquisition of ExactTarget last year, gross margins was 79.5% in Q1 that\u2019s down 70 basis points from Q1 last year and non-GAAP operating margin was 9.7% which was down 80 basis points from Q1 last year, but actually up 280 basis points sequentially. In the first quarter we added more than 900 people that\u2019s our most significant organic hiring quarter ever, and brings our total headcount at the end of the quarter to just over 14,200 that\u2019s up 38% over Q1 last year. Turning to balance sheet we ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter we paid approximately $280 million in principle related to conversions of our senior notes that are due in January 2015. This amount was partially offset by an approximately $30 million deposit we received for the potential sale of four of our eight lots we owned in Mission Bay. Deferred revenue ended the quarter up more than $2.3 billion up 34% over the last year; excluding approximately 13 million of year-over-year FX benefit deferred revenue increased 33%. On a sequential quarter basis deferred revenue also had an FX benefit of approximately $9 million. We expect Q2 deferred revenue to be approximately flat sequentially from Q1. Approximately 68% of the value of all subscription and support related invoices and that includes ExactTarget were issued with annual terms in Q1 compared with approximately 68% Q1 last year. Keep in mind however that our billing frequency percentage last year did not include ExactTarget, if you exclude ExactTarget from this close calculation we saw a year-over-year increase in the proportion of invoices issued with annual terms but is consistent with the fiscal 2014 average that was around 5 percentage points improvement. Unbilled deferred revenue or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet was approximately $4.8 billion in Q1, that\u2019s an increase of 33% over last year. Turning to cash flow, we have an outstanding start for the year as we talked about for sometime Q4 has historically always been our largest new business quarter and as a result have also become our largest renewals quarter. The seasonality of our invoicing has become more pronounced each year because of the compounding effects of the new business seasonality. The Q4 is our largest invoicing quarter it follows the Q1 has become our largest collections and operation cash flow quarter. So in the first quarter operating cash flow was $473 million that\u2019s up 67% over the last year. We anticipate our second quarter operating cash flow growth to be lower at approximately 10% year-over-year growth and continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to grow in the mid 20s percentage range year-over-year that we talked about on the call in February. CapEx was $60 million in the first quarter up 11% year-on-year, CapEx as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter was 5% that\u2019s down from 6% in Q1 last year and we continue to expect our full year CapEx to be in the range of 5% to 7% of revenue. Free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx was $413 million in the first quarter, that\u2019s up 80% from last year. Turning to guidance with our solid results in the first quarter, we\u2019re delighted to be raising our full fiscal 2015 revenue outlook by $40 million that\u2019s new range of $5.3 billion to $5.34 billion for year-over-year revenue growth of 30% to 31%. We\u2019re raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the Q1 beef and now expect it to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51. And as Marc mentioned we are still committed to increasing our full year non-GAAP operating margins by 125 to 150 basis points. But clearly that assumes no significant M&A activity during the year. FY15 non-GAAP EPS also assumes that other income expenses will continue to be a net expense and assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5%. For Q2 we anticipate revenue in the range of $1.285 billion to $1.29 billion representing year-over-year growth of approximately 34% to 35% and we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.11 to $0.12. And as a reminder all of the underlying assumptions for our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance is on complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier today. So to close Q4 and a great start for the year to salesforce, a really good solid execution across the business sets us up well to deliver another year of amazing industry-leading growth. So with that, we\u2019ll open the call up for questions. Question: and: Operator : (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Jason Maynard. Jason Maynard : Good afternoon guys and congratulations on the quarter. I have a question that\u2019s probably for Marc and I would assume maybe for Keith as well. I\u2019d love to get your perspective when you look out over the next 12 months really kind of two parts here one is do you believe you are fully penetrated in sales automation and that the majority of the growth or the incremental growth is going to come from up-selling the Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud and Platform? And then maybe Keith on the distribution side, what do you need to do to turn some of your accounts that maybe you\u2019re spending a couple of million dollars with you today into accounts that maybe can spend upwards of $10 million a year with you on a recurring basis? Thanks. Wells Fargo Securities : Good afternoon guys and congratulations on the quarter. I have a question that\u2019s probably for Marc and I would assume maybe for Keith as well. I\u2019d love to get your perspective when you look out over the next 12 months really kind of two parts here one is do you believe you are fully penetrated in sales automation and that the majority of the growth or the incremental growth is going to come from up-selling the Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud and Platform? And then maybe Keith on the distribution side, what do you need to do to turn some of your accounts that maybe you\u2019re spending a couple of million dollars with you today into accounts that maybe can spend upwards of $10 million a year with you on a recurring basis? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, I think you have to keep all this in perspective where -- obviously our namesake Sales Cloud product is just a huge part of our Company and it will continue to be a huge part of our Company for the foreseeable future. And we have a lot of other great growth drivers in the Company as well especially with our Service Cloud and our Marketing Cloud and our Platform and also our new engagement capabilities and community\u2019s capabilities. But the sales product remains to be such a dominate part of the Company\u2019s success that there is no doubt that future growth will also be driven significantly by it. Keith Block : Yes Jason, [indiscernible] so a couple of things, I think there is still significant opportunity across all of our cloud certainly the Sales Cloud is our flagship, but as you know we have put in place multi-prong strategy to really change the relationship that we have with our customers and those are customers whether it\u2019s in the SMD space or whether it\u2019s in the enterprise space and it really starts with our focus on industries. One of the theses of feedback that I have heard over and over again from the customer base is how important it is to speak the language of industry and to build that trust based relationship and solve the business problems around an industry. So we have obviously launched our industry business unit to help assemble those solutions while ultimately will give us the opportunity to gain a lot more line share and having more strategic relationships with these customers. We have also launched the strong initiative around our partners both our SI and the ISV ecosystem which is very-very important with our strategy and very important with our customers. We\u2019re getting incredible traction across all three of those of funds as well as focusing on international expansion. So when you really coupled the industry and partners together, it really raises our relevance within these accounts which will give the opportunity to continue drive momentum there. Graham Smith : And Jason, this is Graham, just one more thing I have to add. I think one of the things we\u2019ve seen over the last few years is the continued underestimation of the market sizes I think directionally clearly we\u2019ve shown huge increase in share velocity use and consistent gains in shares, but I think the other exciting thing is then the trend all constant optimization of the market size. So I think that obviously gives us more confidence around continued growth with the Sales Cloud. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund. Rick Sherlund : Yes, hi, thanks. Two questions first Keith, actually, both for Keith. Can you talk about the changes you\u2019ve made to the sales organization? And did it have any impact in Q1 so did you do well despite changes if you could kind of talk about that a bit? And also I think we\u2019re all waiting for nine figure deals is that realistic and is there -- are there deals of that magnitude in the pipeline we should look forward to over the balance of this year? Nomura Securities : Yes, hi, thanks. Two questions first Keith, actually, both for Keith. Can you talk about the changes you\u2019ve made to the sales organization? And did it have any impact in Q1 so did you do well despite changes if you could kind of talk about that a bit? And also I think we\u2019re all waiting for nine figure deals is that realistic and is there -- are there deals of that magnitude in the pipeline we should look forward to over the balance of this year? Keith Block : Hi, Rick. Thanks for the question. So a couple of things the question has before. There were no major reorganizations. We put strategy in place about six months ago around our industry growth plan and our partners and international stands and focus on continuation around the tracking retaining the best talent in the industry our most strategic accounts in specialized sales and really solving business problems as a person just necessarily selling products. And since those things have been in play for awhile, it really mitigated any sort of risk around reorganization that I think most people always are worried about when you start the fiscal year. So these plans were put a little bit while ago and we continue to see traction. We actually saw traction in the second half of the year and we certainly saw that traction continue and the momentum continue Q1. Listen as far as large deal sizes go, I think the net-net of this thing as we continue to execute and we did a terrific job, and I am very proud of the team and the Company for how we executed in Q1 is only natural to assume that our relationships with these customers will become more meaningful and more strategic overtime and that will just translate into continue growth and we\u2019re excited about it. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill. Brent Thill : Thanks. For Marc, may be if you could just talk a little bit about Salesforce1 platform, it seems like there is a lot of really new interesting applications are being built that require the rest of the platform to be deployed to the helpers, if you will, on reinforcing the whole enterprise build out. Can you just give us a sense of what you are seeing from some of the larger commitments on the platform? UBS: Thanks. For Marc, may be if you could just talk a little bit about Salesforce1 platform, it seems like there is a lot of really new interesting applications are being built that require the rest of the platform to be deployed to the helpers, if you will, on reinforcing the whole enterprise build out. Can you just give us a sense of what you are seeing from some of the larger commitments on the platform? Marc Benioff :  Well, thanks for that question. We have made a huge investment on the Salesforce1 platform over the last couple of years and so many customers now have deployed it. And as a user myself, I can tell you how dramatically changed out how I work, as I mentioned I work in parallel with my phone but more than that I think it\u2019s, because we completely re-architected our product on a whole family of APIs and delivered a full range of services, it\u2019s really opened up the opportunity for our customers to build applications like that we have never really thought they were going to build before. One of the applications that I saw that got deployed this quarter was with Home Depot where they rolled out this amazing new, How-To application. And right on that, you got to right on homedepot.com, you will see our platform poking through where it gives them the ability to have deep engagement with all of their customers who are building and cloud sourcing and interacting with Home Depot employees and all in real-time and it\u2019s really all possible by the platform. In addition to that we continue to see really strong support from the ISV community and if you go to the AppExchange, you will see more applications available for Salesforce1 than ever before and some of them are just incredibly well reviewed. I mean you will see hundreds or in some cases thousands of reviews around these apps and these are enterprise apps. I don\u2019t think there is another AppExchange or app store in the industry like that and so many new apps emerging for Salesforce1. The combination of this just gives us a tremendous competitive advantage with our customers and I will tell you why. A lot of our competitors, it\u2019s not that they haven\u2019t move to the phone, they have moved into cloud and here we are, we have a solution that\u2019s not only runs great as a service, as cloud service, running of billions of transactions every single day, two, that service is available in whatever device you are using. And three, it runs the way the any other cell-phone network would work like a Facebook or Twitter but it\u2019s your own private company network or with your partners or with customers. And then finally, we are seeing now where companies can take all of this and build their own apps well that\u2019s really exceeded our, exceeded what could happen. So, we are very excited and we are feeling great about where Salesforce1 is and I really think it\u2019s given us this huge leg-up against the competition. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. Marc, the off balance sheet backlog growth rate is just simply stunning. And I am curious if you could talk to which particular products the portfolio are driving that superb strength? And also with respect to Salesforce1, can you specifically talk about how the industry solution\u2019s strategy in the six verticals are going to be differentiated and facilitated with Salesforce1 in particular? Thank you very much.  BofA/ Merrill Lynch : Hi, thank you very much. Marc, the off balance sheet backlog growth rate is just simply stunning. And I am curious if you could talk to which particular products the portfolio are driving that superb strength? And also with respect to Salesforce1, can you specifically talk about how the industry solution\u2019s strategy in the six verticals are going to be differentiated and facilitated with Salesforce1 in particular? Thank you very much. Graham Smith : Hi, Kash, great to see you, so, let me just talk a little bit about the industry strategy and Salesforce1, I think Marc have touched on it. We are incredibly excited about the adoption of Salesforce 1 and how our ISV community is responding to it. And specific to industry, you may have seen a press release that we issued the other day with Deloitte and our partnership with Deloitte in financial services around financial services solutions, all built on our platform. And so there is enormous enthusiasm for the Salesforce1, our ISV community is rallying for the cause and that obviously is an integral part of our strategy. The other thing that I think is important to understand here is that as we continue our transformation, one of the things that we are trying to accomplish here is to solve business problems for our customers. Whereas traditionally we will go to market by product and we will obviously continue to do that. I think the important thing is to listen to our customers and bring a point of view around an industry solution, again the example would be what we did, the press release that we did with Deloitte. And when you sale solution, you bring multiple clouds, so it\u2019s not necessarily one cloud or two cloud, it\u2019s a multi-cloud solution and that is certainly the momentum that we enjoyed over Q3 and Q4 and certainly saw that carry over in Q1 and that multi-cloud solution approach is really paying off for us and it looks very, very strong for us in the future. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray : Marc, your counselors and partners sound very excited about a product called Communities that for some reason it doesn\u2019t seem to be as widely recognized in the investment community. And we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s capable of going wall to wall and really touching every employee in an organization. Could you walk us through what is happening under the radar with Communities and maybe any comment on how strategically significant the offering can be? Marc Benioff : Yes, I\u2019d really be delighted to, and we announced this product at Dreamforce and we now have started rolling it out. I just mentioned it in my comments about Home Depot for example, which is a core part of the platform they\u2019ve rolled out which is Communities. But imagine if you will that I am using my phone, like I do, and I\u2019m using Salesforce1 and I'm going through my social network and I\u2019m reviewing what\u2019s happening with employees, what\u2019s happening on my deals, customer service issues, quotes, and my feed is going by and able to kind of roll between different apps that I am using. Maybe I\u2019m issuing a request, maybe I am giving an employee appraise. All of this is happening inside Salesforce1. Now all of the sudden right inside the feed something appears and it says well, did you know that Frank Blake at Home Depot just commented on the product that you\u2019re working on. And what has happened is, is that externally on my website I\u2019m in a community of all of my customers. Now you could go -- you could see this right now if you go to I think success.salesforce.com is our community site. So if you go to success.salesforce.com, you will see what Communities looks like and you will see how we\u2019ve deployed Communities.  So if there\u2019s customers that I\u2019m following, if there is a product I\u2019m following, events I\u2019m following, whatever I\u2019m working on and now I\u2019m a customer. I come in this site. I\u2019m automatically integrated to the Salesforce employees. And honestly I don\u2019t know a customer who doesn\u2019t need this, whether its partner communities, whether it\u2019s for customer service, whether and even this is for employee communities and so we\u2019re very excited and this is in the category of engagement. So today it can also work this product the kind of tagline is Salesforce, sales service market to feed and you really see it evolve to be sales service market and engage. And the reason why is because of exactly we are saying -- it has been a tremendous success for us. We continue to see all customers to be very excited with this. This all started with Chatter if you remember that. That was kind of the brand. Now we\u2019ve kind of dropped the brand Chatter and it\u2019s all Salesforce1 now because it\u2019s also deeply integrated into our platform. You can\u2019t separate our core collaboration capabilities from our sales service or marketing platform applications and services. So that\u2019s where we are right now. It\u2019s very exciting. You will see more Dreamforce and you\u2019re going to see us really continue to focus and expand this. I did want to make one key point, which is that this is not some separate app. This is really a core part of our platform and that we\u2019ve worked very, very hard to make sure that these are core platform services and the collaboration is at the very heart of who we are at Salesforce. Hope that answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs : I had two questions, one for Marc and one for Keith. I guess Keith to start out with you, you mentioned the vertical solutions and this business problems that you are trying to solve as a result of your verticalization. How do we think about how long it takes for you to really take your stride to serve the customers in the way that you\u2019re thinking about it? And kind of back to Rick\u2019s question, how do we think about how deal sizes scale as you become that trusted solution provider if you use your past history as a guide? And then the question I have for Marc just in regards to marketing cloud, a lot of the customers we talk to, talk about big desire to have one integrated dashboard for marketing so they could open app instead of opening multiple apps to kind of find out what they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re doing with new products and with their customers. I\u2019m just wondering where you are as a company in terms of kind of pursuing that vision? Keith Block : Yes. Hi Heather. So, I think it\u2019s very interesting; the industry focus for us is obviously very, very important and we saw, after only being organized around industries for I will say six months. We started to see that traction hit in Q4. I think you may remember that we pretty much had a run on retail banks in Q4, and that was all around our management solution that was put together by the industry business unit. That continued into Q1 where we -- to a certain extent we had a run on insurance companies. So again part of that is because of our ability to speak the language of industry, which is all about solving customer business problems. So as we continue to roll those solutions out, I think you\u2019ll see us gain mind share again, build those strategic relationships, partner with the SI, partner with our ISVs and really being more meaningful and take on that trust advisor role. So it\u2019s only natural to assume and to expect that as all those things continue to gain momentum that there will be more mind share, there will be more [indiscernible] share, there will be more market share. So again very, very pleased with the kind of early returns in Q4 and Q1 but I think that we certainly have significant opportunity and I think that\u2019s how you\u2019ll see things scale overtime. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank :  My question is for Graham. Graham, the operating cash flow growth 67%, pretty stellar. I think I understand the seasonality but I\u2019m just curious if there were any other kickers that made the quarter particularly strong on that front and if your confidence in your mid-20s operating cash flow growth for the full year has increased as a result of the good Q1 performance. Thank you. Graham Smith :  Yes. I think it feels great to get a good start. So clearly confidence in mid-20 if I say is incrementally higher because of our strong start. So just to reiterate, this compounding effect just our large fourth quarter -- really has been going on over a long period of time? And then I think you layer on top of that. Clearly we\u2019ve also been expanding our annual billings. And then we saw some margin expansion sequentially from Q4 to Q1. Q4 was still affected by short-term cash flows from Dreamforce, those kind of things. And so you kind of roll that up and we saw really strong first quarter result. So as I said, I would expect this would be more of our trend in the future that we\u2019ll have this huge receivables number at the end of the fourth quarter and then a very large collections number in Q1. So very happy to get a strong start on the year here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Group. Pat Walravens - JMP Group :  Two questions. I guess Graham can you tell us what the contribution was from ExactTarget in the quarter? And then Marc now that you have over 14,000 employees, it\u2019s got to be harder to maintain the same culture you had when you were smaller. How are you going about doing that? Marc Benioff :  Well I\u2019ll take that one first, and also I didn\u2019t answer Heather\u2019s question. First, so why don\u2019t I hit that real quickly. Heather is absolutely right. Our plan is to build a comprehensive marketing cloud and to do that we\u2019ve acquired several different companies recruiting, Radian6, Buddy Media and ExactTarget and we\u2019re integrating those into one integrated application which our customers will have used to comprehensively manage their marketing and you\u2019ll see the evolution of that product at Dreamforce. What I would say is that to really understand where we\u2019re going and how we\u2019re maintaining this culture, you have to look at our product. And I am sure that that must sound a little bit strange but I use Salesforce1 every day and I\u2019m communicating and collaborating with our employees. We have an environment that\u2019s filled with transparency and that transparency has created an environment of trust. And that much communication or what I call over communication is kind of part of what we\u2019re doing all the time. We over communicate, we over align, we\u2019re constantly working on what we call V2MOM which is kind of our internal business process service, which lets us work on our visions, our values, our methods, obstacles and measurements. All of that is built into our application. And then at the core is our philanthropy model. When we first started the company we put 1% of our equity and 1% of our profit and 1% of all of our employees\u2019 time into a 501(c)(3) charity. As I mentioned in the script, that produces amazing results, like the 700,000 hours of community service and more than 50 million in grants and 20,000 nonprofits. But one thing that\u2019s interesting is in your first day of employment at Salesforce we show you where your desk is, we show you where the kitchen is and then you go out and do something for other people. And you go to one of our soup kitchens here in San Francisco, you go to one of our homeless shelters, you go to one of our hospitals. And that really sets the tone of our culture. And it also provides the referential integrity for our culture. And our culture is different than other technology companies. And when and as we\u2019ve grown our Company, we\u2019ve been able to maintain that culture by starting -- making sure that its philanthropy first and that has really set the values that are so important to us. So when we look at values like trust, values like giving back, like service and then of course we have tremendous execution. That\u2019s also a key value that we do we say we\u2019re going to do. We delivered obviously a great quarter this quarter but this is not our first great quarter. We\u2019ve had a lot of great quarters. And those things are the things that have really cemented our culture and that\u2019s why it continues to be what it is today. So I hope that answers your question. Keith Block : And just on your second question we don\u2019t intend to provide a breakout of the exact target going forward on either the P&L or the balance sheet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird: My question is for Keith. Keith, you mentioned you\u2019ve been earlier talking to customers and what message is it that you wanted to convey to them? What did you want them to take away from your meetings? Keith Block : Well, I think there are several messages that are important, not the least of which is our corporate messages around the Internet of customers and connected customers and how we sell and service in market and how we are a company of system engagement. So those are all very strong messages that certainly resonate with our customers and our partners. But the other set of conversations that take place are around a dialog around having a strategic relationship with those customers and what does that mean. And that is all around predictability and transparency, some of the values that Marc talked about earlier. It\u2019s about trust, it\u2019s about being an advisor. It\u2019s about how do those contribute to how our customers unleash the power of social and cloud and mobile in our technologies to change their business models, to transform their businesses and really unshackle them from old technologies. Because if you really think about what\u2019s happened in the marketplace, companies have had business processes around selling and servicing and marketing to their customers that have really been hindered slash shackled by old technologies and we are providing them with a path forward here in that guidance. So these are messages that truly resonate with customers. They want these conversations. They want this impact that we can bring to the table and they\u2019re excited about our opportunity to partner with them. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley : Two questions from Graham. One related to headcount, definitely a big increase in headcount this quarter. Should we think about this in any extent in terms of sort of a pull forward of hiring, of getting a lot of the hiring done upfront or what kind of pace should we think about throughout the year? And question number two, if we look back seasonally, you typically see deferred revenues up 2 to 3 percentage point\u2019s quarter on quarter into Q2 and your guidance is approximately flat. Does that sort of hold with the normal seasonality or should we be thinking about a different seasonality this year versus prior years? Graham Smith : Thanks Keith. So, on the headcount question, typically we\u2019ve often had slow starts to our hiring in the year and then we\u2019ve sort of built on organic hiring versus people we bring in through acquisitions through the year and we really have tried to focus hard this year on getting off to a fast start and have slightly more linear hiring and it actually seems to have worked really well. So we\u2019re just pleased that I don\u2019t view this necessarily as an intentional pull forward generally but I think we are -- we\u2019ve got a lot of fantastic news coming out of the Company, able to see some of our facilities announcements are super exciting in San Francisco and I think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re still very much as the destination employer and I think our reputation out there is great and our hiring in Q1 sort of reflects that profile. On your second question, I think generally, clearly we\u2019ve said in the past, deferred revenues always got a little bit of -- it\u2019s a tough number to forecast super accurately. I think there is a sort of general scene that relates to what I talked about earlier around the compounding effect of our fourth quarter and because Q4 is largely a business quarter it becomes a large renewals quarter and it just becomes more and more dominant in terms of its invoicing. And as you know, invoicing drives deferred revenue. So I think gradually over time that Q4 spike of deferred revenue and then a more flattish profile through the year is gradually going to change over the year. It\u2019s tough to know how quickly but we haven\u2019t changed anything in the methodology, the way we forecast deferred revenue, and clearly as I said it\u2019s tough to get super accurate on either a $2.3 billion number but I\u2019d say that that overall trend that I described is probably will play out over the next few years. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Macquarie. Brad Zelnick - Macquarie: Dr. Benioff, congrats on a good quarter but I really also have to congratulate you on receiving your honorary Doctorate degree last week from USC in recognition of your great achievements, particularly your philanthropy. So congratulations. I really just wanted to -- I wanted to ask about the marketing cloud, Marc. When you acquired ExactTarget, you said we shouldn\u2019t expect any large deals for a while as you digested the acquisition. But I just wanted to check in and see how do you feel today about the completeness of the marketing cloud and what\u2019s your appetite to further build it out through acquisitions? Marc Benioff :  Well, I think that we have done a fantastic job building our marketing cloud and it\u2019s a very important market. It\u2019s something our customers have pushed us to and you saw us start with the Region 6 where we moved in the social listening of Buddy Media with social publishing. But then with ExactTarget, which is really a comprehensive application and that is really go into a whole new level with our journey builder capabilities. And if you have seen some of the demonstrations that I\u2019ve done on the Salesforce1 tour, you will notice that ExactTarget marketing cloud has just gone leaps and bounds from when we really first started working on it. Now, as we kind of go forward, there is still gaps in terms of things that we want to fill-in. When we\u2019ll fill those in, what the right companies are? It\u2019s not as easy and not straight forward as it was. We honestly got the best company. I don\u2019t think we could have ended up with a better company than ExactTarget and they have so much product and capability that it\u2019s really kept us incredibly satiated. And I don\u2019t really see that pace like you saw that we were really going through resuming. That said, we are always looking for great new companies and when we see a great entrepreneur or we see a great company or we see a great revenue stream or we see a great way to cement our position in our market, which is all customer facing applications, we\u2019re going to take that. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Walter Pritchard - Citigroup:  Hi Graham, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a bit about -- you have talked for a few years about this matrix with growth and profits as sort of the two coordinates and it feels like you are sort of solidly into the growth part of your matrix here versus high growth or maturity and in that phase you were talking about 100 to 300 basis points of margin expansion. And you\u2019ve given guidance for the year I think of a 125 to 150 basis points of margin expansion. You still are absorbing some of the ExactTarget expenses that are on-board here. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk to, do you feel like you are really within the high end of that range, if we were to consider ExactTarget? And any sort of commentary as we move throughout the year, with most of that solution behind us and then look at next year, how we should think about you on this matrix? Graham Smith :  Thanks, Walter. I think my recollection of the model, I don\u2019t have it in front of me but basically we have said, if we are growing at 30% plus, so I think yes, people could reasonably expect, absent very significant M&A, they could reasonably expect a 100 basis points plus of margin improvement in a year. We\u2019ve sort of committed to a little higher than that this year and clearly we will get -- it\u2019s a little backend loaded because as you say, really the effects of all the purchase accounting related ExactTarget pulled away after the first half and then we get sort of the bulk of the revenue write-downs done and clearly we\u2019re sort of -- we're forecasting quite a strong second half EPS performance year and overall our EPS performance this year, we\u2019re forecasting at sort of 50% type increase in overall non-GAAP EPS. So I think we feel that model works. I think as long as we are growing that top line more than 30%, I think, again absent major M&A, we feel good about delivering a 100 basis points plus a year and hopefully this year we\u2019ll do little better than that. We\u2019ll see. Operator :  Your last question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Richard Davis - Canaccord:  I realized it\u2019s somewhat small but what you kind of think about drawing the line on HR because I guess right now it\u2019s ripple social performance management but do you need to get deeper into HR to fully monetize that purchase? I am just wondering how your thoughts on that component are? Thanks. Marc Benioff :  We\u2019re not an HR software company. We\u2019re the CRM, we\u2019re really a customer relationship management software company and all of our focus is customer facing applications, sales, service, marketing, engagement. And our -- any HR capabilities that we have inside our product are really just -- allow our employees to collaborate and share in the engagement world. So whether its employee profiles or the performance management that\u2019s built into the field, that\u2019s where our focus is then. But we\u2019re not really interested in the HR software market. We will let others worry about that one. John Cummings : All right. Hannah, thank you so much for hosting us today. Thanks everyone on the call for joining us. And we\u2019ll look forward to updating you on our second quarter results in summer. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Salesforce Fiscal Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Cummings, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.

So with that, let me turn the call over to you, Marc. Marc Benioff : Okay. Hey thanks so much, John. I really appreciate it. And first, let me tell you I am so pleased to welcome Mark Hawkins, our new CFO, to our team, and he is on the call with us today, and once again, our enduring thanks to Graham Smith for a phenomenal 6 years as CFO. And as you know, Graham is still with us as a full-time adviser to me and Mark, and he is doing that until the end of March. And Graham is also participating on the call today, as well as Keith Block, our Vice Chairman and President. And we're really excited to tell you all the amazing things going on in salesforce.com.  First, I want to tell you I spent almost 1/3 of the quarter living in Europe and it was an amazing experience. I know many of you followed my trails on social media. I was -- we did very, very large customer programs in Paris, thousands of customers there, as well as in Munich. We opened our new Paris headquarters. We opened our new Salesforce tower in London, and it was just an incredible time. We profiled our work with amazing companies in Europe, including a huge deal that we launched with Philips, where they are becoming a software company and building their next-generation health applications right on the Salesforce Platform, and I was thrilled to have an incredible press conference with the Philips CEO while I was in Paris.  And then we were able to profile some amazing work that we're doing for Louis Vuitton, where we've rolled out a global clientele-ing app, really profiling one of France's most important companies, LVMH, and our incredible work for them.  And then we moved on to Germany, and we did the same thing with an incredible announcement and launch of what we're doing with Roche. And you may have seen some incredible demonstrations of technology of Roche's next-generation equipment built right onto our Service Cloud. It was just awesome and, again, a multi-thousand person program that we executed in Munich as well. It was really incredible.  Look, first of all, let me just thank all of our European customers and partners and employees. They gave me unbelievable support while I was there, and I really want to thank everybody for that. And now I just want to let you know that Salesforce has become the absolute #1 CRM platform in Europe and, of course, worldwide and also the fastest-growing top 10 software company in the world.  As you saw, we've got accelerating revenue growth to 38% growth in the quarter. We've exceeded the $5 billion revenue run rate, the first enterprise cloud company to do that, pretty incredible. And I don't think there's ever been -- I don't think there's ever been a software company that has grown at 38% at the $5 billion revenue line, and we are thrilled to be that company. And we've got a huge top line strategy. Also had just phenomenal execution of our ExactTarget acquisition. You probably saw that we bought ExactTarget a year ago. We've deeply integrated that into our enterprise, and it is just incredible what has happened with them.  We're also honored that Forbes yesterday named Salesforce the world's most innovative company for the fourth year in a row, and that is just a testament to our relentless focus on customer success, delivering a truly innovative customer platform and honestly, we're just in shock on that recognition. We couldn't believe it when we were Forbes' most innovative company in the world and now we're the fourth -- for the fourth - we've done it 4 years in a row, that's just awesome. And of course, Fortune has named us one of the best places to work, top 10 recognition, and we're going for #1 on that as well.  Look, our exceptional second record financial results just speak for themselves. Revenue growth accelerated to 38% from a year ago to more than $1.3 billion, less than a year after we surpassed our $4 billion revenue run rate. We're now more than $5 billion. Deferred revenue grew by 31%; that really exceeded what we thought we could do. And we've got dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet grew 32% from last year at $7.4 billion, awesome.  And now you can really see that clear trajectory to $10 billion in revenue, which has been our dream. And when you start to just look at our revenue, as well as our deferred business, you can start to connect the dots and see exactly how we're going to get there and the speed and rate and growth, and we're super excited about our next big goal now after $5 billion, which is going to get to $10 billion.  Operating cash flow rose to $246 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year. That cash flow has been awesome this year, more than $719 million for the year so far, and we are now guiding to more than $1.1 billion in operating cash flow for this year, which is really just an incredible achievement for our company and really, I think, speaks to the power and quality of the business model that we have put together. Not only we've got this awesome top line growth, but we have phenomenal cash flow as well.  And while we delivered world-class growth, we also grew our operating margin, something we're deeply committed to, and we're able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.13, which also exceeded our guidance. And we're going to continue to grow and exceed and deliver these awesome EPS results as we head towards that $10 billion number.  Given our strong financial results and pipeline of new business, we're raising our full fiscal 2015 guidance by $30 million. And we're also quite committed to delivering 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement this year as well. I think these 2 things just demonstrate Salesforce has never been stronger, has never grown faster and it's just getting to an unbelievably new level.  And since we initiated fiscal year '15 guidance in November last year, we've now raised our guidance by $170 million, which is roughly the same amount of the revenue that we delivered in our first year as a publicly traded company a decade ago. And of course, I think we've now delivered more than 1,700% return for our investors since we went public. And we now are one of the top 10 best-performing equities over the last decade.  We had $176 million in revenue in 2005, and we thought that was absolutely great, as I mentioned, but it turned out we underestimated what we could do. We underestimated what we could do in a decade, and that always seems to be how it is in our industry. We're always overestimating what we can do in a year and underestimating what we can do in a decade. And here it is, Salesforce did that itself.  Well, it's amazing. I couldn't be more proud of what our team has accomplished, and we're continuing our growth trajectory, connecting our customers with their customers in new ways. And you can see Salesforce just continuing to execute in its sales and service and marketing and platform businesses.  And now for the eighth year in a row, the Sales Cloud was just announced as the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Sales Force Automation. Last month, IDC named Service Cloud the #1 in customer service and support. And in April, we announced Service Cloud SOS, which delivers instant and personalized customer service within any mobile app. And so every company, every app, every customer can have their own Mayday button right to their customer service and support center. Amazon has shown us incredible vision of customer service. Every customer wants to do that, and we're making that possible with our Service Cloud now with the Mayday button. So every customer can have that incredible capability in their own apps.  Exact's Salesforce Marketing Cloud was just rated as the top digital marketing solution by CRM Magazine. And last month, we launched a major update to Salesforce Journey Builder, which allows the planning and personalizing or optimizing the 1 :1 customer interactions across multiple channels. And you're going to see an unbelievable reveal of the new version of Journey Builder, which is coming up at our Connections conference.  And if you don't know about Connections, let me tell you, you're not going to want to miss that, it's in Indianapolis. It's going to be happening September 23 to the 25. And we've got a phenomenal group of people coming, incredible CMOs like Beth Comstock of General Electric, and we even have will.i.am coming to do some incredible entertainment for us. And we're going to be showing the future of marketing, September 23 to 25 in Indianapolis with Connections. Look, at the core of our cloud and customer platform is Salesforce1, something we announced last year at Dreamforce, and it's the world's #1 platform for developing these mobile apps. I mean, we're just seeing incredible growth in our customer base with our ISVs. You can build and deploy an app on Android, on iPhone, on iPads, on any tablet. It's just awesome.  And companies are running their entire business right from their phone. I saw that everywhere I was in Europe, and Salesforce1 is really the only solution that I've seen that can deliver this world-class enterprise capability in the mobile environment.  And our customers just love it. We've had the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem, more than 1.7 million developers using our leading-edge development tools, and they're all moving to mobile using Salesforce1, these new open APIs, this incredible infrastructure that we have delivered.  And also want to let you know that, that AppExchange I just mentioned now has more than 2,000 apps available. Most -- a lot of them already moved over to Salesforce1. And it's been -- and those apps have been now installed more than 2.5 million times by our enterprise customers, which is unprecedented in the enterprise software market.  We announced the strategic platform and partnership with Microsoft this quarter. As you know, we have an incredible situation with Microsoft, who has become, I believe, our largest customer of our Marketing Cloud. They've built an incredible new product that they have called Office 365 right onto the Marketing Cloud. They use Journey Builder to guide their customers through their journeys. And it's brought Microsoft and Salesforce closer together.  We've got more involved with SQL Server than ever before, and we're looking to unite our products more closely than ever before. And you're going to see some incredible things at Dreamforce with Salesforce and Microsoft Office and the new version of Salesforce1, which is coming to Dreamforce. And I'll tell you, it's a great partnership for our customers. They could not be more excited. We also launched our new Salesforce Wear initiative because customers are buying wearables at rates like we have never seen. And they want those wearables deeply integrated with those enterprise infrastructures, and we are giving that to them. And we are the enterprise leader right now in the wearables marketplace.  Earlier this month, we also completed our acquisition of RelateIQ, an incredible, incredible company, which is going to greatly accelerate bringing advanced machine intelligence and data science right into our core platforms, as well as creating an incredible new application as part of our family of products. And for those of you who haven't tried RelateIQ, I use it on a regular basis, I'd recommend you taking a look at RelateIQ. You'll be blown away at the levels of productivity that it brings every user.  And of course, nothing is more indicative of the value of Salesforce than the level of custom usage on our platforms. And I'm thrilled to announce that last month, we delivered our first $2 billion transaction day, an incredible milestone for the entire cloud computing industry. More exciting, our service delivered more than 130 billion transaction in the quarter, up 52% for a year ago, and you saw ExactTarget delivering even more transactions on top of that.  It's been a remarkable quarter for Salesforce, but before I close, I want to remind you that we're just 1 month away from the marketing event of the year, Connections, and September 23 to 25 in Indianapolis, I mentioned that, it's just going to be awesome. You're not going to want to miss it. I'm going to be there doing the keynote, and you're going to see the future of marketing itself unfold in Indianapolis.  And then I'll tell you, we're not that far away so get ready for the biggest technology event in the history of technology, and that is Dreamforce, October 13 to the 16, in San Francisco. You're going to see the future of cloud, social, mobile, the future of the connected world. You're going to see businesses running their entire business right from their phones. You're going to see people creating these amazing customer journeys like Microsoft is doing with Office 365, and you're going to see an incredible new capabilities from Salesforce. And we're going to be also launching a major new product line there, as we like to call it new cloud, so we're going to have the biggest and most exciting and most thrilling Dreamforce ever.  You're also going to hear from global thought leaders. Klaus Schwab, the Head of the World Economic Forum, has agreed to come, and we're going to be profiling our work with the World Economic Forum and how they use Salesforce to run their operations. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has agreed to come, and she is going to -- she is also going to be in conversation at Dreamforce with Klaus Schwab. Former Vice President Al Gore is going to be there talking about the environment. We've got Reid Hoffman coming and the whole PayPal Mafia actually, which is Reid Hoffman and Jeremy Stoppelman and Max Levchin, all coming to do innovation panels and discussions on how to create startups and create more value in our industry. Marc Andreessen, of course, an incredible venture capitalist and a pundit in our industry, is going to be there to talk about his work and where he sees the world going. Steve Case, one of the original pioneers of the entire tech industry, is going to be there talking about his work in startups. And then you're going to have motivational speakers, like Tony Robbins is going to be there running a huge program for people, going to be showing them how to take their own capabilities and skills to new level. Neil Young, rock-and-roll legend, is going to be there, launching a major new product, Pono. And neuroscience Adam Gazzaley is going to be there as well, talking about his amazing work with Oculus Rift and how he has created systems that let us fly through our own brains. It's going to be awesome.  And perhaps I'm most excited about that my old friend Tony Prophet from HP, an amazing Microsoft executive, and I will be in conversation on the future of Microsoft Office and how Salesforce and Microsoft are more tightly integrated than ever before.  Of course, we can't wait for the talented Bruno Mars, who headlined in the Super Bowl, who is going to be headlining a huge outdoor concert at Civic Center. And you're not going to believe everything that's going on.  But let me just tell you one thing. If you plan to come to Dreamforce, you also better plan to bring a can of food with you as well because we're going to run the world's largest food drive of all time. And no one is coming to Dreamforce if they're not bringing food with them and things to help others. And we're going to run the biggest food drive. We're going to raise huge -- millions of dollars for philanthropy. And we're going to not only create the future, but we're also going to create a better future for all of us. I'm looking forward to seeing all of you at Connections and Dreamforce. It's going to be amazing.  And now I will hand the call over to our Vice Chairman and President, Keith Block. Keith? Keith Block : Thanks, Marc. Listen, Q2 was absolutely an outstanding quarter and we continue to acquire and expand meaningful and strategic relationships with enterprises of all sizes, in every region, across every segment and major industry. In fact, we had significant double-digit growth and a number of large deals in the quarter and -- which was terrific.  And a lot of them were net new logos, which is really an indication of the type of success we're seeing in our enterprise growth strategy. I'm incredibly proud of the entire distribution team and what we've achieved together in a very short period of time. And it's pretty clear that customers are choosing Salesforce as the trusted advisor for the customer platform. We're having a huge impact in the marketplace delivering solutions and driving customer success, so we're very, very excited.  I'd like to tell you about one of our larger transactions in the quarter, which is 3M, a leading manufacturer with a long history of global innovation. This was a great transaction and really is an example of the energy and the success that our team has been delivering in the marketplace.  Salesforce will now be powering 3M's global transformation with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud as their global customer platform across 27,000 employees. Salesforce will be the social and mobile front end to 3M's SAP back office, and it will provide their sales, service and marketing teams with a 360-degree view of the customers. We're very, very excited about this. It's a terrific example of one of many 8-figure transactions in the quarter and a great example of how customers are turning to Salesforce to unlock the value from their legacy systems.  We also closed another deal with Safeway. They selected the Salesforce1 Platform to build next-generation applications that will drive greater productivity across their store operations. Store managers and associates will be able to complete all their tasks right from their mobile phones, very, very exciting.  And leveraging Salesforce Communities, Salesforce -- or excuse me, Safeway will bring all their stores and associates into a single communications platform. Again, a very, very powerful story that we're very, very excited about.  Another large deal that we closed in the quarter is with Fastweb, which is the leading telco provider in Italy and also a subsidiary of Swisscom. Fastweb selected the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud to get a holistic view of their subscribers, whether they're in the store, online or over the phone or with an agent. And with Salesforce Communities' Fastweb partners, we'll soon be able to connect directly with agents and drive a whole new level of customer service. This is really a great example of helping a customer transform their business model, and this is what we're all about, transforming our customers' business models.  We are also very pleased to have closed the landmark transaction with a very large global manufacturer based in Europe and one of SAP's largest customers, where we will be replacing tens of thousands of Microsoft users.  We also signed on new or expanded relationships in the second quarter with some great brands, Aetna, AIG, Bernard [ph], Caterpillar, Cathay Pacific, General Motors, Konica Minolta, Krungthai Bank, PG&E, Procter & Gamble, Roche, Singapore Airlines, USAA and Yahoo! and many, many more. These are all excellent, excellent global brands in a variety of different industries, and each and one of these companies are looking for us to provide them with deep industry expertise. So whether it's communications or financial services or health care or manufacturing, retail or the public sector, we are delivering the next-generation customer platform to help our customers transform their business models for the future. And as you can see from these incredible global brands, we're seeing tremendous levels of success internationally, as Europe and Asia Pac both delivered strong growth in the second quarter.  We're just beginning to scratch the surface on our international growth potential. That's why we're aggressively investing in our international market by increasing our distribution capacity, building new data centers that we've announced and expanding our very important partner ecosystem.  And speaking of partners, we see -- we continue to see tremendous energy and enthusiasm in the ecosystem. The number of ISVs continue to scale. Our systems integrators continue to expand their Salesforce practices, and all of this is accelerating our momentum, our reach and clearly, our success in the marketplace. So I want to thank the entire organization for their outstanding execution in the second quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Graham. Graham Vivian Smith : Okay. Thanks, Keith. As you just heard, we had a really strong second quarter. It's great to be handing the CFO role over to Mark, with the company performing at such a high level.  As many of you already know, Mark is an exceptional finance executive, and I am fortunate to be transitioning the role to somebody who I've known personally for several years, who I admire and who is really going to be a great fit to Salesforce.  Mark understands the challenges of growing an organization at scale. He was with HP on its journey from $3 billion in revenue to more than $50 billion and moved Dell from $25 billion to more than $55 billion. I'm confident Mark will be instrumental in helping the company scale to $10 billion and beyond.  As you know, I'll be here until March as an adviser to ensure a seamless transition. I'll be on hand to answer any questions this afternoon. Before I turn the call over to our new CFO, I'd like to thank all of you on the phone for your support during my time at Salesforce. So with that, let me pass to Mark, who will take you through the financial details for the quarter. Mark Hawkins : Thanks, Graham. I'm excited to be here and build upon the foundation of innovation and customer success that has made Salesforce one of the truly great software companies. I've been in the industry for 3 decades, and in the last 15 years, I've watched Salesforce lead the movement to cloud social mobile.  And when I think about Salesforce, I think about an absolute leader and pioneer, and I am delighted to be here and to help guide the company through our next phase of growth. As CFO, I'm going to be focused on 3 things : Driving our strong top line growth, while delivering on our commitment to improving operating margin; number two is ensuring the company's infrastructure and operation to continue to scale as we grow; and number three is working closely with Graham to ensure a smooth transition for the entire Salesforce team. With that, let me take you through the financial highlights of our second quarter. We ended the quarter with revenue, deferred revenue, cash flow and non-GAAP EPS all growing above 30% year-over-year. During the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of RelateIQ. We reached a 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of ExactTarget and showed improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin year-over-year. In terms of Q2 revenue, it was $1.3 billion, up 38% over last year. Now excluding an FX benefit of approximately $9 million, revenue was up 37%, and then non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.13.  On a regional basis, Americas grew 39%. EMEA grew 42% in dollars and 36% in constant currency, sustaining a long trend of constant currency growth above 30%. And Asia Pacific grew 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, continuing the acceleration that we've seen over the last few quarters. Looking at the second quarter revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud was $610 million, Service Cloud was $319 million, Salesforce1 Platform and other was $181 million and ExactTarget Marketing Cloud was $122 million.  Now second quarter dollar attrition, excluding ExactTarget, remains 9% to 10%.  And now let's turn to margins. Our Q2 gross margin was 79.3%. That was down 140 basis points from last year. The decrease in our gross margin is principally related to our acquisition of ExactTarget late in Q2 of last year, which by the way, prior to acquisition, had a gross margin in the mid-60% range.  Now going forward, we will continue to seek operational efficiencies from the integration to positively impact our margins. Some of the ideas we're working on include driving benefits from centralizing procurement, leveraging shared infrastructure and increasing the share of projects done by our professional services partners.  Our second quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 11%, up 79 basis points from Q2 last year and up 126 basis points sequentially. From a headcount perspective, we had another great quarter of organic hiring in Q2, adding more than 900 employees, bringing our total headcount to more than 15,000.  Turning to cash flow. We delivered a strong operating cash flow of $246 million, up 34% over last year. We now expect our full year operating cash flow growth of 26% to 27%. CapEx was $72 million in the second quarter, down 30% over last year. CapEx as a percent of revenue was approximately 5%, down from 11% in Q2 of last year. Now for the full year, we continue to expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 5% to 7%. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was approximately $174 million, up 116% from last year. A couple of notes on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. Deferred revenue ended the quarter approximately $2.4 billion, up 31% over last year.  We faced a slight FX headwind in -- to deferred revenue in the second quarter of approximately $1 million on a year-over-year basis and a headwind of approximately $14 million sequentially.  In the second quarter, 71% of the value of all subscriptions and support-related invoices, including ExactTarget, were issued with annual terms. This compares to approximately 67% in Q2 of last year.  Unbilled deferred revenue, or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet, ended the quarter at approximately $5 billion, an increase of 32% over last year. Turning to guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're once again raising our full year 2015 revenue guidance by $30 million at the high end of the range, to $5.34 billion to $5.37 billion, or year-over-year growth of 31% to 32%. Since we first established our fiscal 2015 revenue guidance 9 months ago, we raised our full year outlook by $170 million. We're also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.01 to $0.50 to $0.52, and we remain on track to increase our full year non-GAAP operating margin by 125 to 150 basis points.  For the third quarter, we anticipate revenue in the range of $1.365 billion to $1.37 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 27% as we pass the first anniversary of the ExactTarget acquisition. We expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.12 to $0.13, which includes the cost of Dreamforce, and we expect billed deferred revenue in the third quarter to increase approximately 30% year-over-year.  All of the underlying assumptions of our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued today.  Now to close, I would like to personally thank all of our 15,000 employees for their hard work and dedication in achieving these absolutely terrific results. I'm excited to be part of the company's journey to $10 billion in revenue and well beyond. And I look forward to working with all of you and seeing you at one of our upcoming events, including Connections and Dreamforce. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Marc, I was wondering the movement in wearables and given the recent partnerships with some of the medical device companies that were highlighted throughout the last couple of months, can you share with us how you see Salesforce participating in the trend of Internet of Things? Marc Benioff : Well, thanks so much, Heather. I really appreciate that question, and I'll tell you, it really took me aback, honestly. I was in our Paris Cloudforce program. I think we had 3,000 to 5,000 people there with me. You can watch a video of that on YouTube. And you'll see that we got to the wearables section of the event. And right then, during the wearables section of the event, something amazing happened. And what happened is you hear just an audible gasp from the crowd when they see the Salesforce information appearing on the wearable. And it took me aback. It's taken me aback since we launched the product as well that customers really can see this happening very, very quickly and easily. A lot of them are already wearing wearables on a regular basis. I know that I am. I bet a lot of people on this call are. And these wearables are becoming a lot more sophisticated. They're becoming tethered to our phones. They're also becoming their own phones. And they need to have access to both not only the consumer cloud but to the enterprise information as well. And that's what we are really pioneering with our wearables and software development kits and applications that we're building. You're going to see a lot of that at Dreamforce as well. And when you start to combine it into the different verticals that we are looking at, we can really start to do demonstrations with our customers of what their future looks like, not only in their own productivity but also in how their customers will be automated as well. And you're going to see this become a huge part of the future. I'm confident we're going to see wearables from major providers like Apple and others this year. You've already seen wearables emerge from huge companies like Samsung. And it's going to be a huge part of all of our lives, and Salesforce has to be deeply integrated at part of that, which is why we launched the Salesforce Wear program. And also, I guess I should mention, since the CFO's name is Mark and the CEO's name is Marc, we'll have to come up with some clever way to figure out who the question is for, I just assumed that question was for me. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Matthew Hedberg : I was wondering, can you give us a sneak peek at maybe how RelateIQ might form the basis for your analytics cloud? Perhaps what else is needed for that particular product? And then, maybe if you could help us out with the dilution from that acquisition, that would be great. Marc Benioff : Well, sure. I will let Mark and Graham handle the dilution question and let me take the top line on the strategy question. As part of my job as the CEO of Salesforce, I'm constantly meeting with and looking at and reviewing startups and new technology and new companies, new entrepreneurs and meeting with visionaries, and I had an amazing experience. I have a dinner that I attend every month with 15 CEOs, mostly very strong and emerging companies, and a lot of them now have become huge companies. And 2 of them looked me in the eye, and this has never happened before, and they go, \"You really need to buy RelateIQ.\" And I said, \"Well, why do I need to buy RelateIQ?\" And they said, \"Well, we use Salesforce but we use RelateIQ also. And it's an incredible complement to your product line, and it can be a huge part of your future.\" And I started -- I knew about RelateIQ. I'd used it. I started to spend a lot more time with it, and I saw exactly what they were talking about. It's really a vision of how the power of data science and the power of relationship intelligence can be applied to very large data sets. And what we see happening with RelateIQ is unbelievably complementary right now to Salesforce, but we see it just getting Salesforce on steroids. We obviously have a huge vision of RelateIQ. We're currently working closely with the management team and executing that. And I expect that in about 6 months, we'll have some very exciting new products and new capabilities to offer our customers based on the RelateIQ acquisition. And we are very fortunate, as we were with ExactTarget, to be able to acquire this company, these entrepreneurs, and they just have some of the most incredible visionaries and technologists in the company, including the person who invented the very term data science. And this is just a huge win and success for Salesforce. So let me turn over to Mark and Graham on the question of dilution. Mark Hawkins : You bet. Let me take that, Marc. Matt, in terms of the dilution, there's no effect at all on the non-GAAP basis. So you can -- obviously, we're committed to the 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement, number one. And on a GAAP basis, keep in mind, Matt, that this has just closed, and we'll have calculated the GAAP effect by the end of Q3, but on a non-GAAP basis, no effect. Operator : Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Karl Emil Keirstead : My question is for Mark Hawkins. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the up 30% DR guide for the third quarter. I think that implies about 25% billings growth. I had 2 questions for you. I just wanted to confirm, given that we've lapped ExactTarget, is that a 100% or near 100% organic DR increase? And then secondly, what key assumptions or drivers are you assuming for that October DR guide in terms of large deals or GL strength, any color? Mark Hawkins : Sure, Karl, first of all, let me just say a couple of things here. One is that we focus on our revenue, obviously, our deferred revenue as such. And I know billings is a number that you look at. That's not something that we focus on in the company. But let me just talk to you in the broader things that you're asking about, which is when we look going forward, our guide represents -- at revenue level represents 31% to 32% revenue guide for the entire year, which gives you a sense of velocity. One of the things you touched on is the ET effectively, and we did lap ET in this quarter. And so when you look in Q3, for example, you can see that. And I think that's -- everybody's factoring that in. So I think the long and the short is you're absolutely right, we've lapped ET. I think you have a good understanding when you look at our revenue growth at 31% to 32%. And, Graham, I don't know if you'd add any other color to that. Graham Vivian Smith : Yes, I think we haven't -- in terms of specifically forecasting deferred revenue, obviously, we try and give you a guide on that just because we know it's an important number for you. I would say our methodology of how we actually project that this quarter doesn't change. We have a big, complicated model for that, that we use, and it's been reasonably reliable but there's been no -- it's not working at the deal level. It's basically working at the overall macro levels, new business, attrition. Bill frequency, all those kind of things go into that mix. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Maynard of Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard : I got a question for Marc B. and Keith B. here. Can you just talk a little bit about Europe and Asia? And, Marc, you spent a lot of time over there in Europe, and I'm curious just to get your take and maybe, Keith, you can weigh in on this, where do you think we're at in terms of the European countries starting to make the move to cloud adoption? Because if we look historically, a company of your size, international would be much bigger if we're making comparisons back to the old days of Oracle. And clearly, Europeans have been slow to move to cloud relative to the U.S. So I'm curious, where do you think we're at in that journey? And how do you think about growth rates in each of those regions going forward? Marc Benioff : Yes, I really appreciate that, Jason, and I'll tell you that, number one, and we've talked to you about this before, it has been a long-concerted focus on Europe. And this, obviously, is not my first trip to Europe that I just completed. I have been to Europe with Salesforce many, many, many times. And Europe tends to be a laggard when it comes to implementing new technology. And that has not escaped our cloud companies, as well as you can see across the board with all of the cloud companies. That said, the reason why you see accelerated growth rates in Europe for our business and why we have just seen remarkable, remarkable deal growth and sales in Europe over the last several years now is because what you said is true. It is a huge, huge part of our information technology market, and it's a huge part of our CRM market. And they are now deeply committed and, I believe, earnestly adopting cloud in a whole new level. There's no doubt that we are adopting our model to be more successful in Europe. You probably know, we now have a U.K. data center. And while I was in Europe, we also announced a French and German data center. That will be extremely important for each of these countries to have their own \"clouds\". Germany wants the German cloud, France wants the France cloud and U.K. wants the U.K. cloud. And as you know, our infrastructure investments and ability to deliver infrastructure, the costs for us are extremely minimal. And it's very easy for us to deliver that model to those countries. We've already done that, for example, in the U.S., our dominant market, but we also have also already done that in Japan, where we have a Japan cloud. And I believe we'll have a U.S. cloud, a Japan cloud, a U.K. cloud, a France cloud and a German cloud. And that in our major markets, and you know that we really do business in earnest in about 7 countries, we will see a more -- an increasing Balkanization of those countries. And this is really, I think, indication that the cloud computing model is going mainstream. Cloud is going mainstream, and these countries want to make sure that these clouds are part of their national infrastructure and are part of their national assets. We saw that first in Japan and we delivered that, and we'll now deliver that in our major markets, and that's going to be very, very exciting for our customers. And it has given our distribution organization the ability to talk about this incredible commitment to our local markets. That's also why you saw us also double-down on our key markets headquarters, such as in the U.K. and France this quarter as well. We have our new Salesforce Tower in downtown London, which I encourage all of you to visit. And it's an incredible and very important part of our ability to do business in the United Kingdom and coupled with our U.K. data center. We also have our new French headquarters directly next to the Eiffel Tower, the former headquarters of the French Navy. And we have under development and soon-to-be opened our new French data center. Again, we have so many exciting customers in France that I met with, whether it's companies like I mentioned, like LVMH or AXA or Renault or so many others who have made massive commitments to us. And then we move on to Germany and, again, we're executing the same strategy. And Japan, where the Japanese Government now has asked us to move into one of their brand-new buildings, which is JP Tower, and in downtown Tokyo, in the Marunouchi district, and also we've coupled with NTT with our Japanese data center. And I think you're going to see this as a successful winning combination for delivering our cloud, Salesforce's cloud, in these local markets and accelerating our growth. And if you look at -- as we've implemented that strategy over the last several years, you can see how our international numbers have improved. And now let me turn it over to Keith, who will give you the on-the-ground assessment. Keith Block : Yes, thanks, Marc. Jason, thanks for the question. [indiscernible] I would echo many of the things that Marc has said. When I came onboard just over 12 months ago, one of the things that was obvious to me was just the tremendous opportunity in international, both in EMEA and Japan and Asia Pac. And we have accelerated our investment in those theaters across the board, whether it's people and headcount, whether it's improving our relationship with partners, the SIs, the influencers, the key influencers in those markets, as well as the ISVs. Marc also mentioned data centers. I think that's a demonstration of clear commitment to those countries, that we're very serious about the cloud computing business in their theater. So you wrap up all of those investments, along with our general theme of going to market by industry in selling solutions, and you can see the response in the numbers that our customers internationally, not just domestically anymore, but internationally, absolutely want to embrace our vision for them around a customer platform. So we're very, very excited about the acceleration in the results, and you can see -- you're going to continue to see that happen. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. Brent Thill : A question for Mark Hawkins and Graham on the approach to your hiring in the back half of the year. About 1/3 of your workforce has been added just in the past 1.5 year. And I think there's been some questions around are you going to continue at the pace you've been going. Or is there room for pause as you digest those additions that you've made? Mark Hawkins : Yes, Brent, good to talk to you again. Let me start and maybe Graham can jump in as well here. As you saw last quarter, we did add 900 people. We are glad to do that. We feel like that helps us position us as our company is growing rapidly. We continue to hire. We have -- if you look at our website, we've got lots of stuffs out there for continuing to get those key skills. And I would even add that, obviously, we're having good success in the hiring, I think, in large part with things like being a great destination to be in terms of best place to work and such. But I think the long and the short of it is, Brent, that we continue to hire, we're going to continue to do that within the envelope of delivering our top line growth that we talked to you about with the 31% to 32% and also with the operating margin 125 to 150 basis point improvement, non-GAAP. Graham? Graham Vivian Smith : Yes, I would just add, I think we have somewhere over 900 open positions on our website. I think, Brent, you know we've often had a lot of back-end-loaded hiring in our years. This year, we actually got off to a really fast start. Employee attrition has been actually very favorable for us, too. We ended the first half ahead of our headcount plan, which I don't think we've had in my 6 years at the company. So we had a really, really strong organic hiring the first half. So we feel great heading into the back half from a hiring point of view. Operator : Your next question comes from Ed Maguire of CLSA. Edward Maguire : A couple of quick questions. One is on -- thank you for providing some of the granularity around the cloud. If you could provide any relative strength across the cloud, that would be great. And also, turning to the industrial side of Internet of Things. You guys have been doing a lot of interesting work with ThingWorx and Etherios and some of those partners. And I'm curious to what extent you expect Service Cloud and Platform to really lead adoption here? What are going to be the obstacle to adoption? And what are the biggest vectors you see driving growth for connected products? Marc Benioff : Well, the first thing I would say is that we're very lucky to have a full portfolio of product. Of course, we've got our mainstream Sales Cloud product, and that product continues to do incredibly well and beyond our expectations. And that's one of the key reasons we bought RelateIQ. I mean, it really makes the Sales Cloud so much better, and we couldn't imagine something that could boost us so much so fast. But RelateIQ did that and so we had no choice but to acquire the company and make that happen. Then when we look at the Service Cloud, well, this is our fastest-growing cloud ever. And you can just see the revenue numbers are just awesome. And it's unusual for a software company to have a billion-dollar product line and a multibillion-dollar product line. We have that with Sales Cloud, and now you see it happening again with the Service Cloud, have a multibillion -- second multibillion dollar product line. And that product, as you know, whether -- it doesn't matter what rating agency is rating it, says it's absolutely the best customer service product out there. And then we made it so much better with all of these new capabilities. And when you see what we come out with at Dreamforce, again, you'll be just in shock at the level of quality and capability of the Service Cloud. The Marketing Cloud is a product that very much we've built through acquisition. And we, of course, acquired an incredible company called Radian6. We bought an incredible company called Buddy Media. But all of that was minimized when we bought this unbelievable company last year called ExactTarget. And that company, as you can see, has dramatically accelerated our Marketing Cloud and has given that a very strong trajectory. And when you get to the Connections conference, and you see things like Journey Builder, when you see what Microsoft has built on top of our Marketing Cloud and with Journey Builder and how they've been able to get such incredible success with Office 365 by building customer journeys and how we can deliver this deep customer workflow for any app builder, not just Microsoft, but any one building apps or anybody who is trying to deliver customer journeys and communicate with those customers on a regular basis through email and SMS and on mobile phones and in-app, you'll see why these companies like Microsoft and Sony and so many others have made such huge investments in our Marketing Cloud. And then getting to your IoT question, our platform, you can't do any of this unless you can build your own apps. And you've got to be able to build mobile apps. You've got to be able to build on an API. You have to have enterprise quality. You have to be able to have it in country. It's not like the consumer cloud. We don't own our customers' data. We're not like Facebook and Google or Yahoo!; we don't own the data. The data is our customers', and we are just stewards. We provide the applications, we provide the equipment, but these clouds are very much owned by the customers. And the customers are in the data centers and auditing the data centers and reviewing the security and knee-deep in all the capabilities. And the core of that, that's the platform, that is the infrastructure is the platform, the APIs are the platform, and then the fundamental software that lets them build these incredible next-generation applications like what we see coming out of Salesforce1 with these unbelievable mobile apps, and if you go to our AppExchange.com and you look at the Salesforce1 category, you look at some of the demonstrations of that or just talk to any of our customers and have them show you what they're doing on Salesforce1, we are rapidly moving our user base to mobile. And it's super important for us, and it's our platform, and here it is again, another aspect of our business that has an incredible trajectory. And then finally and as part of that, we have to mention Heroku. Heroku is the absolute standard in building apps on Amazon Web Services. It's an acquisition that we did now, I think, about 3 years ago. It's become an unbelievable success story. It's a standard in the industry. And if you want to build a standard app that's customer-facing on AWS, you're going to do it on our Heroku platform. And you saw incredible integration between Heroku and Salesforce with the introduction of Heroku Connect. And that is super exciting that we're able to offer our customers the ability to build on the Journey Builder platform for those marketing applications. They can build on the Force Platform for their employee applications. And here, they can build on Heroku for their consumer-facing applications. And our customers look at that as a complete suite, not just for B2B applications, in sales, in service, in marketing and in managing their internal apps. But they also are able to do it on a B2C. That is we have a full B2C offering with ExactTarget and Journey Builder with Heroku, and of course, you've seen what we've done with communities where we're just delivering unbelievable community support. And if you go to community.homedepot.com, and you look at what Home Depot has done with deep social network that connects their community, one of the largest retailers in the world, with all their employees around the world, it's an example of what we're all going to be able to do with Communities. So we look at this as -- we look at an unbelievable capability with sales, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Marketing Cloud. We see an unbelievable strength with the Platform, with Heroku and then Communities. And then to kind of get to your last piece, you're going to see us move into an exciting new area in -- at Dreamforce. And I'm not going to tip my hat to what that is. It's not RelateIQ. It's nothing that you have seen yet from Salesforce. We are going to be introducing a major new product line and category. It's at Dreamforce, so hope you'll be there, during our keynote on the 14th, on Tuesday, in San Francisco at 1 :30 p.m. because we will show you really the fifth leg of the stool and how all these things come together to create an incredible, incredible customer-facing environment. Whether you are a B2B company, B2B2C company or B2C company, Salesforce has incredible suite of products that will make you more successful than ever before and also connect with your customers in a whole new way. Operator : And your final question of this call comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. S. Kirk Materne : My question's for Keith. Keith, can you maybe provide a bit of an update on the industry strategy, how that's playing out in terms of some of the larger deals you guys have signed this quarter? And I'd be interested if there's any industries in particular you're seeing some of the accelerating traction, whether it's through your own efforts or through your ISV partners' efforts. Keith Block : Yes, thanks, Kirk, for your question. Our industry strategy continues to gain traction. In fact, if you look at the roster of customers identified in the beginning of the opening comments of the call, they fairly represent all the industries that we're pretty much focusing on. So we continue to get traction. Our customers love the story about our reported view around industry. They love the solution that we're bringing to market. They are enjoying what our partners are collaborating with us on, enabled to help them drive a transformation to their business models in their particular industries. So it's early days and early months, but we continue to see traction. And not only are we seeing this in larger deals and in volume of larger deals, but just getting more meaningful dialogue across the board. So I think the prognosis is good, the early results are good, and we think we'll continue to focus on. John Cummings : Great. So that concludes our call today, everyone. Thank you so much for joining. We appreciate it. We'll look forward to updating you on our third quarter results in November. And if you have any questions, please you can reach out to us at investor@salesforce.com. Operator : That concludes today's Salesforce fiscal second quarter results conference call.

Now let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Okay, thanks very much, and really appreciate it, John, and hello from San Francisco. Look, very, very excited to give you this quarter\u2019s highlights and results and thrilled to be on the call with you, and let\u2019s just start out with top highlights for the quarter. First of all, the San Francisco Giants have won the World Series. Congratulations. Now, in other news, it\u2019s great to be with you today to talk about our strong quarterly financial results, our incredible Dreamforce last month, our contribution to our community, and the significant advancements in enterprise technology that Salesforce is leading.  And that\u2019s what Salesforce and our commitment to customer success is absolutely all about. Cloud computing is taking over our industry. You can see that at Dreamforce. In the four pillars of cloud computing, the cloud, the social world, the mobile, acceleration and data science are guiding us to transform our customer relationships. Look, we saw that take form at Dreamforce. We see this where every company is going to be transformed over the next decade with these amazing changes. Salesforce is leading the way, and we look forward to our first $6 billion year next year. We\u2019ve never been more confident or excited to give guidance. It\u2019s completely amazing to me.  Here it is : Salesforce, the number one cloud computing company in the world, Salesforce the number one CRM company in the world, giving guidance of $6.5 billion in revenue next year as a top five enterprise software company. It\u2019s a huge threshold moment for cloud computing. Now, before I begin, and I\u2019d like to thank so many of you who joined us at Dreamforce in San Francisco, with over 150,000 registered to attend and over 7 million joined us online to hear our vision for the future of the industry. And I know many of you were as inspired as I was by the attendees and the amazing response to what we have all created. And at Dreamforce, we\u2019ve held more than 1,450 sessions on how our customers are using these new worlds of cloud, of social, mobile, and data science to transform their enterprises. All of our attendees experienced an incredible Dreamforce trade show with more than 400 partners presenting the next generation of cloud computing, and it was our highest rated Dreamforce ever. We also had a great experience and we led our commitment to giving back at Dreamforce by running San Francisco\u2019s largest food drive, which raised 3 million meals, stuffed learning materials into backpacks for new mothers, alongside Hillary Clinton. Flew with our veterans on Chinook helicopters to Moffett Field to launch our new VetForce program, and we heard about important advancements in protecting our environment from Al Gore. At Dreamforce, we introduced important new innovations including the advancement of our core customer success platform and we also introduced our newest cloud, the fastest-growing cloud we\u2019ve ever seen, the Wave analytics cloud, the first analytics product that makes data-driven insights accessible to everyone and on any device. And we introduced the new Salesforce1 Lightning platform, which has now been released to developers, the fastest way for every company to build and deploy multiple apps, and you could just see the response from developers quite evident last week on Twitter, how they are receiving this major advancement in our development environments. We heard from amazing companies like Coca-Cola, Honeywell, General Electric, incredible nonprofits like Donors Choose, the Girl Scouts, and so many others who are using cloud computing and the Salesforce customer success platform to innovate and transform their business. Coca-Cola Germany\u2019s CEO, Ulrik Nehammer, talked about Dreamforce, and just talked about it again today in New York City at our show, how the most dangerous place to make a decision is in the office, and how he runs his business from his phone with mobile apps built on Salesforce1 Lightning platform, and how it has transformed and accelerated the growth of Coca-Cola Germany. And I just now have heard that once again with him today. He offers a great description of our vision at Salesforce, how his team is making smarter decisions at exactly the moment and place that it matters. Now, let\u2019s get to the financial results for the quarter. Revenue in the third quarter rose to nearly $1.4 billion, up 30% in constant currency from a year ago. No other top 10 software company is growing faster, and we\u2019re delivering the growth while pushing through the $5 billion revenue milestone this year.  Deferred revenue grew by 31% in constant currency from a year ago to more than $2.2 billion, and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $7.6 billion. That is amazing. $7.6 billion and on and off the balance sheet. Now, as we deliver on this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also remain committed to delivering 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement this fiscal year. You can see that in our numbers and we are committed to making this better next year. In an exceptionally tough foreign exchange environment that has decelerated this quarter, we are pleased to be initiating fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance, and this is revenue guidance that we\u2019re saying where we\u2019re going to be 15 months from now, at the end of January 2016, of $6.5 billion at the high end of our range, and we are the first enterprise cloud company to be able to say $6.5 billion.  I\u2019m seeing that every enterprise of every size is committing itself to cloud computing. Today, more than ever, connecting with customers is an imperative, because everyone and everything is becoming digital and connected. And a company\u2019s relationship with those digitally connected customers is the new bottom line, exactly as Ulrik said. The customer success platform provides what every company needs to connect with customers in a whole new way, and during the quarter, we announced a number of very important innovations. Our new Wave analytics cloud is an incredible achievement by our technology and products organization. I\u2019ve never seen a product as Salesforce, I think in my career actually, get off to a faster start. There\u2019s never been this kind of customer traction and excitement around a new product before. It\u2019s analytics for the rest of us. Major customers like EMC, Verizon, General Electric all signed up in the quarter, and since launching the analytics cloud just a month ago, more than 45 partners have joined our analytics cloud ecosystem and the pipeline is just awesome. We\u2019ve never seen faster traction for a new product or a new cloud. I\u2019m just confident this is going to be our fastest and most exciting new cloud ever. And the new Salesforce1 Lightning takes the Salesforce1 platform to a whole new level. There\u2019s no better way to create mobile apps, with drag and drop, interactive process builders that turn businesses users into citizen programmers. And there was a great article about that posted by our developer community last week on Twitter that I retweeted, and our customers are doing better marketing around our platform than even we are doing, because this is such an exciting moment for our developer community around this next generation Lightning platform.  Salesforce remains the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem in the world. No one else in the industry is providing a software platform that makes it as easy for any company to develop and deploy next-generation apps as well as breakthrough apps for sales, for service, marketing, community analytics. Each one of these is a major product line in cloud now for us. Our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Marketing Cloud, our Community Cloud, our analytics cloud, our platform for building apps, each one of these is a major product line that we have entered the market with and have taken a significant position in the industry. Our Sales Cloud continues to lead in its category on its way to becoming the first $3 billion app cloud at Salesforce. The service cloud is on a tear with its new SOS functionality. Every company wants to have a mayday button just like Amazon has, and now with the service cloud, they can have one connected all back to their call centers and contact centers. And with the click of a button, a customer can connect to an agent via video in real time for personal assistance within any mobile app. And I\u2019m thrill that the community cloud and it\u2019s all new public communities, everybody knows how committed we are to social. We\u2019ve pioneered it with employees, we\u2019ve pioneered it with partners, we\u2019ve pioneered it in vendor communities, and now we\u2019re pioneering it again with public communities. All people integrated into all our other clouds. And you can see that at community.homedepot.com as a great example of this new public community cloud capability. And finally, the marketing cloud introduced a major advancement this quarter with the Journey Builder for apps capability kind of showing the next-generation vision of what the marketing cloud can become. Look, nothing speaks more to the value of the Salesforce platform, and to our customers, than the actual tool usage of the platform, which we make public each and every day. Salesforce delivered more than 159 billion transactions in the quarter, which was up 64% from a year ago. 64% growth in the use of our platform. That\u2019s nearly 2.5 billion transactions every business day. No other enterprise cloud platform comes close, with the dominant transactions coming from our application program interfaces. Look, I am absolutely thrilled with the quarter, and congratulations, Keith, on a strong quarter, and now I\u2019d like to turn it over to you. Keith Block : Thanks, Marc, and good afternoon everybody. Great to be here, and thanks to everybody for joining the call. So as Marc mentioned, I\u2019m here in New York today to kick off the Salesforce World Tour, and with more than 10,000 people registered to attend, and a million people watching online, which is great, you can absolutely feel the incredible energy and momentum, and all of that driving our customer success and our growth. Now, I was with some of our top customers last night, including Coca-Cola and Stanley Black & Decker, and GE Capital, and many others, and all of these customers are talking about our customer success platform and driving a more meaningful relationship with us here at Salesforce. And in fact, Marc alluded to this earlier, but GE Capital is using our analytics cloud, which just launched a few short weeks ago, which is pretty incredible, and they\u2019ve already shortened the cycle time from learning to action, from months to minutes and seconds, and it truly is decision making at the speed of thought.  And it\u2019s pretty clear that analytics is going to be a game-changer, and based on what I\u2019m seeing from customers, what I saw today in my conversations and today at the conference, I agree with Marc, that analytics will be the most successful product launch in the company history. There\u2019s no question about it. And with our customer success platform, which brings together sales and service and marketing, communities, platforms, and of course analytics, customers are transforming their business models and they\u2019re looking at Salesforce in entirely new ways. So here in New York this week, and at Dreamforce last month, certainly when I speak with customers on a daily basis, it\u2019s pretty clear, just like last evening, they want more strategic and meaningful relationships with us. And this was certainly evidenced by the number of large deals that we closed in Q3. In fact, we signed more 7- and 8-figure deals this quarter than in any Q3 in the history of the company. And what\u2019s even more exciting is that we doubled the number of 8-figure deals in the quarter from a year ago, and I am very, very proud of the entire team for this accomplishment. We\u2019ve added significant relationships with companies like AB InBev, Archer Daniels Midland, and Johnson & Johnson, and that\u2019s just the beginning. And we absolutely strengthened existing ones with customers like EMC and HP and Verizon. And I\u2019ll share a couple of those stories with you right now. So Verizon, longstanding customer, continues to do business with us, continues to enhance our relationship. It was a great story for the quarter. They selected our service cloud for their entire enterprise team so that they could service customers across all their products from a single platform, the customer success platform. And interestingly enough, after seeing our analytics product in action at Dreamforce, again just a few weeks ago, Verizon signed up for the analytics cloud to put the power of real time data and insights right into the hands of their reps. It\u2019s a great story. Another story for the international side of the house is AB InBev, the leading global brewer, and they selected the Salesforce1 platform and service cloud to power their customer success platform in several of their key markets. So now, Salesforce can give AB InBev the ability to sell, service, and market to customers from a single platform. Nobody else can do that. And leveraging Salesforce1, they\u2019re able to integrate all their legacy systems and develop social and mobile apps on the fly. So again, I want to congratulate the team in Europe for building this outstanding and great brand relationship. So we also saw strong momentum in the public sector this quarter. As you know, this is an industry that we\u2019re focusing on and it included a significant win with the U.S. Department of Commerce. They selected Salesforce for our ability to deliver a mobile-first customer success platform, and that will connect all of their legacy systems again as a common theme, driving from systems of record into systems of engagement. And with our service cloud and community cloud, they plan to put iPads and iPhones into the hands of their employees so that they can better serve American businesses.  And we also expanded relationships in other areas of government this quarter, including the State of Ohio and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They\u2019re turning to Salesforce to transform the government experience for citizens, for partners, and for employees. Our momentum in financial services continues as well. Barclays, a global top 10 bank and obviously a terrific brand, selected Sales Cloud and Salesforce communities in the quarter to connect 15,000 brokers and put them in touch with Barclays experts right from their mobile devices. Barclays joined a growing list of financial services organizations around the world, including State Street, SunLife, Zurich Insurance, and many others, all of whom are turning to Salesforce as their platform for innovation and growth. We also signed new or expanded relationships in the quarter with Isuzu, L\u2019Oreal, Merck, NBC Universal, Office Depot - which by the way was a significant marketing cloud win in the quarter - Symantec, Time Warner, Toyota. And also in Asia-Pac, we signed a significant deal with a large Japanese manufacturer where we replaced Microsoft with Sales Cloud after rolling out a pilot in a matter of just a few weeks. Pretty impressive. And that really speaks to the speed at which our customers want to transform their businesses versus months or years it takes on legacy platforms. So pretty compelling story.  So just getting started on our international growth opportunity. We\u2019ve been aggressively investing in our international markets by increasing distribution capacity, as you know, and expanding our partner ecosystem into the largest partner ecosystem in technology and building new data centers. In fact, we just opened our first European data center in the U.K. a few weeks ago, and we plan to open two more in Europe in the next year.  So industries is another growth opportunity, whether it\u2019s communications, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, or the public sector. Our customers are looking to us for deep industry expertise and a solution that allows them to transform their business models, leveraging our customer success platform. Our ecosystem, I mentioned that a second ago. Partners are integral to our strategy, and certainly another growth opportunity. The world\u2019s largest and most strategic SIs continue to expand their Salesforce practices, and we recently revamped our ISV model to better focus on vertical markets, and that\u2019s starting to really pay off in bigger and more strategic ways. So it\u2019s an exciting time for us here at Salesforce as we close our first $5 billion year. I echo Marc\u2019s comments. It\u2019s absolutely amazing. And build the pillars for our next decade of growth. And I want to thank our customers and our partners for their continued commitment, and last but not least, I want to congratulate the team on the quarter for continuing to drive our customer success. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark. Mark Hawkins : Well, thank you, Keith. I\u2019m very pleased to be with all of you today to discuss the third quarter. Despite a challenging FX environment, we delivered another strong quarter of results. We exceeded our Q3 revenue guidance by $14 million. We exceeded our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.01. Deferred revenue was up 28% year over year in dollars and 31% in constant currency, compared to our guidance of 30%. And our non-GAAP operating margin was up 244 basis points year over year. The third quarter revenue was $1.38 billion, up 29% over last year. Excluding a year over year FX headwind of approximately $12 million, revenue was up 30%. On a sequential quarterly basis, we had an even larger FX headwind of $15 million. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.14. On a year over year regional basis, revenue grew in the Americas by 29%. In EMEA, it grew 30% in dollars and 34% in constant currency, and Asia Pacific grew 21% in dollars and 25% in constant currency. Looking at the third quarter revenues by cloud, Sales Cloud was $625 million. Service Cloud was $340 million. Salesforce1 platform and other was $192 million, and Marketing Cloud was $132 million. Dollar attrition for the third quarter, excluding ExactTarget, remained between 9% and 10%. Now, turning to margins, our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 78.4%, down approximately 90 basis points from last year, which reflects the continued investment in our infrastructure, including international data center expansion. This continued investment is important for us to maintain the high level of trust and service delivery we are known for. We may see a slight impact on the gross margins next year as we ramp up the data center investment in Germany and France. However, we\u2019re still very confident that we\u2019ll be able to improve operating margins in FY16 by gaining efficiencies in other areas. Our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 11%, up 244 basis points from Q3 last year, even as we held our biggest and very best Dreamforce ever, which had, by the way, about a $0.02 impact on non-GAAP EPS. For the nine months year to date, we are up 90 basis points, and with our Q4 guidance, we\u2019re on track to deliver 125 to 150 basis points improvement for fiscal 2015. From a headcount perspective, we ended the quarter with approximately 15,500 employees, up 21% over Q3 of last year. Now turning to cash flow, we delivered cash flow of $123 million, down 11% from last year. Now, this was primarily impacted by the timing of Dreamforce, which occurred in Q3 this year as opposed to Q4 last year. However, year to date, cash flow is up 39% year over year, so despite the modest decline in the third quarter cash flow year over year, we now anticipate a full year operating cash flow growth of 27% to 28%. Capex was approximately $73 million in the third quarter, up slightly over last year. Capex as a percent of revenue was approximately [5%], and that was down from 7% in Q3 of last year. For the full year, we continue to expect capex and the percent of revenue to be around the 5% to 7% range. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capex, was $49 million.  Now, moving back to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $2.22 billion, up 28% over last year. Excluding a year over year FX headwind of $33 million, deferred revenue grew 31%. FX also reduced deferred revenue sequentially by approximately $30 million. During the quarter, 73% of the value of all subscription support related invoices were issued with annual terms compared with approximately 69% in Q3 of last year.  Unbilled deferred revenue, our revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced, and is off the balance sheet, ended the quarter at approximately $5.4 billion, up $1.2 billion over last year, for an increase of 29%. Turning to guidance, based on our results for the quarter, clearly FX has had a significant impact on our financial performance. As I mentioned, we saw a $15 million sequential headwind to revenue in the quarter, and we expect an additional similar sequential impact to revenue in Q4 as well.  In that context, we are maintaining the high end of our full fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance range and expect revenue to be $5.365 billion to $5.370 billion for a year over year growth of 32%. This full year guidance implies Q4 revenues in the range of $1.436 billion to $1.441 billion, representing year over year growth of 25% to 26%. We expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be in the $0.51 to $0.52 range. This implies Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 to $0.14. We anticipate fourth quarter deferred revenue growth of approximately 27% year over year in reported dollars, and today, we are pleased to be initiating fiscal 2016 revenue guidance at approximately $6.45 billion to $6.50 billion for year over year growth of 20% to 21%, which reflects an expected FX headwind of approximately $125 million to $150 million. Now, keep in mind we are 15 months away from the end of fiscal 2016, and this is our initial guidance without knowing our Q4 results. Q4 is our biggest quarter, and it provides the most new business and renewals in any quarter. Add this to the compounding nature of the business model, and Q4 becomes especially important to revenue forecasting. We\u2019ll have an update to our FY16 guidance for you when we report on our fourth quarter results in February. So to close, despite significant FX headwinds, we delivered strong third quarter results. The third quarter sets us up for a strong finish in FY15, and we are on track to deliver all of our key financial goals we set out at the beginning of the year : revenue growth, improving our full year non-GAAP operating margins by 125 to 150 basis points, and strong operating cash flow. I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in delivering these great results. I\u2019m very excited about how we are positioned for FY16. Now, with that, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : It looks like you did billings growth on a constant currency basis of 29%, which I recollect, Marc, was exactly the same percentage you grew three years back. You\u2019re a much larger company, so the law of large numbers doesn\u2019t seem to apply to you guys. As it relates to the analytics cloud, Marc, I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some sense of how you expect user adoption to take place. What segments in the global markets do you see this as having a near term impact. And as you look at your fiscal 2016 guidance, typically you guys have been conservative, sort of, which is very much appreciated.  Are you assuming the full thrust of the analytics cloud in your next year numbers, or do you want to just take it one step at a time, see how it goes for the next couple of quarters, and see what you do about fiscal 2016 as it relates to analytics before you guide the street on the analytics product? Marc Benioff : I just want to say, at a high level, what I said in the script is the most important thing regarding the analytics cloud, which is that we have never seen faster uptake and faster traction when it comes to new product. And that gives us a level of incredible excitement. I\u2019m sure if you downloaded the product or seen reviews on the app stores that you realize we had a huge breakthrough in our ability to enter a major new segment. For those of you who look at the TAMs of these different markets, and understand how we actually enter a market, what we do is we look at, number one, what is the size of the market that we\u2019re entering into? When we look at sales, it\u2019s obviously a multibillion dollar market service platform, especially marketing is becoming that way. But analytics is already that way. Analytics, business intelligence, is one of the biggest, most exciting markets in the whole industry. This is not a CRM story. This is analytics for the rest of us, period. And we have the best analytics and business intelligence product on the planet, and we are going to market in a huge way, and I\u2019d just like to ask Keith now to talk about the changes that he\u2019s making to his organization to focus on this opportunity, some of the advancements he\u2019s seen in the pipeline regarding analytics. It\u2019s a super-exciting moment, and Keith can also talk to you about some of the deals he\u2019s already closed in the third quarter. Keith Block : Thanks, Marc. So let me just give some color commentary on this. So obviously as I said in the opening comments, this is a product that has been around for just a few short weeks. And already we\u2019re starting to see, with some pretty large companies, interest in the product. We\u2019ve already signed some customers.  So we\u2019re very, very excited about the momentum, and as far as readiness for the organization, we\u2019ve had our entire sales organization go through what we call a black belt process for training, so that they\u2019re completely enabled and ready to engage with our customers around analytics.  We also have a specialized organization that focuses every day. They wake up every day and all they think about is how to deploy analytics with our customers to make them successful. And we\u2019re seeing some interesting characteristics, and I\u2019ll talk about opportunities. We don\u2019t like to talk about pipeline, but we\u2019re actually starting to see customers who are not Salesforce customers, who are interested in analytics, because they see how robust it is. So we\u2019re very, very excited about the opportunity. It is an early release product, but we believe that there\u2019s a lot of momentum and we\u2019re off to a very strong start here. So we feel very good about it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Maybe one for Mark Hawkins. Did a really nice job on operating margins this quarter, up 244 basis points. It seems like you\u2019re being a little bit more conservative going into Q4, where we typically see a little bit more flow through on operating margins. Maybe you can give us a little bit of color on sort of the investment profile going into Q4, why you see less of an operating margin gain in that Q4, and some insight on how you\u2019re initially thinking about FY16? Marc Benioff : First of all, we are pleased, absolutely, when we look at the operating margin progress just really year to date, and I think Q4 was a really nice step up here. You can see some efficiencies in G&A, and we had talked about, you know, I expect and will be planning and driving toward having G&A [indiscernible] 10% over time. We saw some nice efficiencies in other parts of the company. Don\u2019t forget, when you go into Q4, as you get to the end of the year, you start to get to things like commissions and things of that nature that obviously have a bearing from that standpoint. We feel great about our recommitment to the 125 to 150 basis points for the year, and obviously we\u2019re always driving to achieve and better. But that\u2019s where we\u2019re at on that. And then if there\u2019s anything else, I\u2019m happy to follow up on that. I guess also, as you look at FY16 in terms of margins, I think the thing to think about there is this is a period, as Marc teed up, we\u2019re 15 months away from the end of FY16. We\u2019re initiating guidance on the revenue side. We\u2019ll be talking about margins in Q4, at the Q4 earnings call in February, so we\u2019ll get into that for next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill :   I had a question regarding the analytics cloud. Do you see that in terms of adoption mainly coming initially from your existing customer base, or a lot of projects from the partner community? And also, in terms of between the midmarket and enterprise, how do you see that going forward? Marc Benioff : It\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s on all of our minds, because the demand that we have is universal, and what you saw at Dreamforce is that whether it was small companies, or medium, or large, they were all extremely interested. Obviously, GE is the launch customer. We just showed them, speaking today.  If you didn\u2019t see the New York World Tour show, John Sabino, who is a marquee executive at General Electric, who\u2019s [indiscernible] through many different GE units, spoke today on the significance of this product as it relates to General Electric. I think that that sums it up very well for enterprise.  I haven\u2019t found a customer who doesn\u2019t want to have a significant interest in the product, and that also includes our nonprofit customers. That has surprised me. So for us it\u2019s the staging of which ones we\u2019re going to get on, and how fast we can do it. We have aggressive goals for the product for next year. And I would also add, and I think this gets to the other part of your question, this is not an app. This is a platform. This is a product that others will build on. Yes, it\u2019s a great end user capability. You can get to that on your mobile device. And Alex Dayon and his team have done an unbelievable job. I\u2019ve been personally involved in the development process, meeting with the analytics cloud team every two weeks for the last six to 12 months. And I can just tell you, it\u2019s our absolute highest-performing team, what they\u2019ve accomplished, I have not seen, in my career. So huge congratulations out to Alex. But there\u2019s been three key design goals. One was the final user interface that you saw, which is obviously super sexy. The second one is that it\u2019s not just for analysts, which are kind of the traditional targets for the products, but for everyone in the organization.  So you can just ask any Salesforce executive to show you how they\u2019re already starting to use the analytics cloud, because all of our executives are getting teed up on using it. And that\u2019s one of Keith\u2019s goals, is to have every one of his executives using the analytics cloud and be able to demonstrate how they\u2019re using it to run their business.  And three is, you saw that we have a huge number of partners already, not just the ETL vendors and integration vendors, not just the systems integrators, but also application developers. You know, when we first showed the product, to give you a little inside baseball here, to Gartner, they said to us, well, this is really a great product, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen now the first draft note. They said this is a really great product, but what we thought you were going to roll out is an analytics app for SFA, for Salesforce Automation. Why are you not delivering the analytics app for SFA? And we said no, no, no, that\u2019s not our vision. Our vision is we want to be the platform for analytics for all companies. And we don\u2019t want to roll first with an analytics app. I hope that partners out there are building that app on our platform, but this is what\u2019s existing, is that we\u2019re going to have a huge ecosystem around this product, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive it.  It\u2019s a huge part of our philosophy and our business. We don\u2019t make an SFA app, we make an SFA platform. We don\u2019t make a service app, we make a service platform. We don\u2019t make a community app, we make a community platform. It\u2019s all built on our Salesforce1 platform. If you\u2019ve ever been with a Salesforce employee, just have them show you on their iPhone or their Android device, on their iPad or whatever they\u2019re using, how we run our business on our phones. And that\u2019s our vision for this analytics app platform as well. It\u2019s really deeply integrated into our Salesforce1 platform, but it itself is also its own platform. I know that\u2019s a little bit of a confusing statement. So look, I\u2019m super excited, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s getting conveyed to you, and it\u2019s going to be a huge focus. We call fiscal year\u201916 at Salesforce the year of analytics. Everybody knows about our V2MOM process. At the head of our V2MOM for fiscal year 2016, it\u2019s the year of analytics. And we\u2019re going to be super excited about [indiscernible] for fiscal year 2017. It will also be a year of analytics, because it\u2019s not just a one-year initiative. This is going to be a super exciting moment. Keith, do you want to add to that? Keith Block : Yeah, listen, I will tell you again, there\u2019s just tremendous momentum. Marc mentioned the ecosystem. We signed up nearly 50 partners in just a few short weeks, who have some pure interest. And they see the value that analytics cloud can provide their customers.  While Marc was talking about platform, just a thought. I mentioned that we are seeing some opportunities, companies that are interested, in analytics cloud that are not Salesforce customers. So it would be natural to expect that we would be able to sell analytics very nicely into our installed base. But if what we\u2019re seeing trends out, we could actually be seeing a Trojan Horse, if you will, of analytics, into the non-Salesforce installed base, dragging our customer success platform. So the potential is very strong, and again, we\u2019re in the early days, just to temper everybody\u2019s enthusiasm. But our customers seem to be very enthusiastic, and we\u2019re mobilizing the entire organization around making sure that we can drive our customer success. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Question for Keith Block. On the sales side, can you give us a sense of how far through the sort of realignment and changes that you feel need to be made to get yourself to this kind of vertical organization that you want to have, and sort of what plans do you have in the new fiscal year to get yourselves there? Keith Block : I appreciate the question. I will tell you that, you know, this is a great company, and the company is driven by an incredibly strong culture, and it\u2019s a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. And I think we have to start there. And so to that point, our work is never going to be done, and we will always continue to do better and to innovate and continuously improve and experiment, and we\u2019re not afraid to take risks here.  Obviously, they\u2019re calculated risks and we\u2019re smart about how we do things, but listen, we have said that there are three things that are important as we go to market. One is obviously to speak the language of industry. We think that\u2019s very important, because when you speak to a bank, you need to understand the language of the bank, what the customer challenges are, and what the opportunities are, and how you can apply the customer success platform to that business problem. The second is to build up the largest ecosystem in the world, and that takes many forms, starting with SIs and boutiques and agencies which are key influencers, obviously. It\u2019s also about ISVs, and we\u2019re doing some terrific work with ISVs. We kind of revamped our ISV process. And then resellers for coverage. So that\u2019s the second area. And then the third is our international expansion, and you can see the results already starting to happen, for example, in Asia Pac and Europe. And we continue to invest across the board in our distribution capacity, adding more AEs, more reps, more selling capacity, opening our data centers and expanding our partner networks. So this is an ongoing process. We\u2019re obviously seeing traction over the last 12 months. So again, we\u2019ll always, always be inspecting to see what we can optimize. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan : Just on the vertical industry strategy, I guess it\u2019s a question for Keith, aside from the actual verticalization of the sales organization, what are the sorts of things we should be looking for in terms of product enhancements or partner enhancements to the platform that could drive further penetration into particular verticals? Keith Block : So I would look at this in multiple dimensions. So number one is obviously equipping and arming our sales team so that when they\u2019re in front of the customer, they are speaking the language of the customer. So we want to make sure that they\u2019re enabled and ready and we\u2019re giving them the right content. Number two is in certain markets - and we already have this today - organizing geographically by vertical. So for example in the broader market today, here in the United States, we have a financial services vertical sales team that wakes up every day and they call just on financial services accounts. And we also have the same thing for healthcare and life sciences. So that\u2019s another access that you can look at. The third is actually developing product, creating product, that Salesforce builds organically, and you know, we have some announcements that we\u2019ll be releasing soon, so we don\u2019t want to get into that right now, but we will be in the position where in certain industries that are very, very important to us and strategic to us, we will be building out some product. And then the last is cultivating this ISV community, our partner community, and that is super important. We signed an agreement with one ISV in the quarter that we consider to be very, very strategic, and it\u2019s around really two industries. One is around telecommunications and the other one is around insurance. And they will continue to enhance and extend our footprint so that they have industry relevant apps on our customer success platform. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel. Tom Roderick : I wanted to switch gears and talk a little about the Marketing Cloud, particularly see if we can get an update on some of the technical integration that\u2019s gone on over the last several months. And beyond just the technical integration, as you look at the interplay between Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, can you talk a little bit more about how Pardot is progressing in the B2B marketing automation world? Marc Benioff : Well, I think starting with Pardot, I mean, it\u2019s one of our heated success stories of the year. We\u2019ve just had a phenomenal growth rate. It was the unpolished jewel inside the exact target, the ecosystem. We broke it off, and we run it separately, and we\u2019ve invested in it very significantly. We\u2019ve also integrated it into our core, and the leader of the unit has done just a phenomenal job. And I could not be happier with that. It\u2019s run out of our Atlanta headquarters, and the team in Atlanta has just exceeded our expectations. I would also now kind of point to, today, just before World Tour, we had a press event and launched our new Social Studio. You saw the vision for this incredible new capabilities with all of our social products, not just our social advertising products, that you\u2019ve seen at social.com, but the next generation of our social listening products, social publishing and social engagement platforms. The team has done a great job.  Today, that product is disintermediated from our core marketing platform, and you are correct in intuiting the next step is the social studio will become an integrated part of our marketing cloud, deeply integrated into the Journey Builder itself. And when that happens, I think you\u2019re really going to see all of these assets come together in an incredible new way, as well as deep integration into our Salesforce1 platform. We\u2019ve now owned the ExactTarget asset just a little more than a year, and it\u2019s been a very exciting year. We\u2019ve obviously created the next generation of the leadership team that has performed very, very well. We\u2019ve also delivered a next generation of a structure where the product teams are deeply integrated with our core Salesforce product teams under our president, Alex Dayon. And distribution is run directly by Keith. So the functional integration has happened, the product integration is underway, and I think if you saw the demonstrations today, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d say that our products are state of the art, and I\u2019m sure you can see from the financial numbers, we\u2019re very excited about where we\u2019ve gotten.  Acquisitions are hard. I can tell you that myself. We\u2019ve done a couple dozen acquisitions in the last five years. They\u2019re super high risk. Not all of them are successful. You aren\u2019t able to bring the revenue forward and grow it in all acquisitions. In this case, you see the revenue growing in a significant way, and we have a lot of dreams and hopes for this cloud. What I\u2019m excited about the marketing cloud is the macro view, is that our customers want from us a customer success platform, and you can\u2019t deliver a customer success platform without a strong marketing component. We have that. We have a best of breed capability. So we\u2019ve got the sales capability in the customer success platform, the service, the marketing, analytics, community, as well as with Heroku, the ability to build highly customized customer facing apps. It\u2019s a very, very exciting moment for Salesforce with these six core clouds, all underway and all engaged. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Marc, you\u2019re always great with bold predictions, and given the excitement with analytics cloud and the comment that you and Keith made that you see this as being the most successful cloud you\u2019ve ever launched, thinking about how customers can leverage this product, either existing Salesforce customers and new ones across their businesses, any predictions on how fast this could ramp to a billion in billings? Marc Benioff : Well, I would be happy to give you that, and it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have that, I certainly do, but I am not going to do that, Heather, and I\u2019ll tell you why, which is that in these new products, you\u2019re never really completely sure what the next step is. You talk to my team, and they know I am super optimistic about what we\u2019ve seen, not just in what we\u2019ve developed, but what we\u2019re seeing with customer traction. We have a few other things we want to deliver in the next six months for this product, which will, I think, blow everyone away. And I think I can start to make those predictions by, I would say, within one or two quarters of getting fully ramped. We have a big ACB number, which is our kind of first year contract value number, for this product, for this year, and if we deliver that number, then I\u2019ll be happy to give you the billion dollar prediction.  Make no mistake, Heather, my goal is not just a billion dollars product line that we call [AOV] with the analytics cloud. It\u2019s far beyond that. But I don\u2019t want to get into specifics of when and how we\u2019re going to be able to do that. Just know that I\u2019m extremely optimistic about what is possible. And now Keith just needs to go out and sell it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard : I guess I have to follow up on that question with some more bold predictions, since you seem to be in a good prediction making mood. How about on the service cloud? Service cloud is probably one of the areas, if we look at at-scale, still growing, high growth, big, massive replacement opportunity potential. When does something like service cloud start to match the sales cloud, and what are you guys seeing maybe from a customer standpoint in terms of actually moving off of legacy call centers? And Keith, if you want to talk about the Verizon deal, if you can share any more color on that, that would be great. Marc Benioff : Yeah, let me take the first part, and I\u2019ll shoot it over to Keith. You know, number one, you\u2019ve seen us deliver now the first $3 billion cloud with sales, and you don\u2019t have to go very far to put together the numbers that we now report with sales cloud to see that service cloud is probably not far behind. The exact timing of when that service cloud can get to that level, you\u2019re going to have to do the model yourself. I have my model, you\u2019ll have your model.  But there\u2019s no doubt that service cloud has that kind of capability and more in it, and it\u2019s pure potentiality at this point, and Keith is closing some terrific deals with service cloud, because really these other vendors have not delivered in the service area. And by the way, before I move on to Keith, if you haven\u2019t been tracking it, it\u2019s not just service cloud on the high end, it\u2019s also desk.com on the low end. And if you haven\u2019t been to www.desk.com and given yourself an account and seen the huge traction on desk.com or seen what that team has done, we have got an incredible executive running desk.com and is doing a great job at the very, very, very low end of the market.  But let me have Keith talk about the mainstream, high end enterprise capability, with service cloud. Keith Block : You know, service cloud, I think, it\u2019s a whole area that I think is very, very interesting, because it certainly is an area where companies want to go and have the opportunity to take on a major transformation, because as you know, many companies are always looking for that area to differentiate themselves, and service is certainly one. And more and more companies want to differentiate from their competition by improving their service in many, many ways. And a lot of that is leveraging our customer success platform.  And I could talk about Verizon, but Verizon probably doesn\u2019t want me to get into too much detail, specifically, about how they\u2019re leveraging the platform, because there may be some competitive advantage there. So I have to be sensitive to that.  But just generally speaking, we are finding significant interest from some major corporations to work with us and collaborate with us to extend and enhance our service cloud offering, which gives you an indication of the interest that they\u2019re looking to work with us on. So I think that\u2019s very, very existing. We also have some companies that have gone on record. I mean, if you talk to GE, they talk about transforming into a service company, and certainly they want to do that with our assistance by leveraging, again, our customer success platforms.  Suffice it to say, it is a major transformational opportunity for a lot of enterprise organizations, and the great news is that they want to talk to us, and they\u2019re working very closely with us to make that happen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Brendan Barnicle : Marc, you mentioned on the call this impressive transaction growth that you had, this over 60% transaction growth. As we were monitoring that through the quarter, we saw a particular spike in September. Can you give us any color on what might be spiking those transactions so dramatically? Marc Benioff : Before I get into that, let me just say that when we talk about service cloud, one of the reasons it\u2019s so successful is there\u2019s no technical separation between sales cloud and service cloud and the platform and community. That is, this is one code base, and of course we label it and market it, and we deliver it as different SKUs, but unlike other software companies, these are not like separate disks that you can get, this is one integrated service.  And of course marketing cloud is an acquisition that we are working to integrate into that core system, but that core kind of if you will it\u2019s a monolithic code base with sales, service, community, and analytics is actually deeply integrated and is an extension of that core.  It\u2019s kind of unprecedented. When we added Lightning in the service cloud, we added Lightning in the sales cloud, we added Lightning into community. When we add Salesforce1, we add it into each of those things simultaneously, because it\u2019s the same code. And I really want to just point that out as one of the reasons that service cloud has had such an incredible success.  And if you look at service cloud against any other cloud company, that\u2019s amazing in terms of its size. But also, if you look at our growth for next year, you might note that we\u2019re going to grow more next year than I think the second largest enterprise cloud company in absolute numbers. That is, we will add another cloud company on just through our organic growth next year, which is kind of amazing. And I think it\u2019s kind of lost by a lot of people, about what\u2019s really happening right now with Salesforce. So it is a very exciting time.  In regards to September, when you see those transaction spikes, and many times it\u2019s actually linked to fiscal quarters associated with our customers closing their quarters. So most companies are organized around fiscal quarters, calendar quarters, and so you will see a spike, for example, in September, like what you saw, because a lot of customer activity tends to happen around a quarter close, and that\u2019s what happened probably at the end of the third fiscal quarter, which is, for most companies, the end of September, not for Salesforce, but for probably the majority of customers that we have on our system. So that probably answers your question. Anyway, I want to thank you so much. I want to congratulate Larry Baer and the San Francisco Giants for winning the World Series. I want to congratulate my team for delivering the first enterprise cloud company that\u2019s giving $6.5 billion of guidance for a fiscal year, and I want to thank all of you for coming to the New York City event today, as well as for coming to Dreamforce. Okay? And thanks so much for attending the call.",

With all that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks very much, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We had a monster quarter and it was just a great finish to yet another year of exceptional growth and customer success. First, before I get into this I just want to congratulate all of 15,000 salesforce employees for just an amazing year. Our quarter \u2013 you just look at this year after delivering more than $5 billion in annual revenue, we're guiding now to a $6 billion annual revenue run rate in the next quarter. So this is the fastest software company to reach $5 billion and in 90 days, we're going to be on the phone with you talking about that we're the fastest software company to reach $6 billion. And if you can look at our deferred revenue and $9 billion in book business on and off the balance sheet, you can just straight line out. My dream is crystal clear to be the first soft \u2013 first one and fastest to $10 billion, first in the cloud, fastest to $10 billion in software and then onward. Now, I'd like to share the results from our fourth quarter and our fiscal 2015. As you can see, revenue for the fourth quarter has rose at 26% from a year ago to $1.44 billion. For the full fiscal year, revenue grew 32% to nearly $5.4 billion. That is just an awesome result for the year. No other software company of our size or scale is growing at this double-digit rate, and you can see all the single-digit growers in enterprise software who think that they are competitors, where they're just not able to take advantage of this opportunity. Deferred revenue grew 32% year-over-year to more than $3.3 billion. And the dollar value of book business on and off the balance sheet, as I said, is now more than $9 billion. There's no better predictor of our future revenue than looking at those numbers. And as we deliver this phenomenal pace of top-line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 175 basis points, exceeding our guidance, and you're going to hear our commitment to continue that incredible momentum. So we're not just focused on the top-line and growing the top-line. As we've been talking about for more than a year now, we're also focused on growing the bottom-line as well. This translated into another excellent year in operating cash. We delivered more than $1 billion \u2013 $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, that's up 34% year-over-year and we're the first cloud computing company to deliver more than a $1 billion in operating cash flow. Looking to fiscal 2016, we are delighted to be raising our guidance to $6.52 billion at the high end of our range and while we're pleased to have exceeded our non-GAAP operating margin guidance last year, we're committed to improving non-GAAP operating margin moving forward. And once again, we expect to deliver an additional 125 basis points to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement despite this foreign exchange headwind that everybody is going through and to deliver another year of strong operating cash flow. Okay. So here we are. salesforce.com, now the sixth largest software company in the world, the number one cloud computing company in the world, very unique in the industry. We've got a complete, trusted Customer Success Platform built from the ground up or cloud. The social, mobile and data science world, and with six world-class apps that is we have six engines for growth. Of course, our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Marketing Cloud, our Community Cloud, our new Wave Analytics platform and our app development (6:50). It's one unified Customer Success Platform delivered on our trusted enterprise environment. I couldn't be more excited about how all of our clouds are doing. I think that if you look to what I'm most excited about got to be our newest cloud, the Analytics Cloud, just 120 days old on \u2013 this is off to an incredibly fast start of any product in our history, and I've never seen anything like it. I saw the new version of it that's coming out at Dreamforce in September yesterday. That completely took me aback. I haven't seen technology like this delivered in the analytics industry. Salesforce is crossing over from the CRM industry into the analytics industry with this product. It's an app development environment. It's mobile. It's built for everyone. I use it. All of our employees can use it. You can ask any of our employees for a demonstration of it. It's really just an awesome product and I've never seen a product take off with the speed and velocity that this product is going. And of course, I have to just mention our Salesforce1 platform, the foundation of everything we do, become the number one platform development in enterprise cloud apps. And I guess what I love about that ecosystem that surrounds this whole company with more than 2 million developers, more than 2,600 apps, installed more than 2.8 million times through our AppExchange, and you look at another 4 million apps now on Heroku platform. This company is so much more than our six apps. It's really our ecosystem that continues to fuel our growth and the company has done a fantastic job building a platform, and not an application. Now, we've delivered 177 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter. That's up 68% from a year ago. You can see our usage rates are soaring. Customers are using our product more aggressively than ever before. That's an average of nearly 3 billion enterprise transactions every single business day. That's unprecedented in enterprise technology. No other enterprise platform comes close to that. And I have to mention our foundation. They are doing a fantastic job. We've added more than 4,000 non-profit and higher education organizations managed by them, bringing the total to more than 24,000 non-profit and NGOs that are using salesforce. Also, we have delivered over $19 million in grants bringing our total foundation grants to $80 million and our employees have volunteered 262,000 hours this year bringing our total to 840,000 hours of volunteered and we're getting ready to break through that million hours of volunteering which is something I'm extremely proud of. Great work with all of our employees that we're not only doing well, but we're doing good. It's just an incredible year for Salesforce. I want to congratulate the entire company. Fortune magazine just said we're the most admired software company in the world, again, that's the third year in a row, the most admired software company. Forbes magazine says we're the most innovative company in the world. Forbes has said that now four years in a row, most admired and most innovative. And I couldn't be more excited about our future. Looking forward to seeing you all next week at the Morgan Stanley Conference. And if you have an opportunity to see us at any of our events or programs, this quarter, we are going to be all over the world event, how many events are we doing in Q1? Unverified Participant : 355. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So we're going to be doing 355 events this quarter all over the world. I will be at many of them but not all of them. And I hope that you will join us, whether you are in London or Paris or New York, whether it's Melbourne or Tokyo, Amsterdam and you can experience the power of salesforce of the cloud, social, mobile world coupled with data science and analytics. I mean, this is just a sight to behold and I just want to congratulate everyone in the company for creating the first company, first cloud company to ever get to $5 billion. But we're the fastest software company ever to $5 billion and can't wait to get on the call, 90 days to tell you about, the fastest company to $6 billion. And now, let's turn it over to Keith. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Thanks, Marc. There's a lot of great things to say about this quarter, but the thing I'd like to say is how proud I really am about our performance in FY 2015 and really the outstanding work that I saw in the quarter and in the year and I want to congratulate, as Marc said, just an incredibly high-performing team, a super high-performing team, once again for their, I would call, sustained excellence. As far as how we ended the year, suffice it to say that we fired another shot across the bow to the legacy antiquated on-premise software companies and our competition and, Marc, you just said this, and I absolutely agree. It was an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year, and Q4 was a capstone to this outstanding year. So this was a year in FY 2015 that we saw customers not only embracing but evangelizing our vision for the Customer Success Platform and more and more CEOs, CEOs, which is incredible, are realizing how Salesforce can help drive growth and customer success. And I will tell you, they are incredible, incredible advocates for us. And that's one of the big reasons why we signed more large deals in fiscal 2015 than in any year in the history of the company. So for fiscal 2015, we closed nearly 550 seven- and eight-figure transactions. That's roughly 100 more than it was last year. And not only is the number of large transactions getting bigger, but the value of the transactions is increasing. In fact, a number of eight-figure transactions in fiscal 2015 increased by 33% from a year ago. So no other cloud computing is closing transactions like these of this size and this scale and this volume. The execution by our teams to achieve these results has been just simply phenomenal. So we've been talking about this for a while. It's very clear to me that our customers want a more meaningful relationship with salesforce. They're not just buying a single cloud. They are betting their businesses on our vision. And we are absolutely executing at scale in every region, across every segment and in every major industry. And as our relationships are only getting stronger and more strategic, I'm going to take some examples \u2013 share some examples with you that I think you'll be excited about. ABB, Time Warner, Merck, all amazing companies, and they're all betting their businesses on us. And I'll start with one of the leading CPG companies in the world. They've been using salesforce to great success globally. After speaking with them at Dreamforce, it was pretty clear we shared a vision towards transforming the future in Q4. I'm happy to say we strengthened our partnership, we've closed one of the largest deals that we've ever done in the consumer packaged goods industry. And for the first time, they plan to bring together their entire sales and customer support teams to one platform, our Customer Success Platform, with our Service Cloud. And what's really interesting about this is that we're helping them connect their front office and their legacy back office, supply chain systems, giving them a very seamless experience. So we are moving from an integration perspective into legacy system supply chains. I don't know if anybody would have thought of Salesforce that way in the past. ABB. We've talked about them before. They are a $40 billion leader in power and automation technologies, another great example in Q4. Marc and I met with their CEO in Davos last month, and we talked about how his industry is transforming and where he wants to take the company. As part of that transformation, he's placing Salesforce at the center of his strategy to help drive top-line growth. So in the quarter, ABB decided to replace more than a dozen legacy CRM systems worldwide with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. It was a great win against both SAP and Microsoft. Time Warner Cable, again, another great brand, very strategic win in the quarter. They've been leveraging our Service Cloud and our Salesforce1 Platform to drive their mobile strategy. In Q4, they also selected the Analytics Cloud. Marc talked about that and how excited we are. And it will give Time Warner Cable an unbelievable opportunity to have powerful insights across their enterprise. As Marc said earlier, there's enormous enthusiasm for Analytics Cloud. It's every CEO's dream to put analytics in the hands of every employee, and it's important to note that our analytics product is integrated right into our platform. That means the customers can connect any data set, whether it's SAP, Oracle, Microsoft or any other legacy technology right into the metadata layer of Salesforce platform. I will tell you in my entire career I've never seen so much enthusiasm from our customers for a solution like this or our partners. Our complete CRM and analytics platform with an open ecosystem built natively for the cloud, very exciting, people are really excited about this. Another great story is Merck in Germany, another very exciting customer expansion in the quarter for our team. They've been a Sales Cloud customer for many years. Recently, they wanted to accelerate innovation across their geographies and their businesses. So this quarter they expanded with Service Cloud, the Salesforce1 Platform and again, Analytics Cloud. And it really is enabling to build custom applications, drive collaboration across their R&D departments, and again, drive insights across the company and, by the way, right in SAP's backyard. I'm also pleased to continue to see attraction across our industry strategy particularly in financial services and again, this is all about speaking the language of the customer. In fact, this quarter, we've significantly expanded our relationship with one of the largest U.S. financial services firms. It is a premier company that is using the Customer Success Platform to make their sales teams and their wealth managers wildly more effective with their customers. So those are just a few of the wins in the quarter. There were many more at Amtrak and Boston Scientific, Fujitsu, Home Depot, Ingersoll-Rand, LinkedIn, LIXIL, MassMutual, Pearson, the Royal Bank of Canada, the State of Colorado and the list goes on and on. So I have to tell you I'm very, very proud of the team and the progress that they've made and the level of trust they're establishing with their customers. We also saw great momentum in our business globally. We accelerated our investments in Europe and Asia this year, adding more distribution capacity, and expanding our partner ecosystem. We opened up a U.K. data center and we'll have two more to follow in Germany and France as well. And it's obvious that our international investments are clearly paying off. We saw remarkable deal growth internationally. And I want to say one word about our partners. As Marc mentioned earlier, we have the largest cloud ecosystem in the world, and the largest that we did this quarter, in fact, was the signing of global agreement with one of the world's top software companies. And not only will they be using our solutions to run their business, but they're also moving their products to the cloud with Salesforce which is very, very exciting, so stay-tuned for more of that. So we're incredibly well-positioned for the future. We're well on our way to becoming the most strategic and influential technology company in the industry. And again, I want to thank everyone at Salesforce for delivering an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year, and I would like to thank our customers and our partners and our employees for their continued commitment to us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Great. Thanks, Keith. We had a great quarter to finish off a very strong year as you just called out. (19:00) financial goals exceeding our non-GAAP operating margin, operating cash flow and EPS guidance. I could not be more pleased with the results. On today's call, I'll be focusing my commentary on two key topics related to our results detailed in our earnings release. As you know, we continue to see significant moves in foreign exchange rates which impacted both our top-line and bottom-line results for the fourth quarter and the full year. From a top-line perspective, we delivered Q4 constant currency revenue growth of 29% year-over-year excluding the headwind of approximately $34 million. Sequentially, we saw headwind of $21 million, and for the full year revenue was up 33% excluding an FX headwind of $32 million. Not only does FX impact revenue in aggregate, it also affects revenue by cloud, with a disproportionate impact on specific clouds. For example, Sales Cloud is the most widely distributed product with the most international exposure relative to other products and therefore the FX has a more pronounced impact on those results. Conversely, revenue from Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas with little impact of foreign exchange. On the topic of international, we had another strong quarter and year in our geographies with constant currency growth in EMEA of more than 30%, and Asia-Pac of more than 25%. Now, a dollar attrition (20:21) for the fourth quarter excluding Marketing Cloud remained between 9% and 10%. From a bottom-line perspective, we expanded full year non-GAAP operating margins by 175 basis points over last year, coming in ahead of our prior guidance. We also increased full year non-GAAP EPS by nearly 50% year-over-year. We were pleased to exceed our operating margin and EPS goals during the year even as we absorb the RelateIQ acquisition. This is a great result as we drive more discipline and efficiency throughout the company while continuing to invest in the innovation that our customers have come to expect. This margin increase contributed to a record level of operating cash flow as we delivered nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015, up 34% over last year. CapEx as a percent of revenue for the full year was approximately 5%. It was principally related to leasehold improvements and to a lesser extent new data center buildups. With CapEx at the low end of guidance, free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $883 million for the full year, up 53% from last year. Now, looking at deferred revenue, we delivered another strong quarter with growth of 32% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $67 million, deferred revenue grew 35% over last year. FX also reduced revenue sequentially \u2013 deferred revenue sequentially by approximately $44 million. It's worth noting that the deferred revenue benefited from a couple of items. First is the invoice duration. In the quarter, 85% of the (22:02) were issued with annual terms. This is up four percentage points over last year and was more than we anticipated, frankly. Second, we saw a slight benefit from Marketing Cloud contract renewals that were written down as part of the normal purchase accounting related to ExactTarget which has now (22:21) benefit. Moving on to guidance, while we delivered strong financial results in fiscal 2015, we continue to face an increasingly difficult foreign exchange environment. Since November, the dollar continued to appreciate against most of the major currencies. As a result, we now anticipate an incremental $50 million of FX headwind for a total of $175 million to $200 million in FY 2016. Keep in mind that we have more international revenue pressure than we do expense relief. Therefore, FX also has an impact on operating margin which we expect will cost 25 basis points to 50 basis points of headwind in FY 2015. Despite these FX headwinds, our great results and momentum allows to raise our fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.475 billion to $6.520 billion, and we also plan on increasing our non-GAAP operating margin by an additional 125 basis points to 150 basis points this year. As a result, we anticipate full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 to $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS estimate assumes that (23:34) will continue to be a net expense, our non-GAAP tax rate will be 36.5% and no significant M&A activity. We anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 22% to 23% and CapEx to be roughly 5% to 7% of revenue. For Q1, we anticipate revenue of $1.485 billion to $1.505 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.13, $0.14 and deferred revenue in the mid to high 20% range. So, to close, despite significant FX headwinds, we delivered very strong fiscal 2015 results with revenues, deferred revenue and operating cash flow growth of more than 30%, while expanding our non-GAAP operating margins. Very few software companies have a leadership position in one product category, let alone in multiple product categories. With our world-class Customer Success Platform, we are well-positioned to continue our industry-leading growth in FY 2016. Also, we expect to continue to improve non-GAAP operating margins consistent with the framework we laid out at the Analyst Day. At this point, I'd also like to thank our salesforce team for helping deliver an amazing result. It is just inspiring to me. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Your first question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Thank you very much. A question for Marc Benioff. I, of course, saw your commentary about reaching $5 billion in revenue faster than any other enterprise software company, and aspiring to be the fastest to reach $10 billion. And meanwhile there are so many signs of accelerating momentum, looking through the billings growth, the deferred revenue growth, the Service Cloud growth, the platform growth; they're all actually accelerating and those markets are very large. So I'm wondering if the current offerings can carry you to $10 billion or even $15 billion in revenue. And if you have ever sketched out a path to a level beyond that, what else do you think could logically fit into the portfolio? And perhaps is it possible you would define e-commerce as a part of the CRM stack at some point? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I really appreciate that question and I think you really don't have to go any farther than looking at our book business on and off the balance sheet at $9 billion to ask yourself the question are we going to $10 billion? I mean $10 billion will be fueled primarily by that. I can tell you more or less where revenue will be a year from now or even two years from now because you can kind of look at deferred. We don't do that because there can be changes in foreign exchange, there can be changes in other characteristics of the business, but if you look back now, Salesforce has been a public company for over 10 years. You can see how our deferred model has played out with the kind of consistent revenue growth, even through 2008 or even through dark times, the deferred continue to pay out on to the top-line. So I don't think the question is about are we \u2013 certainly my \u2013 (27:15) my mind there's no question that that's going to happen. I think it's all about where we are going beyond that. And as we cross through that threshold, what are the different clouds and capabilities, will we have to invest in to make that happen? I'm very excited about the transformations and changes and shifts that the company is investing in data science and analytics, and the next idea that it's not just about the cloud, social or mobile anymore, it's also about fueling the analytical corporation, fueling the analytical CEO. I thought that Ram Shriram had a fantastic article in Fortune magazine this month on the analytical business and what that means. And we want to fuel that. We want to fuel that kind of capability that gives our customers not just world-class execution in sales and service and marketing and community, we want to give them the ability to have analytics platforms, analytics apps, analytics ecosystems that fuel that future. And that's, I think, our biggest, most exciting revenue opportunity going forward. The CRM market is big and exciting and has fueled us, will continue to fuel us. The analytics market is just as big and just as exciting. I think some would say the analytics market is bigger than the CRM market. And our initial indications of that are that's true. And that's why we're investing and I couldn't be more excited about the Analytics Cloud in our Wave platform. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question. Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks so much and good quarter. First, Keith, I wonder if you could talk about verticals. You had mentioned that at Dreamforce that we'll be hearing more soon about your approach to addressing vertical markets. As I recall, Siebel Systems had about 22 verticals that they addressed, and right now you guys kind of have only one or so verticals. And also, maybe for Mark Hawkins, on the sequential increase in the Sales Cloud, I heard your comments on FX. It looks like it was up only about 1% sequentially. That even if I assumed it's flat, and take that on the first year-over-year number, we're going to have, which is April, it's still about 10%. So is it fair to assume that when we start getting the numbers \u2013 year-over-year numbers that Sales Cloud's still going to be, on a constant currency basis, a double-digit growth business? Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So do you want to take the verticals first, and maybe the... Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yes. Why don't I do that? So, Rick, thanks for asking the question. So we're very excited about our industry strategy, and it takes many flavors. I think the reason why the company continues to get such traction with these enterprise customers and really customers of any size and any geography is because when we talk to these customers, we are speaking in the language of the customer. So that's kind of point number one. We are focused really on six industries right now. And all of that is equipping our folks with the solutions and the messages that our customer's really demanding and asking for. So we're listening to our customers. And we will be making some announcements shortly about some exciting stuff that we're doing with the products around our industries but we also \u2013 and I want to go back to a point that Marc made about our AppExchange and our ecosystem. We have the largest ecosystem in the world for the cloud. And we are driving incredible success with a number of our ISVs who have taken our platform because they obviously have confidence in that platform. And they are building their solutions around industries. We signed up some pretty strategic partnerships this fiscal year. We continue to do it. You look at the statistics on our AppExchange, several of those are also vertically oriented. So we are really driving industry messaging into the marketplace, whether it's our own industry messaging, our organic product, the highly configurable cloud solutions that we have, whether it's our AppExchange and our ISVs and our ecosystems. This really resonates with customers. And this is something that Siebel never had. They never had a \u2013 as you know, they were not a platform company. They were never in a position where they could drive an ecosystem with vertical extensions the way that we're able to do it. So we're getting a lot of traction, and we're really excited. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So let me take the second part of the question, Rick. In terms of the sales revenue by cloud, a couple of different things. First of all, foreign exchange, yes, there's an impact there. To your point, what we're assuming right now is sequential performance right now. And I'm looking forward to it into Q1. You'll be able to see the year-on-year and, of course, you'll see that with all the dynamics that are going on there including whatever foreign exchange is there. So I think I can get to the spirit of the question that you're asking. The spirit of the question is the SFA market is a double-digit market, according to Gartner, it's been that way \u2013 projected to be that way for a long period of time. We have not only done well in that market with a double-digit growing market but we've also put share for the last decade consistently. And so that's what's happened historically. We don't guide by cloud. But that's a very effective market as Marc has talked about, and we'll know \u2013 you'll be able to see a lot more when we anniversary the actual revenue by cloud. Hope that helps, Rick. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Keith, a question for you on the traction with the larger enterprise deals. I'm just curious if you could give us a little more color. You have some phenomenal logos that you're reading through. But is there anything quantitatively you can share with us what you're seeing in the success of \u2013 as you've gone upstream? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, listen \u2013 thanks for the question. I think \u2013 first of all, I think that the numbers were astounding. We're incredibly proud. I'm certainly proud of the work that the team has done, and I think it is proof positive about the relationships that we're building strategically with these customers. You don't do these types of deals at scale and volume unless you're successfully getting mind share and building those great relationships. We've got \u2013 over the year and certainly in the quarter, we've done some wonderful work with some of the best brands and the best companies in the world. Like 3M and ABB, Time Warner I mentioned, obviously. And some of these I could not mention before by name. But there are just many, many examples of us doing an incredible job, building more and more traction and becoming more meaningful. And now, I have to tell you part of this comes from the opportunity for us to really unshackle either legacy SAP environments or have \u2013 give customers the opportunity to transform their business models, because they've really been shackled by legacy technology for years. And with this absolute convergence of cloud and social and mobile, it really gives us an opportunity to talk about what our Customer Success Platform can do for them, generally speaking. I mean, Marc and I had the opportunity to spend some time with Brian Moynihan in Davos and we talked about how CFAs (34:30) transforming their business. And those are the types of meaningful relationships that we're really talking about here. So, again, we're very excited about what's going on. And a lot of our growth initiatives are really taking some traction here. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Terry Tillman with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. Terry F. Tillman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my question is on the Wave Analytics product. I know it's still early but in terms of the deals that you're signing or the deal opportunities, are you seeing large enterprise deals? Or are these still more try it before you really buy it kind of departmental level deals? And then typically are you replacing something that's a legacy DI (35:08) vendor or is this kind of greenfield investments for the analytics solution? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, we've never seen a product take off with these kind of numbers before. In the fourth quarter which was the first quarter that we sold the Wave Analytics Cloud. We saw a lot of very large transactions, probably the very largest transactions that happened in the analytics industry happened on our platform. And we were really taken aback by that. We've decided to focus with dedicated distribution personnel this fiscal year because of that. We've also made a very significant investment and upgrade and the number of people working on the product. And this is the real deal. I mean we really have a world-class product on our hands. And in our minds the way we think is, we only want to focus on those multi-billion dollar opportunities or as we call them clouds. And there's just no doubt in our mind that this is \u2013 has all the makings of that. And of course, we keep track of what all the startups are doing and we're very friendly with them, and even a part of our ecosystem or attend our trade shows. They cannot even \u2013 their bookings can't even compare to what our team did in the fourth quarter. So very excited about that and when I look at some of the names that closed in the fourth quarter on the Analytics Cloud the one that I love that I've profiled at Dreamforce which is GE Capital, and if you get and watch that video that's on YouTube, I mean, what they say is true. You just can't run your business without this product. This is just one \u2013 this is the greatest product, I think, salesforce has ever built and it's going to just transform the way our customers run their business, not just run their sales, service and marketing. I mean this is a enterprise-wide, enterprise-grade capability to fuel the analytical corporation. And it's not just an app. It's a platform. It's going to have a robust ecosystem. It's got \u2013 every characteristic that we like to make our bookings and revenues happen in our largest and most important customers. And to that end, it's not just enterprise and very large enterprise deals, it's also, yes, departmental deals, it's even deals in non-profits and NGOs. I mean it's amazing the democratic nature of the pipeline and deal flow already. Do you want to talk about any of the deals that you closed in the fourth quarter on the Analytics Cloud? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah. Again, I'm going to go back to a comment that I made earlier. In my entire career, I've never seen as much excitement, both internally and externally about a product launch. I mean, again, I'll go back to Davos. We had a nice little area in Davos. It was overrun with customers and prospects, and you know the type of people who attend Davos. And they all had incredible interest of looking at what Analytics Cloud meant and what it could do for them. And Marc did plenty of demos, I did plenty of demos, and we signed up some great companies. I mean Merck is obviously a great global brand. In the quarter, they went with the Analytics Cloud, Time Warner Cable went with the Analytics Cloud, (38:30) with the Analytics Cloud. And that's on top of many that we signed up before. So it's all good. We're very excited. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Question for Marc or Keith on the Service Cloud. It's now 27% of your subscription revenues, your fastest growing segment. Your partners are quite positive about it. I just wanted to ask, is this really a function of salesforce on the sales execution front doing a better job selling it into your Sales Cloud customer base? Has the product improved? What's the key driver of that growth? And then a follow-up for Mark Hawkins. You gave your April quarter DR guide of mid- to high-20% range. I presume that's U.S. dollars. Just curious what you're assuming in terms of a likely FX hit in the April quarter on DR? Thank you. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think I just want to make some initial comments and then I'll let Keith chime in. And the first thing is you look at our competitors and their work in good customer service area. Number one, Oracle, they bought right now \u2013 they have their own Fusion service product. They took Fusion, they turned it into confusion. Oracle keeps saying they're growing more quickly than anyone else in the cloud. Well, that's very easy to do when you're starting at zero. And Service Cloud from Oracle, that's a great example. This is not a multibillion dollar business for Oracle like it is for us. They have not been able to execute. They don't have a multi-tenant shared, scalable, mobile, social, integrated analytics customer Service Cloud and then move on to SAP. They will just come into customers and say just use Hana. And it's like but for what and how? And unload the software into your company. First of all, I think the number one thing about this customer service revolution that's going on and why Service Cloud is delivering phenomenal results is the traditional keepers of the customer service information for these customers, Oracle and SAP, have just not delivered. And we have. We have a very clear vision that we want to transform how our customers not only grow their top-line with our Sales Cloud, which we've done unbelievably well, and you can see it into the multiple billions of dollars. But now, we have this second huge multibillion dollar growth engine with Service Cloud. And our competitors have not been able to execute. They just don't have \u2013 they're delivering new versions when our customers want new visions. And that is where we are right now in the customer service marketplace. And why Gartner says we have the number one customer service product. But anyway, Keith, maybe you can tell us \u2013 you're out there every day selling that product with the customers. What's your perspective? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah. I think what's interesting is that many companies want to differentiate themselves with service. And they're looking for incredible capability to do that. And obviously, we have a very compelling story, and if I just look at some of our top wins, I would say at least half of these top wins had Service Cloud. And so if I think about Amtrak or ABB, Boston Scientific, Ingersoll-Rand, Merck, Pearson; these are all Service Cloud wins. So this is a compelling product. It's a compelling solution. It's actually the source of quite a few of our competitive takeouts, particularly in kind of legacy providers whether it's SAP or Oracle. There's a lot of Siebel replacements going on right now. So this is a great product and it's a great solution and our customers love it. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Let me talk about the last part. (42:46) you asked about the deferred revenue for Q1. We guided it in the mid to high 20%s and you were asking about foreign exchange. That is in U.S. dollars that we've guided. We've given you a sense of perspective for foreign exchange. We called out the entire top-line of the company, $175 million to $200 million of headwind for the total top-line. So you can get a sense of our thinking about foreign exchange. You are correct, that's U.S. dollars that I called out for deferred revenue. I hope that helps. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joel Fishbein with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question. Joel P. Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to take it up more from a bigger perspective in terms of \u2013 we looked at these six engines of growth : Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud but I want to look at it holistically from the customer's perspective. Can you talk about how salesforce \u2013 and give us some specific examples about how salesforce is becoming more strategic as an enterprise provider/solution provider and maybe some examples about how people are buying the solutions holistically and looking at salesforce that way. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that's really a great point. Keith and I have been talking a lot about that. Because in this quarter, what Keith and I were really struck by is in all of our very largest transactions, we were not dealing with the CIO in the company, or the head of sales or the head of service or the head of marketing. We were dealing with the Chief Executive Officer in the company. And that was a huge shock to us. We really either keep their eye on (44:32) our careers going back now a couple of decades, we have not really seen ourselves showing up in the CEO office. And Keith mentioned one and I'll just come back to this which is, here's an example of a great company, which is $43 billion German manufacturer called ABB. And ABB is a great company. They are a very diversified provider of industrial scale energy products and other products. And when ABB did the transaction with us, the CEO was personally involved. And they wanted to issue a press release and issue a statement about the strategic nature of the transaction which we did, which was a very strong eight digit, very healthy transaction, but it was really all about the strategic capability of what ABB is doing with us. What's interesting about the deal was, salesforce and \u2013 ABB is a huge Microsoft customer. I think they've got 40,000 or 50,000 sheets of Microsoft. I mean it's just amazing what Microsoft has done in the account. And salesforce and Microsoft went in hand-in-hand and showed Office 365 deeply integrated with salesforce's services. And we had built a variety of very exciting vertical type functionality into Office 365, using Force.com and our different clouds and automating their business processes. And ABB really has this vision of real-time customer collaboration, but it's all driven by the CEO, okay, and that is a shock to us. And when we look at big deals we did this quarter whether it was General Electric or Coke, or others, okay, the CEO is involved with us. So that's just very exciting. And I think that that is a big change in how our implementations are viewed. We have seen that in Home Depot. We have seen that, of course, at Cisco. We had seen that in \u2013 but we're really seeing it in all the biggest transactions. Keith, do you want to talk about that? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah. I think that it's pretty clear. And I don't think this will be a surprise to anybody that the agenda of a CEO is growth. And our message is all about growth. So there's a natural synergy there. And when we had talked to these customers, they \u2013 ABB is a classic example. Marc mentioned it. But there are countless examples whether it's financial services institutions, again, we talked about Bank of America earlier. It really is about solving a customer problem, speaking the language of industry, and it's not about one Sales Cloud, one Service Cloud. It's about a Customer Success Platform and it's a platform discussion. And again, it fits the growth agenda. So that's why CEOs seemed to be getting more and more involved in this. If I go back to the example that I gave earlier in the call about the strategic agreement that we signed in the quarter, that was a CEO agenda. That's all about growth. So I think the sun and the star and the moon are all aligning here as it relates to the agenda of a CEO and what our messaging is all about. And it's showing up in our results. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I wanted to also mention, I misspoke. It's not a \u2013 ABB is a Zurich \u2013 is based in Zurich, Switzerland, near Davos and not in Germany. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks, guys, and congrats on showing upside both on the billings and bookings line, but also just on operating margin line. It's kind of like the Lego quarter, movie quarter. Everything is awesome. So within sort of in that context, question for both Marks here. Marc B, just from your standpoint, wonder if you could kind of walk through how you sort of imagine, I guess, the evolution of the company here because you've laid out these longer-term revenue targets, but then also on this call, you focused a lot in your prepared remarks on margins. Just from sort of the CEO's perspective, how do you sort of see that give and take there? And then for Mark Hawkins, obviously, at Analyst Day, you laid out the framework for growth and margins. Wonder if you could kind of just reiterate that for everyone, but also put the 20 \u2013 sorry, fiscal 2016 guidance sort of in the context of that? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Well, I think first and foremost, our shareholders have spoken that they want us to keep our non-GAAP operating margin in mind. And for us to \u2013 as we work on our revenue growth plans to have clarity and mindfulness about delivering not just the phenomenal pace of top-line growth, which we certainly have done, but also improve the non-GAAP operating margin as you saw this year by 175 basis points. And that's why this year we're coming in and saying that we're expecting to deliver another 125 basis points to 150 basis points of operating margin while continuing the strong top-line growth. And I think both of these things are now important for salesforce. And we obviously know how to do that. We did it this year. And we plan to do it again in the coming year as well. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And let me just add on to that, Phil. Appreciate the comments about the quarter. I think the guidance when you look at the revenue, 20% to 21%, which is the implied guidance here for the revenue growth in U.S. dollars, plus a headwind that we talked about of $175 million to $200 million, you quickly get a sense of what the constant currency growth rate is. You can see that's matched right in to our revenue margin framework. I think the operating margin to expand that 125 basis points to 150 basis points again after a year that we've just exceeded of 175 basis points plus with the headwind of 25 basis points to 50 basis points due to foreign exchange, it's right in the exact ZIP code of where we want to be. We feel like it's excellent balance in terms of the top-line that Marc talked about, the bottom-line that we talked about and the cash flow (51:15) as well as the growth rate. So we feel really good about where that lines up. And the revenue margin framework is the \u2013 very much something we embrace. Operator : Your final question today will come from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Bhavan S. Suri - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just one for Keith, and congrats, too. But, Keith, just a little bit of color if you could give us on sort of the contribution of the influence of the large SIs like Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG. And then as you look at the concept of the data driven organization and the ability to build some custom (51:52) analytical apps, does it feel reasonable to feel like those large SIs are going to get even more involved given they've all got pretty big analytics practices? And as they do get involved, if that's the case, longer term, is there a chance that we get them to become such an influence that they do drive more leverage on the sales and marketing line because of the reach they provide? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, listen \u2013 thanks. That's a great question. Thank you for the question. As I mentioned earlier, we're obviously very, very excited about the launch of analytics, and our partners are as well. So we have worked very, very hard over the last 12 months to strengthen our relationships with the strategic influencers in the market, be it Accenture or PwC or Deloitte, or cloud sharers (52:32) even some of the regional players. And we think that's very important because they're in the boardroom, and they have the influence with our clients. And we are very aligned around customer engagement and our customer platform and growth strategy for customers. The early returns from these firms are very \u2013 they're very, very excited about what the Analytics Cloud is all about. So that's a natural play for them because they can wrap some incredibly high value-add services around our offering, and really do, I would say, more of the advisory services which are probably more margin services for them. So they're excited, we're excited, we continue to build out those relationships and I think you're just going to continue to see great progress there. Operator : Thank you for your questions. I will now turn the conference back to John Cummings for closing comments. John Cummings - Director- Investor Relations : All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We really appreciate the time and, of course, just to remind everyone that Marc Benioff here will be keynoting the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on Monday, March 2. So look forward to seeing many of you there. Of course, you can always refer questions to us in the interim at Investor at salesforce.com, and of course, we look forward to updating you on our progress this year on \u2013 in May. So thanks very much for joining us. Operator : Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now let me turn the call to Marc. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thanks, John, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. You can just see why I'm so excited because I'm thrilled to report that we had just an outstanding start to our fiscal 2016 and just a great building on the phenomenal momentum from last year. In this quarter, we surpassed the $6 billion annual revenue run rate, and we did that faster than any enterprise software company in history, and we could not be more excited. Our current outlook puts us on track to reach a $7 billion revenue run rate later this year, on the way to being the fastest to reach $10 billion, which is our dream, and something that we are very focused on. I'd like to share the results from the quarter, and revenue for the first quarter rose 23% from a year ago to more than $1.5 billion and constant currency revenue grew even faster at 27%. I mean, you can look at all the other top 10 software companies, no one is delivering this kind of performance. And, as I said, we deliver this amazing growth as we push through the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone. Deferred revenue grew more than $3 billion, up 31% year-over-year and 36% in constant currency. And the dollar value of book business on and off balance sheet is now $9.1 billion, $9.1 billion. That's an increase of nearly $2 billion since last year. That is a very clear indicator of the strength of our future business. Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by nearly 200 basis points this quarter over last year. And as you can see, we're not just focused on growing the top line, we're also growing the bottom line. All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $730 million in operating cash flow which is up 54% year-over-year, and that's just an astonishing number. Given our outstanding first quarter results, I'm thrilled to announce that we are raising our guidance for both our top and bottom line for fiscal year 2016. The high-end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.55 billion, and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.02 to $0.71 at the high-end of our range. As you can see, our strong revenue, deferred revenue, operating cash performance, along with the incredible momentum of our Customer Success Platform puts us on a trajectory to be the fastest enterprise software company to deliver $10 billion in revenue. We're achieving this level of performance and growing faster than the competition because we have a unique platform, really a unique company designed for today's connected world, designed for only one purpose : helping our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way, and ultimately creating customer success. Today, this call is taking place right here from the great city of Chicago. When I've been meeting with some of our great customers today like State Farm and Northern Trust; I've met with hundreds of customer from around the world in recent weeks; I've been on a tour; and next month I'm going to be taking that tour to Europe and spending the summer once again learning from our customers in the region and hearing about all the great things going on over there, and you can just see our European business is just awesome. And every CEO I've met with is feeling the impact of this technology moving faster and faster. Customers and employees are expecting deeper levels of engagement, they're creating these amazing one-on-one journeys, they're more automated, intelligent business processing, everything is going mobile, everything's available on their phone and soon right on our wrist. Well, they're relying on Salesforce, with our metadata-driven technology platform, our six core clouds and incredible, incredible employees, our customer success services team and ecosystem of software developers, systems integrators, service providers, all of them, the whole ecosystem, helping our customers move faster and transform their businesses to be more successful than ever before. That's why Gartner has ranked Salesforce as the worldwide market share leader in the CRM market for 2014, continuing more than a decade of growth and market share gains, while Oracle and SAP continue to fall behind. Well, we can certainly see that from their quarters, can't we? You can see the tremendous growth we've had across our six clouds and how we're outpacing the competition and taking market share at the expense of our competitors. Sales Cloud continues to be the market share leader in SFA by far, and on its own one of the top pure play enterprise cloud companies by revenue in the world. Service Cloud displaced SAP in the quarter and is now the market share leader in customer service and support. Sorry about that, SAP. And the Marketing Cloud, which was born out of our acquisition of ExactTarget two years ago, is now the fastest-growing top five marketing vendor according to the latest Gartner report, taking market share while every other top five vendor is losing. Community Cloud continues to grow its market share and we now have some of our largest partner communities in the world, dozens with more than 100,000 members. Our Wave Analytics Cloud has become a real game changer for us. I've never seen more excitement about this product. I've been demoing it everywhere I go. It's not just an analytics app, it's a platform with a whole ecosystem of partners and development environment that lets you basically build any kind of analytics app our most customers want. You saw us deepen our relationship with Microsoft this quarter with the launch of Wave Connector for Excel which transforms Excel spreadsheets into visual, dynamic graphs in the Analytics Cloud with just a click and we had a phenomenal demonstration of exciting new technology that we're building with Microsoft at their Build Conference, and we also saw more revelation of that at Ignite. And we also launched Analytics Cloud for the Apple Watch, the first enterprise app for Apple's amazing new wearable, and we're really thrilled that Apple featured Analytics Cloud as one of the marquee apps in their launch. The Salesforce1 platform, the foundation for everything we develop, has been ranked by Gartner as the leading enterprise Platform-as-a-Service for the second year in a row. We've seen tremendous momentum in the quarter with customers, with partners, with ISVs, now more than 2 million developers building apps on top of our platform, and that's reflected in our customer adoption and usage rates. They are just soaring. We delivered 211 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, 211 billion, up 79% from a year ago. That is astonishing. That's an average of more than 3.4 billion transactions every single business day, unprecedented in the technology industry. Before I close, I want to mention the great work of Salesforce Foundation. Foundation now supporting 25,000 non-profits and NGOs and we've distributed more than $85 million in grants, and our employees have volunteered almost 1 million hours of community service, an increase of 300,000 hours since Q1 of last year; just amazing. Now I'll hand it off to Keith, who's in London, where he'll be keynoting our London World Tour event tomorrow. And this is the largest cloud computing event in the region, with more than 13,000 people registered to attend. Now, the World Tour that we're all on will follow a record \u2013 that we've had record attendance stops already in Melbourne and Amsterdam, here in Boston, in Chicago, and Toronto. You're also welcome to join us for upcoming Salesforce World Tour stops. The next one's going to be Washington, D.C. next week, which will be incredible. And then we head to New York for Salesforce Connections, the largest digital marketing event in the world. And our New York World Tour which will be June 16, June 17, and June 18. You're not going to want to miss that. More than 15,000 people will join us. And I'll be keynoting the World Tour event in Paris on June 25 and in Munich on July 2. If you haven't seen what's been going on in Europe, it's worth seeing, just an amazing level of momentum with the cloud. And mark your calendars for the largest enterprise technology conference on the planet, Dreamforce, you may have heard of it. That's going to be happening September 15 to September 18 in San Francisco. That is an event I'm quite sure you will not want to miss. Okay, Keith? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Thanks, Marc. Greetings, everybody. It's great to be here in London, as Marc said, I love London, I love Europe. We all love Europe. And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastest-growing region, where we've now exceeded $1 billion in revenue over the past year, so congratulations to the entire team for really an incredible achievement. Suffice it to say that's proof positive that the investments that we've been talking about and making internationally are absolutely paying off. As Marc said, tomorrow I'm hosting our London Salesforce World Tour. We will have a record turnout expected. I've got a number of special guests joining me on stage, including executives from Barclays and British Airways, BSkyB will be with us, John Lewis, Vodafone, and many others. We're also going to have an organization called CoderDojo, which is really a very incredible non-profit here in the U.K. which teaches young kids how to code and adopt technology, so this is going to be a great event, really a world-class event. And as you heard from Marc, we had a world-class first quarter. We are firing on all cylinders. You can see that in the results, and this is a great way for us to start our fiscal year. It really does set a terrific tone for the rest of the year and we're very excited about it. So we continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with our customers of all sizes, all industries, and all geographies. And what's interesting is they're transforming their business models. And they're doing this by leveraging our Customer Success Platform. And this is leading to larger deals in all segments and deeper, more meaningful strategic relationships. In fact, we hit an all-time high in seven-figure-plus transactions of any first quarter in the history of the company. We saw some incredible wins in the quarter. I'm particularly proud of the fact that 30% of our top deals were net new customers. And I'd like to share a few of these stories. The first one is a company called Bouygues Telecom. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in France. It's a great new relationship that closed in the quarter. And they selected our Customer Success Platform to create an omni-channel digital experience for their 13 million customers across all their call centers, stores, and online; very exciting. We also signed a major new deal with a transportation company, really one of the world's greatest brands in their category. They were using on-premise legacy technology from Oracle. And in the quarter, they decided to go all-in with the cloud, and they plan to put Salesforce1 onto mobile devices and into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world. It was really just an incredible win. And I couldn't be prouder of the team for bringing in this new strategic relationship. Also one of the largest deals in the quarter was a net new relationship with a Fortune 500 leader in retail. They were looking to consolidate all their tools and campaigns and selected our Marketing Cloud as their company-wide digital marketing platform. As Marc mentioned, the Marketing Cloud is absolutely on fire. It is the tip of the spear for us with B2C companies, and it really is in almost every conversation that we're having with senior executives around the world. It's really terrific. We're also seeing some significant expansions with our existing customers, Tyco, which is a brand that I'm sure many people recognize. It's a great example. They're a $10 billion leader in protection and security. They've been using Sales Cloud for years and they expanded their relationship with us in the quarter with Service Cloud and Community Cloud and Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 platform. So their vision is to really bring all their teams together and transform their organization, and build a global Customer Success Platform across sales and service in marketing. Barclays, another great win. They started with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Communities. And now with the addition of Analytics Cloud in the quarter, Barclays will be putting real-time customer intelligence into the hands of their corporate bankers so they can make faster and smarter decisions right from their mobile devices. It's a great example of impact from the Analytics Cloud. And in my keynote tomorrow, Barclays is going to demonstrate how they use Salesforce to transform their broker journey and build the most qualified digital workforce in financial services. And speaking of financial services, we expanded our relationship with JPMorgan Investment Management. This is a customer that has been using us in a few of their divisions. And now they will be significantly increasing their deployment of Service Cloud as their CRM platform across their growing mutual fund divisions. So JPMorgan is yet another great example of how financial services companies are moving to the cloud. Other new wins or expansions in Q1 include the Bank of America, Dentsu, Expedia, Hitachi, Japan Post, John Deere, Medtronic, TELUS, T-Mobile, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Western Union, and Zurich Insurance. So this is really, as you can see, a pretty incredible list of brands, and it shows the continued traction we're getting in our industry strategy. You're also going to see our industry strategy come into greater focus this summer when we introduce our first industry solution in wealth management. Now I will tell you we've been able to achieve this level of customer success and growth because we are, without a doubt, the trusted enterprise cloud. And with this incredible culture of relentless innovation, a 16 year track record of customer success, no other technology provider is in a position to say this; we are all about customer success. And conversely, if you were paying attention to SAP's event a few weeks ago, the CIO of the world's largest retailer, which is an SAP customer, she said she hopes to see an SAP implementation in her lifetime. And I think that spells it out. That is the difference between on-premise and the cloud. It doesn't sound like customer success to me. And we are all about customer success. So we're seeing a growing trend of SAP and Oracle customers who are coming to us and talking with us and working with us to wrap around their legacy solutions. They want us to be the agility layer to these legacy technologies. They want us to be able to unlock more value from their investments. And ultimately it puts us on a path to a complete replacement in their front office. In fact, I will tell you, a few days ago I had a meeting with the COO of one of the world's largest banks, and they were incredibly excited about a strategy to ultimately replace all their legacy customer-facing systems with our Customer Success Platform. So that's very exciting for us. So before I close, I want to talk about our ecosystem. Marc touched on it a minute ago. It continues to thrive. We're the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem in the world. We hit a huge milestone this quarter with over 3 million total installs from our AppExchange. We continue to develop more strategic ISV relationships on both the horizontal and vertical basis. And as I travel around the world and speak to customers and partners, it's pretty clear that the relationship with our global and regional SIs, it's just never been stronger. So with that, I want to thank the entire team at Salesforce and congratulate them for delivering just a terrific and strong Q1 and a great start to the year. So, over to you, Mark. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $52 million and a sequential headwind of around $17 million. Our geographies also delivered strong growth on a constant currency basis with the Americas growth of 27%, EMEA growth of 28%, and Asia Pac of 27%. Dollar attrition for the first quarter excluding Marketing Cloud was approximately 9%. Now while we continued to deliver industry-leading top line growth, we're thrilled to have expanded our Q1 non-GAAP operating margins by 197 basis points year-over-year. And by the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our top line outperformance along with the improved expense controls allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.16, up 45% over last year, and $0.02 higher than our guidance. Additionally, we made great progress toward GAAP profitability in the quarter including reducing our stock-based compensation to below 10% of revenue. Now turning to cash flow, we delivered record operating cash flow in the quarter of $731 million. Now that's up 54% over last year. And as we previously discussed, we anticipate that Q1 will continue to be the largest cash flow quarter. Now, this is due to our seasonally strong Q4, and the compounding nature of our new and renewal business in the fourth quarter and the associated collections of our Q4 invoices in the first quarter. Now, free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $660 million, and that was up 60% over Q1 of last year. Looking at deferred revenue, we delivered another strong quarter with growth of 31% year-over-year, excluding an FX headwind of $69 million. Deferred revenue grew 36% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $18 million. As a reminder, we calculate our FX on revenue using the average rates throughout the quarter; however, for deferred revenue, a balance sheet item, we use the spot rate on the last day of the quarter. Keep in mind, we conduct business in multiple currencies, including the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and others. While the dollar exchange rates for most of these currencies were roughly flat at the end of the quarter, a stronger pound drove a slight sequential tailwind to the deferred revenue in Q1. In the quarter, 75% of the value of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms. Now let's move on to guidance. With our strong first quarter results, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.52 billion to $6.55 billion for 22% growth at the high-end. Now this guidance includes an anticipated FX headwind of about $175 million to $200 million. In addition to raising our top line guidance, we're also pleased to be raising our bottom line as well. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.71. We continue to expect year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 125 basis points to 150 basis points this year. With our strong Q1 operating cash flow, we now anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%. For Q2, we anticipate revenue of $1.59 billion to $1.60 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 to $0.18, and deferred revenue growth in the mid- to high-20% range. Our guidance implies that OI&E will continue to be a net expense and we assume a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5% and that we will not make significant acquisitions. To close, we are very pleased with our fast start to fiscal 2016. We delivered outstanding results across the board, our top and our bottom line outperformance drove record cash flow and our backlog of book business positions us extremely well for continued growth while we continue to deliver our non-GAAP operating margin expansion commitment. On that, I'd like to open up the call for questions, operator. Operator : We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from Kash Rangan [Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.]. Kasthuri G. Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Wow, you're the champions, congratulations. Marc, question for you on the Analytics product. What kind of attach rate do you envision for the company, or what kind of attach rate would you be pleased with for the Analytics product as it relates to the deployment of Sales Cloud and perhaps even the Service Cloud in rough timeframe? And secondly for you, CFO, Mark Hawkins, any impact from invoicing duration, early renewals of deals in the quarter that might have helped you one way or the other? That's it for me. Thank you. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks, Kash. And I'll tell you, on the Analytics Cloud, I've never been more excited about a product. I don't think there's a customer that I've spoken to this quarter who hasn't been interested in the Analytics Cloud, and I can't imagine a Salesforce customer that's not going to end up with the Analytics Cloud. This is just a breakthrough product. There's never been an Analytics product that's been built from the ground-up as a multi-tenant cloud service built on a metadata platform that gives you the ability to build apps and deploy them rapidly and I think you're going to see some amazing things with the Analytics Cloud when we get to Dreamforce as well. We've had some huge technical breakthroughs in our ability to build an ecosystem around the Analytics Cloud and we plan to show those off. We've only been in this business about 90 days. I don't know why we didn't get this in a lot earlier. Keith, what's been your experience with the Analytics Cloud this quarter? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, Marc, I'll tell you, we've had some great wins in the quarter, Barclays, that I mentioned earlier, they were an Analytics Cloud user. Tyco is now an Analytics Cloud user. I will tell you, my entire distribution organization walks around with Analytics Cloud on their mobile phone. They use it every day to run their business, and learn more insights about their customers. If you talk to Mark Hawkins, he will tell you that this finance organization at Salesforce, they are all using Analytics Cloud, our Employee Success organization is all using Analytics Cloud. So this is a very compelling new product. Marc is absolutely correct. Within two weeks of announcing this at Dreamforce, we were closing deals in very large enterprises. So the market reaction has been very good. People are very excited about it. And there's no reason why this should not be in virtually all of our entire installed base. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Great. And so, let me take the second question here. And first before I do, Keith, I totally agree, we use the Analytics Cloud constantly to run our business and it's exciting within Salesforce. In terms of the billing frequency early renewals question, Kash, I think nothing dramatic to share. We made continued improvement and the percent of annualized billings pretty in sync with the rate of improvement that we've made. Before it's been a modest improvement and as we called out we had 75% of our total billings were annual compared to, I think, 69% last year, very in sync with the kind of pace of improvement that we've been making and really nothing extraordinary to report on that side. We're just very pleased with the total deferred revenue and the revenue together, so. Operator : And your next question comes from Jason Maynard from Wells Fargo. Jason A. Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon, guys, and congratulations to a strong start to the year. There's obviously been a lot of talk in the press about the future of the company over the last few weeks. And I know you can't comment on that, but I think the big question, and probably one that customers are asking themselves is : what do you guys think about the prospects for your own business? I know you have a goal of $10 billion in revenue, but there's an old saying, maybe you trade a player a year early versus trading him a year late. And I wonder if customers and investors and all of your stakeholders are saying, what does Marc see after $10 billion? Do you see a runway to being a multi-teens billion, $20 billion company? Is that something that you have the line of sight on and have the confidence in your TAM, your products, and your management execution to reach? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I really appreciate that question, Jason, thanks so much. And when I started this company 16 years ago, we wanted to do three things. We wanted to create a new technology model now known as the cloud. We wanted to create a new business model, which is singularly focused on the success of our customers and helping our customers to create new ways to connect with their customers and help them to innovate and transform their organizations. And, three, we created a new philanthropic model with 1% of our equity and 1% of our profit and 1% of all of our employees' time and, of course, that was very easy because we had no equity, we had no profit, we had no time, but I would say at this point, I mean, Salesforce has far exceeded our expectations over the last 16 years. But people are always overestimating what they can do in a year and underestimating what they can do in a decade in our business, and when I look out what I see is we are absolutely committed to being the fastest software company ever to $10 billion. And I'm sure, Jason, if you look at your model now with over $9 billion in deferred on and off the balance sheet, you can start to model exactly how fast that's going to be. I mean, it's record time. And we're going to squarely be very, very shortly the fourth largest software company in the world. Now, when that happens, we are really targeting one company to surpass, which is SAP. Fortunately for us, their kind of lackluster growth, execution and lack of innovation in their core products as we saw in their conference this quarter, well, you know what? They're an easy target, and that's our next goal. But we've got our minds squarely on the prize which is the $10 billion revenue run rate, and that's step one. Step two is go past SAP, and I think we can absolutely do that. I'm personally committed to making that happen. That's my dream. And I am super-motivated every single day to get up and run a company that is doing well, by doing good. We're not just a software company, Jason, that's building products and selling them every day like the rest of the guys. We are a software company that is working hard to make the world a better place, not just through our innovation, but through our philanthropy and through our commitment to equality for all, and also to inspire other entrepreneurs and other companies to do the same. I'm sure your experience is the same as mine, when I meet all these new companies, they've all got philanthropy built into their model and they've all got fired up entrepreneurs who are going to add value to their community, not just build products. And I hope that in some small way we've inspired the industry to kind of get off its kind of traditional stinginess and to get out there and do something for other people. And that's what I'm excited about, and those are my goals going forward. Does that help clarify that? Operator : And your next question comes from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot, and my congratulations, as well. I actually had one for Mark. Mark, you just delivered close to 200 basis points of margin expansion in what I think was the toughest foreign exchange headwind quarter this year. And that number's above your full year guidance, so I was just curious as to how we should think about the pace of underlying operating expense growth as we progress through the year? And does the guidance imply that you're going to accelerate the rate of investment as we look forward? Thanks. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Ross, first of all, thanks a lot for the note. And yeah, definitely we feel great about the quarter. I think, and one of the things I would say on the \u2013 certainly, the operating margin expansion fourth quarter in a row, we feel really great about the fact that for the full year we guide this 125 basis points to 150 basis points on an even bigger revenue base, right? Because we raised the revenue base and we're showing even more EPS. But I think from an operating margin viewpoint, one of the things that you should think about is that this squares very nicely with our revenue operating margin framework in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. So this fits very nicely. But what we're doing also, Ross, as you touch on, is we're making sure to make the investments that are essential to making sure that we grow not only this year but in 2017 and well beyond to fulfill the vision that Marc had articulated earlier on the call. So we feel good about this. It's squarely within the framework. We're delivering on our commitment even on a higher base. Operator : And your next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Keith had mentioned an all-time high for seven figure deals in Q1 and I'm just curious, Mark and Keith, are there any common patterns you're seeing out of these deals when you look across like taking multiple clouds, larger seat counts, all of the above? It'd just be great to get a little bit of color in terms of what you saw and what's rolled out in Q1. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Hi, this is Keith. Listen, thanks for the question. It really is to a certain extent all of the above. I mean, we're clearly signing up some net new logos in some of the largest enterprises in the world. Some of that is one cloud, some of that is many clouds, but I think the overwhelming sentiment here is that there's a real interest in a long-term strategic relationship with Salesforce. And it is a trust-based relationship and a value-based relationship. And customers really want to leverage our Customer Success Platform to help their customers succeed. So it's a pretty common theme around the Customer Success Platform and industry orientation. I mean, if I look at the kind of larger deals in the quarter that I just went through here, many of these were in financial services, many of these were in telecommunications, some in public sector. And these are kind of the strike zone industries that we're focusing our attention on. So we are hitting our cylinders, all of our cylinders, in terms of getting the mind share of these large enterprises, really enterprises of all size and scale and all geographies, and we're running our playbook and we're just executing well. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I might just add on that to Keith's point. When I think of the patterns exactly what Keith said. But what I really like, Brent, is just this notion about how much our customers are embracing the Customer Success Platform on a multi-cloud basis. Keith and his team knocked out some huge deals that he talked about. You look at like Bouygues, they picked up Service Cloud, Community, Marketing Cloud. You look at JPMorgan, you look at sales, service, marketing. You look at Tyco that Keith talked about. You look at Sales, Service, Community and Wave. I just think it's exciting to see that pattern be so pronounced. So that's the pattern that I see, Brent. Operator : And your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you so much. I had two questions. I guess, the first one is if we go back to Jason's question for a second about the $10 billion sales target, I was just wondering, Mark, if you could just give us a sense, how do you think about what the profitability level of the company might look like, knowing that there's a lot of different things that could happen? But how do you think about the profitability level that you'll be able to achieve, once you get to that $10 billion target that looks increasingly in sight. And then the other question I had, Mark, was just Service Cloud had a big sequential acceleration this quarter. I'm just wondering, are there some factors you could share with us that are causing this? And where are we in the rip and replace of those massive Siebel call center systems that were put in place in the early 2000s? Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, let me jump into this and we'll see if folks add in here. But, Heather, the $10 billion vision Marc articulated, you can see us driving toward that. You're hearing loud and clear. I think that the profitability will be a function of the speed of how fast we get there. And when we talk about the revenue operating margin framework, very much it's correlated with the rate of the growth rate compared to the operating margin expansion. That's a higher level of framework that remains intact. We continue to execute that. And you can see it even in this period in the guidance for this year. But I do want to call out something, Heather, to try to get more context to the spirit of your question. When I look at the unit economics of what's happening in our business, the lifetime economics, I clearly see a business that's in the mid-30%s in terms of operating margin. And that is really I think what we should think about when we get the business at a mature level of growth in the mid-30%s. That would be the key point. And in terms of the Service Cloud, one of the things that was most pleasing to look at is just the amazing amount of market share we took, that Gartner just took, where we made real progress on the market share, where we ripped over 300 basis points, we displaced basically SAP and are making real progress. But let me just see if there's other commentary on that. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, let me just weigh in here. So one of the themes that we're hearing as we go around the world and we're talking to CEOs, is that companies are transforming themselves and they're differentiating, Heather, around service. If you talk to GE, if you talk to Philips, they are trying to transform themselves into service companies. And they're leveraging our Customer Success Platform to do that. It's very interesting because it's an opportunity for them to change their business model. They're leveraging our platform and many of them are asking us to wrap an agility layer around their existing legacy systems. Now that could be a homegrown system, but more often than not that's Oracle and SAP. And ultimately, the game plan here is to surround them and eventually replace them. So the overwhelming message from customers is they want to get out of the maintenance game. And they want to get into the innovation and transformation game. And that's what they see in the Customer Success Platform, and that's what's going on in the marketplace. Operator : And your next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. S. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah, thanks very much. Since Keith is staying up late with us in London maybe I'll ask him one about Europe while you're over there. Clearly, that business is accelerating. You guys have put a lot of investment into the region in terms of new data centers. Can you just talk about the adoption trends of customers in Europe? Are you seeing them adopt a cloud at a time? Or are you seeing them jump really straight to the Customer Success Platform? And is there anything you all need to do over there over the next 12 months to really see it continue to accelerate or have you put a lot of the programs in place that we should continue to see you all harvesting some of the investment you made over the last 12 months or so? Thanks. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, obviously, international expansion is a big part of our strategy and EMEA is a big pivot point for that. And we continue to invest. We've rolled out all these programs around industry orientation, additional resources, Solution Selling, a program that we call Ignite, and leveraging this incredible ecosystem that we have built around our partners with a huge focus on customer success from both our own resources as well as the ecosystem partners. And customers are enjoying a bit of our seed and grow strategy but some of them are talking about the wholesale transformation as kind of a long-term strategy with bite-sized chunks, so we are getting incredible traction. We're very, very proud of the results that we're seeing in EMEA and it's pretty clear that our investment strategies are paying off here. Operator : And your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And again, very nice quarter. Two questions from me. One, there's been a ton of speculation out there in the marketplace around the potential of M&A around salesforce.com. How do you guys \u2013 and maybe this is a question for Keith Block, how do you keep your guys focused on the price, focused on execution when there's all that sort of speculation going on externally? And then the second question is just about the industry solutions that are going to be rolling out later this year. Is there anything incremental that you guys need to do in sort of building out the distribution around those industry solutions? Or is that pretty well in place and is it just really putting product into place with what has been a build-out in the vertical distribution capability? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, okay, so thanks for the question. Look, first and foremost, is we don't comment on these rumors. And our focus has always been and will always continue to be on customer success and that goal of the $10 billion, and as Marc said, in going after SAP and passing them. So our people are motivated. They are very excited. It's part of our culture, a big part of our culture, to focus on customer success and our people feel really, really good about what they're doing and the success that they're enjoying with our customers. With respect to our industry strategy and execution around the product, for the most part, we are already starting to pivot around an industry orientation as we're organized in the field. So our distribution model is gradually moving towards an industry orientation over the last couple years. It's hard to believe that in June it will be my two-year anniversary. But over the last couple years, we've started to pivot toward vertical selling organizations, and that is kind of a natural tip of the spear for these solutions that we'll be bringing out. Operator : And your next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. I'd just like to ask about the Community Cloud and the success you're having there, if we could get some more color around. Are there vertical markets where you're having more success, are there use cases, and are you able to find any synergy with your other cloud offerings? Thanks. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think one of the really great things about our Community Cloud is that it's so tightly integrated with our Sales and Service and Marketing Clouds, and that when our customers buy our solution, they're not just buying a silo, but they're buying part of an integrated solution. I think when you look at some of our core deployments of our Community Cloud, companies like Home Depot, and you can see that if you go to community.homedepot.com or many of the other ones, well, you see that we're tightly integrated with their employees, we're tightly integrated with their partners, and it's been a huge boom for them to be able to increase their store traffic, that they get actual results. I mean, I know that because Salesforce uses our Community Cloud every day, but I don't know a customer that's not planning to deploy this product. I mean, this is something that's extremely important for every company whether they're a B2C company or a B2B company in being able to aggregate their customers and unite them with their employees. As you know, we have a very strong integrated system of engagement with our core product, and that system of engagement is tightly integrated with our system of record, and is now with our Analytics Cloud tightly integrated with our system of intelligence, so a system of record tightly integrated with a system of intelligence, tightly integrated with the system of engagement, and that system of engagement is extended into those core customer offerings through our Community Cloud, and that's the right architecture. That's the right product. It's had phenomenal success, super high growth rate and I expect continued great performance from it this year. Operator : And your next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Brean Capital. Sarah Hindlian - Brean Capital LLC : Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I had a couple questions for you. When you're signing customers on Wave, and I realize it's still very early, but do you see this as a product where you're encroaching more on legacy BI vendors or is this an additive to your deployment or a pure greenfield opportunity? And then lastly, I'm just wondering what kind of momentum you're seeing in Marketing Cloud, which is obviously growing nicely at 29%, but not as fast as services and platforms, and so I'm wondering where do you see that trending this year? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, number one, on Analytics Cloud, the answer to your question is, all of the above. I mean, when we're in there, I presented that product today to two executives, one of the world's very largest insurance companies here in Chicago, and they've never seen anything like that. And I don't think anything like it exists. They probably already own every product, you know? And I don't think that's a reason why they wouldn't buy ours, because they don't use that product. Those other products are really isolated and used by analysts, and they're not analytics for everyone. They're certainly not analytics for the rest of us. They don't run well on iPhones and Android devices. They don't run on the Apple Watch. They don't run \u2013 you can't spin it up instantly in our cloud environment. So this is just an extraordinary offering, and it is only \u2013 again, I've obviously seen the next two versions, and it is just going to get better and better and better. And we're going to just bring in a very deep ecosystem of developers and apps, and we're going to exercise our magic in regards to building a really broad use of it, and by Dreamforce, you'll see something just awesome. So I hope that answers \u2013 I hope that answers that question. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And then there was the second one, Marc, on the Marketing Cloud momentum. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, yeah, Marketing \u2013 well, I mean, I can't say enough good things about the Marketing Cloud. I'm sure you see that we took this great company in Indianapolis, Indiana, ExactTarget. We've worked with their core management team and transformed that to just turning it into just an exceptional offering, with Journey Builder and our customers to build journeys for their customers, they can build journeys for their employees. They can build journeys for their partners, journeys for their products. I mean, we just used it ourself to build something called Adoption Manager for Salesforce1, and when you are using Salesforce1, you now have the ability to turn on something called Adoption Manager, you're basically turning on Journey Builder in the Marketing Cloud and I know that we saw almost 50% increase in adoption rates using that technology. And I encourage every one of our customers to move to that model as part of that. I also am extremely excited by the phenomenal success of our Pardot team in Atlanta which is part of our Marketing Cloud. They have done a great job as well, which is the B2B marketing solution. So we not only have a tremendous B2C solution that has applicability throughout the enterprise, but we have an unbelievable B2B marketing solution and both of those are just executing incredibly well. For those of you who know we have taken a long time to build our Marketing Cloud strategy through \u2013 primarily through acquisition, and we have now had a couple of years to be able to operate it, and we couldn't be more excited about the future. Some of our largest transactions in the quarter were done with the Marketing Cloud and I don't know a customer who's not looking at it. You know, it's just \u2013 it's what you need to be able to connect with your customers on a day-by-day basis, and minute-by-minute basis. And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little insight into where we're going for Dreamforce, which is, and as it relates to the Marketing Cloud, you know everyone probably who's listening to this call might be wearing some kind of a wearable. All those wearables are probably evolving very rapidly; probably all of us will be wearing some kind of different wearables in the next two years. Everybody knows that we're moving to this incredible Internet of Things that's part of it. We call it an Internet of Customers. Everything is going online. Everything's got an API. We're generating more data than ever before. 90% of the world's data was generated in the last two years. A lot of it is coming out of this machine data. Well, as all these things are happening, of course, you want to be able to connect everything and then have these directed journeys and messaging and be able to put everything online and have everything deeply integrated into your CRM systems. I don't think there's any other company in the world that's going to be able to show what we're going to show at Dreamforce, which is this idea that everything is connected, everything's online, and that you're basically able to stay in touch with your customer minute-by-minute as it's happening. And that's just all possible because of this Marketing Cloud. So I couldn't be more excited. I mean between the Marketing Cloud, between the Analytics Cloud, between some exciting enhancements that are going to be coming for our core Salesforce Service Cloud offerings and next-generation solutions there, we've got a lot of very, very exciting things planned for September. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and if I might just add, Marc. Sarah, just in closing, too, when I see 29% in USD and you throw on four points or so of constant currency adder, that's a really attractive growth rate. And the last point I would just say is if you see the Gartner data that just came out, of the top five people in the Marketing Cloud arena, every one of the top four lost share. We gained share. You've seen these persistent trends like SAP losing share again. People are voting with their dollars for the Marketing Cloud. Operator : And your last question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, it's great that Barclays is a customer. And it's great that I get the last question here. Thank you. Mark, a quick question, now that we know the breakout of the different clouds, we see that the Sales Cloud, if I adjust for currency, is still growing strong in double-digit. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity there? Remember, that's kind of where a lot of people said, \"oh, it's getting mature, your market share is really high,\" but you keep growing, putting up these really healthy numbers despite the size. What are you seeing in that market? Thank you. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, so let me just touch a little bit, and I think maybe I could turn this over to Keith. Certainly I think you hit it right. We were certainly pleased to see the growth rate that was posted in U.S. dollars. Again if you add on the constant currency, you've got a business that's at scale. It's a $2.5 billion business growing really attractively, and again, just the gold standard in the world with lots and lots of opportunity. I'd just like to turn it over to Keith, I know, on other commentary on this as well. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, thanks, Mark. Listen, I think we've all seen the commentary and the pundits in the marketplace. I think the numbers speak for themselves. This is a terrific product. It is a flagship product, and we continue to take net new logos all over the world in all shapes, size, forms of companies in all industries. And arguably you can say it's the most loved sales app in the world. So we see an awful lot of interest in our Sales Cloud as a standalone product, but also as part of the Customer Success Platform. And it goes back to customers really want to be more engaged, have deeper relationships with our customers and drive success. And that's what this Customer Success Platform is all about .So this is a $2.5 billion run rate business. As a cloud, it's one of the top eight standalone largest cloud companies. We keep getting accolades from Gartner. So this is really a very successful product, a very successful solution as a standalone and it's part of a greater solution. And that's what customers want. They want impact, they want transformational value, they want innovation, and they want success for their customers. And that's why we're so well positioned and we still have so much momentum. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I'll just add to that, I guess we kind of gave it away, but tomorrow at the London Show, you're going to see Barclays profiled. And we've got an incredible demo as part of the keynote and video, you're going to see some amazing things. You're also going to see some amazing things about some other amazing European customers who we've had substantial breakthroughs with including Vodafone and Coca-Cola. I mean, if you look at this customer list in Europe, which includes ABB and BMW and BT and AXA and Philips and Unilever and so many others and then you look at all the incredible work that we're doing with these non-profits and NGOs in Europe, I mean, we've got just an impeccable brand. We've done a great job with Europe's largest and most important customers. Of course, we also have a very strong small- and medium-sized business there, as well. You're going to see it firsthand. I mean, you're going to see 52 Salesforce demo stations there showing all kinds of amazing things and spots. I mean, you've got a huge ecosystem. No one else has this. They've kind of forgotten how to be successful in the software business. And they're the only innovation SAP has is in rhetoric. They should try writing some software. John Cummings - Director- Investor Relations : All right, Katie, I think we can wrap up. So thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. We'll look forward to updating you on our fiscal Q2 results in August. In the meantime, if you have any questions for us, you can e-mail us at investor@salesforce.com. Thanks so much.

So with that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, hey. Thanks so much, John, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I'll tell you, this second quarter, well this was just the best quarter we have ever had at salesforce.com, and just one quarter after crossing the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone, we have now surpassed a $6.5 billion revenue run rate. That's faster than any enterprise software company in history, and we anticipate we're going to reach a $7 billion run rate by the end of this year and we are now well on our way. I mean, we have a clear trajectory to accomplishing our goal of being the fastest ever to reach $10 billion in revenue, so exciting. And no one in our industry is producing this kind of results of our size and scale. And also in this quarter we became a Fortune 500 company. That's really exciting for Salesforce, one of the 500 largest companies in the world, a huge milestone. Congratulations to all of our customers, our partners and employees in this incredible job. We continue to be the fastest-growing top 10 enterprise software company that many of you projected. We're going to go from being the sixth-largest software company in the world to the fourth-largest next year. That's awesome. That is next year, only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP are bigger than Salesforce. That is incredible. And then, of course, we're going to go on to our next goal which is to become the third-largest software company in the world, first by market and then by revenue. Then only Microsoft and Oracle are going to be larger than Salesforce. It's just amazing. Well, I want to thank all of our customers and partners for their inspiration, and all of our Salesforce employees for this unwavering focus on customer success because this is what is driving Salesforce forward quarter after quarter. It just delights us to see our customers so successful with our products. And now, I'd like to share the highlights for the quarter. While revenue for the quarter rose to $1.63 billion, that is up 28% in constant currency and that's just beyond our expectations. Deferred revenue grew to more than $3 billion, up 33% in constant currency, and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is $9.2 billion. It's a great indicator of the strength of our future revenues, and we are just really excited to see such strength in our deferred revenue. Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year, and we are committed, very deeply committed to improving profitability quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year as we also grow this business at record levels. All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $300 million in operating cash flow, which is up 24% year-over-year. That brings us to more than $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first half of the year, $1 billion in the first half of the year, and that really demonstrates the cash model built into cloud computing. This is an incredible achievement and demonstrates the power of our model. Given these outstanding second quarter results, I'm thrilled to announce that we are raising our full year guidance for both our top and bottom lines. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.625 billion and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS by a $0.01 to $0.72 at the high end of our range. As you can see from our strong results along with the incredible momentum we're having with our Customer Success Platform and our sales and service and marketing, community, analytics apps, we're on a trajectory to deliver $10 billion in revenue faster than any other enterprise software company in history. Did I mention that? It's been a phenomenal first half of the year. You'll hear more from Keith in a moment about how we've become a catalyst for business transformation and growth and how we're delivering new levels of customer success in every industry in every region every day. And this is especially true in Europe, where I spend a majority of the quarter, and where we're seeing tremendous growth. Our tours in Paris and Munich drew nearly 10,000 raving customers and I've had the opportunity to talk to dozens of CEOs in the region whether it was at AXA or Barclays or BMW or Deutsche Telekom, Eurostar, LOUIS VUITTON, Schneider, Unilever; all of these folks have become very significant customers in the last year with Salesforce and I am even heading back to Europe again next week because we are seeing incredible momentum in our European business. Right now every company in the world is looking to strengthen how they connect with their customers. This is a massive customer relationship management opportunity. Perhaps it is the largest opportunity in the software industry. Every company is looking to connect with their customer in a whole new way. Every company is looking for a whole new type of customer success and no company is better positioned to deliver this to our customers than Salesforce. There has never been a company of our size and scale focused so exclusively on this customer relationship management opportunity. No other customer relationship management company has 17,000 people, every single employee completely focused on the customer and that's why there's no other enterprise software company selling billions of dollars of CRM and still growing at nearly 30% in constant currency. Look, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP they're selling millions of dollars of CRM, that's with an M. We are selling billions of dollars of CRM that's with a B and that is the difference between us and the competition. No other enterprise cloud can match the breadth and depth of our trusted cloud platform and complete customer relationship management solutions, whether it's sales or service, marketing, community analytics apps within the Internet of Things and no one can match the strength of the Salesforce ecosystem, our platforms, which is accelerating our growth with SIs and ISVs creating solutions that address any kind of business process. In addition, the AppExchange, which is now the number one business app marketplace, continues to set us apart from all others. I'll tell you, that AppExchange, our partners, our platform strategy over the last 10 years this is really separated us from the competition. We're not an app; we're a platform and we're not an app, we're an ecosystem, and we're not an app, we're all about customer success and it's our partners that help us to create that. We're seeing tremendous growth in the adoption and usage of our core platform. We delivered 234 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, up 79% from year ago. That's an average of nearly 3.7 billion transactions every single business day. We're also gaining traction as we better integrate acquisitions and invest in deep, organic innovation. Well, those results are just phenomenal. You're going to see more innovation than ever at Dreamforce this year. You're going to see new products and new clouds and we're going to be showcasing incredible new services. I mean, we're going to be breaking through with a whole new level of customer success. We're even going to be announcing this incredible new cloud. Well, in addition, our strategic partnerships are paying off. There's no better example of this than our relationship with Microsoft and at Dreamforce you're going to hear about how we're making our joint customers, the customers of Salesforce and Microsoft \u2013 well, we're working more closely together than ever before and we're working on making those customers even more successful, delivering deep integration with Office and Outlook and Azure and I'm thrilled that Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella is going to be speaking at Dreamforce this year with his own keynote and that Microsoft Chairman, John Thompson will be part of my keynotes. Well, I have to tell you, but as all of you already know Salesforce just isn't about doing well, we're also about doing good. Giving back has been an integral part of our company culture from the beginning with our 1-1-1 philanthropic model. Salesforce technology now powers more than 26,000 non-profit and higher education institutions and the Salesforce Foundation has provided more than $96 million in grants. That's in addition to the almost $250 million of in-kind services that we've provided to these other non-profits over our life and this quarter we surpassed another huge milestone. Our employees have given more than 1.1 million hours of community service. Well, that's just extraordinary. It's created an amazing culture at Salesforce. It's an amazing place to work and I think it is one of the reasons that our attrition has remained so low at a time of increased talent wars in Silicon Valley and even in San Francisco, there's no other technology company like Salesforce. Look, as I mentioned, Dreamforce is on the horizon, it's just 26 days away. It's going to be our biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever and we expect more than 150,000 people to register for the event in San Francisco and 10 million to join us online. They're going to come from 75 countries. Dreamforce has become so big, we're bringing in a cruise ship, because we've run out of hotel rooms so we're calling up the Dreamboat and to provide extra accommodations for all of our attendees. We've even partnered with Airbnb to radically expand the number of people that we can house in San Francisco. We've partnered with Uber to make sure that there's more drivers available than ever before. We're even going to have four airstreams in the Dreampark for special events and we even have a few people staying there for additional accommodations because we're completely out of rooms. Look, you're going to see the future of Salesforce in my keynote with relationship, intelligence, next generation of clouds, the Internet of Things. You're going to see a whole new standard for an industry. We have 1,500 customer-driven breakout sessions at Dreamforce, the world's biggest cloud ecosystem coming together in one place, thousands of solutions from more than 400 companies in our Cloud Expo. Isn't that amazing? And I didn't even mention the huge Foo Fighters concert that's going to be happening on Thursday night and our special event for our very top customers with John Legend the night before that. We've also gathered an amazing group of global thought leaders. In addition to Satya, we've got an incredible lineup of innovation speakers including, the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick; Skoll Foundation's, Larry Brilliant; John Collison of Stripe; William Marshall of Planet Labs, who just launched more of his Doves into the atmosphere; Hampton Creek's Josh Tetrick. George Zimmer is launching his new company zTailors and zTux at Dreamforce. We even have best-selling authors Tom Davenport, Andrew McAfee, Dov Seidman and many, many, many, many others all speaking at Dreamforce. And we're all going to be talking about the future of business, the future technology, the future of the cloud, social, mobile, the future of data science, Internet of Things, and the future of social responsibility as well and the importance of business to give back and to manage their stakeholders not just their shareholders. A new Dreamforce Women's Leadership Summit features actress and entrepreneur, Jessica Alba; YouTube's CEO and Salesforce's board member, Susan Wojcicki; and Oscar winner, Patricia Arquette. Incredible focus on the empowerment of women at Dreamforce. And we have a Startup Summit to inspire the next-generation of entrepreneurs with keynotes from actor and entrepreneur, Adrian Grenier, I'm sure you all loved the movie Entourage; Box CEO Aaron Levie; Pro Football Hall of Famer Steve Young. And we have a Mindfulness Day because we're all going to need to kick back, relax and clearer minds after that Dreamforce and we have one of the world's top meditation teachers, Jack Kornfield, as well as actress Goldie Hawn and fashion icon, Donna Karan, all talking about the importance of taking care of ourselves while we're taking care of the world. And world champion San Francisco Giants' CEO, Larry Baer; the Golden State Warriors President and COO, Rick Welts are going to share the secrets for success in professional sports. Throughout Dreamforce, we'll have many ways in which attendees can give back. Each day at Dreamforce, there's a focus on an important cause in our world. One day will be dedicated to our veterans; one day dedicated to our K through 12 schools; one day dedicated to women in technology; and one day dedicated to the environment and our oceans. And we're holding a fantastic benefit concert as I mentioned with Foo Fighters and other incredible bands that you're going to love to support children's health and our children's hospitals. Bring all your friends. You're not going to want to miss it. If you buy a sponsorship for the concert, we're going to make sure you get unbelievable seats and recognition. And we're going to have the world's largest book drive of all time. So if you want to come to Dreamforce, you'd better bring a book for kids, because we're going to be collecting books and putting them in libraries all over the country, collecting more than a million books to support schools and students. So don't forget your books. Don't forget bringing food, because we're running a huge food drive. And I look forward to see you all at Dreamforce and don't forget, it's going to be the biggest, most exciting Dreamforce of all time. Now over to Keith. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Thanks, Marc. As you said, Q2 was really an outstanding quarter. We are executing like never before and we are seeing exceptional performance across the board in every geography, in every industry and certainly in every cloud. We saw an amazing number of big deals this quarter. Really, for example, the Marketing Cloud doubled its number of large deals year-over-year, which was terrific to see. And more importantly, the value of our large deals across all the clouds has increased significantly. That is proof positive of the level and depth of relationships that we're certainly driving with customers. As Marc said, we're now part of the Fortune 500 and that is a great indicator of how Salesforce is delivering customer success and scale. It's pretty clear that Salesforce is taking share from our competitors and we're growing at every segment, in every industry, and in every region as software center of gravity continues its shift from on-premise to the cloud. In the past year, we have had countless conversations with CEOs of world-class companies. Marc mentioned his trip to Europe around innovation and taking their companies into the future. They are looking to us to help transform their business models to drive growth and to become their trusted advisor. Every CEO's agenda is about growth and they're looking for Salesforce to be that growth engine. They're looking to us and it all starts with our Customer Success Platform. These are conversations that are driving more meaningful and long-term relationships, quite frankly with some of the greatest companies on earth. And I'm going to give you some examples starting with Enel. Enel is Europe's largest power company with 61 million customers. This deal was significant in terms of expansion of an important relationship where the CEO was personally involved. We are now Enel's strategic partner for the complete transformation of their customer engagement platform, leveraging sales and service and communities, analytics and platform. But that doesn't stop there. In addition, we're building an agility layer around their legacy on-premise SAP system and we're helping them extract information from complex order management and inventory and billing systems. They're having trouble getting meaningful and timely information out of SAP and Salesforce is bringing all this data together, so Enel's teams can get a 360 degrees view of their customers. And with Wave Analytics, they can drill down into their customer data right from the mobile phone in seconds. Enel absolutely has a tremendous vision for the future and we at Salesforce are helping them make it a reality. We also signed a significant deal this quarter with a huge global systems integrator and just as they advised their clients, they themselves are making a major shift to the cloud and decided to replace their aging on-premise software with our Sales Cloud, with our Marketing Cloud and with our platform. I'm also pleased to tell you their doubling down on a dedicated Salesforce practice and we're very, very excited about that. So with this win, with this very large integrator, virtually every global systems integrator globally is running their business on Salesforce. In fact, the number of Salesforce certified consultants across the globe grew 44% year-over-year, it's pretty staggering. This is a great indication of the type of growth and success that we're seeing in our partner ecosystem which is one of our growth strategies and our partner strategy overall. We're very, very pleased with this. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is another exciting win for us in Q2. In one of their largest agencies, they standardized on the Salesforce platform to build and deploy mobile applications. In addition their Farm Service Agency is also using our Service Cloud to connect citizens to critical resources. Our public sector business is just growing off the charts and I'm really proud of the team for their outstanding performance. And just a year after being FedRAMP certified, we're building huge momentum with federal, state, and local governments. In fact, 15 out of 15 federal cabinet agencies now use Salesforce as well as 45 of 50 state governments and we're just getting started in this space. We also signed an exciting new relationship in the quarter with one of the largest hospitality vendors in the world. Now, they have an incredible vision to bring all of their customer service together under a single platform to deliver a very personalized experience at scale to millions of their guests. The Service Cloud will now be the social mobile front office to the Oracle back-office and allow their hotel associates to better engage and service guests no matter where they are anywhere in the globe. It was a great win over Oracle and they chose Salesforce for our ability to deliver customer service on a flexible platform that would allow them to innovate with scale and speed. AXA has significantly expanded their seven-year relationship with us and in the quarter they've decided to consolidate 18 systems together onto our Service Cloud to run their entire global front office with more than 26,000 users. They're taking sales and customer service to a whole new level by modernizing their agent engagement platform with Salesforce. Now, we've also signed new or expanded relationships in the quarter with Barclays and BBC, Comcast, Commerzbank, Cox, Ford, Genomic Health, GlaxoSmithKline, Honda, Honeywell, Renault, listen, this list just goes on and on. It's pretty clear that we're driving success in every major industry and as all of you know, industries have been one of our critical strategies. We're incredibly excited about our industry momentum. It continues to gain mind share with our customers and our partners. In fact, we will be launching our first industry products at the end of this month. Some of the most influential industry-leading companies are serving as our design partners in the development of these industry clouds. The early feedback has absolutely been incredibly positive and you're going to see these products in action at Dreamforce. And speaking of Dreamforce, we've tailored the experience for customers with a special industry showcase in the Dreamforce Expo as well as industry keynotes and special sessions. It's going to be four incredible days for banks, for retailers, for manufacturers, telecommunication companies, government entities, healthcare providers. And I really hope that you check it out. So I want to close by congratulating everyone at Salesforce for their tremendous performance this quarter and, of course, just incredible execution. I also want to thank our customers for their continued commitment and inspiration, and our partners for their ongoing investment in our customer success. With our Customer Success Platform, our six world-class clouds, our industry innovation, our partner ecosystem, our international strategy, we are at the innovation engine and trusted advisor for companies looking to redefine their customer strategies and take their businesses into the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we delivered another great quarter. From a top line perspective, we delivered revenue of $1.63 billion, up 24% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continue to impact revenue with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $50 million and a sequential tailwind of $4 million. Our revenue was strong across the board, becoming more diversified across each geography, all of our clouds, and all of our business units. For example, our geographies continued to deliver great year-over-year growth in constant currency basis as Americas grew 28%, EMEA grew 29%, and Asia-Pac grew 25%. We also delivered incredible year-over-year growth in all of our clouds on a dollar basis as Sales Cloud grew 10%, Service Cloud grew 40%, Platform and others grew 36%, and Marketing Cloud grew 29%. Dollar attrition for the second quarter excluding Marketing Cloud was approximately 9%. And not only did we continue to grow our top line, we also improved our bottom line, expanding our non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year, and this is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We've been able to deliver this improvement by driving efficiencies across all our operating expense categories. As we remain committed to improving our non-GAAP operating margins year-over-year going forward, this is consistent with our operating margin framework we've discussed previously. Our great top line performance along with continued spending discipline allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.19, up 46% over last year. Turning to cash flow. We delivered another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $304 million, up 24% over last year, and we've already delivered more than $1 billion in operating cash flow this year, up 44% for the first half of the year. Second quarter free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was up 37% over last year to $240 million. Looking at billed deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 29% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $72 million, deferred revenue grew 33% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of roughly $12 million. In the quarter, 74% of the value of all subscriptions and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms, and this is compared with 71% last year. This increase is primarily due to our annual invoicing policy for new contracts and to a lesser extent shifting current customers to annual terms upon renewal. In Q2, this benefited year-over-year deferred revenue by approximately one percentage point. Moving on to guidance. With our strong performance in the second quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $75 million. We now anticipate to be $6.6 billion to $6.625 billion, or 23% growth. This guidance includes an FX headwind of approximately $175 million, which is a bit less than previously expected. Given the spending discipline, I've discussed and slightly lower impact from FX in the second half, we now expect to deliver approximately 150 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. This is the high end of our previous guidance. In that context, we're also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.70 to $0.72. Now let's turn to cash flow. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%. For Q3, we anticipate revenues of $1.69 billion to $1.70 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19, and deferred revenue growth in the mid-20% range. To close, we are very pleased with our second quarter results. We saw strong growth across all of our products and regions and are well-positioned to move into the second half. I'd like to thank the entire Salesforce team for delivering another great quarter. I look forward to seeing all of you at our annual Investor Day at Dreamforce on September 15. And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. A question for Mark Hawkins. On the Service Cloud, the growth rate really stood out, accelerating to 40%, up from what you saw in Q1. Just curious if you could give everyone just a little more color on what you're seeing in the Service Cloud and what you see in the pipeline going forward? Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. I'll start out on this, and then will just turn it over, Brent, to Keith, as well here. But we saw just a tremendous amount of traction in the Service Cloud. I think part of the issue when we see deal after deal coming forward is the ROI. It's just so strong. People are able to help their customer raise their customer satisfaction and also have a really strong ROI from that standpoint. So I saw it coming through in a lot of big deals, and that's probably a good segue for Keith. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, just a couple comments on that. Obviously, this is proof positive that we're not just a Salesforce automation company, and that we have a very diversified, very, very strong portfolio across the Customer Success Platform. Specifically around service, as you know, many companies differentiate themselves because of service and the way that they deliver service, so many companies are looking for innovation around how they engage with their customers. And over 70% of all sales, quite frankly, come from great service. So we're seeing this play out in the marketplace. Customers talk to us about how they can transform their business, and our Service Cloud product is best-in-class, so that certainly is what we're seeing going on in the marketplace right now. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'd also like to add, with the Service Cloud, we've talked a lot about the success of many of our customers, including Home Depot, we've even pointed you to our really cool Home Depot Community site : community.homedepot.com. If you want to see the Service Cloud in action yourself, you just have to go to support.us.playstation.com. That's Sony's website for supporting the Sony PlayStation. It runs entirely on Salesforce's Service Cloud. It's had over 16 million page views so far and we're doing our Service Cloud, our console, case management, live agent knowledge, and social service with Sony. It's completely cool and it's another great example the success our customers are having with Service Cloud. Operator : And your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you. Thanks, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. A question for Keith, perhaps. In talking about the vertical solutions that you guys are \u2013 or the industry solutions that you're looking to roll out, the actual product you guys are looking to roll out, can you help us think about two aspects of it? One, how do you think about that expanding the potential market opportunity for salesforce.com? I'm assuming that it's going to let you guys go deeper into existing customers as well as address new customers, but I'd like to get your perspective on that. As well as from a distribution perspective, anything you guys need to change around or expand out to be able to \u2013 a distributor will sell those industry solutions? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah. Listen, thank you very much for the question. So as we continue to fuel our industry strategy, it really starts in a number of ways. Number one is that we want to make sure that we have the right industry messaging, the right content around our Customer Success Platform specific to a particular industry. Secondly, industries just deepen the relationship with a customer. Marc and I both talked about the level of engagement that we're seeing from CEOs. A lot of that dialog is around specific industry and vertical content. So as we continue to think about our product portfolio and we extend our Customer Success Platform, which is an incredible platform, it's not just things that we extend ourselves. Our customers extend it. We have an incredible ecosystem that extends the capability of the platform. There is a natural play to deepen the relationships, drive more strategic relationships with more industry-focus product. Specific to your question around how we organize in the field, over the last few years, we have been very carefully and very slowly moving to more and more of a vertical orientation. For example, we have a huge focus on our public sector. We are taking a look at expanding how we go after financial services markets and healthcare and life sciences markets. So we've done this very carefully and very thoughtfully, and it's really paying out in our results. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Thank you. Question for Marc Benioff. It seems like a fascinating time in the history of the software industry. You have Sage re-architecting under the force.com platform, the big three traditional software companies are trying to deal with the cloud a bit more actively, and for a couple of them their product revenues are actually declining for the first time ever outside of recession. And then their margins are under pressure while yours are increasing. So I'm wondering as they talk up their own cloud products, to what extent do think the bigger traditional software companies can retain some of their customers versus to what extent \u2013 it feels like they're leaky buckets and they might inadvertently drive more customers to reassess and perhaps move in your direction? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think the way to understand the future is to look at the past, and you can look at IBM with the Mainframe business. I think we all know IBM still sells a lot of Mainframes. That doesn't mean that IBM is innovating, that doesn't mean that IBM is creating value for customers or helping them to transform customers' businesses or align them with modern trends. It just means they're selling them old technology and upgrading it. And that's what you see with companies like Oracle and SAP. These are old technology bases that are kind of meandering along like Mainframes. And I think that is reflected exactly as you said in their license revenue growth, which has been poor, and then their movement to the cloud has been stunted because they don't want to shift those customers into new models. Exactly why IBM lost the PC business because they were too afraid to let go of the Mainframe. It's the past replaying itself. But instead of IBM, you've got Oracle and SAP basically running the same playbook. We all know that the world has changed, it's moved to the cloud, it's multitenant architectures, it's about meta-database application development and deployment, it's about social user interfaces, it's about mobility, and it's about data science, and it's about the Internet of Things and the integration of everything. And companies who have built platforms, like Salesforce who has done that, deliver world-class growth like we're doing in this quarter. And if you haven't done that, well, then you end up with a quarter like Oracle or SAP had. I think you've seen in the last four or six or eight quarters, they've missed almost all of them. And that's because their technology bases are degrading the way Mainframes have. But they can hang in there with their revenue, and it's meander along like big dinosaurs moving down the desert for a while. But nothing can stop the movement of new technologies and the key to being successful in the technology industry is to kind of transform that innovator's dilemma, to kind of constantly rethink and re-conceptualize yourself, to have a beginner's mind. And if you can do that, you can create something amazingly new. And you're going to see at Dreamforce more examples of Salesforce doing that. I've never been more excited about our technology base and what we're delivering to our customers, but ultimately, I've never been more excited that customers just love using our solutions, love working with us, and you feel that when you're at Dreamforce, and you're going to feel that in a bigger way than ever before. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard Davis with Canaccord. Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Thanks very much. So in my opinion, you guys have really improved and frankly continue to improve on force.com. And so my question is, by running a platform operation, you've seen successes like Veeva emerge, which is kind of win-win, but you also get to see kind of emerging promising companies. Could you either \u2013 you may not be able to name the firms, but at least \u2013 by name, but at least by segment what do you see kind of emerging? Because you guys get a free look at some of the interesting things that are out there that are pretty exciting. Thanks. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, one of the things that we've done is not only become an amazing platform company, which has spawned incredible companies like you've seen like Veeva, which has become one of our largest customers, or even FinancialForce which has become one of our largest customers. We've also had the chance to help our customers build and create their own applications using our platform, and I think that's been actually by far the most exciting thing for us, because it's taking us from just having a static application to something that customers mold and shape like they would with Play-Doh or Lego and they can create everything they want. And when you get to Dreamforce, you're going to see the next iteration of our Lightning Platform that we released last year and you're going to see a level of application, the creation capabilities that's never been before possible in our industry, and the ability to execute that on everything from an Apple Watch to a phone, to a desktop or a tablet. And that idea that we do have that super dynamic app/dev environment and that's how we built all of our applications means that we can help execute that vertical vision or that line of business vision or the vision for any specific customer so much more rapidly. I think it's also one of the reasons we've been able to create this incredible venture fund, I think you've seen we've been able to deliver amazing returns with our venture fund because we do see everything and we've been able to have incredible relationships with all of these new companies and get them to integrate and work with our platform and you're going to see that show up at the show as well. Burke Norton is actually sitting at the table who runs our venture fund and sees a lot of these new companies. Burke, would you like to add anything about that? Burke F. Norton - Secretary & Chief Legal Officer : Sure. I think that the amazing thing is that just over the last year alone, we've really massively increased the level of investment in the investment program. We don't reveal these numbers, but it's several orders of magnitude larger than how much we've invested previously. So we're really excited about what the returns we're going to be seeing in the coming years. And we couldn't be happier about the opportunity we have to see these companies in their very earlier stages. Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Tom M. Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon. So a question here about RelateIQ. Going on a little over a year since you made the acquisition, been seeing more in the way of marketing, advertising, just more socialization of what RelateIQ is and what customers are using it for. Can you talk a little bit more about what the plans are for that technology? How you think about maybe potentially integrating it with other clouds outside of the Sales Cloud? And just anything else you sort of have planned for RelateIQ as it pertains to integrating it with the broad organization? Thanks. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think you're going to have to come to Dreamforce because it's going to be one of the most exciting announcements that we have at the show. Operator : Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. Thank you very much. By my calculations, it looks like billings grew 30% \u2013 almost 30% on a year-over-year basis. Pretty spectacular if I take into account the year-over-year changes in deferred revenue or impact of deferred revenue and revenue. So Marc Benioff, question for you. Oracle Executive Chairman said sometime back that in their next fiscal year that they will add more cloud subscription revenue than salesforce.com. Just wondering what you think of that. And also secondly, look at some of your businesses, your platform business, congratulations, almost $1 billion business today. Service Cloud almost $2 billion. As you march up and try to be the next $20 billion revenue company or whatever, what are the products that are going to look like the big successes tomorrow? Is it going to be Wave, or is it going to be platform, or is it going to be marketing? Which is going to be the next Sales Cloud? Which is going to be the next Service Cloud? I'm trying to get your view for the future. Thank you. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Kash, I think we've mostly seen Oracle actually fail in the cloud market, I mean, for a long time, Larry said that the cloud was ridiculous and then he started taking it more seriously, but I just haven't seen any competitive cloud solutions from Oracle. And I think that's the shame. And I do view Larry as one of the most capable leaders in our industry. He's amazing. Of course, he's one of my mentors. But in this area of the cloud, Oracle has not delivered. And I think a great example of that is in the CRM marketplace. Here you can see Salesforce is selling billions of dollars of CRM in the cloud this year. Oracle is selling millions of dollars. And I think if you are selling millions and you have a competitor who is a relatively new entrant selling billions, well, then I would chalk that up as a failure in the cloud. Operator : Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Just had a sort of follow-up to what Kash was asking, but specifically wanted to focus on Wave and talk a little bit about how you've seen adoption since you launched it at Dreamforce a year ago and kind of what typical rollout pattern looks like from customers, from the ones who've become big adopters, kind of how does their footprint evolve? And also, what are you hearing from the field \u2013 maybe Keith Block, as to what the next level or next stage of innovation that customers are looking for on the analytics side? Thank you. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Okay. Hi, Heather. Thanks for the question. So, as you know, we are very excited about announcing Wave at last Dreamforce and very quickly, we were able to sign up some large, very strategic deals. In fact, if I go through the roster of customers that I just mentioned in the earnings call, many of them were existing analytics customers or had signed up net new as analytics customers and part of the solution that they're looking for to transform their businesses. So we have gotten some tremendous feedback about the capabilities of that particular cloud, and how it fits relative to the customer engagement and driving customer success and how it does against the competition. I'll tell you, it will be the fastest launch of any product line that we've ever had here at Salesforce. So, there's a lot of enthusiasm, there's a lot of innovation, there's quite a bit of traction with the product. We're getting some great feedback from our customers. We're getting great feedback from our partners and I think that \u2013 it is very differentiated in the way that it drives insights to actions and that's not something that you see from the legacy BI product lines that have been entrenched for 20 or 30 years. So customers think of it as innovative and game-breaking and we're starting to see the results. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Zukin with Stephens. Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Keith, you mentioned the growth of Salesforce consultants worldwide at 44% and I'm wondering how has your messaging changed to the SI community or what has changed about their practices that they're making these types of investments today. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: So there's several things going on. First of all, I think everybody knows that one of our growth strategies was to really expand our ecosystem and that takes a couple of flavors. We talked a little bit on this call, couple questions ago around our platform and our ISVs focus, but another very important piece of that, obviously, is the systems integrators globally and the regional boutiques who have influence in the boardroom, who have industry expertise and deep content and are at the forefront of helping our joint customers transform their businesses. Really what's happening is that we're moving away from the legacy world of on-premise into the cloud and the integrators and influencers in the world, they see it, they want to be part of it, they see new business opportunities, they want to drive unprecedented levels of customer success, and we're the only company that can bring that solution to bear with our Customer Success Platform at scale. And that's why these integrators and influencers are really latching onto us and partnering with us and locking arms and they are making the investments in their Salesforce practices and cannibalizing their legacy SAP and Oracle practices. And that's exactly what's happening. They see this huge shift in the marketplace and they want to be able to respond to it with us. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think they also \u2013 just to add on to Keith's point \u2013 they clearly see that the world is going to the cloud and they want to be part of it, no doubt. Operator : Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. A question for Mark Hawkins. Mark, congrats on the margin and cash flow performance during the quarter. I actually wanted to ask you a question about your guidance on both margins and cash flow. You've guided to non-GAAP operating margin improvement of plus 150 basis points. I think in the first half you were plus 180 basis points so the guide implies a little bit of a slower rate of improvement in the second half and it's not obvious why that would be. And then on the cash flow side to get to your 24%, 25% growth given your great first half performance, operating cash flow in the second half would actually have to be negative year-over-year and we haven't really seen that since the recession. So, my take is that you're appropriately keeping expectations low and there's some conservatism built into both margin and cash flow guide, but I wanted to give you an opportunity to flag anything that might be informing your guidance on those two metrics in the second half? Thank you. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. No, I appreciate the question, actually. Let's just break it down one question at a time. Let's start with the operating margin. We're super-pleased with the operating margin. As you've heard we've expanded the operating margin for five quarters in a row year-on-year. Moreover you've heard from Marc and I, just absolute unequivocal commitment to the revenue operating margin framework that we talk about in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. That's really clear, and you're seeing period after period after period of demonstrating that with action and results. And we're committed to the increase, obviously. And so, at the same time, it's obviously our priority as a company to be a growth company and to take full advantage of investing to go tackle this amazing TAM that's out there, that's north of $50 billion today. It's a double-digit growing TAM, a huge opportunity. And so, clearly what we're doing is we're growing rapidly, fastest-growing top 10 software company in the world, and we're expanding operating margin just exactly as we said we would do, just exactly consistent with the framework, so obviously, making sure that we're investing in growth as well. So I think that's a key point there. We feel great about the guide. We've raised the guide. Effectively, it was 125 basis points to 150 basis points, as you've said. Now we've taken it up to 150 basis points approximately, and we feel good and confident about that. So we'll get a chance to revisit that as we go, but that's where we're at. Point one. Point two is on the operating cash flow. One of the things that is pronounced, not only in operating cash flow, but in a number of the metrics of the company, we've talked for, actually, quite some time around the compounding effect of more and more of our invoicing showing up in Q4. And as we know, one of the effects of that shows makes our cash flow growth more by bimodal, it (48:12) shows up more in Q1 and then it shows up more in terms of Q4, and that's no shock. And one of the things that we want to make sure, we think we have a very solid operating cash flow guide \u2013 by the way, that's exactly consistent with the revenue operating margin framework that we put out, right now the exact framework that we added. And at the end of the day, when we see \u2013 when we have \u2013 we're closer to Q4 and we have more visibility around Q4, we'll revisit that and we'll have a better sense of, is there anything we want to change there? But we think it's an appropriate guide. So hopefully that's helped on both sides. Operator : Your next question is from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Thanks so much. Keith, I had two quick follow-ups for you. One on Wave, when might you take that more down market? We've heard about a lot of success at the high-end of the market. And then second on the Marketing Cloud, obviously, great momentum there. Is there a point at which you need to have an ecommerce engine that you partner with or build? Increasingly we're hearing that about something that CMOs are looking for in their marketing applications. Thanks. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, so thanks for the question. Just a couple of comments. I mentioned earlier on Wave how excited we were at Dreamforce and demonstrated some proof points very quickly and we continue to gain momentum in that marketplace. I think one of the things that the Wave team has done just an outstanding job of is to get feedback and that's what great companies do, they listen to their customers and their customers inspire them. And that's what Salesforce is all about. And so, we have gotten some great feedback on analytics. We are well-positioned in the marketplace. We've got a great ecosystem associated with analytics. We've got more than 80 partners. We've done some great things with Merck and Barclays and Genomic Health, and we'll continue to evolve and augment and enhance the product so that it is far-reaching. So we're excited about the future of Wave and we think it's going to be an incredible product. It's already had a great first year, almost first year, I should say. We're very proud of our Marketing Cloud performance in the quarter. That cloud is gaining momentum. It has really been an incredible part of our Customer Success Platform. It completes our solution for our customers to transform their businesses as far as how they define their digital strategies and their customer strategies. And so we will continue to see, again, as all innovative companies do, but none like Salesforce, we will continue to innovate our product line and enhance our product line, and there are natural adjacencies that you look to and we'll continue to innovate. That is the DNA and heart and soul of this company. We are all about innovation. So, you'll continue to see great offerings coming out of this place. Operator : Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI : Thanks very much, and congratulations on the quarter. Marc and Keith, I was curious about your comments about Europe. Obviously, you're starting to see some really nice momentum in that region. I assume a lot of that has to (51:25) investments on the data center side. I was curious about sort of your thoughts on is the market over there getting better or are you guys taking share? And I guess in particular around your cloud offerings, are there any solutions in particular that are resonating with customers over there, whether it's the Service Cloud or Marketing Cloud, that's really helping you guys gain some momentum? Thanks. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think the most important thing that we did in Europe, we did quite a few years ago, which was decide that Europe was extremely important to Salesforce. And we refined our distribution strategy really being focused on seven core countries which we've really just expanded to nine core countries. The idea that we were going to be super-focused in Europe and the UK, France and Germany was a huge reset for us, because ultimately what we're doing is building the UK cloud, the French cloud, the German cloud, and we're paying more attention to these customers inside these countries than ever before. Of course that doesn't mean that we don't do business in other countries, or don't have customers in other countries, but this extraordinary focus in these core countries where the buyers are has paid off in spades for us and it's allowed us to scale distribution, scale service, scale marketing and make sure our products are right for those products in those core mega-markets. That has resulted in numbers in Europe and growth in this company. We haven't seen numbers like this growing like this in Europe in other software companies. That's the power of what's going on. So I only see more of that. I'm heading back to Europe next week because I am so excited about the European opportunity, and the customers that I met with and spent time in Europe, well, that has escalated. I mean, I'm really not meeting with the CIOs anymore, or the Chief Revenue Officers or Chief Service Officers. When I get over there were meeting mostly with the Chief Executive Officers because they're more committed to delivering their customer capabilities than ever before. Keith, do want to add to that? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah. I would echo what Marc said. We made a conscious decision, as a company, to focus on international growth. We saw Europe as a huge opportunity. The European market has been shackled by legacy technology for decades, quite frankly, and they are screaming for innovation. The CEO dialogue, the agenda of the CEO, is growth. Our message is all about growth and customer success. So there's an alignment here that is fantastic and we're seeing it play out in the marketplace. We have made significant investments and those bets are paying off internationally in all the areas that Marc has mentioned. So international is a strength area for us for sure. EMEA, in particular, is a great story. We have a great team and all of our senior executives spend plenty of time talking to senior executives in our customer base in Europe. Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI : Okay. Investments on the data center piece (54:38)? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'd just like to add that, if you go to my Facebook feed or my Twitter feed you'll see I posted a video that summarizes our Q2 results. And I spent the majority of the quarter in Europe. I lived over there. It's the third year in a row that I've done that, and the video covers some of our activities in Europe for the year and the quarter, as well. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Just to chip in one last point. Kirk, you'd asked about market share specifically, I just want to add \u2013 since you asked it, address it directly, we're globally taking market share. It's been a persistent trend in CRM. And Gartner's report just show we took another 200 basis points of market share, so that's exciting and I just wanted to get that out since you asked about it. Operator : And our final question comes from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, guys. Obviously you guys have had a great quarter of billings growth but also balanced that with margin expansion and cash flow. The question here is to Mark and then to Keith, as well. I mean, obviously there's lots of areas that Salesforce can continue to expand and you definitely have a broad vision here. And then if you look at where some of the leverage is coming from it's definitely the sales and marketing line. Sort of how you're balancing for this broad vision and kind of continued growth aspirations with the margin expansion? (56:02) I have one quick-follow to that. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead (56:08). Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : (56:11) just initially, and then perhaps Marc Benioff will chip in as well. But I would say, the way we're balancing that, Phil, is that, clearly we have a huge opportunity as articulated by Marc Benioff. It's an amazing market space and the way we balance it in terms of our different offerings in our company in total is we're a growth company, number one, and we have the revenue margin framework that we look at to try to make sure we're fully taking advantage of really helping our customers in these markets, and helping them be successful. And at the end of the day, we want to also expanded our operating margins in a framework consistent with our revenue growth. And so we try to balance that at the highest level and then obviously it goes down to each of the different clouds. A lot of companies have one single product that they're driving. It's unprecedented to have the number of clouds that we have that are huge, either a billion, multi-billion, so on and so forth and there's a portfolio that people look at. But Marc and Keith, do you want to add more? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President: Yeah, I think I'll would just follow that up. This is an incredibly successful company that it's just an execution machine with great products and great customers and great innovation and great partners. And as part of being a growth company, we invest in our customers, we invest in innovation, we invest in our employees, and we invest in our partners. And when you are the leader and viewed as the trusted advisors to the most significant and important companies in the world, that's what you do, that's where you place your bets and that's where you innovate and invest in and that's what this company is all about. It's innovation and growth and customer success. Operator : We have reached our allotted time for questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our presenters. John Cummings - Director- Investor Relations : Well, thank you very much. Thanks for everyone for joining us today. We appreciate it. We look forward to updating you on our Q3 results in November.

My name is Ashley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Salesforce fiscal third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. John Cummings, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal third quarter 2016 results conference call. Our third quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at www.salesforce.com/investor, and we'll also post the highlights of today's call on Twitter at the handle, @salesforce_ir.

A description with our risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q. And with that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Well, thank you, John. And before we start and go into the call, which of course would go through our results, we want to let everybody know that our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Paris, with all of our employees and all of our customers that have been going through such a horrible situation. And we've also been just especially shaken by our customers, who have lost employees in this horrible tragedy. So we're so sorry, and our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in Paris. Now, I want to go through our third quarter results and give you an update on how we're doing. Also, joining me on the call is Keith Block, who is in New York City, who just finished the world tour there, and we watched him this morning with his team. Keith, are you there? Can you hear us? Keith Block : I am absolutely here Marc. Marc Benioff : Fantastic. All right. Well, Mark Hawkins is also with us, our Chief Financial Officer, and the three of us really feel the duty today to talk about another outstanding growth quarter for Salesforce. Now, you can see from these results, we are on pace to deliver well over $6.6 billion this year, which is faster than any other enterprise software company in history. And I am thrilled to share with you that we are expecting to deliver more than $8 billion in revenues or $8.1 billion revenue at the high-end of our range for next year. So that is amazing. And we could not be more excited about the results of the third quarter, we could not be more excited about coming into the fourth quarter and we could not be more excited about the potential for next year. And you can see that we have something in sight, which we have been talking about now for several years, which is our $10 billion a year. And of course, Salesforce, as you can see will be the fourth largest software company in the world next year, but you can see that we'll be one of the only software companies ever to reach $10 billion in revenue. And as we become number four, we have number three in our sight, and we certainly [technical difficulty] goal as well quite wholeheartedly. Now, as many of you are predicting, Salesforce will be indeed the fourth largest enterprise software company in the world next year, behind only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. And we are really making a difference for our customers and the industry, and it's attributed to our employees, almost 20,000 of these employees, who are similarly focused on one thing, our customer success. I'd like to kind of give you some specific from the results for the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter rose to more than $1.7 billion, which was up 27% in constant currency from a year ago. That is absolutely I think the best performance that I've seen in the top 10 enterprise software companies. And Salesforce continues to be the fastest growing of the top 10 enterprise software companies, and we are really excited with our 27% number. Deferred revenue grew to more than $2.8 billion or up 30% in constant currency from a year ago, pretty incredible at our size and scale to see that achievement. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $9.5 billion. So that, again, is the setting us up very well for next year and the future. As we delivered on this outstanding topline growth, we also delivered 221 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. And as you know, while we are absolutely committed to be the fastest growing enterprise software company and delivering these phenomenal topline numbers, we are also deeply committed to continuing to increase our profitability, and the results this year are evidence of that. So let's be clear, Salesforce is the only software company selling billions of dollars at CRM, and we are at the center of what every company is going through is digital transformation, it's what every company wants to be in the 21 century. So now, during the quarter, I want to tell you, I met with hundreds of CEOs around the world. And I'll tell you, when we're meeting with CEOs, they are not that interested in talking about honestly about the cloud or about social or mobile. They want to talk about their customers and they want to talk about their topline, they want to talk about how they're going to grow that topline, and this is the really, really exciting thing that's going on, which is this customer revolution. We're really talking about connecting with -- talking about talking with our customers about a connect with their customers in a whole new way, accelerate their growth, creating this one-to-one customer journeys, running their businesses from their phone and making smarter, more predictive decisions. And I'll tell you, one of those customers is us. And at the end of this quarter it just kind of blew me away. I was using Salesforce One, which has I think almost I think 1 million active users on it now. And my IT department here at Salesforce have built several new apps, which got automatically installed on my phone, because I'm using Salesforce One. And I'm using this incredible Sales Forecasting app, where I'm just physically touching on the photograph of all of our sales leaders around the world, kind of navigating through our pipelines and through our forecast, and it was amazing just to feel to run my business from my phone, and have that kind of connectivity with my customers. And I think that today more than ever connecting with customers like that is absolutely essential, because as a CEO I can tell you, it puts you on the pulse of your business and what's really going on. Well, I think that that was definitely evident for everyone who attended Dreamforce. And if you came to Dreamforce, you saw the biggest software conference ever and you also saw not just a huge amount of customers. But we really rolled out incredible new innovations, which is enabling my own personal experience with Salesforce product, but for a hundreds and thousands of Salesforce customers who are using these incredible new product like our new Lightning platform, which is amazing. You have the ability to build an application and run it on any device on a phone, on a tablet, on a PC, it transcends operating systems, it transcends devices and we have rebuilt our sales and service and our core community products and all of our core platforms on this amazing new Lightening platform. And when it shows up, it's done nothing, like I've ever seen, which gives you this incredible modern experience in mobile environment. And then of course we also added SalesforceIQ to bring machine intelligence to that. We introduced our IOC cloud, even bring it into the Internet of Things, and maybe you can you can transform that Internet of Things into Internet of Customer. Well, of course, we also have our analytics cloud with our new Wave app, and there is just still much more. And I'll tell you that walking around Dreamforce, it was just blown away off with our ecosystem, and then hundreds and hundreds of companies who have built on this platform and who have made so much happen. But I guess what I'm most proud of is that during Dreamforce we also held the largest book size ever collecting over a million book to schools. We also raised over $10 million for the UCSF Children's Hospital in San Francisco and Oakland, and I'll tell you that I want to thank all of our partners and our customers for helping us to achieve those numbers there, because it's really, really awesome. Well, I'll tell you it's been an exciting few months here at Salesforce, and I would say that nothing is more indicative of how Salesforce is delivering customer success and how this Lightning platform is being adopted. In the third quarter we delivered more than $259 billion transaction, which was up 63% from a year ago. That's 4.1 transactions every single business. There is no other customer platform come close to that level of usage. And while our transaction continue to skyrocket and our customer success continue to skyrocket, we committed also to reducing our carbon footprint. And the environment is a key stakeholder for us and we continue to show how the multi-tenant cloud platform is 98% more efficient than on-premise software. And we're helping customers avoid a many more than a million tons of carbon each year through our unique architecture of cloud computing. Well, we have to do more, and we've made significant commitments to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. And over the next several weeks, in Paris at the COP21 Conference, we'll be making more announcements on how Salesforce is focused on the environment. Well, as you're about to hear now from Keith, we're working with some of these great customers to deliver a fantastic result to accelerate the digital transformation. And I guess there was no more stronger evidence point in the analyst community than Gartner's 2016 CIO Agenda, which I am sure a lot of you follow as I do, and they found that Salesforce is rated as the number one accelerator by the majority of respondents and received the highest digital acceleration score. At a 30 vendors, Salesforce was at the top. And just Gartner did an amazing job on the CIO Agenda Report and we haven't had a chance to look at that, I would. Well, anyway, let's hear from Keith, he's had a huge day already in New York. I can see him on the monitor here, so he's still there, which is good. And so Keith, tell us how did New York go today? Keith Block : Thanks, Marc. We had a great day in New York with over 8,000 people registered. So it was a terrific event and well-received and the customers are very, very excited about our messaging. Marc Benioff : Well, Keith, you know what, I think everyone on the call would love to talk to you now about how your experience was in the field. We obviously had a great Dreamforce. We saw more customers this year. I know you and I this year have been in front of more CEOs and CIOs I think ever in our entire career, and everyone wants to talk about how to transform the customer experience. I don't know a company today that isn't reviewing on how to transform their customer experience and how to not get, I guess, a lot of them say, they don't want to get uberized out of the world. But some of them I think are don't want to get postmated out of the world, because I just ordered my lunch on postmates here in San Francisco. So maybe you can tell me your experience there in New York. Keith Block : All right. So thanks, Marc, I appreciate it. And it's great to be here, and obviously thanks to everybody for joining the call. As Marc had indicated, this was just a terrific third quarter. And one that I would characterize, I think we all would characterize, as one of the most memorable exciting quarters that we've had here at Salesforce. And we heard it today and we continue to hear, the message from our customers is very clear. And while many of our competitors are struggling quite frankly to catch up for the cloud, Salesforce is taking customers and foreigners forward into the age of the customers. We are squarely in this age of the customer. Marc and I just talked about this, but I had the opportunity to kick off our Salesforce world tour here in New York. Again, over 8,000 people registered for this event. And people want to be here, both customers and prospects, companies like American Express, and Mattel, and Western Union and awful lot of customers through a variety of industries about how they are reinventing their futures and leveraging Salesforce. And as I speak to you, the top customers around the world, and Marc is exactly right, many of them are CEOs, which is terrific. There is a constant theme that keeps coming through here, and that is that we are clearly in this age of the customer and the time of cutting your way to prosperity is over. And when you think about it, the agenda for every CEO in the world is growth. And the reason why CEOs are coming to us is because they've see Salesforce as that catalyst for growth, and we are also quite frankly a catalyst for customer success. So whether it's a company of all shapes and sizes, whether it's a business model with B2B or B2C, large company or small company, regardless of the industry, these CEOs are really looking at us now to be their trusted advisor, and really help them define their new customer strategy, their digital strategy, their engagement model in really new ways to transform into a customer companies, and that's just become super, super important to them. And all of this has translated some of the most exciting deals that we've done in our industry. We had another huge quarter of fantastic wins. In fact, the total number of our large transactions in Q3 was up significantly compared to last year in terms of value. Our relationships are becoming bigger, they are becoming broader, they are becoming more strategic and deeper. And we are now working with some of the world's greatest brands, and this is a far different roster of companies that we have historically worked with. A big part of that success quite frankly has been our industry strategy, and we talked about this on many calls, but this is about our ability to speak the lines of customers and to understand their business problems and drive a level of innovation and a point of view. And it's become a regular part of how we engage with customers of all size, from the smallest to the largest of enterprise. And it's really proving out in our results. And I'll give you a few examples. Certainly, there is a company that we've all heard of called, General Motors. They have 125 million cars on the road. They have a significant vision for the connected vehicle. And in Q3, they selected Salesforce to connect drivers, the cars, merchants and retailer to bring a connected vision, a great experience to life. And with a push of a button, drivers are going to be able to instantly connect with the OnStar advisor and retailers and merchants, and it doesn't matter where they are, and they're going to get real-time information. And this is an example of a company GM that is really embracing the opportunity around the Internet of Things. And we are really excited about working with them. We are entering the holiday season, as we all know. We're seeing a lot of traction in retail. And I'm thrilled that we closed the largest marketing cloud deal in the company's history with a very large retailer in Q3. They are taking things to the next level by personalizing the shopper experience across every single channel. We're going to be at the core of their omni-channel consumer engagement strategy, and they will be able to create a very personalized and predictive one-to-one relationship with customers at every single touchpoint, which is really compelling. And they're also going to be able to anticipate what the next step is and what the next action is, and what customer might need and relevant suggestions at exactly the right moment. So we are very excited about that new partnership. Another great win was with AECOM. If you're familiar with AECOM, they design and build and finance and operate some of the largest and most iconic infrastructure projects around the globe, including here in New York the World Trade Center and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic stadium, which we're very excited about, as are they. They have nearly 100,000 employees in more than 150 countries. And we are all thrilled that AECOM has decided to move their entire company to our platform. In finance and services, which is certainly a key focus area for us, we have expanded our relationship with American Express, one of the great brands in the industry, a company that has been delivering world-class service for more than 160 years. In the quarter, American Express selected Salesforce to bring their sales and marketing and product teams altogether to collaborate and to coordinate, so that they can further transform their customer experiences for their business payments. Super excited about that new relationship. And what's interesting about that deal is that Amex and so many others continue to use our Ignite process to really reconceptualize their futures. And this is a very unique solution selling approach that is all about the art of the possible. We have increased our Ignite tenfold in the past few years. It is a standard part of our selling motion. It is one of the best investments quite frankly that we've made and it's having a significant impact with our customers. If fact, one of the leading high-tech manufacturing company in the world also engaged with us in the quarter and in ignite. And that resulted in a significance eight figure deal, which we're very, very excited about. And right before Dreamforce, I think as we all know, we introduced our first vertical-specific product line with health cloud and financial services cloud. We're very excited about the growth opportunity for these clouds. The interest has been very strong. We're excited about their future. And these products are really translating our incredible core technology into the language of the customer, which is part of our industry strategy. And we are cultivating an excellent ecosystem of partners for all of these solutions. So we're excited about that as well. International continues to be a cornerstone of our growth strategy. And in the quarter we extended our relationship with a company called AB InBev. They've been in the press a lot recently. They are one of the world's top five consumer product companies. They've standardized their collaboration with us globally, and that's after a successful relationship start in Europe. And now they're going to reinforce the consumer-eccentric digital approach and innovation efforts, leveraging our products as well. So we're excited about that. And AB InBev joined ABB and Barclays and GlaxoSmithKline, Telef\u00f3nica, Virgin Media and so many great leading companies in Europe, again who selected Salesforce in Q3. In Asia-Pac, we continue with our strength. We closed deals with Australian Post and Syntel, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Toyota, and the list goes on there. So I really couldn't be more thrilled about the success we're seeing internationally. We continue to invest in our selling capacity, our service capacity, our data centers, our offices, our partners, all to drive growth and to make our customers successful. Another area where we continue to make progress quite frankly is with our partners in our ecosystem. And I'm very proud of the results we're seeing with regional and global systems integrators. Our partner certifications in the quarter, they were up more than 40% from a year ago, which is outstanding. And with all of our global SIs growing at an even faster rate, this is a great indicator that the most important consulting partners and firms in the world are betting their business and their customers' business on Salesforce. So we have firms like Accenture and Deloitte, PwC and Cap Gemini, they're all increasing their Salesforce practices. They are walking arm-in-arm into the C-suite with Salesforce. And in addition our app cloud continues to be the platform of choice for innovation by our ISVs. And a great example of where our industry strategy works hand in glove with our ecosystem strategy, a firm named Accenture we're all familiar with, selected Salesforce as a partner to transform the front office of consumer goods companies around the world. So they will be bringing their Accenture CAS solution on to the Salesforce app exchange, which is a great endorsement of our platform and critical to our join industry strategy. So in closing I want to say, thank you to all of our customers and thank you to all of our partners for their trust in us and their confidence in us. And I'd also like to thank our incredible employees for their outstanding execution in the quarter and this unrelenting dedication to customer success. And right now we are firing all cylinders, our investments in the industries, our partner ecosystem, our international regions is all paying off. And we have excellent momentum coming out of Dreamforce. And really Marc, based on what I say in New York this morning, we are very well positioned for a very strong finish to the FY '16, and we're looking forward to a historic close this year. Marc Benioff : I will tell you, Keith, we couldn't be more proud of you and your sales team, so congratulations. It's so exciting. We really appreciate everything that you're doing. And Keith, I'll tell you, I watched the Sales Cloud Keynote after your keynotes today and Accenture was the speaker with Sarah Varney during the Sales Cloud Keynotes, and what was really interesting, they talked about how not only are they doing this incredible partnership, building products on our platform to sell to their customers, but that they have rolled out 25,000 users internally. And their speaker today in New York, on the video I watched, talked about what how he learned working with Salesforce is that the key to success is to be bold and go fast and just go do whatever you can and just go as much, much faster than any other platform he had ever worked with. Keith, what are you hearing from Accenture, why are they having such a great success internally and now becoming this incredible reseller partner? Keith Block : It's interesting. I had dinner before -- last night we had a dinner with 40 of our greatest customers and prospects. And I sat next to the CEO of Accenture, North America. And we had an excellent dialogue about the partnership and the relationship. And Accenture is just a culture that embraces transformation. And so they appreciate the level of transformation. They know what their customers are looking for. And because of that they want to partner with a company like Salesforce, who understands growth, understands transformation. So it's a very good linkage between the two firms. And that's what we're seeing in interest marketplace and that's why Accenture was happy to establish that a partnership in the consumer packaged good space, that's why Accenture is our number one partner. And that's why they continue to evangelize a great message that we have to our joint customers. Marc Benioff : Well, it has been impressive to see, Accenture is definitely jumped into cloud computing and the social, mobile and IoTs after than any of the other systems integrators. Even though they're largest, they move the fastest. And now to see them deploy internally and also build these solutions on the platform is still exciting, so congratulations on that, as well, Keith. And let's go over to Mark Hawkins and hear about the numbers. Mark? Mark Hawkins : Fantastic. Thank you, Marc. We delivered another great quarter with consistent execution and balanced growth across all of our products and geographies. And our results this quarter set us up for a strong finish in FY '16, as discussed, and another solid year in FY '17. Third quarter revenue was $1.71 billion, up 24% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange, continue to impact revenue with a year-over-year headwind of $40 million and a sequential headwind of $6 million. We continue to see strong year-over-year constant currency growth in all of our geographies with the Americas growing 27%, EMEA growing 28%, and Asia-Pac growing 25% Each of our clouds delivered outstanding year-over-year growth on a dollar basis with Sales Cloud growing 10%, Service Cloud growing 38%, App Cloud and other growing 40%, and Marketing Cloud growing 29%. Dollar attrition for the third quarter excluding Marketing Cloud was approximately 9%. From a bottomline perspective, we delivered another quarter of improving profitability. In fact, we have now increased our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin for the sixth consecutive quarters, up 221 basis points over Q3 of last year. Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.21. Non-GAAP EPS includes approximately $0.01 from our lower than anticipated non-GAAP tax rate, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Our great topline and bottomline performance in Q3 drove another solid quarter of cash generation with operating cash flow of a $118 million. This was slightly down year-over-year about 4%, while operating cash flow year-to-date was up 37% compared to the same period over last year and that's now up to $1.2 billion year-to-date, which is very exciting. Marc, it took us 15 years to get to a $1 billion in cash flow and we did it in the first two quarters and now we're topping it, so we're really excited about that. For the full year, we continue to anticipate operating cash flow in the growth of 24% to 25%, consistent with our prior guidance and our revenue growth operating margin framework. Third quarter free cash flow defined as operating cash flow plus CapEx was $38 million, down 23% over the last year. Again, year-to-date free cash flow was $937 million, up 47% over the first nine months of the last year. Looking at billed deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 28% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $41 million, deferred revenue grew 30% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of $7 million. In the quarter, 79% of the value of all subscription and support related invoices were issued with annual terms compared to 73% in Q3 of last year. This is a bit higher than anticipated and translated into approximately 2 percentage points of deferred revenue growth in the quarter. Moving on to guidance. With our great performance into the third quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $25 million. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.64 billion to $6.65 billion for 24% growth year-over-year. The guidance continues to include an FX headwind of approximately $175 million. We are also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.74 to $0.75 or $0.03 at the high end of the range, which is approximately $0.02, as a result of our outperformance and about $0.01 as a result of our lower full year non-GAAP tax rate. Now, let me take a minute to discuss our non-GAAP tax rate. We are adjusting our projected full year non-GAAP tax rate to 35.5%, in light of a recent Altera tax opinion. You may recall that we began to compute and use the fixed long-term non-GAAP tax rate during FY '15, and as we said, we would reevaluate this rate annually and/or as the situation rises where we need to reevaluate that and that is exactly the case as it relates to Altera, and that's just the situation where we needed to true that up. And we'll continue to reevaluate that and give you update as we need to. For Q4, our full year guidance implies revenue growth of approximately $1.782 billion to $1.792 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19 and billed deferred revenue growth of approximately 23% to 24%. And as you heard from Marc, we are pleased to be initiating fiscal revenue guidance of approximately $8 billion to $8.1 billion for year-over-year growth of 20% to 22%. In fact, FY '17 feels very similar to last year, as we continue to deliver strong growth at scale. And we will provide additional details about our outlook for FY '17 on our fourth quarter call in February. To close, we had a strong third quarter and we are well-positioned for a great finish to FY '16 and to deliver another solid year in FY '17. Thanks to all of our employees for continuing to deliver these outstanding results. And with that I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow : I have a question on Service Cloud, because obviously the revenue there, which is obviously lagging a bit, continues to grow just phenomenally. No sort of sign of deceleration there. If it continued at this pace, you could almost see within a couple of years, Service Cloud overtaking Sales Cloud. So the question is what are dynamics that are going on there? How would you compare them to the Sales Cloud, when it was sort of at this point of its lifecycle? And are you displacing more legacy vendors? Is it net new? Is it replacing to give custom developed software? I mean, how should we think about Service Cloud? Marc Benioff : Well, I think the way to think about Service Cloud is, first and foremost, these are mega markets. Sales, service, marketing, analytics, these are all multibillion dollar markets. We actually called them internally swimmers and we call them swimmers in their lanes. And we look at these products each going down their own lane, and yes, you're right, service is performing incredibly well, but so is sales, so is analytics, so is community, so is our platform, so is marketing, we have many, many high-performing swimmers. And we don't just look it at that way, by the way. We not only see that, we see it by geography, and we also look at it in verticals. And in each of the strategic areas that we've made this big bets, we continue to see very high performance. And in customer service and support, if you read Gartner's most recent Customer Engagement Magic Quadrant, you'll see Salesforce is number one. We've displaced Oracle, we've displaced SAP. These were traditionally the leaders in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, and so we're not only now the number one in the Magic Quadrant on sales, which we have been for few years, but now we're number one in the Magic Quadrant for service, which means we actually have the best product possible. Our customers just have phenomenal success. We have great examples of customers who have tens of thousands of users deployed on this product. We have examples of customers who have tens of users, hundreds of users. But what's unusual our Service Cloud is you could be a very small company or you could be a massive company, and you can use our Service Cloud. And when you look at requirements for customers to provide extended customer service, especially in regards to areas like the Internet of Things, when our core customers like Cisco or Phillips or even Coca Cola are more connected to their customer than ever before, the first point of access with those customers is customer service, so they better have their customer service act together if they're going to drive the customer revolution. So of course, we continue to do well in all of our core products, but also customer service is a critical part of our portfolio. Keith, you want to add anything to that. Keith Block : I think, Marc, you're spot on. I mean, at the end of the day, we are performing well across all of our clouds. And certainly as we talked about service, a lot of companies in a variety of industries differentiate themselves with service. And when you think of this Age of the Customer where there are billions of connected devices and connected things, and you think about what service can do in terms of the business model, leveraging IoT and Analytics it's very, very powerful in terms of disruption and differentiation and changing business models and that is really the level of dialog that we are having with many, many companies and it's very exciting. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : I wanted to ask a little bit about the platform business, and in two directions. We saw a little bit of acceleration in that business. I think, Marc, you talked a little bit about some of the internal reasons for that. We also see in acceleration in some of the other big platforms out there like Amazon Web Services and Azure, both of them have seen accelerating growth. So I wanted your view on it. Are we seeing something of a broader industry trend, that's sort of really an acceleration in the move towards those cloud-based platforms, as de facto standard of where we're going to developing applications. So I just wanted your view on that? And two, similarly, do you see Amazon Web Service and Azure increasingly as competitors for their platform business for you guys? Marc Benioff : Yes, that's a great question, and let me address that. So there is no doubt, we are at a tipping point in cloud platforms. And companies who have been cloud deniers like SAP and Oracle are paying a horrible price in single-digit and negative growth, because companies are not buying their products, because they are not modern. And they are not built-in this kind of modern architecture. When you look at the cloud opportunity there is different opportunities. And one opportunity is at the applications layer, where we dominate in sales and service and marketing, where we have these multi, multiple billion dollar clouds, all kind of underway, which I've just talked about in the last question. But the next layer down, which is declarative and programmatic application development and deployment, especially in rapid application development and deployment, this is an area where we also have incredible success. Gartner calls this aPaaS, Application Platform-as-a-Service. You look at our product like our App Cloud, Salesforce1, Lightning, Heroku, this is an area that's very strategic to us, because our core applications are built with our platform, which gives our customers basically the plasticity necessary to kind of take our applications apart and putting them back together, this is an area that's very important to us. The next layer down is, kind of what we traditionally call Infrastructure-as-a-Service. Amazon Web Services, which we are a huge customer of Amazon Web Services, Amazon is also a huge customer of Salesforce, and we use the Amazon Web Services to build our products. For example, Heroku is one of the most successful platforms on the Amazon Web Services and has been incredible success for Salesforce.com and also demonstrates the power of Amazon's platform. Salesforce also has been working with Microsoft on how we're going to be using Azure as part of our product line as well. We're very excited about Microsoft. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We've talked about that, and I think Azure is terrific. And Google, by the way, is a huge customer of Salesforce. We use Google's platform very extensively at Salesforce as well. And I'll tell you something that it's critical for the operations of our company, and the Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud platforms. We're a very modern company and how we've deployed IT internally, that's given us the flexibility to grow. We tutor and mentor other CIOs and industry leaders and show them what we've done to build a modern company using this highly flexible IT infrastructure, but it's because we're doing all three of these layers. One, very flexible dynamic, highly innovative, three releases a year, applications at the top; in the middle, rapid application development and deployment of apps, like I was talking about new apps appearing on my phone instantly from my IT department in that APAS area; and also an Infrastructure-as-a-Service, where we partner with Amazon, we partner with Microsoft and we partner with Google, those are three core strategic partners in Infrastructure-as-a-Service, and that's the modern IT infrastructure. And of course, what do we all run it on, we don't run it on our laptops, but we run it on our phones. And that's the power of the modern age. And this gives you the level of speed in IT. It gives you much lower total cost of ownership. And it gives you a rate of innovation, because you're not waiting three or four years for a new release, you're waiting three or four months, sometimes three or four days before you're getting incredible new features and functionality. And so yes, we are at a tipping point. You could see that in the results of Amazon. You can see it in the results of Microsoft. You can see it in the results of Google. And you can see it in the results of Salesforce. And for companies who have denied that this shift is happening, for companies who have fooled customers to be afraid of this shift, and for companies who have tried to stop this shift, look at where they are today. It's quite a good example of Clayton Christensen theories regarding The Innovator's Dilemma. Operator : And your next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Question for Keith. On the industry strategy, you mentioned that's providing a very nice tailwind for you in the field. You mentioned the retail case. I'm curious, if you could talk about some of the other verticals that you're starting to see open up given the all the hard work that you've been laying in many of the other vertical segments? Keith Block : Yes, no problem, I'm happy to fill that question. Look, across the board, I mean if you look at the wins in the quarter, we had some terrific experiences with financial services, obviously with American Express and automotive with General Motors and consumer package goods with AB InBev and Mattel. So financial services is very strong, healthcare and life sciences is very strong, retail is really picking up, CPG is really picking up, manufacturing has always been a strength for the company, but we continue to do very, very well. I alluded to that deal that we closed earlier. So it really has become a situation where in no surprise customers want to speak to us and we should be speaking to them in their language. And that is the whole idea behind the industry strategy, and it starts with that. It starts with the messaging and the creation of the solution. It also moved into making sure they're organized carefully and we've done that very carefully over the last 2.5 years in physical organizations that focus on vertical markets. And then the third is to start delivering product, which we announced, again, just before Dreamforce around Health Cloud and Financial Services Cloud. So it's really a three pronged industry strategy that is resonating with our customers. They want more of it. They certainly don't want less of it. And we already had a very compelling and differentiated solution, but when you also add this sort of layer on it with the industry messaging and going to market by industry and also adding to this product set, it becomes super compelling and customers really, really like what we're doing. Operator : Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Marc, one question for you. When you look at the company from a $1 billion to $5 billion, Service Cloud really led that engine of growth. As you look to expand the business for up about 50% to a $10 billion revenue company, what are the lead engines here? Obviously, service and sales as big as they are, they cannot get you to grow as rapidly. So are we going to see other engines come to the forefront in order to help you to increase your business by 50%, be it analytics or platform or verticals? And one for you, Mark Hawkins, as the renewal business becomes larger and larger, what kind of impact does it have on your margins? Marc Benioff : Well, I think this is a great question, Kash, and is something that Keith and Mark and I are talking about with Alex Dayon as well almost every single day, because we're working on our fiscal year '17 budgets. And when you look at the great success of a lot of these core products, we want to continue to fuel them. Certainly, Service Cloud is amazing. Marketing Cloud, obviously, is also amazing, and Sales Cloud, of course, has achieved a level of revenue that we never could have anticipated and continues to grow. And we have other, as I said, kind of swimmers in their lanes doing very, very well. Now, in addition of those core products, especially with the tip of the Marketing Cloud and its outstanding performance, especially since we acquired ExactTarget and integrated that very deeply into the company, I think also you have to look at what Keith has done with public sector, which is very exciting for us and is a huge opportunity for our company. And of course, the verticals where we're continuing to build some new products, including our wealth management product that we've announced and our health product and other applications categories that we see, and that I will also have to say ISVs. So ISVs remains a really powerful growth channel as well. So if we have any problem with Salesforce, it's that we have a huge amount to invest next year, but we can't just peanut butter and give everybody something. We have to make some bet and to invest in some these winners that I'm talking about, because we have had some phenomenal results as well. Mark Hawkins : So one of the things that I just want to jump in on, Marc, on that point is, the second aspect of the question, which is around renewals and what we saw there from margins, Kash, I'm happy to address that. The first thing we always think about obviously is customer success. And we want to make sure that happens and that really promotes renewals. And we'd love the attrition rate, Kash, it's been happening. You track the company for a long, long time, and you watched that come down now into the approximately 9% range and that really helps us. And so as we think about margins going forward, as it relates to renewals, one of the things I just would almost level it up and say, all of our unit economics suggest that we can hit the mid-30s in terms of our operating margin over the long-term at mature revenue growth rates. And part of that is because we're taking good care of the customer, part of that is because we keep the attrition rate low and part of that is we continue to get scale with unit economics that we can see today. So Kash, I think the long and the short of it is, as that renewal business continues to grow, our number one priority is to take care of the customer and number two is we will fulfill the operating margin in the mid-30s, long, long-term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : My question is for Marc Benioff, Aneel Bhusri recently said that if the first 10 years is about cloud, the next 10 years is going to be about data and analytics. And he commented that there won't be any difference between the transaction systems and the analytical systems. So I was just wondering first off, Marc, what do you think of that statement and how far do you want to push the boundaries of data science at Salesforce? In other words, do you think you would have more of a focus on analytics to support sales service and marketing or are you thinking very broadly pushing into machine learning, predictive behavioral unstructured data, massive data volumes for Internet of Things, and really becoming a hub for essentially any kind of data? Marc Benioff : Well, here is how I look at it, which is, Aneel is a very close friend of mine and I just got a text from him, while we're on the call here. And I look at it differently and I'll tell you why. I think the next 10 years is the age of the customer. I don't think it's the age of data science or the age of machine intelligence or the age of cognitive or the age of mobility or the age of social or the age of cloud or whatever, okay, because all of those things are going to be important in the next 10 years. All of those things, the cloud, social, mobile, data science, deep learning, MLP, machine intelligence, those are table stakes. Those are table stakes. What you're going to do with that technology? Who is not using those technologies? Phillips is using that technology. GE is using that technology. Apple is using that technology. Cisco is using that technology. Coca Cola, Unilever, they're all using. Look, if the next 10 years for these companies is going to be about customer, what are they doing to build a world-class customer experience? How do they transform from being product companies to customer experience companies? And as millennials takeover in these enterprises, they're going to be much more focused on experiences and that is going to be the transformational lever for growth with these companies. And I think that if we get to into any one particular technology, or if I was to all of a sudden wave the flag like I used to do 15 or 16 years ago for cloud, okay, that would be a huge misstate for a company, because the number one thing, most important thing to this company is the customer. So there was a really good discussion between Ginni Rometty, who is the CEO of IBM and John Stumpf, who is the CEO of Well Fargo Bank at a conference that I was just at put on by Fortune Magazine here in San Francisco, and I'm sure that the transcript is available online, but you will see that when she is discussing her strategy is to become the cognitive company. And when he is discussing his strategy it's to become the customer company. And I think that we too have to decide what kind of companies are we going to be? I'm going with customer-company. I want to be a customer company like John Stumpf does. He is all about the customer, maintaining the integrity and the fidelity of the customer relationship. I want to help him do that, and yes, will cognitive help him to do that? Yes. Will cloud help him to do that? Yes, it's doing it. Is mobile, yes; social, yes; IoT, yes; all of these things. But let's keep our eye on the ball, which there is a transformational force that is wafting its way through all of these companies and every company is afraid that they're going to be uberized out of the world. And they see it happening. And it could be financial services. It could be IBM, okay. Every company is worried about -- look at the decline of IBM over the last decade. Technology is shaking every company at its roots. So that's why the companies who will be the most successful are the ones who are most connected to the customers, because the customers are the ones who guide us into the future. They are the ones with the true vision of where we have to go. So I'm going with customer on this one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : First off, Marc, I love the interview format with you and Keith. Please do that again, it makes the call pretty entertaining. I've got two questions for Mark Hawkins. Mark, at Dreamforce in the Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about the renewal activity skewing a little bit more fourth quarter. And I wanted to just check to make sure you're as confidant that that will happen, as you were a few months ago. And then secondly, you talked about the mix of annual invoicing hitting 79%, that to me as well felt a little high and I thought maybe you could explain why it did? And if that rate of increase is likely to continue? Mark Hawkins : Happy to do both there, Karl, and again good to talk to you. Let's just talk about the second question first, and then we'll go back to the renewals. I'll say the first thing is that we are pleased, we have been on a path to just increase our invoices to annual from FY '12, so we've been on a steady path with continuous improvement. And we report out when we next progress, and last quarter we continued to make progress. As you noted, Karl, year-on-year, we went from 74% of our invoices being annual to 79%, and so that is just good progress, good execution. We're pleased to see it. It works well for lots of and lots of different reasons. And that added, as I called out, about roughly 2 points of growth to deferred revenue year-on-year. But I think we have continued runway on this in the sense that the more enterprise business we get, the more natural it is for people to go to the annual terms that we're looking for. So I wouldn't expect any sharp turns, Karl. I think about this is a steady progression with, yes, more runway in the future. Key thing about it is moderate and that's what we're intending and I think it's just good execution. That's number one. Number two, in terms of renewals, and one of the things for everybody on the call just as a reminder, we just talked about the quantum of our renewals. If you think about when they show up, and Q4 is when they show up the most, when you think about kind of the historical patterns of our business, and in fact, that is what we expect. And that's all comprehended in our guidance, which we feel really good about both for Q4, the strong finish, and also as we point into next year. Obviously, hitting something worth $8 billion to $8.1 billion on topline revenue, we feel really good about for the company to continue to grow and execute at the scale. So those are my answers on both points, Karl. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. End of Q&A John Cummings : Great. Thank you so much, Ashley, and thanks so much everyone for joining us. Sorry, we couldn't get to all your questions. If you have any follow-up for us, you can reach out to us investor@salesforce.com. And if you miss the world tour in New York today, you'll have multiple other opportunities. We'll be in Tokyo and Los Angeles in December, in Minneapolis, Atlanta, Houston and Dallas and Seattle. And so if you'd like to hear some of these great transformational stories of how Salesforce is changing customer experiences, you can tune into that. Otherwise, we look forward to giving you an update on our progress in Q4 in February. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. John Cummings. Sir, you may begin your conference. John Cummings - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks so much, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results conference call. Our fourth quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; and Mark Hawkins, CFO. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may also contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should any of our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of our risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. With that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks, John. And this is our biggest call ever, we've got over 500 people around the world, who are dialed into the call. And so, we know there's a lot of interest in the quarter and we made a decision, we're going to put aside the vast majority of our script so that we can get into Q&A as fast as possible with you. Look, my number one thing I want to tell you is, this is the absolute best quarter we have ever had. It's been just an incredible quarter, way beyond our expectations. It caps an incredible fiscal year for us. I'm sure that you saw that revenue for the quarter rose to $1.8 billion, and that's up 27%, which is really just amazing. Revenue for the full fiscal year was also up 27%, $6.7 billion. So you look at those things and you go, wow, I mean, that's a very fast growth rate for a company of our size and scale. For a top-10 enterprise software company, you all know the growth rates of Microsoft, Oracle, SAP are shrinking; negative growth rates in many cases, and here we are at a 27% growth rate in this enterprise applications market. And as Keith gets into it, you're going to hear that we believe that we're selling more enterprise apps than Oracle or SAP. Deferred revenue grew to nearly $4.3 billion, which was up 31%. Quarterly operating cash flow was nearly $460 million, up 38%. That number, of course, exceeded everyone's expectation and took us by surprise as well. And we are really proud of that number, $460 million quarterly operating cash flow in the quarter. Full-year operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, up 37%. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion. That is obviously a huge number for us, something that we've never had before, and it's really a huge reflection of the amount of business that has been achieved in the fiscal year and specifically, in the quarter as well. We've got great momentum going into our first quarter. We're guiding to an incredible number here, and $1.895 billion at the high end of our range. And for the full-year, we're increasing our revenue guidance to $8.12 billion. So, we are really excited and aggressive in our guidance. And, look, it was an amazing quarter. It was an amazing year. We are confident it's going to be an amazing first quarter. And no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering at this level or as excited as we are, and no one else is as well positioned for this age of the customer that we are all moving into in this fourth industrial revolution. Before I hand the call now over to Keith, I just want to thank all of our customers, and I want to thank all of our partners, and I also want to congratulate all 20,000 of our employees on an amazing year. We are deeply, deeply, deeply grateful for everything that you do for us every day, and we don't forget that. For one moment, every single day with us at salesforce starts with gratitude, and we know that this is a special time and we're grateful for all the hard work that everyone has put in. Also, I know you're going to want to catch us on our World Tour that's coming up, and big events are starting next month. You'll see us at CeBIT in Germany, and then Chicago, Boston, Melbourne, Amsterdam. We'll be in Washington, D.C. as well, so come to one of our events, and we've got a great new COO here at salesforce as well. So, Keith, congratulations on your promotion. Well done. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Thank you very much, Marc. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And why don't you tell us about the quarter? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Marc. Listen, this was an amazing quarter. Our team, really the whole company, delivered the best quarter in my two years here at salesforce. It was a breakthrough quarter. It certainly was a breakthrough year for us, and it translated into some amazing results in every region, every industry and really accounted across companies of all sizes. We signed two of the largest deals that I've seen in my career. I mean absolutely fantastic. I mean, first we signed an exciting new nine-figure transaction with one of the world's most respected companies; and second, we signed the largest renewal in the history of the company; and, listen, they didn't just renew. They also significantly expanded their nine-figure relationship with us in Q4, and we are now their company-wide platform for innovation. I mean it's really amazing what the team has done, and how these customers have embraced us. We also drove an all-time high in the number of large transactions this year, which is incredible \u2013 more than 600, seven-figure plus transactions in the quarter. And I'll tell you, Marc said it, I'll say it again, no one in enterprise software \u2013 no one in enterprise software is developing more strategic relationships right now than salesforce. And, you know what, there's no better example of this than Unilever, which is one of the world's greatest consumer packaged goods companies. It's a great digital transformation story and a significant \u2013 significant expansion for us here in Q4. We've been delivering great levels of success with their consumer and marketing teams. We're now working across all business functions and Unilever plans to bring 95,000 of their employees onto the salesforce platform. So, that means they are empowering their digital employee strategy to new levels of engagement. Now, Charles Schwab and other great brand is an exciting new relationship in the quarter. They'll be using salesforce for their entire CRM platform. This is a great example of how Ignite, an industry team, have played a pivotal role with an important customer; as you all know, Ignite is part of our go-to-market motion. Also I think we had mentioned in Q1, if you remember, we had told you about our largest Marketing Cloud win ever then we signed an even bigger one in Q3 and in Q4 we did it again. We talked ourselves and we entered into our largest Marketing Cloud relationship ever with a large social network. In fact, Marketing Cloud continues its success and increased the number of large Marketing Cloud transactions by more than 60% in the past year. Also one of the largest retailers in the world expanded with us in the quarter and selected salesforce as their company-wide collaboration platform. And you know what, there are many, many, many more stories. These are some of the world's greatest brands, some of the greatest stories and we continue to deepen our strategic relationships with all of them. I mean, this is great momentum, it's incredible momentum and growth across all of our key industries, in all of our key markets. And I will say again, as Marc did, I'm very, very proud of the entire company for all of these accomplishments, all our outstanding results are just proof positive that our strategy is absolutely more than taking hold. I'd also like to thank our customers and our partners, because they are helping us set the standard for this industry. So with that, I'll hand it over to Mark Hawkins. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Keith. We had an incredible financial quarter, so let me start off with some highlights. In addition to the operating cash flow results, Marc mentioned, we continue to drive increased operating leverage. For the full-year, we increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 177 basis points, this is a great result as we continue to grow our top line. Our year-over-year growth was balanced across all of our clouds and all of our regions. Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with 12% growth. Service Cloud grew 35%. Marketing Cloud grew 31%. And Apps Cloud and Others grew 43%. In the regions, EMEA grew 33% and APAC continues to accelerate at 26% growth, both in constant currency. We also got up to a great start in Q4. And that early quarter strength translated into strong billings and collections in the quarter and helped drive our cash flow in Q4. It also helped us drive our top line performance in Q4 and when you exclude the FX effect of $32 million, revenue was up 27% in constant currency. Supporting this great top line growth was our declining attrition rate, which remained below 9%. Our deferred revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $4.3 billion, this was up 31% in constant currency, when excluding an FX effect of $48 million. We also continue to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter with 88% of all our subscription and support related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the quarter by approximately three percentage points. Moving on to guidance, coming off of strong Q4 and with our proven business model, we are raising our FY 2017 revenue guidance to $8.12 billion at the high end of the range. We're also initiating FY 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $0.99 to $1.01. In context, we expect to deliver 125 basis points to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY 2017. And this is just coming off a year where we exceeded the high end of our FY 2016 operating margin guidance. As a result of this, we continued margin expansion, we expect to drive another full-year of strong operating cash flow with year-over-year growth of 23% to 24%. For Q1, we're expecting revenue of $1.885 billion to $1.895 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.24, and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 24% to 25%. A quick note on our Q1 guide; as all of you know, FY 2017 is a leap year. And given we recognize our revenue on a daily basis, there's an extra day of subscription revenue in the first quarter. This will benefit our first quarter revenue by approximately $20 million and will drive a slightly higher non-GAAP EPS and will reduce our deferred revenue by the corresponding amount. This is simply a timing item, that has no impact on the full FY 2017 fiscal year results, but this will have an impact on your quarterly and full-year compares in FY 2018. To close, we had an outstanding quarter and year, and we are well positioned for yet another great year in FY 2017. And at this time, I'd like to add my thanks to the entire salesforce team for these great results. With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. John Cummings - Vice President- Investor Relations : Ashley, we'll take calls when you're ready. Operator : We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and very strong, very nice quarter. I guess the question I wanted to ask was the why \u2013 to Mr. Benioff, like you're saying not many companies at this scale actually see accelerating growth. Anything you can point just to, in terms of why you guys are seeing this now? What's really clicking on in the business that will let you guys accelerate? And then maybe if I could squeeze in one for Mr. Hawkins, just in terms of as we're thinking about FY 2017, the business is getting increasingly seasonal, so in Q1 growth would be a little bit lower and more growth in the back half of the year. Given the current sort of economic environment, how do you garner confidence in the ability to sustain this 20%-plus growth for the full-year of FY 2017? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, our growth strategy is really built on having a full portfolio of products. I think you know about that in Sales, in Service, in Marketing, Community and Analytics, in Apps, in IoT, and as well as a full portfolio of geographies as well, doing business around the world like in the United States, in Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada; and in addition to doing business with enterprises and as well as small and medium businesses. And when that full portfolio accelerates, that is they all come in, in the quarter, which we really never expect, every product and every geography in both enterprise and SMB to come in, then you get this kind of accelerated revenue growth, which is what you see at this 27% number on both the year and the quarter. As I said in my opening remarks, it's the best quarter we've ever seen. We would never expect to see every product group and every geography and every sector of our business exceed our expectations. But that's what we saw in the fourth quarter and that creates this phenomenal momentum that we have now. And look at that number on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion, there's no greater predictor of our future success than this deferred revenue that we now have in place. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Great. Let me pick up the second half of that question that you directed. Just building on Marc's comments, I think you'd asked a little bit about the seasonality in FY 2017 starting with Q1. Back at our Analyst Day, Keith, I was referring to, we looked at this compounding effect and more and more of our renewals and business happening and showing up in Q4, showing up in the impact in DR and then having a quarter-on-quarter effect throughout the year. That compounding effect, in fact, is happening. We see that, and I affirm that, and you can see just a terrific Q4 result and a terrific DR performance. On the macro side, to Marc's point, when you have $11 billion of booked and billed and unbilled deferred revenue, that gives you a lot of confidence. When you see our big deals coming in, like Keith referenced, it gives you the confidence. When you see the business performing across geos, across clouds, that gives you the confidence that our book of business and what we're hearing from the customer had basically caused us to raise our guidance, and that's what we're seeing. Now we read the same newspapers as everybody else. We're not seeing an economic impact. We're seeing customers doing the kinds of things that we talked about earlier on the call. So, hopefully that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question, and apologize for the background noise here. Marc, I've not heard of nine-figure deals in technology. Can you talk about what exactly, Marc Benioff, that is, or Keith, can you talk about the dynamics here? Who did you displace? What is the scope of this implementation? What is this customer looking to do with salesforce's portfolio of products, and could this be a \u2013 hopefully a leading forward indicator of what other customers could also adopt from the salesforce product family? Thanks. Congrats. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Kash, you make a very good point, which is, these are very unusual transactions and we never like to over-emphasize these transactions, because they tend to be few and far between, because they are just exceptional in size, quality and depth. But we had an incredible renewal with one of the world's largest insurance companies, and we had an incredible new transaction with one of the world's largest professional services companies. And it really, I think, is a testament to some of the processes that Keith has put into place in regards to the enterprise and I'm going to let him speak to that. And I want to also make the comment that it's not just those two large transactions, but you heard what Keith had to say about the broad range of large transactions that were seven-digit and eight-digit deals as well. And, I'll just get back to my first comment, it was across all sectors of the business in product, in geography, and in enterprise and SMB. And, Keith, will you just address Kash's question specifically, in terms of what we're seeing and how we're able to create such large transactions? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Marc. So look, first of all, I would say that this has absolutely been an outstanding set of execution across the board, in all market segments. The broader market and the enterprise space has obviously been a focus and emphasis area for us over the past few years. If I were to characterize these two transactions in particular, I would tell you that they are CEO-level sales. We are in the boardroom. And we find ourselves in a position where customers, as Marc had indicated earlier, are looking for our help bring them into the age of the customer. They're looking to embrace the concept and notion of digital transformation. They view us as the market leader, and really the only company that is uniquely positioned to provide them with that transformation, or that level of transformation. And this is what's happening in these very large deals, it's happening in every deal, where these customers are viewing us as a trusted advisor. And that is becoming the norm. And this is something that has been happening for some period of time, and we continue to see it as we move forward. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're very excited about what's happening here in terms of the market dynamics. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. I was wondering, Marc Benioff, if you could talk to us a little bit about your vision for Analytics, I know the product is relatively new. I guess I'm just wondering, out of Dreamforce, if you could give us an update on the types of customer conversations you're having in regards to Analytics? And if you were to look out kind of three years to five years, how do you think about \u2013 there's obviously multiple different vendors right now that can do Analytics on top of the salesforce platform. How do you think of your own offering kind of replacing those people that are piggybacking on top of CRM deployments today? Thank you. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Heather, I think it's a great question and really a huge focus here at salesforce. Of course, Analytics applications have been an incredible part of the CRM market for a long time, and there are many vendors who offer Analytics applications on our platform. When we first introduced our Wave capability, which was just a little over a year ago, we didn't introduce applications. We introduced a platform. We introduced the ability to build Analytics applications using our Wave platform. And we said that this strategy was going be quite differentiated from others, because we were going to be platform first, we were going to build an ecosystem, and then we would later build these applications and then we would later build all of these capabilities from the platform into all of our products and into all of our ISV capabilities as well. And that's where we are today. I think that there isn't a customer or demonstration or new sale that's happening, where this Analytics capability is not a huge part of what we offer the customer. This is analytics-as-a-service. This is scalability, this runs on your phone, on your tablet. This runs on your desktop. This runs on your watch. This is a multi-tenant, fully scalable system. It has all the characteristics of every other salesforce product that you know and love. It's deeply integrated into our core platform, which is Lightning. And Wave is amazing. The growth is terrific. We're going to \u2013 I believe start to see incredible breakout this fiscal year that we're starting now. And we're just finishing our fiscal year kickoff the last two days here in San Francisco. And Wave was a huge part of the emphasis of what we're going to do this year. So, you're going to see a lot of that product. We're very excited about its capabilities. It's an incredible platform. And I will tell \u2013 yes, I'll tip my hand here that we have been demonstrating, internally here, a number of core Wave applications, including our new sales wave capability, which is our sales applications, built on Wave, Service Wave, service capabilities; Marketing Wave, marketing capabilities. And even Mark Hawkins here has built a full set of applications that help him run his entire financial business. So, it's an exciting new product. And we couldn't be more excited to be in the Analytics business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. I have a couple quick ones. First, these nine-figure deals, how many years are these contracts over? And then secondly, with you becoming a strategic vendor, is your relationship with the IT department within these companies change? Thanks. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Okay. So hi. This is Keith. So, obviously, we don't get into the term and length of these contracts, but you can imagine that if you're going to make a significant investment of nine-figures, that's probably a long-term relationship that you're talking about. And that again has been a focus area, I mentioned earlier, these are CEO-level conversations. We're in the boardroom, presenting to their boards and we're talking about transformation, which I think is something that is top of mind for all of these customers. As far as IT is concerned, you always have to talk about, and with IT, but these are transformational sales. These are conversations around growth, which is the top of mind for all Senior Executives and CEOs for sure; but, listen, in these large enterprises, the CIO is important. And by the way, we are a great platform. And CIOs and technologies are always interested in great platforms. And, again, that message certainly resonates. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I'll tell you that there's definitely a transformation going on at salesforce and Keith and I've had a lot of conversations about this. We've talked about it on previous calls. I would say this transformation has accelerated. And, then Keith, how many sales calls, you were at Oracle for how long? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : 26 years. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : 26 years. I was at Oracle, 13 years. I never made a sales call on a CEO, while I was at Oracle. I mean, there were some business development things, but never CEO buying products and being that kind of Chief Digital Officer himself or herself. Was that your experience as well? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, absolutely, the world just turned. And certainly as we talked about earlier, CEOs are all about transformation. And in many ways they had become the Chief Transformation Officers for these companies, so they are personally involved. They are personally engaged and they want to talk to us. And they're very interested again in us playing the role of the trusted advisor, they're interested in our thought leadership, as you know. And listen, in the last three weeks, I've had more conversations with CEOs around transformation than in my entire career over 30-plus years. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and I look at the large transactions we did with the largest banks in the world, largest insurance companies in the world, largest media companies in the world, the largest technology companies in the world, which was marked throughout this whole quarter, every single transaction was done with the Chief Executive Officer. And those happened at the World Economic Forum, those happened in their offices, those happened in our offices, those happened at trade shows, but I'll tell you that Keith and I just can probably rattle off dozens of CEOs that we are having to constantly interact with and collaborate with in creating these transactions. And I think it's really unusual and I think that's why we are really selling more enterprise software than Oracle or SAP in the applications area, wouldn't you say, Keith at this point? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : There's no question that we are outpacing the competition in terms of enterprise application sales; there is no question. We continue to take share, and that's both market share and mind share. You and I were having a conversation just the other day about one of the world's largest financial services institution and kind of in the old world, what level we would be able to call on. And in this new world, because we were with them at the World Economic Forum, we're talking to the CEO. And their CIO and Head of Operations, that person would never have met with us before and all of a sudden they're with us all the time. In fact, we have a quote from our kickoff \u2013 we just finished our kickoff from the CEO, this particular institution saying that they view salesforce as one of their most critical strategic partners. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And, Keith, wouldn't you say that that's really about our company being able to transform our role to becoming a trusted advisor especially in regards to these customer relationships with these companies? Isn't that's what's going on? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Absolutely. And we're bringing a point of view around the industry. And one of the things, as you know that we focused on is these specific industry messages and the points of view and that resonates. When you're talking to the CEO, of course, I'm sitting next to one right now, Mr. Marc Benioff, and he wants to know the point of view in a particular industry. And those messages are absolutely resonating. And they want to make quick decisions, they want to solve business problems and they want to transform. And this is all about transformation. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Keith, there seems like there's another level of it, which a lot of them really grill us on own business, because they're moving to subscription-based services themselves, they want to be a cloud company. They want to have Internet of Things capabilities, they want to be more connected to their customers, they want to understand how we're achieving this growth, because many of these companies want to achieve these same growth levels. How does it impact conversations? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Well, it's interesting, you brought it up. There are two types of conversations that we typically find ourselves involved with. And again, this is at the C-level. And in the boardroom, number one is, you can always ask these companies, why aren't you thinking about yourself as a cloud company? Why aren't you thinking about changing your business model? And you can see the expression on their faces, because they're embracing that notion of transformation. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : So, that is certainly one. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Nobody wants to be Uber-ized out of the world. That's on the mind of every person out there who is a CEO. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Absolutely. If you think about what's going on with the marketplace about this perfect storm of convergence of cloud and mobile and social and data science and IoT, all coming together, that creates incredible opportunities. It's a different world. And no CEO wants to be Uber-ized just like 15 years, 20 years ago, nobody wanted to be Amazon, if you were in the retail space. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. And that's all about customer experience. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Absolutely, which is where we're at. Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Anyway, next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne - Evercore: Thanks very much. Just two really quick ones and congratulations on a great fiscal year and fourth quarter. Keith, just to put a fine point on your last comment, there's a lot of discussions about IT budgets right now, what's going on with financial services. Is it fair to say, when we're thinking about salesforce, we should be thinking that you guys tap into budgets well beyond just the IT budget? That's our first question. And then second question would be, Europe is accelerating nicely right now. Can you just talk a little bit about whether or not that's sustainable? Thanks a lot. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : I'm sorry, but for some reason there was a garbled communication, so I'm going to have to ask you to repeat the second part of that one, okay? John Cummings - Vice President- Investor Relations : Can you repeat the question again? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : We'll come back to that. Okay. Go ahead, Brent. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Marc. The App Cloud is your fastest growing cloud and it's showing really nice acceleration. Can you just give a sense of what you're seeing in some of these deals with the App Cloud? And I guess just a follow-on with Keith to the prior question, the fear of the macro has been weighing on a lot of investors, some of the comments from others, your tech brethren, and can you just give a signal \u2013 it doesn't sound like you've seen any type of slowdown, based on the result, but just give us a sense at kind of what you're seeing among some of the customer conversations as you look out the next couple quarters? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. I think number one is customers are looking to build applications faster than ever before. And customers want to build applications once and deploy them on every modern platform, which includes a watch, a phone, a tablet, a PC, and many different types of tablets and many different types of PCs, many different types of phones. And we have delivered the most modern, most incredible application development and deployment platform, I believe, in the enterprise today, which is Lightning. And you heard Accenture talked about on our February 2 launch, how it's accelerating their own ability to build applications not only internally but for their customers using our Lightning platform, because there's nothing else like it. Companies in the software industry have kind of doubled down and gone back and focused on building apps and kind of getting their apps to be kind of sexier and looking better on all these new devices. And that's a huge mistake. Because what these software companies should be focused on is building platforms that can deliver these apps. And that's what salesforce has done. We've delivered this incredible Lightning platform. I mean it is amazing. What it can do? I mean you even saw in the February 2 launch, we delivered our Lightning platform running on Microsoft Continuum before Microsoft has been able to deliver their own applications running on Microsoft Continuum, because of the kind of flexibility and the capabilities of Lightning. And also I would point out that's our strategy as to my comment with Heather on Wave that is, we have this incredible platform with Wave to build these Analytics apps. And I think you know that we have the most \u2013 the number one platform on Amazon Web Services for building applications there, called Heroku. And between Heroku, between Wave, between Lightning and other capabilities that we have, this really gives developers a fast, easy and very low cost way to build and deploy enterprise apps. And I would probably give you this great example of this company called SteelBrick, who came with a lot of momentum out of our Dreamforce Conference with this incredible application that they had built using Lightning and they ended up in my office in November and it was awesome. And I'm, like, how did you build this? And they were like, well this, we just built all this on Lightning. I mean, I saw this app was running. It's my dream that this incredible app running on the watch and the phone and the tablet and everything and making sales people more productive and more successful and customer service professionals more successful and more productive. And I said how did you build that? Lightning, Lightning, Lightning. And I'm, like, wow. And of course, I liked it so much I bought the company. And I think that \u2013 and I hope that I get to buy more Lightning companies, because within 30 days, I've already fully integrated that into my product, launched a new product, Sales Cloud Lightning, which includes the SteelBrick CPQ capability. And in addition to that, I've got a fully expanded and extended capabilities across my whole product line. So, I hope there's more Lightning ISVs that are teeing up, to come into our family, because, I mean, this is like auto integration once they get on to our Lightning platform, and then our ability to distribute that through this multi-thousand person distribution organization, with all this momentum is really an awesome thing. So, it is all about the platform. It's a key differentiator for us. Of course, we've got a great company. That's a key differentiator for us. Of course, we have our ecosystem; that's a key differentiator for us. And it's also about this robust platform, that's a key differentiator for us. And that's how we're winning all these deals. I think you're kind of figured out our secret sauce. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne - Evercore: Thanks very much. I'll try this again. Just my question earlier was \u2013 is for Keith. Obviously, the European business is accelerating nicely over the last year. You guys put a lot of investments into that region. I was wondering if you could just talk about the momentum in that area, and the ability for that to continue into fiscal 2017? And then just a really quick follow-up to your earlier point around transformational deals. There's going to be a lot of discussion about IT budgets fluctuating in this kind of macro environment. When it comes to CRM, I think we should be thinking that you guys tap into budgets well beyond just IT now. Is that a fair comment? I think you were alluding to it earlier, but I just want to sort of clarify that as well. Thanks a lot. Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Yep. Let me talk to both. So, this time we can hear you loud and clear. So thanks for the question. So first of all, just on EMEA, I mean, one of our growth strategies has been international expansion, and that has certainly proven out in terms of the numbers. And that takes many forms. It's customer-facing, it's support resources, it's our data centers, it's all those sort of things that have really expanded our footprint internationally. And certainly in EMEA, that has paid out very, very well for us. Let me just give you an example. Two customers with incredible unsolicited CEO-level remarks at the World Economic Forum. We have entered into a relationship that we talked about on this call before with ABB. And at the World Economic Forum, often there are many sessions where the CEOs of these companies will host a transformational meeting that talks a little bit with other CEOs about what they're doing, what they see in the industry; and certainly, ABB was doing that. And at the end of the meeting, the CEO of ABB stood up, unsolicited, and said, listen, I am completely transforming the way that I sell and service to my customers and engage with them, because I have chosen salesforce as my trusted partner. And that, of course, is a very significant company in Europe. Schneider Electric is another \u2013 the CEO of Schneider Electric was on a panel with Marc talking about digital transformation. Unsolicited comment about Schneider Electric is transforming its service model because of the capabilities of salesforce. So, we have some of the most incredible, global companies in the world, who happen to be headquartered in EMEA, who are actually evangelizing our message in the marketplace around transformation and connecting to customers in entirely new ways. So, when you see market leaders coming out there and at the CEO-level and evangelizing our story, that certainly sends a great message to other companies, whether they're in that industry or not. So again, those are two proof points on EMEA. On the line of business question in terms of budget, look, IT organizations always have budgets. They typically range between 1% and 2% of the company revenues. But what we've been able to tap into beyond those budgets are the line of business executive's budgets and also, as we've discussed on this call, the CEO agenda. It's an amazing phenomenon when you see the CEO, who has the growth priority realign the budgets in a corporation to take on these growth initiatives, and that's what we're seeing. So, it goes well beyond IT. Certainly IT budgets are a particular component, but when the priority of a company is all about growth, you find the money to make that happen. You find the money to make those investments, and that's what we're seeing in the marketplace. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. A question for Mark Hawkins. Your guidance for the year in terms of operating margins is towards the lower end of your range of I think 100 basis points to 300 basis points of margin expansion, with your revenue growth at the lower end of that as well, can you talk about sort of how you are thinking about that prior framework for margins? And is there anything going on this year that we should think about impacting how you are adhering to that grid? Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Walter. First, thanks for the question and I'm happy to address that question. We're really pleased, coming off of a great year and a great finish where we beat our operating margin guidance. We delivered 177 basis points this last year. And on top of that, to then, consistent with our revenue margin framework, go ahead and do that 125 basis points to 150 basis points for FY 2017. We feel that's really appropriate in light of our framework, it's very consistent with it. We think it's appropriate and good guide and it also allows us to propel this growth to really help our customers solve the needs that they have and invest in the future to perpetuate this performance over the long-term. So that's what I would say, Walter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Thank you. I'll add my congratulations on the strong finish. Question for Marc Benioff, so we are hearing more discussion of transformational types of projects, where salesforce is displacing many legacy systems and is being used wall-to-wall. And so, there's also a view that the company has evolved from being a single engine to a three or four engine aircraft. So, I'm curious, when you look at the larger transactions, how commonly is a large deal just for a single cloud, because I think in the prior cycle \u2013 in the past, some of them were. Versus, how commonly is it viewed as really a single customer success platform and, just from the beginning, it's going to be spanning Sales, Service, Marketing platform and everything else? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that's a great question. And I'll tell you I believe that that's a huge growth driver for us going forward, because still, only, I think the number is, 72% of customers still use us for only one cloud. So, that is 72% of customers still only use either the Sales Cloud or the Service Cloud or the Marketing Cloud or the Platform or Analytics, or whatever. And the opportunity is to do exactly what you said, which is, to deliver a customer success platform. And we do want to go wall-to-wall with these companies, they do see that opportunity more and more. With some premium customers, we have had that opportunity. And I believe that is a huge opportunity for this company as it continues to grow and expand, that we have a rich portfolio of products to offer these customers. Even though the vast majority of the customers have only chosen one of those products, so far. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Question for Mark Hawkins. Mark, I wouldn't mind going back to the Q1 DR guide, which I think implies billings growth in the mid-teens level. And your seasonality question. You definitely told us before that deal activity especially renewals are skewing to 4Q, which obviously makes the sequential DR and billings growth comparison tough in 1Q. I'm just curious is this expected to be a greater than normal impact in this Q1? And are there any other issues worth flagging that are impacting Q1 DR? Thank you. Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Absolutely, Karl. Thank you for the question. I think you're hitting it right on, which is when you described it exactly right the compounding effect that we described at Dreamforce is a reality. More and more of our DR is showing up in Q4. It impacts all of the sequential growth rates more and more as we showed in that amplified set of data that we referenced. But to kind of build on your point, there is one other thing that we're trying to make sure that everyone sees and to call out. Also I appreciate your question there, and that's regarding leap year. And it seems like a simple enough point, but when you take a look at our revenue and you divide it up by day, when there's one extra day that has the effect of having $20 million of extra revenue recognition in Q1, even though it all washes out in the year, right? But, when you have one extra day of revenue, it means you have one less day of deferred revenue, effectively. And so, that's the other thing you take a look at. So, if you take a look at the compounding effect and you adjust for the leap year, which washes all out in a year, but not in the quarter. I think you'll see just a kind of an appropriate pattern there for a guide. Okay? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel. Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Let me direct this question to Marc Benioff and to Keith as well. You both talked about the role of systems integrators both as partners and customers during the quarter. I'd love to hear the role that those SIs are playing in bigger enterprise deals? And I'd be even more interested to hear to the extent that you do have some systems integrators, partners that are consuming a lot of salesforce.com. How are they doing so internally and how that's shaping their practice? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think there hasn't been a conversation this quarter that has not evolved around the incredible success that we've had with Accenture. We're not only Accenture's fastest growing business unit, but also they've now deployed already 25,000 users of salesforce inside Accenture. You've heard their CIO and their CEO come to our launch on February 2 and give personal testimonial to the success that they've had, that their only regret is they didn't go faster with salesforce, that they're transforming their customer relationships at unheard of rates and this is having a broad ripple effect through the SI community, where I think that honestly they're all asking themselves why are they not all using salesforce, building apps on salesforce and selling salesforce and having the same great success that Accenture has had. Some of these SIs are kind of prima donnas, who have held on to the path too long and has affected their growth rates and their ability to work with customers, and in some cases, dislodged them from strategic customer situations because they were not able to move fast enough to understand these customers' needs and got displaced by Accenture, and we're seeing that as in mass. And for sure, it's a shot across the bow of the SI community that they better go faster or there's going be a broad shakeup in regard to the transformations that are happening underway in regards to these next generation implementations specifically those regarding salesforce and our product line. Keith? Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, great question. So first and foremost, I think we all recognize that these SIs, many of them, certainly the upper tier of the SIs are very strategic influencers in the boardroom and at the CEO-level and speaking transformation for these lines of business executives. Part of our strategy has been to really strengthen these relationships over time, because we know that they bring expertise and access. And they can also drive most importantly the customer success. The observation I would give you is that the most successful SIs are the ones who are very focused on salesforce and the ones who actually run their business on salesforce. Marc has just given that example. And we are establishing what I would call a 360-degree relationship with these SIs. So, we go to market with these SIs. They run their business on salesforce. And in the case of Accenture, they're actually building product, they become an ISV and those are the strategic sort of relationships that we're trying to build here. And we've been very, very successful and the ones who get it are growing. I had a conversation last week with a CEO of a pretty major consulting organization, who was lamenting about their lack of growth, generally speaking. And my comment to this person was quite candidly, you're not focused enough on salesforce, because if you were focused on salesforce your business would be growing. And I got this look of acknowledgment and it's absolutely true. The success stories in these consulting practices is about their salesforce practice. So, they've been a big part of our growth strategy. They're starting to \u2013 virtually all the large ones are running their business on salesforce. They've made their commitments and they're a big part of our future and our ecosystem strategy. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens. Alex Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Marc, there's been some investor and customer dialog lately touching on the theme that salesforce is becoming a little bit more like Oracle. As you continue your drive to be the largest software company in the world, how does salesforce aspire to be different from them and others going forward, while balancing your various constituencies? Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that's a great question, and something that we think about every day at salesforce and something that we talk about every day at salesforce, which is what kind of a company is this? And what is our culture? Who are we? And what is it that we do? And we've talked a lot about that on the call already that is, we have a radically different technology model than the technology model that has been in place at Oracle or SAP or even Microsoft. We have a \u2013 which is our multi-tenancy system built on our metadata model. We have a radically different customer model, which is a model built on customer success. And we have a radically different philanthropic model that we talked about, which is our focus on 1% of our equity, our profit, and our employees' time go into our salesforce.org. So, we've, of course, done about 1.3 million hours of community service. I believe we'll do even more community service this year than Microsoft, which is a company 10 times our size, because we're just very committed to volunteerism. We run over 25,000 non-profits and NGOs for free, which have been a gift of over $250 million in services to the non-profit community. And we've given away over $100 million in grants as well. I think also we're out there fighting for equality where we can. You saw that with our focus on equal pay for women. We were just at the White House speaking about that, adjustments that we've made to our own financials, so that we can pay women the same that we pay men here at salesforce. You saw us fight in Indiana against discrimination of our employees and we're looking squarely at what's going on in Georgia with House Bill 757, which means that we may have to reduce our investments in the State of Georgia based on what we're seeing with the state government there as well. And I hope that they see the light the way that the State of Indiana did. And in addition, I think that you see salesforce trying to create a culture in an environment, where we reflect what we think the future of the world is, a world where there needs to be more equality, a world where there needs to be more focus on sustainability and where there needs to be a world focused on companies that are becoming platforms for change. And that the business is improving the state of the world. Those are the things that are really important to us. I think also you probably noticed that we opened up this call saying thank you. It's really important to us that we have a sense of gratitude, when we address our employees and our customers and our partners. That's a huge part of our culture. And at the end of the day, it's deeply a part of customer success as well that is because of our business model we're only successful if our customers are successful. So, these are the things that I think that are actually somewhat different than when we were at Oracle, the narrative there and the actions, the behavior was rewarded differently, the things that we were encouraged to do and compensated for and what we told our employees to do and what we were directing to do is different than what we do at salesforce. And I hope that we can be an example of a benevolent company that does well and does good. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back to John Cummings for closing remarks. John Cummings - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks so much, Ashley. And I'd like to thank everyone again for joining us on the call today. You can catch up with us next week.

I would now like to turn the call over to John Cummings, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Victoria, and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal first quarter 2017 results conference call. Our first quarter results press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. And with me today on the call is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President, and COO; and Mark Hawkins, CFO. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Also some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-Q and 10-K. With that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks, John. And really excited to be here, really excited for the first quarter and we\u2019ve got some great people here for the call, we\u2019ve got Keith Block here, our new Chief Operating Officer really excited to have Keith here, we have Mark Hawkins here, our Chief Financial Officer and you\u2019ve all seen the press release, we\u2019ve just had an awesome Q1. It\u2019s the best Q1, we\u2019ve ever seen. There is some incredible numbers you\u2019re going to see including the cash flow number. Revenue for the first quarter as you saw grew nearly to $2 billion that was up 28% in constant currency that was just above our expectations. Deferred revenue also grew more than $4 billion up 32% in constant currency that was also above our expectations to see deferred revenue grow with a three in front of it at this size and scale. Dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet at $11.6 billion, up 28% from a year ago. We improved our non-GAAP operating margin which Mark is going to talk about and it drove $1 billion in operating cash flow as I mentioned but that\u2019s 43% from a year ago, pretty great. I\u2019m also thrilled to announce we\u2019re raising full-year revenue guidance $80 million raising the guidance we feel really excited about that, $8.2 billion is the high-end of our range and our current outlook puts us on its square path, look we are going to see now that we\u2019re going to realize very shortly our $10 billion dream. We\u2019re well positioned for another great year. This is amazing I think that one of the reasons that we are doing so well is because Oracle and SAP are doing so poorly in the cloud, they just have not been able to make that transformation that we\u2019ve made, that other companies have made, and we just continue to take market share from them and gain customers at a record levels and you can see that their growth numbers are nothing like we\u2019re putting up here as we deliver our first quarter and it\u2019s happened because Salesforce is really the only company totally focused on companies helping to connect with their customers in a whole new way. We\u2019re in the midst of a massive generational shift; a new generation of customers and consumers is clearly emerging. We have been calling them here at Salesforce C generation customers. Customer generation, consumer generation that these are people who want it now, they want it fast, they want it easy, and they\u2019re mobile, they\u2019re social, they\u2019re always on, and our customers are working to connect with the C generation in new ways, very exciting. I mean this is really part of a huge shift that\u2019s happening in computing. We\u2019ve gone from the first generation of computing which was very much about systems of record to the second generation which was systems of engagement we talked about that on these calls many times over the last 10 years. And we are clearly moving into this incredible world that the system of intelligence that\u2019s all yielding these incredible systems of customers or C generation customers that are -- that our customers are connecting to. And that\u2019s we\u2019re so excited about. I know you all hear more about those shifts that are going on. Well I\u2019m encourage you to come to our World Tour Event in London tomorrow we\u2019ll have 15,000 people in person bigger than most companies user conferences for us it\u2019s just another visit to a great city in the world. And then next week we are going to be in New York for World Tour New York which is already sold out. So we\u2019ll be excited to see you there. And in San Francisco on June 7 and 8, we\u2019re going to be hosting Trailhead DX which is our brand new developer conference. It also I believe is already sold out, but it\u2019s going to be an amazing event we are going to have plenty of opportunities to watch it online. Hard to find venues around the world to host these large events, Trailhead DX you\u2019re going to see the next generation of software\u2019s, Salesforce\u2019s software development capability including our new lightening systems, component based development as well as the ability to build one-on-one journey\u2019s with customers and a huge focus, a huge focus at Trailhead DX on how to rapidly and easily build mobile applications. And really excited to visit with all the Salesforce customers and developers who are coming Trailhead DX. Okay. Well finally let me tell you, we\u2019ve got Dreamforce coming October 4 through 7 in the details. I know the bands that are playing. I know what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m going to give you too much of that yet I can just tell you it\u2019s going to be the biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever and its synergy also just a great year and Keith, you\u2019re a huge part of making it such a great year I think we\u2019re getting ready to celebrate your third anniversary at Salesforce is that right. Keith Block : That\u2019s right; it\u2019s coming up, absolutely. Marc Benioff : When is that going to be so I can have the cupcakes ready? Keith Block : That will be June 2, Marc. Marc Benioff : June 2, all right, well we\u2019re going to get those cupcakes ready, but Keith before we do let me just congratulate you on a great quarter. Congratulate on your promotion, your excellent leadership in the company, and why don\u2019t you to tell us, what happened with customers this quarter. Keith Block : All right. Thanks Marc, and thanks everyone for joining us on this call. I think as you heard from Marc we had an extremely fast start to the year and that is terrific on to itself but it is on the heels of a fantastic Q4. So we saw great execution across the board. We fine tuned our go-to-market approach. We\u2019ve aligned our operations to bring our resources closely to our customers because at the end of the day it is all about driving success for those customers. And all these investments that we\u2019ve made over the last three years, innovation in our industries, building out our partner ecosystem, expanding internationally, all this is really paying off in our results. So we began fiscal 2017 with a record number of large transactions more than any other first quarter in our history as a company. The value of these large transactions across our clouds continue to increase. We have built on our tremendous momentum from Q4 and in fact we closed yet again another nine figure transaction in the first quarter. So we\u2019re very, very proud of that. All this is proof positive the scale and depth of relationships that we\u2019re building and continue to build with our customers worldwide everywhere, all shapes and sizes, geographies, industries. An example, in Q1 we signed a significant and strategic agreement with Amazon. We are now their company-wide customer platform and this is a huge expansion of our relationship with them and we plan to use more Amazon services in the future. Uber one of the world\u2019s great innovative companies, another expansion in the quarter, they\u2019re an incredible innovator with off-the-chart growth. They selected Salesforce to be their global customer success platform, so they can build one-to-one journeys at scale for millions of Uber riders worldwide. This is one of the most innovative companies as I said and they are driving their innovation by leveraging our customer success platform. Samsung another great brand decided to standardize their B2B business on Salesforce in Q1, so they can engage with their customers anytime from any place and run their businesses right from their Galaxy phones. Another great brand is New York Life. They have selected Salesforce to power the digital transformation and they are planning to mobilize their field agents with Salesforce and enhance the service they deliver to their customers. In Europe, one of the world\u2019s leaders and pioneers in robotics decided to go wall-to-wall with Salesforce to advance the digital transformation of their business. Now Marc alluded to this, but this is a strategic partnership where we completely replaced SAP with every cloud in our portfolio to drive at their customer success with our product suite. So not only are we their customer success platform but Salesforce will be their IoT platform connecting all their robotic devices to open up new services and apps and create new experiences to their customers. There are many, many more examples and in every one of these each companies are turning to Salesforce as their trusted advisors for redefining their customer strategy and take their businesses into the future and we are delivering this level of customer success at scale and across the entire portfolio. I want to thank our customers for their continued trust, their commitment, and always their inspiration, and our partner ecosystem which is second to none for their ongoing investment in our customer success, and last but not least, I want to thank everybody at Salesforce for again another outstanding performance in the quarter. So I would like to hand this over to Mark to talk a little bit more about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark? Mark Hawkins : Great, thanks Keith. As you\u2019ve heard, we had a great start to the fiscal year with very strong results across the board. Our total revenue was up 28% in constant currency when excluding year-over-year FX headwind of 29%. Sequentially, we saw $4 million FX headwind. Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with 15% year-over-year growth. Service Cloud grew 32%. Marketing Cloud grew 29%. Apps Cloud and other grew 45%. In the region, EMEA grew 33% and APAC continued to accelerate a 29% growth, both on a constant currency basis year-over-year. Dollar attrition for the first quarter remained below 9%. While we continue to deliver this outstanding top-line performance, we also continued to improve our bottom-line as well. In the quarter, we delivered 283 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement, our eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. This help drive record operating cash flow this quarter as we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow, up 43% over last year. I\u2019m very pleased with these outstanding results, our first $1 billion of cash flow quarter, very exciting. These outstanding results reflect continued compounding of our invoicing in Q4 and to a lesser extent the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 which benefited operating cash flow by approximately $25 million in Q1. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $4 billion. This was up 32% in constant currency when excluding our year-over-year FX headwind of $10 million. Sequentially deferred revenue had an FX tailwind of $51 million. We also continued to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter with 79% of all subscription and support related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth by approximately one percentage point. Moving on to guidance. With our strong start in Q1, we are raising our FY 2017 revenue guidance to $8.16 billion to $8.2 billion. We\u2019re also raising our FY 2017 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1 to $1.02. We now expect year-over-year operating cash flow growth of 25% to 26%. For Q2, we\u2019re expecting revenues of $2.005 billion to $2.015 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25, and our year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 26% to 28%. To close, we had an outstanding quarter and we\u2019re off to a great start for FY 2017. I\u2019d like to thank the entire Salesforce team for these great results. With that I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Marc, your largest Revenue Cloud to Sales Cloud accelerated the best growth in over five quarters. Can you just highlight what\u2019s driving that outperformance and you did have a small price increase there has been questions among investors is that price hike having any impact in the short-term? Marc Benioff : Yes, I think that we have really been focused on how do we accelerate the Sales Cloud. I mean it\u2019s a huge number of revenue numbers incredible and the growth rate is also incredible. And the areas where the Sales Cloud is really accelerated are, number one we\u2019ve done a huge amount of innovation with the Sales Cloud starting with Lightning probably you know we\u2019ve completely rebuilt our core platform of Salesforce which we now call Lightning and we have rebuilt how the Sales Cloud is manifested to our customers especially in regards to mobile technologies, you can see that, if you go on the app store and download our Salesforce1 app which is now millions of users, millions are using that to access Salesforce. Two, we\u2019ve also created some amazing new capabilities for us the Sales Cloud probably the most popular is our Pardot capability which is a part of a Sales Cloud very exciting accelerator for us as well as SteelBrick. And these things and others really have led us to kind of what I\u2019d say the most reboot the Sales Cloud, recreate the Sales Cloud, reenergize it, and this kind of accelerated revenue growth for to something that we\u2019re very, very excited about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Bhavan Suri : Hey, guys thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick ones for me. First when we look at the Force platform again it posted really, really healthy growth, the fastest growth again over five quarters. And if I also look at that growth just some color on the mix of how much is coming from sort of existing ISCs and customers expanding on the platform or net new customers that are choosing force.com for speed for whatever versus any other platform. Just some sense of how that\u2019s playing out. And then you touched a little bit on the IoT cloud, just a little more color in terms of adoption obviously that\u2019s a huge market but just how you\u2019re thinking about the growth trajectory for that business. Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, I think that when you look at our platform and you want to understand its growth you just have to look at the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant for mobile application development and deployment. I mean we\u2019re ranked as the leader and in so many other of course analysis by these independent analyst agencies they have marked our platform as the leader and I\u2019ll tell you why that is because there is a full segment of the developer population that we are speaking to who want to rapidly build and deploy applications especially, and I said this in the previous answer, in the mobile environment. And only Salesforce -- only Salesforce has let you rapidly build and expand and create these applications using Lightning and deploy them on all these different devices. And for those of you who have tried it or seeing the traffic around it on social networks like the Twitter and others know we have hit a huge home run in regards to Lightning; we have our customers\u2019 imagination. For those of you who attended the February 2 event with -- at the St. Regis, you heard Accenture, who is deploying this technology not just for its customers but internally to tens of thousands of users almost 100,000 users and how they have accelerated their application development capability internally by turning to Lightning. And so that is what is driving the power, we\u2019ve rebooted our core platforms and you\u2019re seeing that reflected in our Sales Cloud, in our Service Cloud, in our platform, in our community, in our core applications that are running currently on that Lightning platform, that\u2019s been a huge growth driver and I believe that because Lightning is so unique and so special in the industry that it lets our customers build these applications quickly at a very low cost and deploy them across so many different platforms that we\u2019re going to see a continued growth in core clouds. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. One question for Benioff, and one for Hawkins. One for you, Mark Benioff. The platform business, again, it feels like even the Sales Cloud at this size, at when it was, it was roughly the size of the platform business, did not grow this fast. So are we finally at the point where we're getting that inflection? This is poised to be firmly a business potentially larger, could be longer -- could it be the largest cloud? And if so, how does it help your vertical strategy? One for you, Mr. Hawkins. You signed three deals in the nine-figure range. When will you start to bill and when will it start to actually show up in deferred revenues? Because I suspect given how large these deals are you're not yet invoicing these customers. Thank you very much. Marc Benioff : Well in regards to the Sales Cloud, number one you know already this is one of the largest software product by revenue in the industry period. Not just CRM, not just Salesforce automation where it\u2019s number one but in the industry and to see this acceleration, this is something that we have been working on. And I said and I believe this is true for innovation, reasons of innovation, and it\u2019s also reasons of specialization as you know Keith Block has been working on this vertical strategy. And Keith, do you want to speak to that and also kind of some of the exciting things that have happened with the vertical strategy in the Sales Cloud and how you\u2019ve been able to address some of these new markets which is part of this acceleration. Keith? Keith Block : Yes, so a couple of things, first of all the acceleration in Sales Cloud this is what is Marc said, this is one of the most successful products in the history of technology. And one of the great things about this company is it continues to innovate and this has been a refocus point for us to continue to innovate and accelerate innovation around Sales Cloud and you see that in the results and we\u2019ve leveraged that great innovation and that base to drive vertical specialization. As you know we announced and made for GA available the Financial Services Cloud and the Health Cloud in Q1 and we had several customers sign up in the quarter. So we\u2019re starting to get a lot of momentum. So we\u2019ve been talking about it for a while part of our industry strategy has been around messaging and then releasing these first vertical products focus on financial services industry and healthcare industry and life sciences industry. And again you do that with amazing technology with Force you do it with amazing technology leveraging the underlying cloud and you add industry specialization to it and that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting to see these results and this reacceleration. Mark Hawkins : So let me jump in also catch with the second question around three nine-figure deals which obviously we\u2019re very pleased with all the reasons that Keith and Marc talked about and you\u2019re absolutely right in the sense that these big deals are multiyear deals and so what happens is the first year gets billed and that will show up in our deferred revenue and then ratably recognize over time. But the multiyear aspect to that does not show up in our DR, it shows up in our unbilled DR. And what\u2019s amazing about that is when you put our billed and unbilled book of business together, we have $11.6 billion now growing at 27% year-on-year. So you\u2019re picking up some of that that really, really good business that\u2019s going to show up it hasn\u2019t been billed yet but it will over time. Great question, Kash. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Hi, great. I had a question for Marc Benioff and then a question for Keith. I guess Marc; you've had this $10 billion goal for quite some time. It now is looks like you'll trip over it very soon and obviously a great accomplishment. As you look ahead and rally the company into the future, can you share with us what's the next big rallying point or what's the next big goal you have for the company? And then the follow-up for Keith would be how do you size the potential for these nine-figure deals as you look into your customer base? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well you\u2019re right, Heather, and I know that you have created and keep a comprehensive financial model on Salesforce and have for a number of years as well as many of the financial analyst on the call. And I\u2019m sure that all of you can figure out exactly or approximately based on our deferred revenue numbers and adjusting our models around when you think we\u2019re going to have $10 billion. That is an exciting moment, it\u2019s an exciting moment because for the software industry and specifically in enterprise applications there is really only been two other companies that have really hit back kind of a number. So I would say that we are already looking forward to lasting rate through that and getting to the next level and I\u2019m excited that Salesforce doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down as we kind of get to these levels. We\u2019re moving rapidly into a world that when we talk about of course many transformations in our industry which is a world as a cloud of course that drove the Salesforce\u2019s growth for many years, a world of social that drove the Salesforce\u2019s growth for many years, and also mobility and that\u2019s also currently driving Salesforce\u2019s growth. When I look at kind of the next major trend for Salesforce and our industry that will drive tremendous growth is got to be artificial intelligence. And as we look out into the future and we start to look at extreme improvement and advances in artificial intelligence whether it\u2019s machine learning, whether it\u2019s deep learning, whether it\u2019s machine intelligence itself, I think that those kind of capabilities appearing inside our applications that is going to be a major growth capability going forward. And one other areas that I think will advance that is that we can bring this type of new technology very much to everyone and that\u2019s going to be the power of Salesforce that\u2019s certainly what we are doing and with mobility today that\u2019s what we will do in AI as we shift Salesforce to be in an AI first company. You can see the beginning of this in one of our most exciting new products of the quarter and also part of the Sales Cloud growth for sure because it\u2019s in there is not just SalesforceIQ which you can get on the -- on the app store but also our new product Salesforce Inbox. And Salesforce Inbox is very exciting because it uses artificial intelligence and machine intelligence to work with our users, to work with our emails, to work with their calendars, and work with their CRM data to give them perspective ideas on exactly how do be more efficient in the sales, service, and marketing processes of their companies. And when you look at technologies like SalesforceIQ and like Salesforce Inbox, well and I\u2019m sure you know those came out of an incredible acquisition, we did approximately two years ago RelateIQ which was just a world class team that we\u2019re able to pick up that\u2019s based in Palo Alto. Well then you can see that this is another major growth factor because it will appear in sales, it will appear in service, it will appear in marketing when you saw it actually last week if you attended our Connections Conference, you saw our new predicted journeys capability and this kind of predicted capability that appeared in our marketing cloud that was driven out of our new SalesforceIQ services. You also see it of course in communities, you see it in our platforms, you\u2019re going to see it in mobility, you\u2019re going to see it in our analytics of course at the core. This is a very powerful next generation technology. So Heather, when I look forward, what I see is an AI first world and for every customer is going to be able to get whole another generation of productivity out of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Yes, so Heather, do you want to add to that? Keith Block : Yes, Heather, just to your second question well large deals is certainly an indication of how deep these relationships are becoming with these customers but they are not the only indication I mean certainly in Q4 we had two of the largest nine-figure deals that we had in the history of the company. In Q1, we signed up again another very strategic long-term relationship. Right our business is based on a balanced portfolio across all market segments whether it\u2019s SMB or midmarket or the enterprise space. And there is a lot of room there. So there is an expectation from our customers to play a more significant role across the board and certainly in the enterprise in fact Marc and I met with a couple of CEOs yesterday who were talking to us about how they bring their companies into kind of this age of the customer and drive digital transformation and that\u2019s becoming a regular dialogue but this is both a mind share and a market share gain and we strive for balance in our execution and a balance in our portfolio of business and customers. Again, it\u2019s not from top to bottom, SMB all the way up to enterprise. So we got great momentum, we expect that to continue and I think we\u2019ve got a terrific playbook with an incredible portfolio of products that satisfy our customers\u2019 needs. Operator : Your next question comes from the Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : Hi. Thank you, guys, so much for taking my question and congratulations on a really extraordinary quarter. I had a couple for you. I'm wondering where will you be expanding your usage of AWS beyond Heroku and the components of IoT that are built on that. And I was wondering what's really driving that decision. And then secondly, how do you think about the size of the Sales Cloud market given the number of clunky sort of custom-built in-house solutions that still exist out there? Where are we in terms of hitting that runway for you guys? And then I'll try to sneak in a third here. But if you could talk a little about wave analytics and what we're seeing there that would be fantastic as well. Keith Block : Well thanks for that question. Number one I\u2019d say we love Amazon, we\u2019ve got a great relationship with Amazon, they are a huge user of Salesforce and that certainly has been a huge part this quarter as well. We did a very significant and very large transaction with Amazon and Jeff Bezos, and I have a great meaning of the minds, the future of the cloud. I think that it\u2019s been a great relationship and partnership for us. We want to continue to grow that and expand that strategically. We are definitely exploring ways so we can use AWS more aggressively with Salesforce. Of course we know that we run one of the largest application development capabilities in the world on AWS which is Heroku. We also are building our new IoT cloud on AWS. We also introduced new capabilities for our marketing cloud last week on AWS. And we have a lot of research and development capabilities in AWS. When you look at Amazon today, there is no public cloud that is more sophisticated, more well used by enterprises ad one that has more robust capabilities than Amazon. They have done a spectacular job in defining this kind of infrastructure as a service market. They of course dominated. I think you know they are doing themselves more than $10 billion a year in it. And we\u2019re very happy to be so tightly aligned with Amazon and AWS. In regards to kind of future capabilities that you\u2019re going to see with other parts of Salesforce while as we head towards our Developer Conference and as you head towards Dreamforce, I think you continue to see more announcements between Salesforce and Amazon and you will see our partnership and strategic alliance with them continue to grow and develop. And Jeff and I have a lot of very exciting ideas on what the next steps are. Okay, Alexa, would you take the next question. Marc Benioff : Let me -- may be I could jump in here. One of the things that you touched on was the have a little fun here. The Wave, you had asked a little bit about that, sir, and we\u2019re seeing nice growth with The Wave, it\u2019s again we are very pleased with the way that\u2019s progressing. And by the way, the big deals that Keith had just called out in terms of AWS is using Wave, Live Nation is using Wave, we can get big customer after big customer using Wave. By the way I use Wave as we run a Fortune 500 company and I absolutely love it. So I love the growth rate, I love the large deal penetration with it, I love the momentum. Keep in mind its version one. But the thing I call out and may be Mark or Keith want to talk about this, but Bob Stutz, we are just super happy to have Bob here and he is thinking beyond Version 1 and that\u2019s just really exciting to me. And that\u2019s the Wave comment from my standpoint. I guess the last point was around you had asked around the sales cost market, market size and I don\u2019t know if there is any other additional thoughts there. Keith Block : I will just say it again; I mean this is one of the most exceptional products in the history of technology. And we, a product company as you all know when they come out with a great first product if you will, they leave it behind and they don\u2019t continue to innovate but this is a company that is keeping innovation as part of its DNA and we have reinvigorated this product set, and we are very pleased with the results and our customers are loving it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird & Company. Steve Ashley : Great. I would just like to drill down on the Sales Cloud question again. You saw the accelerated growth, 14.9%. But if we were to peel and kind of parse that out, look at it from enterprise, may be medium, small businesses, look at it at layers, if we peel back that enterprise layer where I'm sure large deals are really helping, are you seeing improved growth at some of the lower layers in the mid-market and smaller business market for the Sales Cloud? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Yes, we are and I\u2019ll tell you why that is I\u2019ve touched on it a number of times but I will circle back one more time because I think it is important. I think it\u2019s important because I think for a lot of companies to get to this level of a product they kind of put it on maintenance they abandon that. They look another way and they hope to kind of bring in the next horizon. They look to kind of Jeff Moore\u2019s more commentary on what is the next wave or whatever and they move to that next product. For us we\u2019re not, we have that of course we have multiple -- successful multibillion dollar product in the company everybody knows that. But we have not give it up on Sales Cloud because there is so much more that we can do and you saw that this quarter in that, we have rebuild this quarter with Lightning so that it works better on mobility. We have Salesforce1 which now has millions of users on it, I use it every day it\u2019s never been faster, easier it\u2019s level of acuity with Salesforce1 is phenomenal. We have SteelBrick, which our customers love this kind of CPQ kind of capability to be able to do court, quotes, and orders and all this incredible new stuff that SteelBrick does for us that\u2019s built natively on our Lightning platform. We have SalesforceIQ which is a artificial intelligence front end, machine learning front end to Sales Cloud which is incredible. We have Sales Cloud; we have a Salesforce Inbox which is an email front end of Sales Cloud that is incredible. And we have many, many other things coming, many that you will see Trailhead DX, many more you are going to see at Dreamforce, we have not abandoned Sales Cloud we have doubled, we have tripled down on Sales Cloud, and because of that we have accelerated our growth rate and it\u2019s exciting and our vision for Sales Cloud have not yet been fully realized. I mean we know that there is not just a cloud, there is not just a incredible Cloud vision for Sales Cloud, not just incredible, social vision you all know it has been built on this incredible engagement platform built on our chatter core and then extended into Salesforce1. Of course it has incredible mobility, the best of any enterprise application in the world with more mobile users gone up than any other application that I\u2019m aware of. And we are now introducing this new AI wrapper that you can see that artificial intelligence is becoming part of Sales Cloud, you can see that already in SalesforceIQ, Salesforce Inbox you can see that in predicted journeys, you\u2019re going to start to see that more aggressively and because we are innovating so aggressively on Sales Cloud you are going to continue to see great results because what customer does not want or need this ability to grow their top-line and that\u2019s was Sales Cloud is giving them in this tough environment. And by the way all of those same things that I just mentioned work with Service Cloud, they work with our platform, they work with our community. We are have one very solid core platform that is extended through this work that we\u2019re doing, jazzed about the capabilities in the company and what our developers are doing, what our innovators are doing I mean it\u2019s still exciting. Mark Hawkins : Hi, Marc, I agree. And the thing I would add in Steve is that not only as it accelerated this quarter, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of Sales Cloud accelerating in terms of the year-on-year growth, and so all this stuff that Marc is talking about is taking hold. And the other thing keep in mind and I know you know this Steve, this is U.S. dollar growth that we are talking about not foreign exchange because you alluded to like where is the growth coming from and in fact that\u2019s another point to be aware of. But the third thing I would say is when you look at all the innovation Marc is talking about and you look at market share and you probably extend we took market share again in Sales Cloud but even more importantly we took market share at the CRM level. Number one again, I took a 150 basis point and our key competitors are falling behind and actually losing market share and so that\u2019s exciting to but this is a continuing trend, it is not just one acceleration quarter, Steve. Keith Block : Just a final comment on the acceleration of Sales Cloud, if you think about the agenda of every CEO and certainly the most progressive CEOs, it is about growth, it is about shareholder value, it is about stakeholder value and this is why we align so well with our customers and this is why they are interested in our Sales Cloud, because they want to grow, they want to engage with our customers and this is the market leading platform and that\u2019s why we are seeing a reacceleration and we are aligned beautifully with the agenda of the CEOs of the best companies in the world and that they are looking for solutions and this is the best solution in the marketplace. Marc Benioff : Yes and I would just get back to my competitive comments which is you look at these other vendors and what they\u2019ve done with their technology in this category, it\u2019s been pretty poor and that\u2019s why when you saw that Magic Quadrant from Gartner, we are way high up into the right because everyone also kind of abandoned their technology in this area and they are trying to -- they give it a lot of lip service but the reality is there is just no comparison between what we have and what the other vendors have at this point, it\u2019s incredible and it comes through in our demos, it comes through in our wins, and it comes through in the core customer success. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great quarter. Two quick questions. First one is Keith can you talk a little bit about the linearity in the quarter? We saw Q1, obviously, a very terrible earnings season for a lot of the old-time software companies. I just wanted to see if that's timing or the market share comments that you kind of laid out in the first questions. The second one is since we talk about London and the event there tomorrow. And I saw like, the European growth accelerate again. Could you talk a little bit about where you see the maturity of that market versus the U.S. market? Thank you. Keith Block : Yes thanks for the question. So let me just start with the international markets into the second part of the question. This has been a big focus area for us over the last three years as part of our one of the three growth levers again extending our partner ecosystems, speaking the language of industries and focusing our resources internationally obviously we\u2019ve made investments with data centers in Europe which we\u2019re very, very excited about, our customers are obviously excited about that, we\u2019re just responding to our customers in that regard. But we\u2019ve also invested more in terms of customer phasing assets internationally because our customers want to engage with us more deeply, they want to have more strategic relationships. So we\u2019re just seeing the results of this investment that we\u2019ve made over the last three years. As part of kind of the market trends, there is a lot of legacy on premise providers out there quite frankly that are still trying to figure out if and how they can possibly transition to the cloud which is very difficult, a lot of companies will claim that they are a cloud company. But the reality is being a cloud company is about technology, it is about a business model and it\u2019s about a culture of driving customer success. And these companies that had poor results or soft results, they represent the past and they do not have these three pillars that really were the foundation for Salesforce 17 years ago and that\u2019s why we continue to drive success for our customers, we see great results in the marketplace, we are taking share quite frankly these other companies are losing share as we gain share. So we\u2019re creating separation with them in the market. And we have the right vision, we have the right story, we have the right product, we have the right execution, we have great partners and we have great customers and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Hi, guys, just want to echo my congrats on what was a huge quarter. We've talked a lot about Sales Cloud and platform, and those are phenomenal too, but we haven't touched on the Marketing Cloud yet. Our checks are picked up that you guys continue to increasingly good job in cross-selling that into that big Sales Cloud base, and obviously just the product itself has evolved pretty rapidly over the past 12, 18 months. Wonder if you could give us some color there. As you think about the rest of fiscal \u201817 how do you think about the outlook for the Marketing Cloud in particular? And then just one quick follow-up to that. Keith Block : Well we just came off with Connections. We had this incredible event last week in Atlanta where we had a record number of customers throughout for this event and a lot of great CMOs, lot of great C level executives, they love our messaging, they love our vision and we\u2019ve done a very, very nice job of integrating not only integrating, I would say that acquisition that we made almost three years ago in June of ExactTarget but we continue to strengthen the product. So it is a natural adjacency to customer engagement along with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. We continue to invest in the product, we continue to invest in the marketing assets as well as our field assets and we\u2019re driving the results and the message continues to resonate. Marc Benioff : Yes I would add in on that one too, Keith. I think you guys have landed some amazing big deals in the Marketing Cloud that\u2019s been really, really productive in that way as well, so it\u2019s really nice to see those attributes Marketing Cloud I think coming along really nicely. Philip Winslow : Great. And then just a follow-up for Marc B. Service Cloud has obviously been a phenomenal success. It's a big dollar number and continues to grow rapidly. It seems like the customer service market as a whole is pretty hot right now. We've heard some new players start to talk about coming into this space even just this week. When you think about your positioning and sort of what you bring to market here first to some of the existing fetters, but also these new ones trying to get into the market, just how do you think about your positioning? What advantages do you have and how do you think about especially the new entrants? Marc Benioff : Well, service is a huge focus of Salesforce and we -- I immediately kind of default to again my comment on innovation and as evidenced the innovation Gartner\u2019s lead analyst just published Magic Quadrant on customer engagement if you haven\u2019t seen it, you should get it and contact Gartner and you will see when you get it that Salesforce has moved farther up into the right of any product that I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of Gartner Magic Quadrants. So you will have to look at that and we\u2019re not done because where we platform in service completely on the Lightning which would be done by Dreamforce, we are continuing to add and extend service. It remains one of our most exciting fastest growing product, its going; it is chasing Sales Cloud to be our largest cloud I mean it\u2019s an exciting market. Now service is a huge and exciting market there will be many players in service, just as there are many players in sales, just as there\u2019s many players in platform. We are in mega markets and I like there\u2019s innovation in service and competition and service it makes the markets bigger but it doesn\u2019t change our position as being the number one, most important provider of service solutions in the world with largest market share that is what we want to be and continue and where we will continue to be. Mark Hawkins : And just add to that, just in case you haven\u2019t seen the report yet so, we gained 330 basis points and the report that just came out I mean it\u2019s pretty major share shift it\u2019s to add on to our already number one position. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Thank you. I'll add my congrats. Question for Marc Benioff. In recent months, we have seen a lot of evidence of the major consulting firms, such as Accenture and Deloitte and PWC, moving pretty aggressively to build out their Salesforce practices. They've been doing it both organically and through acquisitions, and they seem to be centering their entire digital transformation strategy around Salesforce. And we've seen them converging their services with apps from multiple of your app exchange partners and they're kind of wrapping that around Salesforce. And it seems to be resulting, in part, in this growth trajectory that you've got. So I am curious, does the path even beyond $10 billion and may be to $15 billion or $20 billion in revenue seem any clearer to you as you have these consulting firms coalescing around Salesforce for their digital transformation strategies? Marc Benioff : Okay, well this is a great question and I\u2019m going to go to Keith pretty quickly on this but you saw it in my February 2 presentation where we highlighted Accenture and where we\u2019ve also now toured them around the world. You\u2019ve seen the videos on YouTube between Salesforce and Accenture you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s a great opportunity go and check that out as well as the demos, you heard from their CIO, from their CEO, from their President that Salesforce is their fastest and more strategic growing practice. And it is their transformation practice; it is their key cloud practice. You also see that with the some of the other major SIs as well. I\u2019m especially proud of our work with Deloitte. I\u2019m especially proud of our work with Capgemini. And you know from the fourth quarter PWC was just an awesome, awesome relationship that is emerging. And we are delighted with that as well. All of these players have our full attention. Now for all of them they are kind of competing the growth to be the fastest grower with Salesforce\u2019s ecosystem because all of our customers want service capabilities because Salesforce itself provides actually only strategic services. We don\u2019t really provide these kind of core implementation services. So these large players have acquired many of the key parts of our ecosystem and you just saw that with IBM, they just bought Bluewolf. And they are very good company but they\u2019ve all made strategic bets and they are trying to acquire our ecosystem as fast as possible. We\u2019re continuing to invest in these companies, into these ecosystem companies, we want to start more companies that provides service capabilities, regionally in United States, in Europe, in Japan, and Australia, and other places in the world and these companies grow up and they get acquired by these large companies, that\u2019s a great model for us of course our venture firm who has made a incredible return on that strategy over the last 10 years, now on top of that, I will tell you that I don\u2019t think that there is a strategic systems integrator who isn\u2019t making massive investments in Salesforce right now. And a lot of that has been led by Keith; I\u2019m going to turn it over to him. He has really given us a partner focus that we did not have before and Keith can you kind of tell us how you doubled down on that and how you provided such great leadership around the systems integrators. Keith Block : Yes so again this has been one of our growth strategies to really drive this partner ecosystem in many fronts. And Marc mentioned a lot of the large and significant players and these are firms that have deep relationships in the board room, companies of all shapes and sizes all over the world, I mean Deloitte has been rebranded to Deloitte Digital and really when you look at the centre piece of everything that Deloitte brings to the table in terms of digital transformation, it starts with Salesforce. They have done a terrific job there. I just last week I addressed the Global Partners Forum at Accenture in Munich and talked about digital transformation and how Accenture and Salesforce are doing so well together. And just to give you an example of Accenture, we just don\u2019t have a go-to-market relationship with them which is terrific and they continue to build their practice, they\u2019re also a very large customer of us, so they are leveraging the Lightning platform, they are rolling it out very aggressively, they are getting all the benefits of it and they are building products on top of our platforms. So with a beautiful 360 degree relationship with Accenture that has really served as a model for all of these great systems integrators. I\u2019m going to be with Capgemini in a few weeks to explore how we accelerate going to market with Capgemini. We collaborate with them very regularly about how to drive the market together. I was with the Vice Chairman of PWC, a couple of weeks ago talking about our growth strategies together and our job is really to work very closely with these very trusted advisors to listen to them, to help feed and drive the ecosystem because it\u2019s just a huge part of our strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thanks for taking my question. I think this question is for Keith, this has been two quarters, I mean Salesforce has been putting up numbers that are good numbers for a while. But these last two quarters look to us be really strong and strong primarily it looks on the enterprise, I mean the SMB seems to have been pretty consistent for quite some time. But something seem to have changed with the enterprise, the enterprise customers. So Keith can you talk about what\u2019s driving this, what\u2019s happening or enterprise is just more willing to engage with SaaS vendors in specifically Salesforce or some of the processes have you came in Marc said it\u2019s your third year anniversary coming up, you obviously made some changes and put some things in place, are they just starting to really thinking right now and I guess how sustainable is this, we\u2019ve seen it now for a couple of quarters? Keith Block : Yes, John thanks for the question. So I think a couple of things. Number one just honestly this has been 17 years in the making. I mean, this is an incredible company with incredible people and incredible set of products and customers that I alluded to earlier and we\u2019ve been able to gain in several markets share and momentum. Starting with Marc\u2019s vision for cloud computing 17 years ago. So we\u2019ve been able to capitalize on that, so that\u2019s kind of point number one. Point number two is that, we find ourselves in a world where this convergence of cloud and mobile and social and data science and IoT all coming together and we kind of lit the match again with Marc\u2019s vision 17 years ago and we\u2019ve been able to reinforce that vision by driving success with our customers. And then over the last there is a third point, is over the last three years and successful as a company has always been, we have put a particular emphasis on the enterprise and a focus on expansion in our international markets becoming trusted advisors by speaking the language of the customer around the industries and building out our ecosystem kind of probably answer the question about our SI partners before, so all of these things are coming together. We are built for last that\u2019s been part of the strategy from 17 years back. And I think in the last three years as I said all these key parts are just augmenting but it\u2019s always been a great company with great products and great leadership and incredible employees and customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Ed Maguire : Hi, good afternoon. I\u2019d like to just ask a question about the source of demand that\u2019s driving acceleration in the platform. Would you characterize that more as a push to find demand where that you\u2019re building a developer ecosystem and with all of the new features and Lightning etcetera or it are you actually starting to see more pull demand as this broad ecosystem of all the clouds works together and attracts more business to the platform. Keith Block : Yes, so this is Keith. So like this is really a multifaceted thing number one our job is to think a vision for our customers around driving success and customer engagement. And then we have to back it up by driving that success and one of the ways we do it is with industry leading products and that starts with our platform. So that platform is really the secret sauce that allows us to engage drive this customer engagement level for all of our customer base in the market. So we do create a vision, if you will, we do create demand but there also is timing in the market as I talk about early between this convergence as part of the mobile, social data science and IoT all coming together. So customers are seeing a need because the market is right for disruption with all these technologies, our platform is amazing. So we\u2019re able to deliver on that product and then we have build out this incredible ecosystem or ISDs who are building on our platform and they are driving success with our customers by building unique solutions, they love the vision of Lightning and the reality of Lightning and so all those things are coming together. So it\u2019s kind of a push pull effect, the market has been created and we feel that and it\u2019s very cyclical and as a result, you see the results in our platform. Marc Benioff : All right, I think that\u2019s all that time we have for questions for today. So I want to thank everyone for joining us on our call for the first quarter. Look forward to updating you on our Q2 results in August and remember you register for Trailhead DX event here in San Francisco June 7 and 8 and of course Europe for Dreamforce October 4 through 7. So look forward to talking to you all in a few months. Thanks so much. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

So with that, let me turn the call over to you Marc. Marc Benioff : Outstanding, John. Thank you very much and thank you to everyone joining us on today's call. I am absolutely delighted to be here to talk about our second quarter results and tell you about everything that is going on at Salesforce. So revenue, as you see, has grown 25% in dollars and 26% year-over-year in constant currency to more than $2 billion and just congratulations to everyone at Salesforce. This is our first $2 billion quarter and also no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering this kind of growth rate. Congratulations to everyone. Deferred revenue was $3.8 billion, up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. The dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now $11.8 billion, which is up 28% from a year ago. We are raising our fiscal 2017 revenue guidance to $8.325 billion at the high end of our range of 25%, and we are delivering on the strong pace of topline growth even as we continue and improve on our non-GAAP operating margin. Salesforce continues to be the fastest growing top ten software company in the world and last week Forbes ranked us as one of the most innovative companies in the world for the sixth year in a row and has named Salesforce \"the innovator of the decade\". Thank you, Forbes. And that\u2019s a great tribute to our amazing employees, especially our technology and product teams. Dreamforce is coming up and you are going to see an incredible level of new innovation when we introduce Salesforce Einstein, the world's first comprehensive artificial intelligence platform for CRM. Salesforce Einstein is AI for everyone. It's going to democratize artificial intelligence. It's going to make every company and every employee smarter, faster and more productive. We are going to deliver the world's smartest CRM. And as you know, over the last few years we have acquired a number of AI companies. Incredible companies like RelateIQ, MetaMind, Implisit, PredictionIO, Tempo AI and more with amazing, amazing people and technology. We have been able to stitch all this together into this incredible AI platform and this focus on AI and on the critical aspects of AI as the next wave of our industry has resulted in a machine learning team of more than 175 data scientists who have built this amazing Einstein platform. And that\u2019s really why I am so excited and why everyone in Salesforce is so excited. And when you come to Dreamforce you are going to see how this fits together and how we are delivering Salesforce Einstein and we are going to have some great new products like Sales Cloud Einstein and Service Cloud Einstein, Marketing Cloud Einstein. We are going to have our Analytics Cloud Einstein and many other artificial intelligence capabilities in all of our clouds and our customers will be able to build their own AI capabilities using Einstein extensions and Heroku. This is going to be a huge differentiator and growth driver going forward as it puts us well ahead of our CRM competition once again. Salesforce Einstein is also a perfect example of how we have been able to combine organic innovation with some amazing acquisitions. We came into this year with a lot of excitement and energy around the investments we made in our own technology. Earlier this year, as you know, market conditions did change and my leadership, the board and I were presented with some incredible opportunities that we just never thought would be available to us. We took a look at these amazing acquisitions and our strategy was simple, we will acquire one of a kind companies with unique technologies, amazing engineering teams and of course visionary leaders that fit with our mission and our strategic plan to help our customers connect with their customers in new ways. And some of these acquisitions are helping us build out our CRM today, others are laying out the foundation for our future. A great example is Demandware. A company we have had a great relationship with and have admired and there is no company like Demandware. It's the clear leader in the multibillion dollar cloud ecommerce marketplace, a natural extension of our platform. It expands our CRM offering with capabilities our customers have been asking for and when we have talked to customers, like Louis Vuitton or Brunello Cucinelli, or See's Candy, or even Adidas, they talk about Demandware as the critical part of their ecommerce cloud, and that\u2019s how it became Salesforce's ecommerce cloud. It's the solution that our customers drove us to and we are absolutely thrilled with this great new family of ecommerce products at Salesforce. We also take advantage of opportunities to invest in our future with incredible companies like Quip and everyone knows he is the great leader of Quip, Bret Taylor. Creator of Google Maps and also the former CTO of Facebook, who has created this next generation technology of live documents, bringing a new level of content, communication and collaboration right into our platform. And with all of this, we are creating the world's smartest CRM through sales service marketing community, analytics, ecommerce and IoT. We have never been better positioned for the future. You are going to see that at Dreamforce. It is going to be a rush of innovation. There has never been more new products and more capabilities released at Dreamforce, and you are never going to see a better place to see how all this amazing innovation and products comes together. This is our biggest customer event of the year. Coming very very soon, October 4 through 7. We have got more than 2300 customer speakers inspiring, motivating, empowering, educating our amazing community of customer trailblazers. We also have an amazing lineup of speakers including Melinda Gates, and General Motors Mary Barra, Congressman John Lewis, and many many more. And you are not going to want to miss U2 performing at our Dreamfest UCSF Benefit Concert to raise $10 million for children hospitals. It's going to be an unforgettable event. Dreamforce is already sold out. So talk to John to get registered and I am going to look forward to seeing everybody there. Now let's turn it over to Keith and talk about our customer highlights for the quarter. Keith? Keith Block : Thanks, Marc, and thanks to everybody for joining the call today. Overall, we delivered a solid second quarter. Our results reflect our continued focus on becoming more strategic with the enterprise, expanding internationally, investing in our partner ecosystem and broadening our penetration in our target industries. In each of these areas we made good progress in Q2. Now, at the same time we saw some softness at the end of the quarter, primarily in the United States, and after a thorough operational review of the United States business, from sales to products to marketing, really all aspects of our business, I am confident in our plan for the year. We have a proven and tenured sales leadership team. We have industry-leading products. We have continued high win rates and our second half pipeline is very strong. We also are seeing very high levels of customer engagement. So let me take you through some of the highlights of the quarter. We continue to close some of the biggest and most strategic transactions in the industry. In fact, we closed another nine figure transaction in Q2 with a Fortune 50 customer. For those of you who are counting, this is now the third quarter in a row where we have established these very strategic nine figure relationships. On the international front. Over the last few years we have been steadily increasing our distribution capacity, expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in offices and infrastructure and opening new data centers and all of these investments are clearly paying off. Europe was our fastest growing region powered by some great strategic wins with Cellcom, and PostNord and TNT, AXA and Nestle. Great brands. Asia Pac had some great wins with Shinsei Bank, Meiji Yasuda, Samsung, and Telstra. And in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with the largest private bank in Brazil, Ita\u00fa. And in every region our partners, which is so critical to our strategy, have been a huge part of our success. Our ecosystem continues to expand with incredible ISVs and global and regional SIs. In fact, partner certifications reached 38,000 in the quarter, up 25% from a year ago, which is proof positive that our partner strategy is working and adding to our additional overall capacity. We continue to gain traction from our vertical focus, which produce our momentum in each of our major industries and I would like to share a few of those stories. In healthcare, UnitedHealth Group significantly expanded with us to help build its next generation of patients and customer engagement for more than 125 million people. This is an incredible vision to make healthcare more cost effective, efficient, predictive and intelligent. In retail, one of the world's largest brands expanded with us to consolidate their entire guest experience to turn the billions of messages they send to customers in one to one journeys that are seamless, intelligent and predictive. Macy's is another great example of how our retailer can transform with us. They started with Heroku for just portions of their mobile and ecommerce websites. Now, they are bringing Salesforce to 185,000 employees and 1000 plus HR call center agents. And our momentum in retail is only going to get supercharged with Demandware, our Salesforce Commerce Cloud. In financial services, we expanded with State Farm and Nationwide and Farmers, and the Advisor Group, one the largest networks of independent broker dealers in the country, and they are rolling out the Salesforce financial services cloud to thousands of affiliated advisors. As you now, this is a product we launched just last quarter and their early interest has been remarkable. These are all incredible stories. I could go on and on and at Dreamforce you are going to hear even more from our customers and how they are transforming their business with Salesforce. Before I close, I would like to thank the team and the company for their hard work and their efforts to driving customer success in the quarter and, of course, to our customers and partners for their trust in us and I look forward to a strong second half. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to talk about our financial performance in the quarter. Mark Hawkins : Great. Thanks, Keith. Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter which was near the high-end of the guidance we provided in June. Our dollar attrition for the second quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud, remains below 9% supporting top line revenue growth. Looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year in dollars. Service Cloud grew 29%, App Cloud and other grew 43%, Marketing Cloud grew 28% which now includes the subscription and support revenue from Demandware. While many enterprise software companies are aspiring to achieve a billion run rate in one product, we already have three products with revenue run rates of more than $1 billion today with the Marketing Cloud soon to become our four. This gives us multiple levers of growth and provides additional business diversification. This was another quarter of consistent, year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in our regions with EMEA growing 32% and Asia Pac growing 29%. During the second quarter, FX drove more revenue pressure than expense relief. So I am very pleased that we were able to still deliver 25 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year, our ninth consecutive quarter of expansion. And we achieved this even while we began integrating Demandware and other recent acquisitions. I have already discussed our FX impacted our P&L but the more meaningful impact was to the cash flow statement and balance sheet. Cash flow in the quarter was $251 million, down 18% over the last year. Operating cash flow was principally impacted by FX headwinds as well as continued deepening of the seasonality of invoicing and onetime cost associated with the acquisition of Demandware. However, I am very pleased with our cash generation in the first half of the year of $1.3 billion, which is up 25% over the first half of last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $3.8 billion which includes approximately $23 million related to our acquisition of Demandware. This was up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $35 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $41 million. This was the largest sequential deferred revenue headwind we have ever seen. It highlights the dramatic effect that currency had at the end of Q2. In the quarter approximately 78% of all subscription and support related invoices were issued with annual terms. Q2 benefit to deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than one percentage point of growth. Moving on to guidance. Just as FX had a significant impact on our Q2 results, we now expect FX pressures to persist for the remainder of the year with a full year revenue headwind of approximately $100 million to $150 million. In this context, I am pleased to raise our full year revenue guidance to $8.275 billion to $8.325 billion. At the same time we are making minor adjustments to our operating model to absorb and integrate recent acquisitions in order to deliver the profitability we committed to. As such, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.93 to $0.95, which implies approximately 70 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement. Finally, with FX volatility we have discussed, we are updating our full year operating cash flow guidance to a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21% which allows us to remain on track for our first $2 billion cash flow year. For Q3 we are initiating guidance for the revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.20 to $0.21, and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of approximately 20%. To close, we delivered solid results in the second quarter and I am very pleased to be raising our top line guidance while maintaining bottom line guidance for the year. As Keith said, with our strong pipeline of new business and with Dreamforce in October, we have a great set up as we move to the back half of the year and I look forward to welcoming many of you at Dreamforce in October. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Keith, you mentioned some weakness at the end of the quarter, I was wondering if you could dig into that a little bit for us? Was it, from like a competitive impact, was it in any particular product segment? Anything you could give us in terms of color, in terms of what happened at the end of the quarter, and to the degree to which it's going to persist into Q3 into the back half of the year? And then, Mark, if you could talk to us, Mark Hawkins, if you could talk to us about how much of that conservatism for the weakness at the end of the quarter is implied into the guidance that we have for Q3 and Q4? Particularly the implied billings guidance for Q3? Keith Block : Yes. Okay. Keith, thanks for the question. So, listen, we had a solid quarter. Our results were good. We did have some weakness and some softness, if you will, in parts of our business in the United States. As I had mentioned in my earlier comments, we conducted a very very detailed operational review which is, by the way, part of our normal cadence. It's what we normally do. But we took a deeper look given that we had some softness in parts of the U.S. And, look, at the end of the day what I would boil this down to is just a bit of blocking and tackling. And we have taken a look at it, we have made the adjustments, we have looked at our playbooks. We have tightened up on a few things. But in these quarters, things push out, things pull in and that\u2019s happened in every single quarter that I have ever been involved with and I think many of you know that I have been in this business for over 30 years. So as I said, we have taken a look at the operational aspects of the business. I feel very very positive about the second half. Our pipeline is strong. Our win rates were very strong in the quarter. Our level of engagement has never been stronger. In fact, over the last two weeks I have spent time with three of the CEO and COOs of the top ten U.S. banks in the United States. And all of them are talking to us about transformation and raising their level of engagement with customers and they view us as a trusted advisor and they want to know how we can help them. They are talking to us. They are talking to Salesforce, they are not talking to other customers. So when I look at the leadership team that we have in place, which has been a very high performing team historically, when I look at our second half pipeline, when I look at our level of engagement which is unprecedented, I feel very very strongly about the second half of the fiscal year. Mark Hawkins : Yes. Let me pick up on the second point, Keith, the questions you asked there around DR and you asked about billings. Let me just talk about our DR, deferred revenue. Obviously, we have some impact for the foreign exchange. We talked about having such a impact in Q2, it's the biggest sequential change that we have seen ever in the history of Salesforce. So it has to be factored in appropriately. The other thing that I know you will get, Keith, also is the [indiscernible] seasonality and the compounding effect that we talked about at Dreamforce last year, we showed all the map and the multiyear trend that\u2019s happening there. Of course, we would look at that as well. When I level it up, basically, and say that we think it's appropriate. And when we look at the overall topline demand of revenue growth as described, I am just pleased to be able to have -- this is the third time this year that we have raised our annual guidance for revenue for the year. And we are doing that predicated on all the things Keith talked about, the second half pipeline. Looking at things like our market share. We continue to gain momentum based on the most recent market share data that was released. Win ratios. But at the end of the day, what I am most pleased about doing is doing that for the third time in the face of $100 million to $150 million and FX headwinds at the topline and yet we are still doing a third raise. So I think we have a good setup, as Keith described, and obviously we have to factor in all the things he covered. That\u2019s my point of view. Hope that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : This question is for Marc Benioff. Marc, there's obviously been a lot of news coming out of Salesforce over the past 90 days. You also had a bunch of comments in the press surrounding LinkedIn. I guess, what I'm wondering is, the last time I believe you set out a big public goal for the company was your $10 billion target several years ago, which obviously, looks like you'll trip over very soon. I'm just wondering if you could share with everyone your vision for the company as you look out over the next three to five years? How you're thinking about the company's revenue potential and how important M&A will be going forward in achieving those goals? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, Heather, I really appreciate that. You know specifically to the M&A question, when we came into this year we didn\u2019t really have M&A on our forecast and the reason why is, because when we look at doing M&A we look for really strategic, great companies that are one of a kind, and also that we are going to get a great price. Then we have a tremendous process in our company that includes our board of directors, M&A committee as well as our internal corporate development group. And when we looked out, we didn\u2019t see that happening. But then there were some pretty big changes that happened in the market and the first one I know, you covered, which was that LinkedIn did not have a great quarter and their stock dropped by 50%. And when that happened, it really triggered our process because all of a sudden they -- a great company that is a unique asset, that\u2019s strategic, was available at a great price. So we made a bid for LinkedIn and another company as you know, Microsoft, made a bid, and Microsoft outbid us. And that happened for a lot of different reasons but we thought that that was a great asset at a great price. Then as the market continues to evolve, we had an incredible situation occur which, very similar, which is a company that we coveted for many years, Demandware, was all of a sudden approached by another company and they tried to acquire Demandware. And it came to our attention, would we want to buy them, and we put in a bid for Demandware because, again, it's a great company. It was a great price. Tremendously strategic fit for our company and our future, ecommerce platform. And I have just come back from a trip to LVMH who uses Salesforce for CRM and is also standardized on Demandware, and they said, those two solutions combined that\u2019s all they needed to manage all their customer information. That was enough to me to go the board and say, look, we have been approached by Demandware. This is one of a kind opportunity, there is no other leader in cloud ecommerce. Our customers like LVMH, like others I could go through, are using Demandware. We should acquire this and we were successful in that bid. Now as the summer kind of rolled on, I did not expect to get a call from someone who I have incredible respect for, Bret Taylor, who is the CEO of Quip. I have followed his career for many years, I try to have dinner with him once a month. Everyone knows the incredible work he did with Google Maps. Everyone knows he was the CTO of Facebook and he had accepted an investment from Salesforce to this company and we were talking about the possibility of Salesforce acquiring his company and him joining our team as one of our top technical leaders. And that\u2019s a dream that this company has had for several years. Everyone here and many people in the industry as well covet and love Bret and when we had that opportunity, we took that. And so, our beginning of our fiscal year plan not to acquire any companies all of a sudden turned into we acquired two very important companies with Demandware and also Quip. And we have also found a couple of other great companies as well. And this M&A window, I talked about that I think on the last call, openly in the press, seems to have opened for the year. I think it will probably close, probably at the end of this calendar year. But it's been incredible time for us to acquire some phenomenal assets and I have never been more excited about Salesforce and our product line and coming into Dreamforce, like I said is, just awesome. And specifically on the goal, well, I am not giving forward guidance of course but, yes, we are, you are right, you can do the math and so can I. We are about to get very close to being able to start talking about our $10 billion year. We are not doing that on this call, and you can see it in our quarter numbers that when we pass through that, we are going to be taking a very aggressive goal to double the company. I am very committed to topline growth, as you know. I am also very committed to bottom line growth. I will not grow the company without also growing the bottom line and we have proven that, and you can see that on the press release that\u2019s in front of you that the top and bottom line have grown really well this quarter and we will continue to do that and will continue to do that while being able to participate in this M&A environment. Because, as you can see, not only did we buy the companies, but we also beat our numbers. So we will continue to execute that. I hope that answers your questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan : One for Keith. First of all, if I think I heard right that the Demandware revenue went into the Marketing Cloud segment. So if I took that out and looked at it organically, it seemed that that cloud decelerated to maybe something in the low 20% growth range. And I was just curious, Keith, if the Marketing Cloud in particular was an area of softness in the quarter or if there were any other dynamics going on there that are leading to that business decelerate here? Keith Block : Yes. So thanks for your question. Obviously, some of this, and Mark Hawkins can discuss it, but some of that effect would come from FX. But, look, generally speaking, we are still very very excited about marketing cloud. I think as you know, we have had a strong push on industry focus and retail is one of our top industries. Marketing cloud obviously plays a big role there. And when you add Demandware in concert with marketing cloud from a portfolio perspective, that just means that we are bringing a very very compelling solution to retail. So we continue to be very competitive with Marketing Cloud. We are locked in a lot of deals. Our win rates have remained the same. And, Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to make a comment on the FX component? Mark Hawkins : Yes. No, I think there is that and the only comment I would add is, as recently reported, we continue to take market share in this area as well and that bodes well and it supports our win ratio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : Maybe I'll start with Keith. Keith, you mentioned the second half pipeline looks pretty strong, it gives you confidence, but the 3Q deferred revenue and hence billings guidance doesn't imply that much strength actually. So are we to interpret your comment that you're looking at a fairly strong 4Q print? I guess, that's my question, I'll stop there. Thanks. Keith Block : Yes. Let me address the pipeline issue and then, of course, Mark, if you want to weigh in, that\u2019s fine. So we are coming into a second half for the year where we feel very very strongly about our pipeline. Of course we have got our big event with Dreamforce coming up in October and that obviously will help supercharge our quarter and we get an incredible turnout from our customers and our partners. But we feel very very strongly about that pipeline. And what gives me so much confidence about the second half is not just the pipeline but it is also, as I mentioned earlier, the level of engagement that we are seeing. I mentioned the three executives that I recently spent time with. I will tell you a very quick story about the gentleman named Stephen Hemsley, who is the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, who spent hours with me talking about his vision for healthcare and his industry and why he was committed to working with us. Hence, signing agreement with the quarter. But there are dozens and dozens of those conversations that are taking place. Marc recently came back from Europe where he was surrounded with other CEOs, and he may want to comment on, talking about the opportunity to drive transformation in customer engagement in their businesses. So I think the level of engagement is very strong. The pipeline feels very very good. As I mentioned earlier, again, this is a very high performing leadership team that we have. That has delivered quarter in and quarter out and, obviously, I have enormous confidence. We all do in the company and those folks. And with respect for the forward guide, I will refer that to Mark Hawkins and let him respond. Mark Hawkins : Yes. Absolutely. Karl, I think at the end of the day, when you take the most significant FX sequential headwind to deferred revenue that we have ever experienced in Q2, obviously that has to be factored into our overall plan. All the context that Keith gave you as well gets factored into our plan for the second half. But certainly in Q3 we had to factor in the foreign exchange and don\u2019t forget what we talked about, I know you know this well too, the continued compounding effect of invoicing that we described mathematically, at Dreamforce continues, and those are things to think about as well. But, certainly, the FX has a real bearing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Keith, on the deals in Q2 that slipped in the U.S., it seems like, just implying from your comments that those deals are still in the pipe. You didn't lose them competitively, that it's just a matter of timing. It wasn't an issue of those deals going somewhere else? Keith Block : Yes. So I want to make sure that I am very clear that what we saw the softness in parts of the U.S. business, it was at the end of the quarter. Really in July. And our win rates continue to be very very strong. As far as these deals that slipped, again, typical of my experience, some of these deals will close in the next quarter or the next quarter, or the next quarter. None of these deals are going away. None of these deals have been lost. They may take different shapes and sized and forms but all of these deals are very very much in play. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : I guess a fair question to Marc Benioff, given this potential about three years back. Three years back or so, I think your Q1 new business was a little weak and everybody was worried on Wall Street, and then subsequently the next three or four quarters your billings growth rate went from 17% to 19% in that quarter to, well, north of the high 20%s, 30%s. So is it just a temporary phase with slippage of deals or could there be some broader macroeconomic forces at work that have a fair bit of probability. Just wanted to get your feel for that? And also secondly, more strategically, what could be the impact of Einstein? Could there be a replacement cycle within your base or new TAM ops that you think could be opened to Salesforce that were previously not available? Thank you so much. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks, Kash. And you are right, and you know, I mean we have been -- Keith and I had a lot of conversation about this because Keith and I have both been in the enterprise software business for 25 years or more, 30 years, and I think we both started at Oracle in '86. And you do get a quarter now and then when some specific geography, in this case the United States, has some softness, and it's just the nature of enterprise software and that\u2019s where we are. I don\u2019t attribute it to any other factor than that and that\u2019s just, it is what it is and you move on to the third quarter and assess your pipelines, and ours are full and rich. And you assess your competitive position and our win rates are strong and you look at where your innovation cycle is and we have never had a bigger, a new product cycle as your question indicates, which is that when we roll into Dreamforce, we are going to have incredible release of Einstein. You are going to see dramatic enhancements to our Salesforce Lightning platform. Now mobile capabilities and enhancements with Salesforce1. Of course, the productivity tools available through Quip which is remarkable live documents that everyone has downloaded and started using Quip, whether it's on your phone or your iPad or on your laptop. I mean it's just a remarkable piece of technology. And then we, of course, have some of these incredible new platforms that we did not have a year ago, like Ecommerce Cloud. So all of that together provides for a very exciting Dreamforce. And in regards to how we price it, you have seen that Sales Cloud continues to do really even though it's a monster in terms of revenue. And one of the reasons that growth continues is because we have these amazing options available with Sales Cloud like, of course, Pardot, we all know that, which is an incredible product that we picked up when we bought ExactTarget three years ago. We also have another amazing option on Sales Cloud which is CPQ or SteelBrick, which is another amazing option that we picked up last year. And there will be another amazing option of Einstein for Sales Cloud to give you this incredible intelligence. So you are going to see some awesome capabilities. You can also have those kind of options available with it. For example, Analytics Cloud will have the Einstein option as well to make machine intelligence part of your analytics journey. So there is a lot of exciting things coming for Dreamforce, and nobody likes to softness in any particular region. This did seem quite isolated, in my opinion, to the U.S. Like I said, we really saw some great growth and deal flow in the United States but we did get a big of softness at the very end of the quarter. And then we had a great performance in Europe, we had great performance in Asia Pacific, we had great -- Japan had a record quarter and a record month in July. So it's just, it's in incredible part of the enterprise industry and it's something that you learn to not only just manage through but use to make your company stronger and stronger and stronger, which is exactly what we did the last time that we saw that which was in the quarter that you talked about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Alex Zukin : So maybe, Marc, one for you, kind of on this theme around digital transformation projects. As you speak to CEOs, do you sense, at least in the U.S., any change in the pace of those digital transformation projects? And then, maybe one for Mark Hawkins, within your framework of growth and profitability, what is the triggering mechanism to kind of start showing incremental leverage if there is some moderation in kind of growth? Marc Benioff : Well, it's a great question. Last week I was with a lot of customer CEOs. CEO of Unilever and ABB, and Coca-Cola and PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the CEO of Bank of America. And in each and every case, those customers are not only absorbing more and more of our technology than ever before but they are getting more aggressive about their digital transformation. I mean today ABB, which is an incredible manufacturing company based in Switzerland, they have deployed now more than 20,000 users and are connecting all of their machines and building an incredible customer network using Salesforce. When I look at the work that Brian is doing at BofA, again it's a huge fundamental transformation of his business to be a customer first and to be digital and to be integrated. And both of those companies and the other companies I have mentioned have chosen Salesforce as their CRM platform to do that work. And I could go through dozens and dozens of others that I think that that pace, not just digital transformation but what I would say is customer transformation. Creating a customer first environment that is intelligent and mobile and one that allows their companies to build these one on one relationships with either their BtoB customers or BtoC customers as well. This is a pace of change that I have never seen and I don\u2019t think that there is a company that we are working with today who is reducing their digital transformations. If anything, I think almost every single one that I met with this quarter and I have even spent a couple of weeks in Japan this quarter, are accelerating it. Mark Hawkins : So, Marc, let me pick up the second part of the question. Alex, thank you for the note on, for revenue, operating margin framework and how do we think about profitability and triggers and such. As Marc said, we think about that a lot. Growth is number one and as we showed this quarter, whether it be at the bottom line as we are showing for the year with our guide, operating margin expansion is important to us as well. Very consistent with our framework. Clearly, when you think about the trigger points of that framework, it's growth rates and we think about those three categories. And what that brings to mind for me, for this quarter and this information that we are sharing with you, we have a guide that\u2019s in the 25%ish revenue growth rate for the year. Again, as we said, the third raise of the year and that\u2019s what that number looks like. And then, of course, what we haven't talked about as much is an $11.8 billion of billed and unbilled deferred revenue that grew, a big number at 28% in aggregate. So we think about growth a lot. We think about profitability a lot. We think about the revenue framework. It's very much intact. You have heard from Marc and heard from me but clearly, it's keeping growth number one but also delivering a profitability consistent with that framework. But clearly growth is the trigger. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : First for Marc Benioff. I guess a follow-up on Alex's question around your conversations around digital transformation. Did those conversations already start gearing into AI as well? Meaning, I'm curious with Einstein coming out, do you think that the customer base that's already thinking about digital transformation, are they asking questions about AI from you all? And then, Keith, just on your commentary around the pipeline looking good, as you mentioned at your last company, you have been around this industry for a while, your last company had a modest seasonality in the fourth quarter. Are we just starting to see more seasonality in the business as well as you guys get into larger deals? Thanks a lot. Marc Benioff : You know, I will tell you that you are absolutely right and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence. We strongly believe that when we look at the future of Salesforce, when we look at the future of our industry, of course we have seen the evolution from the cloud. We talked about that on many calls. We have talked about social, we have talked about mobile. I think we are really now evolved into kind of four key areas and my employees and executives all know that I feel very strongly around this. But of course the absolute first one is intelligence. That is companies demand that your software is going to be intelligent, smart. That you are going to have machine learning and deep learning and machine intelligence built in. That it's going to be excellent. That that machine intelligence is going to be declarative as well as programmatic. That you are going to leave no customer behind. If a customer is a programmer, they can use it. If a customer is non-programmatic or what we call declarative, they are going to be able to use it. This is very important going forward and I really believe we are going to have the best artificial intelligence platform in the industry. We have phenomenal executives, phenomenal minds. The progress so far has been incredible. And I think when you see Einstein, you will see that it is on par and capable to any other AI platform that you have seen like Watson and others. But with Einstein it has these capabilities like non-programmatic capabilities as well as programmatic capabilities that is built into our applications as well as being independent. And I think that will be very powerful. Two, platform. I think everybody knows that I strongly believe you can't just build a platform today -- can't just build an application, you have to build platforms. And these platforms also have to be declarative as well as programmatic. And I of course am biased, but I believe that our Lightening platform is the best in enterprise software. You can build applications that run on any device, whether it's any phone or any tablet of any PC, or any type of IoT capability. And I believe that Lightening will be an incredible capability for us going forward. And three, is mobility. That is Salesforce now has millions of users on its mobile platforms. I know many people on this call use Salesforce1 every day. We have many other key mobile technologies like Salesforce Inbox and others available as well and mobility remains a huge focus for Salesforce. When you come to Dreamforce, you are going to see more and more capabilities on mobility as billions of users around the world go online on their phones. They want to be able to do that with Salesforce run their business from their phone and Salesforce1 remains, I believe, the absolute, most popular application development and deployment vehicle for mobile. And, finally, productivity. We have to have productivity built in. All of our applications need to have core productivity applications, whether it is email, like with Salesforce Inbox or spreadsheets or word processors like Quip, live documents. All of that has to be an integrated part of what we are doing. We believe that strongly. We have obviously done a lot of great work with Microsoft as well, with their products. We have now our own product in this category. And this is going to be really important for us going forward and it's the reason that we bought Quip because we believe the productivity is the fourth leg of the stool and that when you look at artificial intelligence, platform, mobility and productivity, and then you look on top of that our core applications in sales, service, marketing, community, analytics, apps, IoT and ecommerce and you could even break productivity out as its own application category. I think all of you know productivity itself has a huge TAM, $26 billion a year TAM. Those nine applications, differentiated by these four capabilities. That\u2019s how I look at where our product line is going and I hope to be able to articulate that in a much simpler, much easier to understand way when we get to Dreamforce for our customers. Keith Block : Again, just to respond to the second part of the question. As you know over three years ago Marc and I had many many conversations about coming onto Salesforce which I was super excited about and I continue to be super excited about being here. But a couple of the charters, coming on board here, was obviously to continue the outstanding operational excellence of our broader market or SMB business. But really to accelerate into the enterprise, and I think we have made excellent progress there. But as you continue this SMB business and accelerate into the enterprise, of course you are going to be balancing out the portfolio. And by definition, the nature of enterprise typically is back ended in the second half of years. So, I think it's natural to expect that that will drive some degree of seasonality for the second half of the year. But we run a balanced portfolio of business and that\u2019s what we strive to every single day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Question for Marc Benioff. So essentially all of the major services firms experienced problems recently, and that included Cognizant and Infosys and Genpact, and a whole bunch of others. And I do believe several of them mentioned softness in digital projects in the month of July. I think some of that was attributed to the big banks that were counting on a midyear interest rate increase which did not happen, partially as a result of the Brexit vote. I'm just curious, do you look at all of that as purely coincidental relative to what you mentioned at the end of the quarter in the U.S.? Or is it possible that there was a bit of a brief pause, maybe a little macro induced, that just potentially may have pushed some number of transactions out of Q2 and perhaps leading into a bigger second half of the year? Marc Benioff : You know, I honestly really believe in kind of manifest destiny that this is always about us. You know that we always have to just look at our own ability to execute. And as we have driven this company forward over the last 18 years that, I always come back to that. And that this is the most important thing is that regardless of what the environment is, whether it's incredibly strong and robust, or whether if there is a bit of softness. Regardless of what geography you are in, whether it's the U.S. or Japan or whatever it is, that it's ultimately always about you. If you always went to kind of these macroeconomic views and, well, well, it's a low growth rate environment or it's a low interest rate environment, or it's this or it's that, you are not able to really just focus on and work on your own business. And as an example of that is Japan this quarter. You know I spent two weeks in Japan. Japan is a very exciting IT environment. It still is a huge part of the enterprise software industry and we are just still getting going in Japan. We are at the beginning of our Japan journey. And, yet, we have these incredible relationships with some of Japan's most important companies and government agencies. And that\u2019s how I look at it. If I had listened to what everyone told me about Japan in the last 18 years, we wouldn\u2019t even by doing business there. I just don\u2019t believe in that stuff. I believe that you get what you focus on and you have to answer the question what do you want and then you focus on that and achieve it and keep it positive. Well, Keith, how do you look at it? Keith Block : Well, I think you are right. I think you have to stick to your netting and our netting is all around the customer and growth for the customer. Specific to our partners, I go back to the statistics I mentioned earlier. We have 38,000 partner certifications. That\u2019s up 25% year-over-year. And I don\u2019t think it's appropriate for us to comment on what they are seeing in their business or the softness in their business. But I think the indication of that level of certification growth says that they are betting on the long-term on Salesforce and I think that is something we all should pay attention to. Marc Benioff : You know, Keith, you had some amazing transactions in the quarter we talked about. UnitedHealth Group is one of them specifically. But you had some of the other really amazing companies that you were personally in. I know we have talked a lot about the financial service companies that you spend a lot of time in in the quarter and you obviously also travelled a bit during the quarter as well. So when you are out there, what are customers really zeroing on in terms of what they want from Salesforce? Keith Block : Well, I think the thing that really aligns us with our customers is, if you look at the CEO agenda and of course you are CEO, number one is growth. And followed very quickly with shareholder value and then of course the concern about the employee and the community and all that stuff that\u2019s important to us and our values. But the CEO agenda is [indiscernible]. I mean you listen to our story and our messaging and the value that we bring to customers on a daily basis. It is growth. So there is great alignment there. So when I am talking to financial services institutions, they are talking about streamlining processes around customer engagement and reinventing themselves. And they know that we are an innovative company and because we drive innovation and we inspire customers, that\u2019s why they want to have those conversations with us. And so that\u2019s pretty typical of what I see on a regular basis. Marc Benioff : So I think that\u2019s consistent with my viewpoint as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : It's Macquarie. First, a question for Keith and/or Mark B. I don't want to beat a dead horse and I certainly understand the nature of large deals and enterprise software playing at this level and size in particular. But I was wondering, as you guys examine the business do you think there was any impact from the roll out of Lightning with its improved feature set and the subsequent price increases that may have caused some slowness at the end of the quarter? If you guys could talk a little bit about how the market is receiving Lightning prices that would be really helpful to us? And then a second one for Mark H. In regards to billing, Mark, how much of a factor is Demandware in your outlook? Thanks guys. Keith Block : Let me take the first part of that. So really with respect to the price increase that we have been talking about for some period of time. When I did these full, and I do mean full, operational review of the U.S., every element of the business was inspected. Six ways to Sunday. And naturally one would go to, well, was it pricing, was it this, was it that. And I will tell you, we did not see a material impact on the quarter in pricing. And the thing that we view on the pricing change that we have made, is that it really demonstrates value for our customers and that was the impetus behind it. Mark, I don\u2019t know if you would like to comment? Mark Hawkins : Yes, sure. Let me just carry on in terms of the second question, Sarah, that you has asked about, in terms of Demandware. Let me just call out that Demandware, in terms of revenue we talked about, when Keith and I were on the call in June, that we expect revenue of around $100 million to $120 million for the year. That\u2019s what we called out when we set that guide. And so that\u2019s something you should think about as you think about billings from that standpoint. By the way, I just want to call out, we are super pleased to have Demandware. It's just an exciting, adding functionality and a unique asset, as Marc called out, that we are super happy to have. So I hope that dimensionlizes and helps you to think about how to factor that into billings. Operator : The last question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Derrick Wood : For Keith, I mean you guys put more product out this year than we've ever seen. You've got SteelBrick, IQ, you've got new Wave apps, you've got Wealth and Health Cloud. Now you've got Commerce Cloud. I think IoT Cloud is coming out. Certainly a lot in one year. And I imagine bringing all these products out, go to market varies by product. But you've got to do things like train the sales force, train the channel, may be create new dedicated teams, may be there's new ELA type of engagements now coming into play. So I'm curious, do you think all these product releases may have weighed on near term sales productivity or sales cycles? And then, what's your strategy over the next 6 to 12 months to help push greater adoption of these newer products? Keith Block : Okay. Great. So that\u2019s an excellent question. Here's the way I would look at this. Number one, I am a big believer in innovation and it is at the core of this company. It's part of our DNA. And we are blessed to be, all of us, to be working in a company that drives innovation. And all these products that you mentioned, whether it's IQ or SteelBrick or our IoT cloud, these are things that our customers are very very excited about. And by the way, the reason why we build these products or acquire these companies is because not only do we have a great strategy but part of that strategy is because we listen to our customers and we think about what's important to their future. So we have a whole portfolio of solutions. We will continue to enrich that portfolio of solutions. Part of the strategic weapon, if you will, of this company is the focus, a relentless focus on what we refer to as an enablement, which is training our people. We have an incredible platform for that called, Trailhead, which you will continue to hear the company talk more and more and more about because it's an exciting way to enable employees. And we use it on ourselves and all of our people are subject to building trails and taking advantage of the incredible training and content. And I think we do that as well as any company that I have ever seen. And I think that\u2019s one of the things that really separates us from the past. So, again, when I talk about our optimism around the second half and our pipelines for the second half, it is because we have such a rich portfolio. It's because we have a high performing organization and it's because we know how to enable these people. Now, enablement, I will tell you, for a company like us there is no end of job. So I think we all as leaders in the company, no matter what line of business we are responsible for, we wake up every day and think about what's the best way for us to onboard our employees, what's the best way to continue to educate them on new product releases, what's the best way to make sure that we are prepared so that they deliver value to our customers. And that\u2019s why enablement is so important to us as a company and that\u2019s why we focus so much of our attention to it. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks so much. Thanks everyone for joining us today. That concludes our call. Just to remind everyone that we will look forward to seeing you on October 4 at our Analyst Day, and of course updating you again in November for our third quarter results. If you have follow-up questions you can reach us at investor@salesforce.com, and thanks for participating today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

So, with that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Hey, thanks John and thanks to everybody for joining us on the call today. We are coming live to you from New Jersey where we have the whole team and we spent the whole week here in New York and having a great time. And it\u2019s been great to be here. We just opened our new Salesforce Tower which is the former MetLife though at Bryant Park, really cool, great new space for customers, partners, employees, love to invite all of you there to see what we are going to do with this incredible new building in New York. And Salesforce Tower New York is open and all the signage is going to be going up over the next six months. We are really thrilled. And we\u2019re in the first floor, it\u2019s really -- I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be here. We are looking forward to having you all visit us there. Okay, let\u2019s get right to it. You can see from our results, we had an exceptional third quarter. Revenue rose to more than $2.1 billion, up 27% in constant currency from a year ago. You know already, there is no other top 10 software company delivering that 27% number. And what I am really excited about is we expect to deliver more than $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018. I think we initiated guidance at $10.15 billion at the high end of our range. And now, we are setting our sights on our next goal, $20 billion. Look, no other software company, no enterprise software company\u2019s delivering this kind of growth at this scale, size, and we are already off to a great start. Deferred revenue in third quarter grew to $3.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency from a year ago. Dollar value of booked business on, off the balance sheet more than $12 billion, up 27% year-over-year. That\u2019s a great predictor for next year and why we are so aggressive about giving this incredible $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion number now because we have that $12 billion on the balance sheet, this in the deferred. So, let\u2019s talk about this. We are really well-positioned for the future. Everyone at Dreamforce saw that. We are having an incredible year. We are growing in this mid- to high-20s range and we have scaled from $4 billion three years ago to $8 billion this year. We see tremendous opportunity ahead. Now, today, we are trusted by a global community of 1 billion customers, consumers, citizens, partners and employees, and that\u2019s a huge responsibility on our shoulders. What we are excited about is serving all these incredible people all over the world with our services. And just look at our new Commerce Clouds supporting 300 million unique shoppers a month. And you saw adidas and I love this story. 10,000 pairs of easy shoes, Kanye West, you did a great job on the shoe in a single hour through the Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Thank you, Kanye, thank you adidas. That\u2019s amazing. And our Marketing Cloud processing 600 million social posts and more than 1 billion messages a day, really, really exciting, and 400 million consumers are using that service. So, you just look at customer facing apps, global Salesforce, Heroku, companies like Macy\u2019s, Toyota, and we are operating at incredible scale and now an incredible level of momentum as well. Over past several months, I have been spending a lot of time on the road with our customers. I love being with our customers and this week of course was no exception. I\u2019ll tell you what I continue to see is this incredible community that surrounds us and it\u2019s been awesome to experience that. I just went through that. I just did the Dreamforce keynote again yesterday, here in New York and just having all of these customers so excited about our future, understanding this amazing platform that we\u2019ve built, the future and B2B and B2C CRM. And you saw this come to life at our sold out Dreamforce conference in September, which was way beyond our expectations. I know a lot of the conferences this year have not delivered their results, but Dreamforce did; that was awesome. And you saw not just 170,000 people registered and everyone was there and you saw a pack, but more than 15 million joining online. That was a huge surprise for us. And at Dreamforce, you also how we\u2019re continuing to innovate with Lightning, with Einstein, it\u2019s been really, really awesome. Of course, probably the most exciting announcement at Dreamforce for a lot of our customers has been Salesforce Einstein. We\u2019ve extended our Salesforce platform, not just with this incredible UI with Lightning, not just with this incredible BI layer with Wave, but now we\u2019ve extended our Salesforce platform once again with an AI layer with Einstein and it\u2019s really world\u2019s easiest AI, that is all of these partners, all of these customers are able to easily inherit, all of the most state of the art, artificial intelligence, whether it\u2019s machine, learning machine intelligence, deep right inside the Salesforce platform through Einstein. And we\u2019re extending that Salesforce platform with amazing new capabilities, with new technologies, new talent, new platform, functionality and you saw that again this quarter where we have acquired this incredible DMP Krux extending our Marketing Cloud. And of course everybody knows, if you been around, you see how our whole Company now has 20,000 users on Quip. And of course Facebook has thousands of users on Quip and other incredible companies like electronic arts and many others have thousands of users now on Quip. And if you don\u2019t have Quip on your phone yet and you haven\u2019t experienced Quip, you should just go to the app store right now and download Quip, it will change your life. I\u2019ll tell you, you can really experience next generation productivity but live, collaborate, documents and spread sheets on our platform, integrated media. It is really cool. And Bret Taylor, Former CTO of Facebook is now with Salesforce and of course the former legendary product manager at Google Maps, he and Kevin Gibbs, co-founder did a just a beautiful job on that. Anyway, I could go on and on and on about our products and technology and on how exciting this quarter was. But let me turn it over to Keith. And Keith thanks for coming down from Boston and being here for the call. Keith Block : Thanks, Marc Thanks to everybody for joining the call. Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team and all of our key geographies and industries. We\u2019re really, really thrilled with the results. We also delivered very strong performance in large deals this quarter. Not only did we close a record number of seven figure plus transactions in Q3, but the value of those transactions grew significantly. We continue to spend a lot of time with CEOs. And at Dreamforce, our CEO summit brought together some amazing thought leaders, and they\u2019re all looking to drive a new level of innovation in their industries around customer engagement. And they recognize that they need an intelligent, customer engagement platform that will help them stay ahead of rapidly changing customer expectations. Now, this level of dialog and engagement with these CEOs of some of the most incredible companies in the world, they have put their trust in us and that has been reflected in our results. So for example, this quarter we saw huge strength in financial services, where we signed strategic agreements with seven of the premier financial services institutions in the United States, including Citi and PNC Bank. And we are very, very excited about these stories. So, let me tell you a little bit about PNC. This is a new relationship for Salesforce, and we are hoping them streamline operations across all their primary lines of businesses that they can reimagine the banking experience for nearly 11 million customers. All their retail call centers and branches will now be powered by Salesforce and that will help them respond to customers faster. And they will also use Salesforce to mobilize their corporate and institutional banking team, giving them access to customer information on the go. Salesforce also signed a strategic agreement with Citi in the quarter. And this is Citi\u2019s global consumer bank that will utilize Salesforce for all client facing personnel in their U.S. retail bank, enabling Citi to better serve clients while lowering costs and improving analytics and efficiency. It really is an incredible vision to transform the global consumer bank with a very highly differentiated customer experience. We had a landmark win with one of the world\u2019s largest consumer package goods companies who needed a complete CRM and ecommerce platform to help them transform from B2B to a B2C business. Now, I am having a lot of conversations with customers about this particular type of transformation. And this relationship was the result of excellent collaboration between Salesforce and the Commerce Cloud, which grew its comparable customer gross merchandise value by 22% in constant currency from year ago. This is an early sign of the power of our combined businesses and it is creating unmatched value. Other commerce wins in the quarter included GNC and Shiseido. Amazon is a great in the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know and in Q3 that relationship has expanded and may have even more services throughout the Company. International continues to be an important cornerstone of our growth strategy. In Europe, we had a great win with KONE, one of the world\u2019s largest elevator companies. And just last week I spoke with KONE\u2019s CEO, Henrik Ehrnrooth and his team about our partnership to transform the multibillion dollar field service industry together, very exciting. Their vision is excellent and they are using Salesforce to mobilize more than 20,000 service technicians. With real time customer information and service data from connected equipments, they will be able to provide more proactive service and response to service requests faster than ever. Telecom Argentina, also new to the Salesforce family, they selected Salesforce to power all their call centers and upgrade the in-store and online experience for more than 25 million customers. We partnered very closely at velocity to show them an integrated solution in their industry and then the testimony of the power of our industry\u2019s strategy coupled with Salesforce\u2019s ecosystem and our ability to work effectively with our partners. It is also proof positive that our ecosystem is absolutely blossoming. So, it\u2019s pretty clear that our enterprise strategy coupled with our continued operational focus is working, our investments in key industries, our partner ecosystem and our top international regions are paying off, and we are very well-positioned for strong fiscal, the remainder of the fiscal 2017. So, at this point, I would like to hand the call over to Mark Hawkins and he can share some more detail around our financial highlights for the quarter. Mark? Mark Hawkins : Thanks, Keith. And I am very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding the year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million. The Commerce Cloud is off to a great start and had an excellent quarter, contributing $49 million to total revenue after adjusting for purchase and accounting. Our dollar attrition for the third quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud, and other acquired businesses remained below 9%. Looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year. Service Cloud grew 26%, App Cloud and other grew 38%. Marketing Cloud grew 46% but then if you exclude approximately $42 million of subscription and support revenue related to Demandware, Marketing Cloud grew 21%. In our region, we delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in EMEA by growing 27% and Asia Pac by growing 29%. Now, before I move on to cash flow and deferred revenue, I want to remind you that invoicing seasonality is affecting both of these metrics. As we discussed at the last two analyst days, we continue to see an increase in the seasonality of invoicing, primarily as a result of compounding and to a lesser extent contract returning and a shift toward annual invoicing in Q4. In that context, third quarter cash flow was $154 million, down 5% over last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, up 23%. Deferred revenue includes approximately $30 million related to our acquisitions of Demandware, up from $23 million in Q2. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue was up 25% when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of about $49 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $33 million. In the quarter, approximately 80% of all subscription and support related invoices were issued with annual terms excluding Demandware. The Q3 benefit to deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth. Now, moving on to guidance. I\u2019m pleased to be raising our full year revenue guidance to $8.365 billion to $8.375 billion, despite absorbing approximately $100 million to $150 million of FX headwind this year. This implies year-over-year growth for FY17 of approximately 25%. We expect Demandware and other acquired assets to contribute about 1 to 2 percentage points of growth year-over-year. We are also raising our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.03 to $0.97 to $0.98. This raise includes $0.01 from operational outperformance and $0.01 from an investment gain in Q3 and $0.01 from an anticipated investment gain in Q4. This guide continues to imply approximately 70 basis points of full year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year. For Q4, we are initiating guidance of $2.267 billion to $2.277 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25, and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 22% to 23%. And as you heard from Marc, we\u2019re excited to deliver our first $10 billion revenue milestone next year, as we are initiating fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion. This implies year-over-year growth of approximately 21%. We plan to provide additional details about our outlook for FY18 on our fourth quarter call in February. To close, we had a strong third quarter and we are well positioned for a great finish to FY17 and this sets us up for another strong 20% plus growth year in FY18. At this time, I\u2019d like to thank all of our nearly 24,000 employees for their dedication to customer success and driving these outstanding results. And with that we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : In Q2, you noted some U.S. weakness. It looks like in Q3 that came back. I was curious if you could just talk about the performance in the U.S. and Keith you were clear that these deals were delayed not lost, did they come back in the quarter? Keith Block : Glad to answer that question. So, we did discuss on the last call that at the very end of Q2, we did have some weakness in the United States that was attributed to execution issues. And as I said on the last call, we did a very detailed and very disciplined operational review. We made some minor adjustments to our playbook and some changes down the ranks. And I am very, very pleased with the results. This is a high-performing team, it\u2019s been a very high-performing team for number of years, and they have responded in time. As far as deals, in any given quarter, deals, I mean there is an ebb and flow, some come in, some come out. But I am very, very pleased with the execution in the quarter, particularly around these large seven figure transactions. Again, these brands are absolutely fantastic. You talk about a company like PNC Bank or Citigroup, even Amazon in the quarter, KONE, Telecom Argentina, many of these brands are world-class brands. And our performance was strong globally, across all theaters, all markets, all segments, all industry. So, again, I think it is a quarter of execution and very, very proud of how the team responded. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Can you -- I want to begin a little bit into the different clouds. Can you speak a little bit, how you saw the performance? Obviously platform was, the Sales Cloud continued to be better with the high value SKUs that you introduce. The Service Cloud moderated a little bit. Can you just kind of frame it, how you see it? And maybe, Keith, question for you here. Keith Block : Yes. So, again, we are very fortunate, based on the vision of our CEO, who is sitting right here, to have an incredible product in set of clouds that is second to none. Obviously, we\u2019re the market leader in virtually every one of these clouds and super excited about the vision that we put for our customers. And obviously based on these results, our customers are super excited as well. And they serve as the inspiration and motivation for a lot of the vision along with of course with Marc and rest of the team comes up with here. But, I\u2019ll tell you that we are very pleased with our Sales Cloud execution, we are very pleased with our Service Cloud execution. And proof positive around Service Cloud is that example I gave on KONE. This is a best in class service oriented company, even though they are industrial manufacturer. And they look to us to help them transform their business around field service, because this is a way for them to differentiate their products. Service is very strategic in their future. And it\u2019s just one example of how companies are looking at a Service Cloud. Our platform continues, our ISV strategy is very, very strong, our execution around ISVs has been very strong, which speaks to how strong the platform is. We look at Marketing Cloud as a very strong product. We look at some of these acquisitions that we\u2019ve made, the Commerce Cloud. We had a very large global CPG company and very, very recognizable brand. And that deal happened because Commerce Cloud onto itself was very compelling, but when combined with our core products, made us even more compelling to envision for that particular company. So, we love our product strategy, we love our vision, our customers obviously love our vision. This is only reinforced at Dreamforce, which was just an incredible event this year and we say it every year, but it was just incredible event. And then when you start adding things like Einstein into the mix which really is about the future, it\u2019s just becomes more and more compelling. So, we definitely have the wins at are back in our sales and we\u2019re super excited about the execution in our vision for our customers. Marc Benioff : And Keith, I just want to add to that, and I\u2019m sure everybody realizes, especially people who were at Dreamforce, this is a balanced portfolio. And we have really a balanced portfolio and what\u2019s great about that is, of course we\u2019ve talked about having a balanced portfolio geographically, we have a balanced portfolio in regard to our small and medium business, as well as our enterprise business, we also have balanced portfolio when it comes to our products. And you can see that in the numbers. Of course, Sales Cloud is one of the largest products in our industry, not just CRM but in the software industry. And to it growing at 13%, I mean, I just think that is incredible to see that reacceleration. And it\u2019s pretty awesome. And I am really excited about that. Again, we service at 29%, we saw App Cloud and other 43%, marketing 28%. But what I really focus on is that we have a balanced portfolio of offerings because as the Salesforce kind of gets different levels of comfort and by geography and by market segment, we see that shift quarter-to-quarter. But like a portfolio manager in a big institution, it\u2019s big financial institution, and they\u2019re keeping a balanced portfolio, so are we. And through that balanced portfolio, that\u2019s how we\u2019re achieving these high performance results. Keith Block : In fact, Marc, I just would like to add on to that. I really see that when you look at the entire balance portfolio Marc and you look at the growth rate that we\u2019re putting out, which nobody is doing in our industry at this size and scale, what it translates in is this whole market share thing, Marc where we gain market share, we gained 150 basis points at last report and we just continue to watch our competitors fall behind in this respect. And then lastly Marc, to your point on portfolio, 27% growth in the Americas, 27% growth in constant currency in Europe and 29% growth in constant currency in Asia Pac. Marc, I think that underscores portfolio point. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : One question for both Marks. Marc Benioff, with respect to Einstein, when is the product going to be in GA and how are you as a company going to be gearing the sales organization go-to-market strategy around Einstein? And then one for Mark Hawkins. I want to actually finish up the first question before. Marc Benioff : I think when you look at things like Einstein, you look at kind of these incredible directions, the shifts that are going on and technology, from a customer perspective, and we had an opportunity to meet with all the largest banks here in New York this week. Customer service, sales, marketing, these things -- it\u2019s going to have an incredible shift. And that is really what is just surprising to me. I don\u2019t think -- when you look back, we started this company 17, 18 years ago. And where we are now, I mean, this was unexpected. And from a technical perspective, and I went through some of those things, but whether it\u2019s our UI -- the demos that I did with customers today were entirely on my phone that was -- I\u2019ve given CEOs of Fortune 100 companies, hey, I run my whole business on my phone that surprises a lot of people. And to see the amount of information and insights that you can get from that is just incredible; and not just the UI, but business intelligence as well, I have Wave running on my phone. Mark Hawkins has Wave running on his. We both gave a Fortune 10 CEO a demo on our phones, and they just couldn\u2019t believe that. And then, I\u2019ll tell you that it\u2019s now this -- AI, artificial intelligence where everything is getting just smarter and is helping all these users to actually point the direction of success. They know where to go. That is what is so cool. And of course, we\u2019re complementing that with the speed of our platform, with this unbelievable mobility, with this productivity from Quip. I think I talked about that earlier but that\u2019s a huge game changer for our customers. This is really awesome and they see it as the integrated platform that our Company -- our customer can execute against is very motivating for them. And I think that that\u2019s really cool. And of course Einstein is a huge part of it and you\u2019re going to see Einstein of course deeply integrated in everything that we do. And customers get that Einstein is different than other AI solutions. I\u2019ve met with all the tech CEOs of course, the cloud CEOs, and they all have AI. It\u2019s table stakes AI. AI is table stakes, you all know that; everybody has got it programmatically; we\u2019ve got the best AI, no, we\u2019ve got the best AI, we\u2019ve got -- okay, fine; but have declaratively, through our platform, because we need to bring it to millions of people, not just a few -- there\u2019s only 15 million programmers in the world. We\u2019re much bigger than that. We have to bring this to people who don\u2019t code or low coders or citizen developers, need to have the power of our artificial intelligence, they need the power of mobility; that\u2019s why Salesforce platform is exciting and that our core app -- cloud like sales and service are built on it; that is a huge differentiator for us and it\u2019s -- you can see it just in our win rates and also our competitive position has never been stronger. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Mark Hawkins, I guess I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a bit about the synergies that you\u2019re starting to see or if you\u2019re starting to see synergies out of Demandware principally from a revenue perspective. And I\u2019m curious, in your Q4 guidance if you\u2019ve embedded anything additional to what you were maybe thinking three to six months ago? Keith Block : Let me just jump on that and anybody else can add in if they\u2019d like. We\u2019re so pleased with Demandware; we\u2019re so pleased to have this asset. It rounds us out, it\u2019s a unique asset\u2026 Marc Benioff : That was just good fortune. Keith Block : Oh, my gosh Marc... Marc Benioff : I mean Keith you agree, don\u2019t you? Keith Block : Yes... Marc Benioff : We can\u2019t believe it. First of all, Keith was having a company in Boston. So, [Multiple Speakers] Keith Block : He\u2019s got a big smile on his face, but Walter, I appreciate the question because\u2026 Marc Benioff : Are you wearing the easy shoes [Multiple Speakers] Walter Pritchard : I\u2019m going to go get them right now, Marc. [Multiple Speakers] Keith Block : But, Walter, I think what\u2019s interesting about this is we put out in the stub period announcement $49 million in revenue. And of course you know that it was haircut by about a third. We snapped this in and we talk about execution. Everybody has been on it. We have a great team that\u2019s been joining us. They\u2019re working in with our broader company and we\u2019re starting to see the momentum pick up. And Marc alluded to that in some of the activities but we see lots and lots of opportunity. And from a synergy standpoint, we have a plan, we can\u2019t go into a great detail on all of that about where we\u2019re going take this long-term including as you\u2019d expect Walter, lifting the company and synergies and really leveraging some of the best practices of Salesforce and some of the best practices of Demandware. So, watch this frame to come but the overall performance, I love what I see. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : One of the areas that we\u2019re seeing really nice acceleration in over the past couple of quarters has been the application platform. Anything in particular that\u2019s kicking in gear there, is it the SIs building, helping to build applications on it, is Wave starting to be a more material contributor? Can you give us any incremental color on what\u2019s really working there? And then mainly on the flip side, wondering there has been decelerating in marketing cloud. And one of the things we are hearing all about it\u2019s in the marketplace is increasing competition potentially from the alignment of Microsoft and Adobe. Is that having any of an impact on Marketing Cloud given any pressure on that business and causing the slowdown there? Marc Benioff : Well, I mean I think number one, when you look at Microsoft, we sold more CRM software this quarter than Microsoft has sold in last decade. It\u2019s just empirical. And that is what is really awesome about our performance against Microsoft. And I\u2019ll tell you also, when you look at marketing cloud, I really look at that against we have so many undeliverable products, I just -- Keith knows I feel this way, and I\u2019m going to ask Keith to come in. I really feel we\u2019re distribution constraint. We have so much products, we are in so many amazing markets whether it\u2019s sales, service, marketing, communities, analytics, application development like you talk App Cloud, whether it\u2019s commerce, whether it\u2019s IoT, whether it\u2019s productivity with Quip. And the Salesforce is going to have that full portfolio of products and they are going to move back in forth against those. And we\u2019ve seen that. Look at our results over the last five years and you are going to see that constant up and down of those clouds based on that distribution organization performance. But, Keith, you are the absolute leader of the distribution organization and you probably have unique perspective on this. Keith Block : Look, I think the bottom line is that we have an abundance of riches [ph] particularly as it relates to our product portfolio. And if I look at our field organization and the value preposition and the solutions that they can put in front of a customer, whether it\u2019s a line of business executive whether it\u2019s from an industry perspective, it is incredibly compelling. And that is really manifesting itself from these results. So, I would echo with Marc\u2019s sentiment about what people have to carry in their bag and what they can put in front of customers. I also want to go back to the part of the question around the platform and why we\u2019re seeing such great results in the platform. There is a bunch of reasons for this. And let me start with the systems integrator. I think as everybody knows, we have really emphasized the importance of having an incredible partner ecosystem and particularly over the last 3.5 years. And that has just paid dividends when you are talking about the largest SIs of the boutiques. And we still have work to do there but the team has really done a fantastic job there. But those SIs are really recognizing the value of the platform and what it can bring to their client. So that\u2019s one point I would raise. The second point that I would raise is that initially when we sell our position of products with customer, like Sales Cloud or Service Cloud, customers are overwhelmed by how incredible it is but then they realize that the power of the platform extending sales and extending service and that just lends itself to more usage adoption and utilization of the platform product. And then, finally back to my partner comment, we have had a huge emphasis on ISVs and the growth of the ISVs and making sure that we reinvigorate our app exchange. But particularly around our industry ISVs, we are seeing tremendous success. And why is that? Number one, they love our platform, they see all the capabilities, they see all the potential and they want to build mission critical applications on top of that platform. So, we do have a lot of great products in the portfolio that our sales team can deliver and our service teams can provide service to and our partners can deploy. But we also have an incredible platform and that is a lot of the secret sauce that we have in the company. Mark Hawkins : Keith, I love your comment of abundance of products, abundance of riches [ph] in that way, just adding Heroku, even on the B2C side and it\u2019s been added to all the things that you talked about. And then one of the things I see with customers is this whole notion of using force.com. And I would like to self brand and they add-on using force.com which is really need that they can do? Marc Benioff : And Keith, I think you also have to really hit on some of these specific relationships, you have the world\u2019s top SIs, you\u2019ve built phenomenal practices, heading toward $1 billion practices which is incredible for them with these unbelievable service organizations. And you and I had meetings with CEOs of these top SIs who are at other user conferences this quarter, we are not going to mention any names because the CEOs are very sensitive in this industry. But this bigger sides go into these other conferences and they say where is the energy, where is the momentum, where is the growth, where is the innovation and they are pivoting back to us. And that\u2019s exciting to us, because we can bring a large systems integrator and we have talked -- and by the way standardized on us internally, companies like Deloitte, Accenture and so many others who are building these incredible fast growing practices. And customers are paying attention to that as well. Is that right? Keith Block : Yes, these SIs, critical part of our strategy, these SIs are in the boardroom along with us and they are key influencers. In fact Marc, you and I have presented to a quite a few with their boards. Now, I don\u2019t believe that Microsoft or SAP or Oracle are being asked to present in the boards of these incredible SIs. So, it\u2019s a big part of our strategy. If you look at their growth and their practices, I mean they are exploding. And they can\u2019t get enough talent. So, they are cannibalizing the legacy practices of the companies that I mentioned earlier. Marc Benioff : So, why is that Keith, why do we have so much CEO and board level attention compared to like when we sold it, Oracle -- I never made a call to a CEO or board member. I don\u2019t know how many of those you made; you were there probably longer than I was. But just put it in perspective. Keith Block : I thinks it\u2019s very simple, these companies, these CEOs have an agenda of growth. Our story is about growth, they are imperative is about growth. And we are uniquely qualified as a company with this product portfolio and quite frankly our culture is an example of how to grow. Marc Benioff : Right, because we\u2019re a double digit grower and all these other software companies are just single digit growers, and they can\u2019t break out of that. Keith Block : Yes, it\u2019s really\u2026 Marc Benioff : And this is what these customers want; they want to be double growers. Keith Block : That\u2019s exactly right. And we have the product portfolio and the vision to help them do that. Mark Hawkins : I am smiling, Marc. I was looking at Keith, we were in Dallas, I won\u2019t mention the name. One of the biggest SIs that you talked about in the world, talking about standardizing on Salesforce. And Keith, you remember that discussion and just that all came to be and it\u2019s great to see that not only partnering with us but using. Keith Block : Yes, I mean just to that point and both of you guys have mentioned this, it\u2019s one thing to build a practice but when you also bet on your business, because you are running Salesforce to run your business. I think that speaks volumes, and all the major players do. Operator : Our next question is from a line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Hey. This question is for Marc Benioff. Marc, it wasn\u2019t long ago that you set a $10 billion target and obviously, you\u2019re going to achieve that next year based on your guidance. It does seem like you have a very good crystal ball versus others. And I guess, I am just wondering, if you were to fast forward to Salesforce hitting your new goal of $20 billion, what do you think would\u2019ve been the biggest drivers if you were to look back, which products do you think would be giving you or driving the most incremental revenue, if you had to guess? And how would you think about the margin trajectory of the Company as you surpassed that feat? Marc Benioff : Well, I really appreciate that, Heather. And I\u2019ll tell you that I really think that in my core, I think that I\u2019ll get back to my comment about that balance portfolio in our platform. It\u2019s unique, Heather, about our capability, and you know this is that we have an integrated platform. And the integrated platform is exciting, because not only is the number one Sales Cloud in the world, not only is the number one Service Cloud in the world, not only is it the number one declarative platform, but it has all of these other capabilities, mobility and AI and so forth, analytics and so forth. And so, I think that when I look at the most incredible things that our customers have done, they weave these things together in really smart and creative ways, build these, they build these apps, they deploy these things internally and they look for speed. They\u2019re looking for speed. Of course they want productivity, of course they want intelligence, of course they want mobility, they want that core platform. And that because I think we built it right and of course we\u2019ve also bought some great things that are outside of our core that we\u2019re integrating into our core like our marketing cloud, like our commerce cloud, like Quip. But with Lightning that\u2019s an incredible UI layer that no one has ever seen anything like this componentized application development UI layer, it\u2019s almost like a visual ETL. These customers are now integrating this stuff together at the UI layer and of course at the data layer, but that is what I think is going to really drive us forward. I think it\u2019s going to be our platform. And I think that when you look out, and obviously we have short-term goals around that $20 billion number, I mean you have -- I am sure you have your own model of when you think we\u2019re going to hit it. But I think that for us, we want to make sure that -- I don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019re going to double the company by, but my dream certainly is to double this -- I would just tell you, my dream is to double this Company within the next three to four years for sure. That\u2019s really important to me. Amy Weaver is here who works directly for me as my General Counsel, and she doesn\u2019t want me to go any far. Amy, do you want to comment on that. Amy Weaver : Not at all, Marc. Marc Benioff : Anything you want to say? Amy Weaver : No, I think you\u2019ve said. Marc Benioff : I think so. But obviously, we have -- we\u2019re performance oriented and we\u2019ve got a great team, we have great culture, you know that. We have a great brand reputation with our customers. We also have a transparent -- a level of transparency with you, the financial analysts and media that cover us, when you come to Dreamforce, you\u2019re untethered. We want you to go and talk to and be with our customers. And you can feel the vibe. And you know you can come to all of our events. I am going be back. In three weeks, I am going to be in Tokyo. So, please come and see, for those of you who still have not come to Japan. You really should come and see something incredible in Tokyo that we have in three weeks. And then for those of you who don\u2019t want to go Tokyo in three weeks, we\u2019re going to back here in New York for a multi-thousand person event, which is our world tour. So, that\u2019s so exciting. The world tour, Tokyo and San Francisco are on the same day for all the types of purposes. So, you\u2019re going to see a lot of market momentum this quarter as well as Keith you\u2019ve got the fourth quarter coming up, are you ready? Keith Block : Oh, I\u2019m ready Marc. Don\u2019t worry. Marc Benioff : You are working out, aren\u2019t you? [Multiple Speakers] Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel. Tom Roderick : Keith, a question for you; you made a comment that your big CPG win was driven by a customer whose desire was I think to shift from B2B more to B2C. So, can you talk a little bit more about that deal in particular and are you seeing other customers trying to make that shift? Also with your portfolio now, with Demandware and ExactTarget fully integrated, is that something they\u2019re coming to you and asking particularly for your help? Just talk a little bit more about that transition with your customer set out there. Keith Block : I love this question. So, listen, we live in a world where -- and Marc talked about this, where speed, mobility and productivity, innovation, intelligence are paramount. This has become table stakes. If you want to be part of the next wave of great companies, and if you think about the classic business problems that any consumer package goods company has right now is they have to have a connection with that end consumer. Many times they go through a retailer or distributor or whether it\u2019s a classic industrial company or whether it\u2019s a consumer package goods company like a Unilever, they want that direct connection to the consumer. So, moving that shift, keeping the B2B relationships but also establishing a new model of B2C is very critical to their future. I mean, think about -- we live in this world, we call the age of the customer. And think about cloud, mobile, social, data science, IoT, analytics and artificial intelligence, all coming together, new companies have born overnight. Barriers to entry into markets are being brought down. And if you\u2019re not thinking about the future and how you\u2019re going to engage with your customer, whether you\u2019re a B2B company or a B2C customer, you\u2019re going to be in trouble. So, this is becoming a regular dialog and even more meaningful for us at Salesforce because of the Commerce Cloud. So, this is just another part of our portfolio that really helps to complete the package around these transformations. So, it is becoming a regular part of the conversation and that particular win that I mentioned earlier. This is one of the world\u2019s greatest CPG companies in many regards and it is exactly about moving from B2B to B2C. Operator : Our next question is from line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : This question is for Marc Benioff or Keith Block. I know forecasting deal timing is awfully tough but you\u2019ve been generally pretty bullish about the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve got any different confidence level about those deals in the pipeline dropping in the fourth quarter. And I know it\u2019s very early but based on your recent customer conversations, I\u2019m just wondering if the business uncertainty is stemming from recent political events, might have any bearing good or bad on the timing of large enterprise deals closing this quarter? Marc Benioff : Okay. I think Keith and I both want to talk about that. I think there\u2019s a couple of things going on that are very important. And I want to make a few different comments. Number one, you all know that in the second quarter, we experienced bifurcated headwind which was not just in foreign exchange which came out of Brexit and the Great British pound which we\u2019ve continued to kind of suffer all year, that is our numbers would be even more incredible if we didn\u2019t -- right Mark? What have separated for foreign exchange this year? Mark Hawkins : For FY17 Marc, we had to absorb between a 100 million and 150 million headwind. [Multiple Speakers] Marc Benioff : So, number one, in that second quarter, we have this with the Brexit and the Great British pound situation and then at the very tail end of the second quarter as we discussed, we saw a little bit of weakness. And to Keith\u2019s credit, and he said this, but I think it\u2019s a very subtle. So, I think it\u2019s worth amplifying. He made a number of changes. We made a number of changes I think that really let us perform well in the third quarter because we did see the market shift a little bit in the second quarter, we told everybody that. And it\u2019s not the first time that we\u2019ve seen that in our careers. Keith and I have been through -- have been to this road even before and the selling motion had to change. I think in companies that you\u2019ve seen report in the last month or so who kind of saw or seen in that kind of market shift, they also will change in the coming quarters their selling motion because the selling motion has had to change in fiscal year 2017. We changed you can see the results incredible even with this foreign exchange headwind. So that\u2019s number one. Number two, in regards to specifically to our fourth quarter, we don\u2019t talk about this specifically but one of the reasons that we do have confidence around the fourth quarter is a certain percentage of that revenues is kind of contracts we have already signed that is we know we are going to get bookings in the fourth quarter because we have signed these agreements. And so that is coming in. And so that gives us a leg up. And then Keith has an incredible focus through the sales organization, which is as you centrally half of our Company is in sales, customer facing and that customer facing organization, which is I think the best in the world, all wants to have a great fourth quarter. And they are focused and we have made these cool adjustments. So, do you want to jus amplify any of that or augment or highlight any of that because I actually think there is a lot to learn. You and I have been coaching CEOs on how to kind of survive some of the ebb and flow because I think that we both have a lot of confidence that we\u2019re going to see a lot of exciting things happen. Keith Block : I think, there is a number of things going on here. I mean, we all know the story of the second quarter, I don\u2019t think we need to talk about that but at the last earnings call we said that we had a high degree of confidence in our Q3. And obviously we delivered the goods and we said we also had high degree of confidence in Q4 and we did make those adjustments. I do think that we -- I\u2019ll echo Marc\u2019s comments; I think that we do have the best distribution organization in the world in certainly in this industry. But it also allows us to talk to our customers about the things that they can do and adjust the way that they think about their customers and how they can sell to their customers and service to their customers and market to their customers. Marc Benioff : We\u2019re not abstracted from our customers, we are with these people every moment. Keith Block : We are and this is what\u2026 Marc Benioff : We\u2019re living with them. Keith Block : We live with them and this is what we do. Marc Benioff : And I\u2019ll tell you the other thing is and in regards to the election, I think is really important. Look, some of us many not have had the outcome that we want, some of us have the outcome we did want. In my view, it\u2019s in the past. We\u2019re moving forward and we have, at Salesforce, an open heart, we have an open mind and we also expect the best. That\u2019s what we\u2019re positive. And we talk about that in everything we do. We\u2019ve talked about how we cultivated beginners mind. You\u2019ve heard us talk about, well, it\u2019s not just in regards to running our business but even when there is an election, things have change -- yes, everything is changing but we have a beginners mind and we have a sense of optimism for the future and we\u2019re going to cultivate that optimism and we \u2018re going to manifest it into our business because that is how we operate here. We are positive people. And we are moving forward. And I have talked to now a number of customers this week, and I have met with CEOs of some of largest companies in the world this week. And in each and every case, all of them are moving forward, okay? And that is -- we all have our -- we know what we have to do and we know how to execute. So, I hope as I said the 2008 is behind us, okay? I\u2019ve said this before. I have been optimistic about 2017 on growth. I have been counter to a lot of the global economists and I am going still continue to feel positive about growth in the coming years because I really hope that 2008 tail that we\u2019re finally through it. And now that this election is also behind us and I hope absolutely for the best now for everything going forward, this is what I want in. Mark and Keith are here with us in the room here and you guys weigh in here on this. Mark Hawkins : Thank you. I\u2019d love to add on that. Because when we talk about that market, that looking forward and the view and the tail that you talked about, and Keith hit something really key building on this confidence in Q4 Keith that you talked about. But one of the things that we have chatted about and I think it\u2019s good to share on the call is when we execute the Q4, we are going to exit with a $9 billion rough run rate in terms of revenue run rate. So, we are not only achieving our plan but we are actually going to exit with a run rate of $9 billion. It\u2019s going to position us in the guidance you heard for next year is going to be $10.15 billion at the high end. So that\u2019s another really big milestone. But Marc, this guidance for the year with a confidence you have talked about also implies two other milestones we have never hit in the history of the company; one is that in this FY17, our guidance implies $1 billion plus operating margin non-GAAP milestone. This is something we have aspired to, and that\u2019s going to achieve with this particular guidance for this year, Marc. And the last thing we are going to achieve is another milestone we have never ever done which is $2 billion plus on the operating cash flow. So these are things Marc that I think quantitatively are milestone to support this idea. Keith, I don\u2019t know if you have a comment. Keith Block : Yes. Look, I think the results speak for themselves. There is a lot of dialog out there. Marc mentioned about the tail from 2008, the presidential election. Looking at the end of the day, at Salesforce, our story is about growth, our message is about growth, our products and vision inspire growth, what CEO does not like growth? And I think that says it all. So, I think we are well positioned\u2026 Marc Benioff : This is best for our employees\u2026 Keith Block : Absolutely. Marc Benioff : Our customers, for our partners, for shareholders and for our community and all the organizations that we support, we want that, we want the best for everybody. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities. Abhey Lamba : Keith, can you please discuss deal dynamics as you are seeing very strong growth in annual contract value from existing customers? Is it coming from greater penetration of various clouds, more seats or pricing or any color on what -- if you\u2019re seeing accelerated pace of adoption of multiple clouds? Keith Block : Yes. Thank you for the question. So, go back to what Marc said about a balanced portfolio and that is really what this is all about. Each of our individual clouds are best in class and together it\u2019s even more powerful, and this is a balanced portfolio. And we are out there selling solutions to real business problems and opportunities for these customers. So, it\u2019s a very balanced portfolio, it\u2019s installed base selling, it\u2019s net new customers, I mentioned a few of these who are new customers to us, company like PNC is a brand new logo and it\u2019s a pretty good brand new logo. So, we\u2019re super excited about it. So, it\u2019s just great execution with an excellent platform for customers with our consolidate selling or net new logos and positioning the solutions for growth. Operator : Our last question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much for fitting me in. Keith, you mentioned a couple times in the presentation just the breadth of your portfolio now. But you not only have a broad portfolio but you guys have been verticalizing your go to market motion at the same time. So, can you just talk to us about how differentiated it is to be able to, not only take a broad product portfolio, but also shape it in a way that you can talk about how customer service transformation differs in the financial services industry versus the telecommunications industry? To me that seems like a massive moat that\u2019s very difficult to get over, and I know you guys have been working on it for a couple years. And to me that seem to be one of the reasons maybe these bigger deals are happening at a faster cadence today versus one to two years ago. Keith Block : As you know, this is one of our core strategies that we\u2019ve trying to put in place over the last 3.5 years. It\u2019s really to speak the language of the customer and go to market by industry and make sure our messaging and our products and entire portfolio is really in many ways taking this incredible platform of products and portfolio of products and reorient them to solve the specific customer problem. In this particular quarter, we\u2019re seeing something in Q3 around financial services where again the seven of these premier financial services institutions decided to go with Salesforce as they think about their transformation. One of these deals was with a premier wealth management company. And they are going wall to wall with our financial services cloud, which is one of our first vertical products that we have ever had in the Company. And [indiscernible] since March, but this firm is going to wall to wall and that\u2019s because we are targeting a specific problem area in a specific industry. I mean you think about the Telecom Argentina solution that we partnered as part of our ecosystem, with this company like velocity, And this is transformational for the telecommunications industry. It\u2019s a huge win for both of us. And this is probably not the same sort of outcome that we would have gone, if we had not had something that was industry specific. So, whether it\u2019s the PNC story or the Citigroup story or the wealth management story that I referenced, the Telecom Argentina. We are in very early days here, whether it\u2019s organically with our products, with financial services cloud may help or whether it\u2019s with our partner ecosystem. But this is really a hand in glove strategy with our partners, our SIs, our ISVs, the way that we\u2019ve organized our field teams around going to market. And at the end of the day, all comes back to the platform because everything is built on that platform and leverages the strength of that platform. So, again I think that is the secret sauce. But this vertical and industry strategy is certainly playing off in terms of the level that we call on in the account, these are all very much CEO level sales, the mind share and market share and wallet share that we\u2019re getting as a result of speaking the language of the customer. So, we\u2019ve got some momentum here and we\u2019re excited about it. Marc Benioff : We are excited and we are going to tell you some more details about our strategy and our plans for the future, because we\u2019re right here in New Jersey at CNBC headquarters and we\u2019re about to walk into the studio with Jim Cramer. So, if you turn on CNBC, you\u2019re going to see us coming and talk to Jim. Marc Benioff : Thanks everybody. Bye, bye now. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Marc Benioff : Thank you.",

My name is Victoria and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CRM Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to John Cummings, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Cummings - salesforce.com, inc.: Thanks so much, Victoria.

A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Okay. Hey, thanks, John. And you know what, this is really an exciting call for us. I'm just going to tell you right now why we're so excited. This is our 50th quarter as a public company and we couldn't be more thrilled to be on the call with everybody today. You know, in 2004, when we went public, we had $46 million in quarterly revenue. And now in the fourth quarter alone, we delivered $2.3 billion in revenue and, for this fiscal year, we are guiding to more than $10 billion in revenue. I just had the opportunity to review the financial numbers and details, as I'm sure all of you have, and when you look at operating cash flow up 50% year-over-year at these extraordinary rates to $706 million or that we now have $14.5 billion of book of business on and off the balance sheet, up 28%, I mean, is just beyond our expectations. We're absolutely thrilled with the performance of the company and these are clear financial indicators of how well we're doing and also how well we're going to do in the future. Look, I'm incredibly grateful to our employees, our customers, our board members, our shareholders, the Salesforce community, all of our stakeholders over the last 18 years have been on this path together with us, thank you to each and every one of you for everything that you've done for us. We are absolutely grateful. And I am extremely proud as well with this amazing recognition that we received from Fortune Magazine which ranked Salesforce as the 20th most admired company in the world. That is something we could have never anticipated and the number one work place for giving back. So thank you very much for that. Now, we've proven over last 18 years that a company can do good and also \u2013 do good in the world and also do well and I'm going to go through some of our fourth quarter financial highlights to get to some of these incredible numbers. Revenue for the quarter rose to nearly $2.3 billion, that's up 27% year-over-year. It's amazing and, of course, this has not been an easy foreign exchange environment this year, has it, Mark? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: It's not, for sure. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: So those numbers would be even higher if we did not see things that have happened in Brexit and pressure on the Great British Pound. So also just amazing how we saw revenue for the full fiscal year was nearly up $8.4 billion, up 26%. Incredible. No other enterprise software company of our size and scale is growing at this rate and we've continued to balance this top line growth with improvement in non-GAAP operating margin, which I'm going to have Mark talk a little bit more about in just a second. Deferred revenue grew to more than $5.5 billion, up 29%. Pretty awesome. And dollar value of book business on and off the balance sheet now more than $14.5 billion. I just touched on that. I'm sure that you all realize that means that we've added more than $3 billion since last year. So, now, looking ahead to fiscal year 2018, you can see why we are raising to $10.2 billion at the high end of our range and this incredible fast growth is a result of how we are uniquely addressing the needs of more than 150,000 of our customers from around the world, building a single view of their customers, and no company like this has ever been created before, company and enterprise software singularly focused on the customer. No other company has 25,000 employees solely focused on CRM and helping to build deeper and more intelligent relationships with their customers. We are so well positioned for the future. We're the clear leader in the fastest-growing enterprise software segment, CRM, and here's something kind of amazing. CRM, I'm sure you saw this incredible report from Gartner. The enterprise software marketplace is really sliced into four key pieces : one, operating systems, which are in decline; two, ERP, which is slightly up; databases, slightly up; and CRM, which is now by 2020 will be the largest segment of the enterprise software market. That's incredible. We're the largest player in that market, and we're also the leaders in our core markets in that sector in sales, in service, in marketing, in commerce and platform. We're exiting fiscal year 2017 with the strongest portfolio of products we have ever had, including some amazing technology and teams that we have also been able to bring under our wing over the last year, including these great organizations like Demandware and Krux and Quip. Okay. I can tell you I've never been more excited about the future, and we are really well positioned to take advantage of this very, very fast growing CRM market as this quarter results indicate, and you're going to hear now Keith talk about some amazing customer wins. Now, before we go down to Keith and the customer success stories, I want you all to mark down March 7. March 7, in only a week, we are going to have a worldwide webcast to 2 million of our customers and users, and it's going to come to you from our new building at Salesforce East in San Francisco. And that will be right next to Salesforce Tower that I'm sure a lot of you've seen. It's rising high in the sky here in the city. And if you can come to March 7, you're going to see some amazing customer announcements, product announcements, partnership announcements, and we have got some incredible stuff to talk to you about. So we'll hopefully see you in one week here in San Francisco, and you're going to also see the latest in what we're talking about with Einstein, with our spring and summer 2017 product releases. And some of our largest customers are going to be there as well talking about some of their expansions, some that we're talking about on the call here and others that we're holding until March 7. So you can catch some news a week from now on Salesforce as well. Okay, Keith. Go ahead. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: All right. Thanks, Marc. Obviously, this was an exceptional quarter. Salesforce is the fastest-growing top five enterprise software company in the world, and this year, we expect to deliver more than $10 billion in revenue. And that will reach the milestone that we've been talking about, about being faster than any other enterprise software company in history to that $10 billion mark. In FY 2017, we drove tremendous execution, growth of scale and delivered unprecedented customer success. And we did this while integrating Demandware, our largest acquisition ever, launching innovative new products, including Einstein, and adding more than 5,000 employees. When I joined Salesforce nearly four years ago, Marc and I put together a plan to become more strategic to our customers and to become more of an enterprise skilled company, and that plan really had three parts to it. Number one was the focus on industry. This is all about speaking the language of the customer and bringing industry expertise and launching industry products in the marketplace. The second was expanding our international reach to serve our global customers. Very, very important. And the last was building the world's strongest ecosystem in the cloud, and that was with our SI partners and our ever-expanding ISV community. Well today, we have strategic relationships with the largest and most successful companies in the world. We're inspiring companies of all sizes, all industries and all geographies. We have clearly become the trusted advisor to our customers for their digital transformations. All of this is translating to our results, including a record number of big transactions. In fact, we hit a huge milestone this fiscal year which we're incredibly proud of, and that was achieving 100 $10 million-plus relationships on an annual basis and the number of $20 million-plus relationships has nearly doubled in just one year. Pretty incredible progress. Now, let's talk about some of the highlights in the quarter, starting with our industry strategy, again one of our growth pillars. We had strong growth in Q4 in all of our target industries. In fact, the largest deal in the quarter was a massive expansion with one of the world's leading CPG brands based in Europe using Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud to deliver personalized consumer experiences. We expanded our relationships in Q4 with three of the five largest CPG companies in the world, all of them running on Salesforce. And, as you recall from last quarter, our momentum is continuing in financial services. In Q4, we expanded relationships with U.S. Bank, SunTrust, TD Bank and many, many more. We're also building on a very strategic relationship with Farmers Insurance. Now that's from our early days in helping them modernize their customers' self-service to bringing more synergy across their customer, agent, employee and partner channels. Healthcare continues to be strong for us. In Q4, we expanded relationships with Anthem, athenahealth and one of the largest healthcare companies in the United States, Humana. And just a quick update on Financial Services Cloud and Health Cloud. It's been less than a year since they've been GA and we've already seen great traction. In fact, more than 70% of customers who have purchased one of these industry solutions are net new logos to Salesforce in this fiscal year. So all of these are proof positive around the power of speaking the language of the customer. Now on to international, our second growth strategy. Each of our regions grew more than 25% in constant currency for the full year. In fact, EMEA and Asia Pac both grew 29% year-over-year in constant currency. So today, nearly 30% of our revenue is outside of the Americas and this represents a huge, huge growth opportunity for us. And we'll continue to accelerate our international expansion to meet our customers' demand and I fully expect our revenue mix to be more balanced over time. And this is, again, something that we're very, very focused on and very excited about. Now to that end, we expanded relationships in Q4 with some amazing brands like Shell, Michelin, Emirates and Maersk in Europe. We drove strong financial services momentum as well, again, in the industry with 5 of the top 15 banks in Europe this quarter including Banco Santander and BCC, again, all running their business on Salesforce. We had other huge international wins in the quarter with BRF, Latin America's largest food company, also with the Japanese Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Tax and Fujisoft, all in Japan. So great progress, again, on the international front. As far as partner momentum, we continue to strengthen our partner ecosystem. In fact, we are seeing partners grow their Salesforce practices by more than 50%. Today, every single one of the top five SIs in the world run their business on Salesforce. A great example of this is Deloitte. We have an incredible partnership with them. In the quarter, they expanded their relationship with us, rolling out sales, service, analytics and of course, the Salesforce platform. We're also seeing strong momentum in our ISV community and the innovation around our platform in that community. In fact, today nearly 90% of the Fortune 100 are running apps from the AppExchange and these are apps that are being installed by customers at a rate of more than one per minute every single day, which is pretty incredible. Now before I wrap up, I want to say how proud I am of the company and our ability to integrate more than a dozen acquisitions in FY 2017 while still delivering really record-breaking results. And look, this operational excellence, it's already paying off. We're driving incredible value and innovation for our customers. In fact, this quarter, we had a huge set of Commerce Cloud wins with Levi's and The Gap and YETI and many, many others. And Commerce Cloud grew customer gross merchandise value by 26% in constant currency from a year ago, again, an acceleration from Q3. So look, in summary, I would tell you that no other technology company is building the relationships that we are. We are driving incredible innovation. We're bringing huge value to our customers. We continue to inspire our customers. We continue to paint a vision for their success, and as I said, we are executing at scale across every part of the company and delivering success for our customers better than anybody else in the world. And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we delivered another year of strong financial performance in FY 2017 with outstanding top-line growth, continued operating margin expansion and excellent cash flow. And over the last three years, we've actually doubled our revenue, we've increased our non-GAAP operating margin by more than 400 basis points, which has translated into nearly a tripling of our free cash flow. And I'm especially pleased with our cash flow performance and operating margin improvement even as we've been making critical investments in our long-term growth. Now let me discuss Q4 and FY 2017. Q4 revenue grew 27% in dollars and 28% in constant-currency excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately $30 million. For the full year, the revenue grew 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, with the revenue from companies that we acquired in FY 2017 contributing approximately 2.5% to year-over-year top-line revenue growth. Driving this strong top-line growth was the performance of our portfolio cloud throughout the year. A couple of highlights. Sales Cloud grew 13% for the full year, becoming the first $3 billion cloud. Service Cloud grew 20% for the full year. Platform and Other grew 39% for the full year and Marketing Cloud, excluding Demandware and Krux, grew 25% for the full year. Our Demandware performed strongly in the first six months, contributing approximately $63 million in revenue for the quarter and $120 million for the year. And note this was at the high end of our initial guidance despite adjustments due to purchase accounting. Dollar attrition for the fourth quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses, remained below 9%. Before I turn to cash flow and balance sheet, let me spend some time on margins. Full-year non-GAAP gross margins were down 126 basis points over last year primarily due to revenue adjustments due to purchase accounting, increased investments in acquired companies and thirdly, a slightly higher mix of professional services revenue due to a large increase in our strategic transactions. Despite this, our full-year non-GAAP operating margin was up 78 basis points over last year and slightly ahead of our prior guidance of approximately 70 basis points. These results included a headwind of approximately 150 basis points related to FX and the acquisition of Demandware. This operating margin improvement helped drive a record cash flow for Salesforce as we delivered more than $2.1 billion in operating cash flow, up 29% over last year. This translated into an operating cash flow yield of 25.8%, which was slightly higher than FY 2016. Given that cash flow is my number one priority, I'm very pleased with these results considering the headwinds from both FX and M&A activity. CapEx for the year was $464 million or approximately 5.5% of revenue. This was primarily driven by leasehold improvement and a continued investment in data centers globally. For FY 2018, we anticipate CapEx to be between 4% to 6% of revenue, which was in the lower range than in prior years. Deferred revenue grew by 29% in dollars and in constant currency, ending the quarter at $5.54 billion. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue had an FX tailwind of approximately $23 million. Demandware contributed approximately $49 million to deferred revenue in Q4, up from $30 million in Q3. Before I move on to the guidance, a quick reminder regarding seasonality and the impact on operating cash flow and deferred revenue. As we shared with you at the last few Analyst Days, invoicing seasonality continues to deepen. This Q4 was especially strong from an invoicing standpoint. In fact, the sequential change to deferred revenue in Q4 was 59%, up from 45% three years ago. This contributed to the outperformance in cash flow and deferred revenue in the quarter. Moving on to guidance. Coming off a record portfolio, we are pleased to be raising our full year FY 2018 revenue guidance to $10.15 billion to $10.2 billion for 21% to 22% growth year-over-year. This includes approximately $125 million to $150 million of FX headwind. We're also initiating our FY 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $1.27 to $1.29. In context, we expect to deliver approximately 125 basis points to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY 2018. Keep in mind this continued integration of Demandware along with FX headwinds of approximately 50 basis points is expected to slightly pressure our operating margin in fiscal 2018. This margin improvement will help us drive another strong year of operating cash flow and we expect year-over-year growth of 20% to 21% and an operating cash flow yield similar to FY 2017. Let me quickly touch on non-GAAP tax rates. We previously said we would reevaluate this rate annually and/or if a significant event occurs that may materially affect this rate. As we become more profitable, which is a good thing, especially internationally, we expect our long-term tax rate to decrease. And as a result, we are lowering our fixed \u2013 our long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate to 34.5% for FY 2018. For Q1, we're expecting revenues of $2.34 billion to $2.35 million, year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 22% to 23% and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.25 to $0.26. A few quick notes on our Q1 guide. First, you will recall that in FY 2017 was a leap year. As a consequence, we have one fewer day of revenue in the first quarter of FY 2018. At our current scale, that one day of revenue represents approximately $25 million, which is reflected in our Q1 guidance. Bear in mind this is purely a timing issue and has no impact on the full year of revenue guidance. Secondly, due to the acquisition-related margin pressures in the first half, we expect our FY 2018 profitability EPS to be a bit more of second half-weighted than in prior years. And thirdly, as we discussed, due to continued deepening of our invoice seasonality, we expect the sequential change on deferred revenue from Q4 to Q1 to be a bit steeper than in prior years which is not unexpected. So to wrap up, we had an outstanding quarter and that drove a strong finish to an outstanding 2017. We delivered our third consecutive year of non-GAAP operating margin improvement, even in the face of FX and M&A headwinds. We delivered our first-ever $2 billion operating cash flow and going forward, we will continue to focus on improving our GAAP \u2013 our non-GAAP operating margin cash flow while balancing our investments required to ensure growth, customer success and shareholder value. On that, I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, thank you very much. Congrats on a spectacular finish to the year. My question is for Marc Benioff. I wanted to ask you about the acceleration that we're seeing in the Sales Cloud. It does seem rare to see a revenue stream that is so large accelerate like this. And so I'm wondering what you think might be breathing new life into the Sales Cloud, whether it's the Lightning UI upgrades or the layering on of artificial intelligence capabilities or perhaps the pricing environment and competitive environment is becoming less intense or something else? And if I may, I have a quick follow-up for Mark Hawkins. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, thanks so much. Sales Cloud has become one of the very largest software products in the entire industry. And of course all by itself, I think it's probably the largest cloud computing company. Is that right, Mark? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: It is. It's over $3 billion, Marc. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah. It's over $3 billion. So that's bigger than \u2013 Sales Cloud is bigger than what Workday, ServiceNow, NetSuite... Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Correct. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Better than Oracle's entire cloud business, that type of thing. So \u2013 but anyway, yes, Sales Cloud is amazing, and it has reaccelerated, you're right, you've seen the numbers. And you're also right, it has to do with \u2013 we've completely rebuilt our Sales Cloud and not just a user interface with Lightning, not just an incredible new CPQ platform with SteelBrick. Of course you saw today, Salesforce1, which is the mobile extension of Sales Cloud, won the Mobile App for Businesses of the Year at Mobile World Congress that exceeds our expectation, but it really demonstrates that Sales Cloud works incredibly well in the mobile environment, the best business mobile app. Pricing, as you know, last year, we enhanced our pricing and made changes based on customer feedback. That's been received incredibly well. And you saw that we introduced our Dreamforce Einstein, which is giving Salesforce artificial intelligence and giving Sales Cloud artificial intelligence. And that gives our customers the ability to take this incredible power of machine intelligence, machine learning, deep learning. And it's available now inside Sales Cloud; that's incredible for our customers. So there's no other Salesforce automation solution in the world that's as successful as Sales Cloud, has the market share of Sales Cloud, has the growth of Sales Cloud, but also is as innovative and competitive as Sales Cloud. It has, after 18 years, remained number one in innovation and capability. That is incredible. And as I pointed out, with this acceleration that is going on in the CRM market, I think that that's part of it. So if you look at that Gartner Chart, they published dividing up operating systems, databases, ERP and CRM, you can see CRM has accelerated because Salesforce automation is an essential part of CRM that's also accelerating, and we have this incredibly innovative product. So we're all set up on Sales Cloud. I hope that answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot. This is also for Marc Benioff and congrats for me as well. Just as you think about Einstein, it's now in-market on Sales Cloud. Maybe you could just touch on how we should expect to see the artificial intelligence get rolled out across sales and marketing and other parts of the platform? And what sort of timing should we expect to see that happen in? Thanks. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, we actually have already begun the rollout of Einstein into all of our clouds and we have made a number of announcements, but we've also released products. And our customers in our spring release have this capability embedded inside many of those clouds, including Sales Cloud, including Marketing Cloud, including Commerce Cloud. And you saw the announcement last week on Service Cloud and Service Cloud Einstein. That's so exciting to see this intelligence start to move across. Einstein is an incredible AI capability and I mean I have to tell you one amazing story. We're going to talk about this more next week and to encourage all of you to come to the March 7 event or watch it on video. But we had a call from a major customer of ours. They're a CPG company and they have a big issue. And the issue that they have is in their stores, they have a lot of shift happening on inventory and they also have a competitive situation as well. They want to know what's going on. They want to know if competitive products are ending up in their shelves, which is supposed to be merchandised only with their own proprietary products. So we showed them just by using a cell phone camera and using Einstein and our deep learning capabilities which have benchmarked, I think, as high as many of the other AI clouds. I'm sure many of you are following that work. Well, all of a sudden, what we showed them was with a simple camera, they're able to do real-time inventory analysis of their retailer shelves and they're able to, based on that analysis that's happening from those cameras, understand the competitive environment, number one. Number two, understand their own environment, and number three, when they are seeing a level of depletion on the shelves that they want to replace, they can just roll trucks automatically using Salesforce Einstein. And of course that also can create customer service cases. It can create sales opportunities automatically, automatically with no one else involved. So all of a sudden, salespeople and service people and marketing people and even truck drivers are all alerted to changes that are happening in the retail environment, which up to this point haven't really been monitored very well and certainly not efficiently. But that's kind of what AI and Einstein are giving us now in the current state of play. That is with a very low-cost camera, coupled with Einstein, gives us incredible intelligence into their customers' environment. Their customer is the retail store. So this vision of the future that AI is going to make our customers more successful, this is playing out now. It also helped us close a very large deal in the fourth quarter, as you'll hear about March 7. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. This is another one for Marc Benioff. Marc, you launched Analytics obviously a few years ago and at Dreamforce this past year, Alex sounded as if that product had found the right mix of capabilities at the right price points. Can you share with us how you see this opportunity being layered into your installed base? And what's your expectation of traction in this regard for the coming fiscal year? Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well thanks, Heather. Analytics had a great year. We're very excited about the Analytics offering. We have had this product now in the market for about two years and this is really \u2013 I'm speaking really about our Analytics Cloud sales and our Wave platform, which now you know that we've also augmented and extended with Einstein. Now that really changed the game on Analytics. Now I'll just tell you that how I run my own business has dramatically changed based on this product and that is very simple that we have, like a lot of companies, every Monday we all sit together, about 20 of us, and we go through how the quarter is doing and what the major issues are in the company. It's our staff meeting. And there's one extra seat left at the table and that's not for Elijah. The extra seat that we're leaving is for Einstein and that chair which has a little Einstein doll in it, I turn to in the meeting and I can say, Einstein, tell me how is the quarter doing? Usually I have to say that to Keith Block, okay, but now I have Einstein who goes back and looks at all of our fiscal year results over a long period of time, looks at all of our account executives, opportunities and deal flow, look at all of our global pipeline and then all of a sudden says, well yes, you're going to make the quarter, or no, you're going to exceed the quarter by $10 million or you're going to miss the quarter by $10 million. And I can tell you, it's kind of a funny story because this quarter, which is the first quarter that we're using Einstein which is based on sales, this incredible Salesforce Analytics Cloud with Wave and Einstein and this guidance capability. Well all of a sudden, one of our sales managers who was actually doing fine in the quarter and was forecasting in the month, in the Monday meeting saying, oh, I'm going to have a fine quarter. I'm going to have a fine quarter. Well Einstein started to say, no, actually. This is actually, I'll tell you what it's kind of a funny story because he actually made his number and had a world-class quarter, which was our European business. It said to about our European business, well Einstein said, well very sorry, but you're not going to make your number this quarter. You're going to miss by $10 million, okay, approximately. So this really got him upset actually. And I think that it kind of spurred him into action a little bit because it was said because of this variable is not right and this isn't right and this isn't right, you're going to have this result. And all of a sudden, he became kind of, I would say, inspired and went out there and he had a great quarter. Maybe he would have had a great quarter anyway, but this is a new player at the management, on the management team, Salesforce Einstein. This is really coming out of this AI Cloud. Now we could not have anticipated this three years ago when we built Wave. Now Wave has had a huge secondary game because in our core platform and I have that first question on Sales Cloud, well, it's not just Lighting and AI and CPQ and Salesforce1 and pricing within Sales Cloud. Also we have this incredible analytics capability, our baseline analytics which is better than ever built into Sales Cloud. And our customers have never been as satisfied with our core capabilities and dashboards and reporting and now artificial intelligence. That's analytics. And then we of course have our Analytics Cloud which I believe is the most competitive and most exciting and most innovative analytics cloud in the CRM market. So I'm very excited about it. I believe it will continue to be a good strong growth driver for the business and it's still an early product. It's hard because when you have a product like Sales Cloud doing $3 billion and a product like Service Cloud which is doing how much now, Mark? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: $2.5 billion. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: $2.5 billion and then you have Marketing Cloud doing... Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Approaching $1 billion. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: $1 billion, then you have a new product that you kind of built organically internally kind of coming up. It's hard to give it as much of the limelight with the technology and the customer acceptance and how we use it internally has been awesome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the spectacular finish. One for Keith. If you could talk about the tweaks that you're contemplating on the go-to-market side given that we had an infusion of some fantastic technology in acquisitions in the past 12 months? And one for Benioff, how do you think, Marc, that AI would allow you to go upsell back in an install base? Can you just quantify how that might play out? And thirdly, for Mark Hawkins, not to leave you off, but as you execute Marc's plans to double the size of the company, how should we be thinking about the margin profile? Is there a nonlinear element of the margin growth in the next three to four years as you get scale? Thank you very much. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah. Kash, hi, it's Keith. So thank you for the complex multipart question. I'll lead off with this part. So as you know, we did a dozen plus acquisitions in FY 2017; the integration has gone incredibly well as we continue to operate the company at scale and growth. We have a standard template and process when we integrate these companies in all lines of business. So for example, in the go-to-market business aspect of the company, we try to keep these companies together because we want to incubate them. We want to grow them. We want to nurture them. We want to bring them into our culture, but we also want to make sure that we allow or we put them in a position where we can attach to the install base and the customer. So they can get the power of Salesforce when they come into the company. We've seen some great success. A good example of that is the Demandware acquisition, now called Commerce Cloud. The GMV growth was excellent. We signed up some great business in the quarter. But it's \u2013 because we have a standard model from an operational perspective on how we bring these companies in so that we minimize disruption and we try to get them to hit the ground running as fast as we can. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Let me take the second one in terms of the operating margin as we go to take the company forward, Kash, happy to talk about that. One of the ways to think about the operating margin is number one, we'll be thinking about it consistent with our revenue, operating margin framework and that will guide us as we continue to absolutely propel forward the growth and also expand the operating margins and drive the cash flow at the same time. One of the things that's interesting though, Kash, about your question then is \u2013 if that's the forward-looking kind of thought about it, let's look at this year. And this year, it's really effectively been in the middle of the framework when you take 78 basis points of year-on-year improvement, and if you think of 150 basis points of headwind that we took, those things we kind of think about a few of those together in 2017. But going forward, again, we'll be \u2013 we'll certainly be committed to the framework. And you can certainly see what we've done in the last three years when you talk about doubling the company cash. The last time we did it, if you think about 2017 \u2013 2014 to 2017, we literally doubled the revenue of the company. We increased operating margins by approximately 430 basis points while nearly tripling the free cash flow. So you can see what we've done in the past. You can see what our most recent year is. And you can see the framework to guide us forward for the future. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, I really appreciate the other question about Einstein. And I thought we should bring Einstein on to the earnings call and we'll let Einstein answer that for you. No, we're not going to do that. But that would be a good part of it, wouldn't it? So yeah, Einstein is an upsell opportunity into the install base, but that's not our primary goal with it. For some of our customers, they will receive Einstein as part of their platform. For other of our customers, they will pay for Einstein. But I think the most important part of Einstein for us is its differentiation against other CRM products. Now that Salesforce has shipped Einstein into its core platform and released it to its customers worldwide and now that so many customers are using Einstein and we have so many exciting stories about Einstein which is only going to accelerate through the year, Salesforce is the only CRM platform in sales, service, marketing and commerce and community and analytics, as I mentioned, that has this deep artificial intelligence capability available to it. And that is going to accelerate this year, not only in innovation, but also in customer use. And I know how much customers love this platform and how much they're going to use it going forward. Mark, do you want to add to that? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: I think the Einstein is just for me personally super-interesting, Marc, because as you know, I use Wave all across the company. I instrument literally every aspect of finance that you can think with Wave. I probably legitimately have more than 50 dashboards. And I think about, Marc, some of the application of Einstein to each one of those dashboards. So as a big use case for a Fortune 500 company, I just see a really interesting opportunity going forward with Einstein. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Keith, do you want to add any thoughts about what you're seeing with customers in Einstein? Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, I think that the \u2013 I think it's pretty clear that customers \u2013 the company over the last 18 years has had an incredible vision and consistently has delivered new innovation to the marketplace. Obviously, pioneer in cloud, and bringing Sales Cloud to the market 18 years ago was a great start. It was a first act. Many companies never get beyond that first act. We've gotten beyond the first act, the second act, the third act, the fourth act, and we're well into our fifth act-plus around innovation and Einstein is certainly a great example of that. If I looked at use cases for Einstein, overall, I would tell you that this is really bringing insight to action across sales and service and marketing and commerce, if you think about opportunity insights or account insights, predictability scoring, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, I can go through every one of the lines of business. But at the end of the day, yet again, you're painting a vision for our customers and providing them with a very compelling technology to get insights about their customers and what sort of use cases that that technology can be applied to. So every customer that I've spoken with is hugely excited about the potential for Einstein and what it means to their business models and their business. And we're just starting to see the beginning of it. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: And I think you're going to see that next week when we introduce you to several of these customers who completed extremely large transactions with us and increased their strategic relationship with us, and many of those are based on Einstein. And we want to hold back some of those demonstrations and review that \u2013 reveal some of those technologies and deals so that we can really emphasize them appropriately. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. This question is for Mark Hawkins. Mark, I had a question on the Q1 DR guide and hence the implied billings guide. Mark, this always happens when you post a big 4Q DR number. But the math means that the sequential DR decline is large and it obviously has the effect of making billings growth look perhaps less than what some investors wanted. Is that merely this sequential DR math dynamic at work maybe made a little bit worse by this steady increase in 4Q/1Q seasonality, which you've been flagging for a while, or is there anything else that you could call out? Thank you. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: I really appreciate the question, Karl, and I think you've absolutely nailed it. I think we \u2013 as you said, we've been calling this out for years, and you can see the mathematical symmetry of what's happening. And again, our thesis is that other companies that eventually get to the scale, as such, companies will see this similar kind of phenomena, Q4s get bigger and bigger for lots of reasons. It's our biggest renewal quarter; it's our biggest new book of business quarter. People want to consolidate their deals as they continue to grow their strategic relationship with Salesforce, which is happening, as Keith had called out, and so you can see exactly what he talked about. Our DR was very strong. In Q4, we had very strong invoicing, very strong demand. And that, of course, has the effect of the sequential growth goes higher and higher and then in the next Q1, it goes lower and lower. Very mathematically symmetrical to what we would've expected. But really the sound bite on this thing, separate from the leap year which we called out last year, just to make sure people have that reminder, is fundamentally our demand environment is exactly as Keith and Marc have described and I've described is very strong. We just finished a really strong year and, as a result, raised our guidance for the whole year. And that is really the point that we're trying to make, but I think you understand it perfectly, Karl. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. Marc or Keith, how would you categorize what percentage of your Salesforce is currently fully trained to sell Service Cloud? And given that this market has five to six times more seats than Sales Cloud, what kind of share do you think you can get over time in the market? Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah. So, hi, it's Keith, let me take this. So, look, we put a premium on what we refer to as enablement, right? We bring a lot of people into the company, 5,000-plus people this year. And we spend an incredible amount of focus time making sure that our people \u2013 all of our people are brought up to speed on the features and functions of any of our cloud, take Service Cloud as an example since it's the one that you asked about. And we take advantage of some amazing technology; Trailhead is an example, so we're making sure that we can bring people up to speed and hit the ground running very quickly. So this is an ongoing thing. We don't just train somebody once and then that's it. There's no end of job when it comes to the training and enablement. As I said, I think it's one of the reasons why we're so different than the rest of the marketplace in terms of the effectiveness of our go-to-market teams. And specifically on Service Cloud, look, we're the market leader, okay? So we had amazing growth. The Magic Quadrant. We're the market leader of the Magic Quadrant with Gartner, if you take a look at that. This is a $2.5 billion run rate business. It is \u2013 after Sales Cloud, it is the largest cloud, I guess you could say, company in the world in terms of size and scale. And again, we're taking market share. We're number one in the marketplace. So we've got incredible capabilities. We continue to improve the product. We're enabling our sales teams and our customers' success teams, and I think it shows up in our results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks guys, for taking my question. Just actually one question for Mark Hawkins, just a sort of a point of clarification. Unfortunately, the conference call I think broke up when you were giving the high end of your margin expectations for this year and it wasn't in the transcript, either. So wonder if you could reiterate that. And then sort of a follow-on for both Keith and Marc off of that. Obviously, you've gotten questions about upsell, cross-sell and just the framework you've given for margin. But as you increasingly attach, as Keith, you were just talking about, Service Cloud or Marketing Cloud, which is one that I'd particularly like you all to double-click on. How are you thinking about that as far as just sort of where you are in that process in terms of just training up the sales force to do that? And then how is that contributing to leverage and the framework, just call it, more attach of clouds per customer? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Got it. Well let me, Keith has something, then I'll kind of tag team on this. Let me just address that. First of all, Phil, thank you for alerting me that it broke up during that. Our, pleased to report that in addition, our revenue, taking that up to $10.2 billion for the year. The operating margin, we've expanded it from 125 basis points to 150 basis points for fiscal year 2018. And that is despite the fact that we expect 50 basis points of pressure associated with FX. So we're still going to take it up between 125 and 150 irrespective of that additional 50 basis points of pressure, Phil. Point number one. Point number two, Keith, I think he's asking a little about cloud, cross-sell and opportunities from that standpoint, and if you want to address that, then I'll talk about the margin at the end. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah. Let me talk about that. So we're in an enviable position where we're a market leader in every cloud that we make and produce and bring to the market, and that drives incredible amounts of customer success into the marketplace for our customers. And that is where we are laser-focused. And when we go to market, we go to market on a solution basis, which is typically a multi-cloud solution. So that could be by industry, that could be by line of business. But when I think about, for example, the top 10 deals in the quarter, I can tell you that 8 of the top 10 deals in our quarter in Q4 had multi-cloud solutions. So that means it wasn't just Sales Cloud. It was Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, or it was Marketing Cloud and communities, or it included Analytics, et cetera. So again, customers are buying solutions. They buy solutions because they're looking to solve a business problem, and we are uniquely positioned to solve those business problems in the marketplace as it relates to customer engagement. So we're in a great product position. We have an excellent execution strategy which I outlined in the call earlier. And yeah, just to give you an example, I talked a lot earlier about the level of relationships that we're establishing with these customers. When I talked about achieving this goal of 100 $10 million-plus relationships and doubling the number of $20 million-plus relationships, just to put that into perspective, if you go back to \u2013 I joined the company back in FY 2014 \u2013 and again, I had the privilege of working with an amazing team and an amazing company. But to put that in perspective, fast forward to where we are today. We have three times, three times the $10 million-plus relationships with customers than we had back in FY 2014. We have five times the $20 million-plus relationships that we had back in FY 2014. Well, how did that happen? Well, it happened because we had a compelling vision. It happened because we had a multi-cloud portfolio that added a lot of value, incredible value, that allowed these customers to drive digital transformation and engage with their customers in entirely new ways, in unprecedented ways. So there is an incredible amount of opportunity on an attach basis across all of our clouds. We're seeing more and more demand for it, and we are uniquely positioned to provide that for our customer base. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: And I think this is really kind of get back to the upsell comment before, which is in terms of upsell and cross-sell and kind of selling these CRM cocktails. When we're going in to a customer, I think it's important that we are talking to them about what are they trying to accomplish with their customers. We're not there to sell them the Salesforce automation solution or a service solution or marketing or platform. I think our first question is, tell us about your customer strategy. How are you going to connect with your customers in a whole new way? How are you going to build a one-to-one relationship with your customer? How do you create more collaboration across your enterprise and with your partners and with your customers? How do you build communities with your customers? And I think through these probing and question answering and really asking these questions in the customer's language, specific by vertical, that is, we're trying to speak to the customer these questions in their own language. And that's an incredible transformation that Keith has led over the last four years. And you can see that now when we talked about we've got five of the top five banks, five of the top five systems integrators. When we talked about Deloitte, you know who all the other systems integrators are, and they're all using Salesforce. You look at the top tech companies who aren't our specific head-to-head competitors, they are using our products. You look at the media companies. And that's very exciting what has happened, this transformation of Salesforce. And we're not just selling them SFA. We're selling them a broad set of solutions. Einstein is a huge differentiator. Mobility is a huge differentiator. Platform is a huge differentiator, because our competitors just don't offer these capabilities. They just don't have it. And I think that that has really become an incredible thing in this cross cloud vision which is a vision we've had for a long time, but I think we're executing it now better than ever. And when we look at these very large customers getting much, much larger with us, it's because they're embracing all of our clouds. They trust us. They know we're going to make them successful. We're there for them. We're deeply committed to our customers and we're going to deliver success for them, which means, for them, growth. They want customer growth and that's what we're going to deliver and I think you say that's really what we're talking about. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Absolutely. I think it's listening. Listening is very, very important, but also it's bringing a point of view, whether it's an industry perspective or a line of business perspective, as I said before. At the end of the day, let's use consumer packaged goods, in a quarter, three out of the top five consumer packaged goods companies in the world, and these are massive companies. These are brands that we all know and we'll talk a little bit about that next week. They are expanding their relationships. They are betting their business on Salesforce. That's pretty compelling. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Very exciting. And then Mark, how are you seeing this play out in the financials? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, I think on the financial side, one of the things I spend a lot of time, Marc, as you know, with a lot of the top banks all over the world and, obviously, we see people, customers who respond very favorably to that. And we've announced big bank after big bank after big bank, who I think this whole vertical side, Keith and I talked, we spent time in Davos with a number of the absolute top banks in the world, and Marc, this whole language of what do they need? What do they need for wealth management? What do they need for other applications and then we're able to actually meet that need and build a long trusting relationship with them. So that is happening... Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: I think that really gets down to why \u2013 I mean, you talk to me, you talk to Keith, Mark, we've never been more excited about Salesforce and our opportunity, our relationship with our customers, the potential with our customers and also we've never been more excited about the CRM market, to see the CRM market itself accelerate has become larger than the operating system and ERP and database market is because it has these really important critical growth drivers of our industry, not just Salesforce Automation. Not just customer services work. Not just marketing cloud and like, messaging and email marketing. Not just commerce, but all of these things and so much more and we still feel, even though we're forecasting $10.2 billion for the year and even though we doubled the company in the last three years, tripled the cash flow, increased operating margin every year, like Mark has said, we've just never been more excited about the future and what the opportunity holds for Salesforce and for our customers, specifically. And you're going to see that on March 7 as well. Okay, John. One more question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to go back to the billings guidance and I know we're going to be getting a lot of questions on this tomorrow. So maybe just to diffuse concerns on pipeline and, obviously, how you guys are talking today about your customer opportunities and everything, it sounds like things are great, but Keith or Marc, would love to just get your view on the macro right now and how you see overall IT spending environment trending as we enter 2017. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah. So this is Keith. Look, we talked about this earlier. CRM is the fastest-growing enterprise market and we're the market leader. We're taking shares in the marketplace. We continue to separate from the rest of the marketplace. There's a number of reasons for that. Obviously, it starts with a compelling vision, an incredible execution and operations of scale. But we started off the year with a fantastic quarter. We're certainly very, very proud of the entire company and are very thankful to our employees, and all of our \u2013 really all of our stakeholders. But we have some momentum carrying into the quarter. And I think that's reflected in our forward guide, which I think Marc and Mark talked about. So there's a lot of momentum. We're very excited. We've got a great story, a compelling vision for our customers and we continue to execute in an unprecedented way, better than anybody else in the marketplace. Marc, I don't know if you want to add... Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: No, I just would add, I think that's exactly right, Derrick. And just fundamentally, the point is that we've raised our revenue for the year. We've actually, because of what we saw in Q4, we've raised the entire guide for the year. So we, obviously, feel very good about the demand outlook. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: All right. I think that's all the time we have for calls today. We appreciate everyone tuning in. Obviously, we look forward to seeing many of you on March 7 and, of course, updating you at our next results call at the end of Q1. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day. My name is Victoria, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CRM Q1 FY '18 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Cummings, the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal first quarter 2018 results conference call. Our first quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; and Mark Hawkins, CFO. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Also, some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings in our -- including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. With that, let me turn the call over to you, Marc. Marc Benioff : All right. Well, hey thanks, John, and welcome, everybody, to the call. We're excited that you're here with us, and I'm personally very excited to be here and to share these amazing first quarter numbers. So as you can see, the numbers were really outstanding with very strong top and bottom line performance. Revenue for the quarter rose to nearly $2.4 billion, that's up 25%. And this is the fastest growth of any top 5 enterprise software company, and no company in the history of enterprise software has achieved our scale faster and at this growth rate. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter rose to $0.28, up 17%, and deferred revenue grew to more than $5.04 billion, up 26%, really excited about that. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $14.6 billion. That's up 26% from a year ago and we've added more than $3 billion since last year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.23 billion, up 17%, and we're maintaining our full year operating cash flow guidance of 21% growth at the high end of the range. Based on these strong results, we're raising full year top line revenue guidance by $100 million to $10.3 billion this year, the high end of the range, 23% growth for the year.  We're also raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.01 to $1.30 at the high end of the range, which is 29% growth year-over-year. We've consistently delivered excellent top and bottom line growth, driven by our industry-leading CRM product line and strength of our financial and operating model has continued in this quarter. In fact, our consistent non-GAAP operating margin improvement over the last 3 years has enabled us to triple our free cash flow even as we have doubled our revenue. So that is something that we're very, very proud of at Salesforce that over the last 3 years, we've now tripled our cash flow and doubled our revenue. And we're on track to deliver our fourth consecutive year of non-GAAP operating margin improvement this year, 150 basis points at the high end of our range.  Our strong revenue performance shows the strength of our full product portfolio. In fact, our 4 major clouds are standalone companies, they would represent 4 of the top 10 pure-play cloud software companies in the world. We have strong organic revenue growth across all of our product sales. Cloud revenue is growing at 14%, Service Cloud at 21%, Platform at 32%, Marketing Cloud at 32%, excluding Demandware. And our portfolio has not only gotten stronger as we have continued to strategically invest in our business but as you know, last year, we also acquired a number of amazing companies, and the integrations of these acquisitions has been very successful. And I just want to thank all of our employees at Salesforce for welcoming these new companies, and I want to also thank these companies who have now become part of Salesforce for their incredible hard work over the past several months integrating it with us. And a great example of this is, of course, Demandware, which served more than 500 million shoppers and purchased more than $4 billion in total gross merchandise value in the first quarter, which was up 31% over last year, pretty incredible. And yesterday, I was down in Las Vegas with the entire Salesforce Commerce Cloud team. And I'll tell you, we had over 1,500 people attending our Commerce Cloud conference, and it was amazing to see what's happening right now in this incredible retail industry and how so many retailers are focused on achieving a new level of customer success by going online or creating hybrid solutions between online and stores. Now this is fuel -- further fueling our B2C CRM product line within our already industry-leading Marketing Cloud. And as retailers are shifting from these brick and mortar to online situations, they're focusing on building more personalized, one-on-one relationships with customers, using artificial intelligence to provide the best capabilities to their customers, delivering world-class customer experiences and not only in the store but even in the mobile environment. And Salesforce is leading all of these transformations. Our competitive position has never been stronger. Just look at the latest data from the top industry analysts, IDC, shows Salesforce grew its overall market share more than any other CRM vendor. And according to IDC, we are #1 in CRM, we're #1 in sales applications, #1 in customer service applications, #1 in marketing applications in 2016. And you can see that if you go to my Twitter feed, there's a nice chart that we put together using the IDC data.  And Salesforce is gaining share at a much faster rate than our competitors, which you'll also see on that chart. We increased our market share in 2016 by more percentage points than the rest of the top 10 CRM vendors combined. That is, we increased our market share in 2016 by more percentage points than the rest of the top 10 CRM vendors combined, and we are very, very proud of that outstanding market performance in sales, in service and in marketing applications. Gartner showed similar results. It named Salesforce the #1 in CRM. And based on total software revenue for 2016, for the fifth year in a row in its latest worldwide CRM market share report at Gartner, market share, all software markets, very excited.  So in the same Gartner report, we also saw total software revenue for 2016, Salesforce is again named #1 in application Platform-as-a-Service and for the fourth year in a row as well as the #1 sales provider for the eighth year in a row and the #1 customer service and support provider for the third year in a row. So all these incredible areas that we're focusing on, we're delivering phenomenal results. With the strength of our market leadership and multiproduct portfolio, in the first quarter, we closed some of the biggest deals in Salesforce's history and Keith will talk more about that. We've also expanded relationships with incredible brands like Visa, very excited to see them go wall to wall with our Salesforce automation technology, with Delta Airlines and 21st Century Fox, very excited about 20,000-seat deployment of Quip, which they are using to replace their Microsoft Office implementation. So very excited to that and congratulations to all of those teams at Salesforce. No one else is closing more strategic CRM deals. CRM is the fastest-growing enterprise software category today, and by 2021, CRM will be the largest area of spend in enterprise software, according to Gartner. And we are very excited about that. We have a massive opportunity to continue our growth and leadership in CRM and grow the Salesforce economy. Our ecosystem of customers, partners and developers is generating hundreds of billions of dollars in GDP impact and creating millions of new jobs. And in a time an incredible change in the world and incredible areas of workforce development, we are so excited that so many people are coming to Salesforce to find a new employment. In fact, there's hundreds of thousands of job openings today that are calling for Salesforce skills, and we've seen this incredible situation where Salesforce developers and Salesforce administrator are 2 of the highest-paid jobs today in the United States. It's very exciting time for Salesforce. We expect to grow to nearly 30,000 employees worldwide this fiscal year, something I'm very proud of. And with each and every one of them completely focused on CRM and mostly focused on honestly, our customers and their success. In fact, nothing is more important to Salesforce than our customers' success, which is why we continue to be so successful and no other company has a focus like ours in the CRM market. Our customer success message is on display this quarter. As you've probably seen, we launched our worldwide advertising campaign featuring some amazing customers and you're going to see some amazing more [ ones ] but one is -- and this is certainly something that everyone's interested in, the partnership between Salesforce and Amazon Web Services and how Amazon Web Services uses Salesforce to grow. It's been an incredible -- incredibly excited to use Amazon and the success of their cloud to feature the launch of our advertising campaign, and it's backed up with some incredible video testimonials that you can find on YouTube. Farmers Insurance as well, Intuit, and so many other incredible brands, you're going to see emerging in our advertising campaign as we seek to raise the awareness of Salesforce in the general market to show people how they can connect with their customers in an entirely new way. And in London today, you probably saw we held a sold-out world tour with more than 10,000 people in attendance and will be in Boston, Paris, Chicago in the next month, having similar world tours. We'll also have our second annual TrailheaDX developer event coming up in June 28 and 29 in San Francisco. And I hope you're going to join me for any of those events or you can join me in Tokyo on July 4 as we continue to deliver our message in the Asian market and to put on display the incredible success of Salesforce in Japan, which has been something that I have really been excited to see, helping our customers to blaze these new trails in CRM.  Okay. Well, that's enough of what's happening. With the numbers, let's hand this over to Keith. Keith Block : All right. Thanks, Marc. We delivered incredible results in the first quarter across all of our geographies, industries and clouds. As you can see from our numbers, the investments that we have made, and we continue to make an international expansion and industries and our partner ecosystem, continue to pay off. More importantly, we are deepening our customer relationships. We're engaging with them in more strategic ways, some of which Marc alluded to, and we are acting as a true trusted adviser to their businesses. We had some of the largest transactions in the company's history this quarter, starting with an iconic technology brand who is standardizing on Salesforce to bring together sales, service and marketing for thousands of employees worldwide. More to come on that next week. And another large transaction in Q1 was with a major telecommunications company who is using Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce Platform to transform the shopping experience for its customers. Very, very strategic. Now this company sees Salesforce as the key component to their retail growth strategy, and with this win, now 10 of the top 15 global telecommunications companies rely on Salesforce. Very impressive. Now while our market-leading core products continue to see great traction and drive success for our customers, we're also seeing momentum with our new additions to the portfolio such as Commerce Cloud and Krux and Quip. Marc gave you an example of 21st Century Fox who's rolling out Quip to 20,000 employees, helping them co-create documents and streamline approval processes and collaborate in real-time.  Looking at our revenue internationally this quarter. We delivered strong results in all of our geographies as we had constant currency revenue growth of 29% in EMEA and 26% in APAC. Expansion outside the U.S. is key to serving our global customers. It's a key part of our strategy and achieving our goal of $20 billion of revenue. And this starts with investing in our go-to-market resources, our partner ecosystem and our infrastructure. We made amazing progress on this front in Q1, starting with announcement in March that we are leveraging AWS to deliver Salesforce services to customers in Australia, which I just returned from a couple of days ago. We also announced the opening of our second data center in Japan in April. And in Europe, we had customer expansions with Banca IFIS, Adecco and Group Atlantic. In Japan, we landed wins with major brands such as SoftBank, Japan Asia Group and Mizuno. And in Australia, we expanded our relationship with AMT, a leading wealth management company. They are turning to Salesforce as many wealth management companies are to reimagine their client advisory relationship for the digital age. Now turning to industries. We continue our strong showing in Q1 yet again. In fact, as Marc talked about, if you were in Vegas this week, you've seen Salesforce hosting our XChange conference for the retail industry, a great reception there. And at the conference, we announced an expansion of our relationship with iconic fashion brand, Diane von Furstenberg. We also had a major expansion this quarter with Ralph Lauren. They've been very active in the press, and they have a new vision for growth and customer engagement that is powered by Salesforce Commerce Cloud. They believe that Salesforce will create a best-in-class experience in all of their markets around the world. And with these wins, today 8 of the top 10 U.S. retailers, nearly half of the top 20 global retailers, rely on Salesforce to power their business. In the public sector, the team recently unveiled Impact Level 4, IL4, provisional authorization for government cloud, enabling even more federal government agencies to benefit from Salesforce. And in the quarter, we expanded our relationship with the United States Army and the United States Air Force. In state and local government, we drove an amazing win with the state of Florida. They're using Salesforce to implement travel management system that will include authorization requests and approvals and expense reporting. And by streamlining all these processes with Salesforce, the state will be able to better analyze the amount of funding spent on travel and ultimately save tax payer dollars, which is a good thing. Finally, in financial services, we're thrilled to expand our relationship in Q1 with Northern Trust, a leading provider of wealth and asset management services. And with the addition of Salesforce CPQ and Shield, they're enhancing customer trust and building a 360-degree view of their clients. And today, 9 of the top 10 global wealth management firms rely on Salesforce. On the partner front, we continue to work with the largest and most strategic SIs and ISVs in the world, reaching new markets, building amazing applications on the AppExchange and ultimately growing our impact with customers, because it is all about customer success. And in Q1, we expanded our relationship with Accenture. As you know, they're a long-standing and strategic partner for us, and this quarter, they grew their deployment of Sales Cloud to thousands of their consultants worldwide. But it's not just about the SIs. We're also seeing momentum across our thriving ISV ecosystem, and earlier this month, we announced that Quintiles IMS, a leader in life sciences is building new clinical trial applications on the Salesforce Platform. And just last week, you saw that we launch new AppExchange partner program and a $100 million platform fund to empower millions of developers and ISVs to create new applications. So it's never been a better time to build on the Salesforce Platform. At the end of the day, our strategy of international growth and building the world's greatest cloud ecosystem and speaking the language of our customers continues to fuel our results. I'd like to thank our customers and our partners for their trust in us and our employees for strong results for the year, and of course, now over to you, Mark. Mark Hawkins : Thanks, Keith. I'm really pleased with our first quarter results. We continued strong top line and bottom line growth and our record operating cash flow in the quarter. Revenue grew 25% in both dollars and constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately $11 million. Sequentially, we benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $15 million. Each of our clouds demonstrated strong revenue growth in the quarter as Sales Cloud grew 14%, Service Cloud grew 21%, Platform and Other grew 32% and Marketing Cloud, excluding Demandware, now Commerce Cloud grew 32%. The Commerce Cloud started FY '18 very strong, contributing $57 million in total revenue and with $46 million in subscription and support revenue. Dollar attrition in the first quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses, remained below 9%. As you know, our fourth quarter is our largest new business from renewals quarter and Q1 is our largest cash collection quarter. And as a result, we delivered a record operating cash flow in the first quarter of $1.23 billion, up 17% over last year. This is more operating cash flow than we delivered in all of FY '15.  Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $5.04 billion, up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding an FX headwind of $21 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of $41 million. Commerce Cloud contributed $50 million to deferred revenue in Q1, up from $49 million in Q4. Moving on to guidance. With strong results to start our fiscal year, we're very pleased to be raising our full year FY '18 revenue guidance to $100 million to $10.25 billion to $10.3 billion or 22% to 23% growth year-over-year. This guidance includes approximately $50 million to $100 million of FX headwind. And we're also raising our FY '18 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1.28 to $1.30. Please keep in mind that Dreamforce is in Q4 this year versus Q3 last year. And as you update your models for the second half, we anticipate slightly more EPS to come in the third quarter than in the fourth. We continue to expect to deliver 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY '18, our fourth consecutive year of improvement. We're also maintaining our full year operating cash flow guidance of 20% to 21% year-over-year. For Q2, we're expecting revenue of $2.51 billion to $2.52 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.31 to $0.32 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of approximately 22%. This deferred revenue guide reflects the increasing seasonality that we've discussed over the last several years. Before I close, let me give you a quick update on our future adoption of the new revenue standard ASC 606 starting in Q1 of next year. We will adopt this using a full retrospective method, which will result in recasting our results in FY '17 and FY '18. We're on track with the preparations to address the accounting changes. Regarding commissions, we anticipate capitalizing more selling-related cost, and our amortization of these costs will be over the customer life rather than the contract term. While we expect to increase our disclosures for revenue backlog, deferred revenue and other customer contract information, we have not yet quantified the impact to revenue. However, we do not expect these changes to have any impact on our operating cash flow results upon adoption in FY '19.  All these changes are required under the new standard. We plan to provide you with a thorough review of these changes and the anticipated accounting impact later this year. So to wrap up, our first quarter results position us well for another year of strong financial performance. I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, partners and our stockholders for their continued support. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : Question for Mark Hawkins, just on the how front-end loaded the investment spend will be this year. I noticed you and Marc updated the full year operating margin improvement of 125 to 150, but it looks like in Q1, operating margins were down year-over-year and it looks like R&D was up quite a bit. So I'm just curious whether Salesforce is front-end loading your OpEx investments and what would drive the operating margin improvement in the second half. Mark Hawkins : Sure. Thank you, Karl, and good to speak. Remember last year, Karl, one of the things that we called out is that we had the benefit of a leap year. And while that washes out for the year, what that does is has a material 25 -- $20 million to $25 million in revenue impact in Q1 from that standpoint. And so when you -- that's one thing that you would consider. The second thing, Karl, as a reminder, is that we still haven't annualized the full integration costs that we're doing right now for some of the work with our major acquisitions, including Demandware and a few others. And so that obviously has a little bit of a front-end impact. But when you look at those 2, that explains a little bit of the topography as you look quarter by quarter. Of course, for the full year, as we talked about, our operating margin, 125 to 150 is intact. It's consistent with our framework and it's on a higher revenue basis obviously. Therefore, we raised the -- also the EPS for the year. So I think we're in good shape on that but hopefully, that gives you a sense there. Number two is on research and development, Karl. One of the things that we want to call out is we've been having a group of people, as you know, as we've been going into industries, we started industries, trying to talk the language of industries and with a really huge go-to-market focus. And now -- we're now starting to move some of our industry resources into the product development side. And so there's a bit of a reclass of moving some of our resources and shifting those into R&D. So in total, it's just a movement between line items, but we're in good shape overall, and that's what's happening in Q1 in those 2 items. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Kash Rangan : Actually a couple of questions. One for you, Marc Benioff. It looks like there's a lot of business coming through on the government side. And I'm also hearing, really over the last several quarters of conference calls, a decided shift in the business towards more B2C-centric industries. Can you talk about the business strategically, Marc, given that we know that according to statistics that the government actually spends the most amount of money on software. It's, by far, the vertical that commands the biggest share of what's spent on software. Can you talk about how the company views this opportunity ahead in the context of the Platform business, which also has a potential to be a multibillion-dollar business? And I guess I'll save the question for Mark Hawkins if you can get through this, that will be fine. Keith Block : Okay, Kash, it's Keith. So you alluded to the progress that we're making in the government. We have made an incredible amount of progress with our focus on the government business, the public sector business here. We had a big announcement in the quarter of IL4, which obviously is making a difference for us. We've expanded our relationship in the quarter with the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army. So we see that as a huge opportunity as the government really focuses on trying to modernize and transform their business and their organization, their technology. So there's a lot of potential there in the quarter. As I mentioned, we had a significant win with the state of Florida. And we did some incredible work in 311 for one of the largest cities. So stay tuned on that. For one of the cities -- largest cities in the country that we all know and love. So again, this industry's strategy is really, really paying off for us, not just in our go-to-market strategy but as Mark Hawkins alluded to in our orientation of our product set. As you know, last year, we released the Financial Services Cloud and the Health Cloud with the acquisition of Krux and Demandware, now Commerce Cloud. We have a widely compelling B2C story. Ralph Lauren is an incredible story and the company that is going through a lot of transformation, and they're leveraging us as the growth platform for B2C. So we just see tremendous opportunity and tremendous upside, and we continue to focus on speaking the language of the customer, leveraging our platform, growing our partner ecosystem and investing our assets in driving solutions for customers in specific industries. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : Question for Marc Benioff. Wanted to focus on the Sales Cloud because obviously, a lot of attention has been given to the growth over the past couple of quarters and Service and Marketing. But if you look at the growth in Sales Cloud, that's actually gotten accelerated over the past couple of quarters here. How do you think about Sales Cloud in terms of where we are in the life cycle, pricing, upsell potential, just walk us through just your thoughts on where we are. Marc Benioff : Well, Sales Cloud has become one of the largest products not just at Salesforce, but in the entire software industry, and it has far exceeded our expectations. And as you can see, as Salesforce, Sales Cloud specifically kind of heads towards that, these kind of incredible revenue levels, I think Sales Cloud has really accelerated because we kind of have a -- had a breakthrough in how we think about Sales Cloud and the ability to grow that revenue stream. And that you saw with our acquisition, for example, of SteelBrick. When we acquired SteelBrick, it also gave us the ability then to extend Sales Cloud with CPQ-type functionality, which just -- was something that we did not have previous to that, previous to the acquisition, and we're able to organically grow the product. And that has been a big revelation for us as we look to all the options and all the things that our Sales Cloud customers need that previously we didn't have. And in addition to that, we continue to close very large new Sales Cloud licenses. I mentioned Visa, for example, which went wall to wall with Sales Cloud this year. But there's been so many other exciting Sales Cloud customers, as you know. And as Keith mentioned, combined with the vertical strategy, it's really opened up all these new opportunities. I think, a great example is financial services where we have the Wealth Cloud, which is built, of course, on the Sales Cloud. And now, 9 out of the 10 largest financial institutions of the world are using Sales Cloud and Wealth Cloud to manage their wealth advisory firms. That's pretty cool and another example where we're growing Sales Cloud. So we take this very, very seriously that when we look at Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, which are huge products, 2 of the biggest products in the software industry and 2 of our biggest products, we want to continue their strong organic growth. And we have been able to put together a whole portfolio of strategies to do that. And it's working. And I hope that it will continue to work and we're trying to do a lot of cool things this year to make that happen. And I think that we look and talk to Alex or you talk to Keith or I, we're extremely aligned on this breakthrough and we're executing it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Aleksandr Zukin : Maybe for Marc Benioff or Keith. You guys continue to sign some very large transactions in the quarter. So I guess, as you think about the strategic imperative of growing your wallet share within these Fortune 500 accounts, how should we think about a very large customer that you are for this along with in terms of that percentage of their overall budget or spending on you versus your average? And how does that compare with an Oracle, SAP or Microsoft at this point? Marc Benioff : It's a very good question. Do you want to handle [indiscernible]... Keith Block : Well, let me -- Alex, it's Keith. Let me take a swing at this. So obviously, we have a very balanced portfolio of business, whether it's our large deals or small deals, whether it's our industries or geographies or segments. We've highlighted a couple of these very large transactions because we're particularly proud of the fact that these are 2 of the largest transactions that we've done in the history of the company. And when you think about the compelling reason why these companies are undertaking these transactions and establishing these relationships, at the end of the day, the CEOs of these companies are very forward-thinking CEOs. And they want to bring their companies into this age of digital transformation, and they have an imperative for growth, and they believe strongly that we are the only technology platform out there that will enable that growth. So that would be point number one. Point number two is that once we've established this relationship and they start to get more and more value as a company, as you know, we continue to innovate. And as we bring new innovations to the table, like Quote-to-Cash or SteelBrick like Marc was talking about, that allows us to go back into those large customers and bring new points of innovation to them. So that huge deal or those large deals really create a platform and an opportunity for us to innovate and continue to attach. That's a big part of our strategy. Obviously, from a percentage of IT spend, if you look at where the market is going, IDC has a study out that says that the largest category of enterprise software by 2020 will be CRM and the fastest growing. And if you look at our results, we're growing at significantly more than that rate of market, so that means we're taking market share, which means we're taking wallet share and that means obviously, we're taking -- which translates to IT budgets. And it translates into the mind share of our CEOs that we're trying to do business with. So we have a compelling offering. We're driving the market. We're taking share from our competition. We've got the mind share with the CEOs of these companies, and that just translates into higher penetration rates from IT budgets. Marc Benioff : And I think the other point you -- kind of didn't mention that, I think they love to hear about is these top 10 customers just continue to grow. I mean, it's kind of amazing and I think it surprised us, right, to see how big our largest customers are becoming and how committed they are to our technology, especially is our platform. Do you want to illuminate that further? Keith Block : Yes, I think it's kind of an interesting statistic that we talk at the board level is if you look at the top 10 companies and the barrier to get into what we referred to as the top 10 club. If you look at what that barrier was 4 years ago and then you fast forward to where we are today, particularly at the end of this first quarter, to get into that top 10, you'd have to be spending more than 2.5x what you did before 4 years ago. So we have not only grown these relationships, but we also have new members into this, what we call the top 10 clubs. So again, it's an indication that these companies are adopting our technology and they're transforming our business. Marc Benioff : And back at that point, you mentioned the kind of -- this kind of pre-growth time, we only really have maybe 1 or 2 products to offer these companies. Now we have a full range of services to help them focus on their customer, sales, service, marketing, community, analytics, apps, platform, commerce and so forth. Is that -- do you think that's one of the reasons that it's growing is the digital transformation of these companies that's doing it? What is it that's happening? Keith Block : There's no question that there is a laser focus on digital transformation by the CEOs of these organizations. And when you think about the evolution of our company, we have a strategy that we refer to as seeding growth, where we initially penetrate and we drive value, typically, with Sales Cloud. So this reacceleration of Sales Cloud is obviously a great thing. And then once we drive success for those customers, as Marc was talking about, then we're able to say, \"Okay, now the walls between sales, service and marketing are coming down.\" So now we have an opportunity to provide a 360-degree view of the customer with service and with marketing. And take that now one step further, as we've moved from systems of record to systems of engagement to now systems of intelligence. And that's where Einstein, which we're all very excited about and customers are excited about comes into play. So it's an expansion of our capabilities and our opportunity to drive transformation with these customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Question for Keith. Just first on -- you highlighted Australia rolling out AWS down there. And I'm wondering just generally, is the AWS partnership and you being able to put customer data in more locations, ultimately, long term helping your pipeline internationally or any impact at this point yet? Keith Block : Well, interestingly enough, I just returned from Australia a couple of days ago. And there is a great deal of excitement about our Australian data center and a great deal of excitement about our partnership with AWS. And this is something that as a company on the -- for the benefit of our customers, it's kind of a big deal strategically for us. And obviously, it's a big deal for our customers. It's something that we're excited about. Marc Benioff : Yes. And I think at Salesforce, we really strongly believe that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, and I think that makes Amazon Web Services our best friend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : This question is actually for Marc Benioff. Marc, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen Einstein start to impact deal sizes. And what's the general, I guess, adoption curve look like for machine learning and AI now that you have it embedded into your products? Marc Benioff : Well, I can just tell you from my personal experience and I think I've mentioned this before, but I think it played out in this quarter once again, which is that we have Einstein now built into all of our capabilities. And like in a lot of our technologies, we've really become the first and most, probably, fastest moving user. And we then have a piece of Einstein now that we've not yet rolled out to our customers called Einstein [ Guidance ]. So this is a capability that I use with my staff meeting, when I do my forecast and when I do my analysis of the quarter, which happens every Monday at my staff meeting like a lot of CEOs do, it's a very typical process, of course, we have our top 20 or 30 executives around the table. We talk about different regions, different products, different opportunities. And then I ask one other executive their opinion and that executive is Einstein. And I will literally turn to Einstein in the meeting and say, \"Okay, Einstein, you've heard all of this. Now what do you think?\" And Einstein will give me the over and under on the quarter and show me where we're strong and where we're weak and sometimes will even point out a specific executive, which it's done in the last 3 quarters and said that this executive is somebody who needs specific attention during the quarter. And I can tell you that I do believe that Salesforce's enhanced performance has been greatly attributable to our ability to have Einstein on board and as part of our team. Because that ability to consult with Einstein has made me a better CEO. I have the ability to talk to Einstein and ask Einstein everything from product areas that I should be focusing on, geographies that I should be focusing on, the linearity of bookings during the quarter. Every question that I possibly could have, I'm able to ask Einstein. And I think for a CEO, typically the way it works is, of course, you have various people, mostly politicians and bureaucrats, in your staff meeting who are telling you what they want to tell you to kind of get you to believe what they want you to believe. Einstein comes without bias. So because it's just based on the data, and it's a very exciting next-generation tool. And to have Einstein guidance has transformed me as a CEO. I'm sure that if we are a sales leader in here, they would tell you that it's transforming our individual salespeople's experience as they have the ability to prioritize who to make sales calls onto or who to make phone calls to with our new Einstein dialer or to -- yesterday, I was down in Las Vegas talking to retailers where Einstein is helping shoppers make better shopping decisions because it's able to prioritize based on shopping histories what products that they're seeing. We did a very exciting demonstration with one of our top customers, which is Deckers. They have an incredible brand that I love called UGG shoes. And we demonstrated how one of their consumers is having a mobile experience using Apple Pay and using all these kind of next-generation activities to have a one-on-one shopping experience. And Einstein comes in and says, \"You like that shoe. These are the other shoes and other products that we have that we think that you would like and the colors that you would like them. And based on how everybody else has purchased and your purchase history, this is what Einstein recommends to you.\" And that was very, very powerful for our customers. I mean, so we see it in our analytics product, we see it in our Commerce product, we see it in our Sales Cloud. You're going to -- you see it in our Service product as well, especially with the emergence of bots, where many of our customers want to deflect call using bots, which I think is a great strategy and across the board. So I think that Einstein artificial intelligence, I mean, I guess, I have -- I should probably just point back to we started the quarter in February and many of you saw the demonstration with Coca-Cola were building the smart cooler for them, which has Einstein built into the cooler in a retail store that's paying attention to what products are being taken and removed from the store using Einstein Vision. So you can see into the cooler and actually say, \"Oh, they took a Coke, they took a Diet Coke, they took a Sprite. Or oh, there's a competitive product in here. Send somebody to get this out.\" So Einstein is having, I think, a very dramatic impact. Of course, we're the first major CRM company to roll artificial intelligence so dramatically through all of our products. And I think that it's going to be instrumental. And when you look at AI, there's a couple of things you can think about. One is this is happening a lot faster than anybody expected. The fundamental development of AI whether it's machine learning, machine intelligence or deep learning. The growth of AI, the advancements in AI, and you saw that yesterday in the Google conference as well, it's just the speed of growth is just exceeding everybody's expectations. And two, AI is the next platform. All future applications, all future capabilities for all companies will be built on AI. Much in the same way that we talked about the future with cloud, the future of social and social became the next platform, or mobile became the next platform. Now you can really see how AI is becoming the next platform. And everyone is going to build on AI, and it's going to fundamentally transform all of our customer experiences and Salesforce is going to continue to do -- lead the way with that and also be on point to be able to have that meaningful transformational conversation with the most important CEOs in the world to help them to do what I'm doing, which is to transform their own business and how they run their businesses using AI. And that's why I'm excited about Salesforce Einstein. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Also a question for Marc Benioff. Given the board-level attention that you're receiving, I'm curious what inning you think we're in, in terms of digital transformation. In other words, how many Global 2000 types of firms are seriously considering a digital transformation? And also when you do see a company engage in a use Salesforce as the centerpiece for one of those projects, how does their level of spending with Salesforce change? Marc Benioff : Well, I think that is really the big question right now here at Salesforce so I appreciate you asking that. And I'll give you an example. I was in Las Vegas yesterday. We had thousands of customers down there. Simultaneously, we had thousands of customers at our London world tour, which is just, in my mind, a major accomplishment for Salesforce for running 2 multi-thousand person events concurrently in 2 different parts of the world. And when I was down in Las Vegas, I was meeting with a very large manufacturer of furniture who has not done a lot of automation. It's a huge company with tens of thousands of employees. And they are both a B2B company, where they are building their furniture, designing their furniture, creating their furniture and they're selling it to partners and they're selling to the resellers, and they're selling it online to different vendors, and their B2C company, they have their own stores and they also do their own online. And they're like, \"We are looking for an opportunity to digitally transform our company. And honestly, we have -- we're not the state-of-the-art, and we need a B2B and a B2C transformation. Can you help us?\" And I said, \"Honestly, I think Salesforce is the only company today who can work with a company like that and be able to come in with a full range of capability, technology, services, relationships, partnerships and say we can transform you whether you're B2B or B2C or both. And it was the first time that a customer actually ever came up to me and said, \"I'm B2C and I'm B2B.\" And it was really very powerful to kind of hear that because I -- it's how we're starting to think a lot at Salesforce, which is, of course, we have this incredible -- we're #1 in B2B. Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, you know the numbers. Marketing Cloud, Pardot, I mean, it's incredible, the Platform, Application Platform as a Service. And now you saw the IDC numbers we're #1 in B2C with the Marketing Cloud, which is incredible. And this is a big, big deal in Commerce Cloud with our digital marketing platform that we introduced yesterday, which is so incredible as well as our -- not just our DFP but also this incredible capability with commerce. And the ability to stitch it together for these customers in a meaningful way to provide deeply interactive experiences and deeply personalized one-to-one experiences and make it all intelligent with Einstein. And with that customer, we're able to sit there for 1 hour and sketch out on a piece of paper everywhere they need to go. And here's the other thing that's so cool is we can say, \"We're going to get all this done for you probably in the next 90 days, no more than 180 days.\" It doesn't take a long time to really build and deliver. And I won't go through this specific example, but we have a major customer right now who just has imploded with SAP Hybris because it's on-premise software product built in the last generation of software. And these retailers, they don't have time to wait and they don't have the ability to take on the risk of this old enterprise on-premise stuff like SAP Hybris. And that's why you see this rapid acceleration of our Commerce Cloud. But that's just a metaphor. They just don't have the ability to take on the risk of any of that old Oracle or SAP on-premise software. So that's why by basically being born cloud, by being born social, born mobile and now being born AI, we can do more for customers today and go faster than ever before. And we have so many examples. And I think that when you look at that IDC chart, the reason why we've really just taken SAP out of their #1 spot in CRM and left them in the dust is because these customers, they need transformation now and we're able to deliver it. And that makes me very proud for the company and makes me really happy when I meet with one like that furniture company yesterday in Vegas to be able to support them so fully. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. S. Kirk Materne : Keith, another really nice quarter in Europe for you all. Just 2 quick questions on that region for you. Can you just talk about where you think Europe is versus the U.S. in terms of your mind share with senior executives that are thinking about digital transformation? Do you feel like you have sort of the same sort of brand awareness over there as you do in the U.S.? Or is there still some opportunities on that front? And then second, any concerns at all about the new GDPR regulation that's coming up around data privacy, maybe slowing down decisions on cloud technology as that deadline gets closer? Keith Block : Kirk, thanks for the question. So let me address the first one then actually, our President and General Counsel is in the room, so we're going to let her talk about the second part. So obviously, we did have another great quarter in EMEA. It's part of our growth strategy around international expansion. And look, at the end of the day, we honestly, we see opportunity everywhere, whether it's in the U.S. or whether it's internationally. And it really is coming back to this notion of CEOs embracing this concept of digital transformation. I spent some time in Europe about a month ago, and I'll give you 2 examples. One is with the CEO of one of the largest consumer banks in the world who is looking at how does he embrace our technology, how does he embrace Einstein to drive digital transformation inside the consumer bank? And it is very real. And financial services, as you know, it's an imperative because there's an incredible amount of disruption that's going on. Another example, I was with our President of EMEA, Miguel Milano, we went -- took a day trip up to Finland to meet with the CEO of Koenig. And this is a company that we would think as they are an elevator company. They are an escalator company, but the way that they view themselves is they're not really a B2B company, they're a B2C company. They move 1 billion people every single day and that's how they view themselves. So they want to go through a digital transformation to drive service because everything in their world is about service. And they're leveraging all of our technology, they're leveraging Sales and Service and Marketing and Einstein to make predictive insights about their customers' behavior and optimizing how they could move to these machines, these escalators and these elevators to optimize the experience for the consumer. So there is a ton of opportunity. I actually think it's limitless. It is bound only by the imagination of what you can do with this technology. And in Europe, I find that the industrial manufacturers are actually quite progressive in their thinking. You find financial services institutions all over the world that are very progressive. AMP in Australia, the wealth manager, many of the financial services institutions that we've talked about here in the United States, the example I just gave you about the consumer bank over in Europe. But in terms of the manufacturing sector, EMEA is very, very progressive in terms of embracing digital transformation. And by the way, we see that at The World Economic Forum every year in Davos. Regarding your second question, I'm going to turn that over to Amy Weaver and she can give us a little bit of an update on that. Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks for asking about this. So the GDPR, for anyone who does not know, is the new EU General Data Protection Regulation. And that's going to come into effect in about 1 year from now in May of 2018. And what this is going to do is this going to replace the current attach work of national data protection laws in the European Union and at the same time strengthening privacy rights. And at Salesforce, we really welcome the GDPR as an important step forward in streamlining all of these processes. And we're committed to making certain that our customers can continue to use our services while compliant to GDPR. It's something we are looking at very closely, and we will have further update to the market and to all of our customers throughout the year as we get closer to its implementation deadline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens, Inc. Samad Samana : So we thought at the New York City world tour, the company announced it was lowering the rev share for ISVs back to pre-2015 levels. What's the strategy behind that decision? And maybe related to that, can you give us an idea of what the revenue from ISVs represents as a percentage of total platform revenue? And overall what percentage of new ACV's coming from the partner ecosystem generally versus direct sales? Keith Block : This is Keith. Let me try to address that as best as I can. Look, at the end of the day, we think we have the most compelling platform in the marketplace. I gave the example of Quintiles IMS who's building a mission-critical application. Clinical trial application, it's pretty serious stuff and they're going to be building that on top of our platform. Great example of an ISV. Another example obviously is Accenture. Vlocity, I mean, there's a roster that we've given here. And we want to drive proliferation and usage and adoption in the marketplace, and we want to make sure they're [ going to use ] price to value, and that's why we made an announcement in New York and also why we made the announcement around our fund, which we're very, very excited about to be able to invest in these ISVs. As far as breakout of ISVs, revenue and ACV and all that stuff, we don't disclose that. Mark Hawkins, I don't know, if you want to... Mark Hawkins : Yes. In fact, just we concur, we don't, but I totally agree with your points there. I would add, Samad, that this is, as you know, is an exciting offering our Platform app grew 31%. It's another $1 billion, $1.5 billion cloud that's growing and rapidly towards $2 billion. So it's an exciting thing. And I think this change, Keith, is just simply part of amplifying the opportunity for our customers. So that would be the net of it. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : A lot of mine have been answered, but the one I wanted to talk to you about is now this year, you're going to hit the $10 billion in revenue and only very few software companies have achieved that. Now that your eyes are kind of moving on towards the $20 billion, can you talk a little bit about the changes you need to think about in terms of organization and we need to think about as well because obviously, it's a completely different skill again then and it's something that kind of requires kind of careful planning? Marc Benioff : Sure. I'm happy to talk to you about that. I think everyone at Salesforce is so excited to see our run rate begin to eclipse $10 billion in revenue. And of course, the big -- I think the big announcement on this call here, you can see the switches, the book business on and off the balance sheet is just the deferred revenue, which is what Mark, $14.6 billion. $14.6 billion... Mark Hawkins : Yes, $14.6 billion. You're exactly right. Growing, Marc, 26%. Marc Benioff : 26%. So all of you are going to run your own financial models. You know how our revenue and expense models work. And you can start to model next year now based on that, which is very exciting, I think. Or you can model -- we run our models now for the next 2 or 3 years. Next to that, we have, of course -- we have a running 5-year long-range plan and a 5-year long-range budget that gets fueled and created by that on- and off-balance sheet deferred revenues, probably one of the most important things to drive that forward. And we -- that gives us the ability to kind of have a true north star of where our company is going and our finance team has done a great job in building these models and giving me the ability and then coupling it with Einstein to actually look to these models, too. And that is part of how we are able to deliver our quarter. Specifically, as we start to look at eclipsing $10 billion and moving into much higher numbers going forward, of course, it's exciting to have that $20 billion in sight. And I think that you're going to see the transformation of Salesforce in a few areas and you already saw it with what Keith has -- Keith mentioned, which is started by talking about government. That's a major business opportunity for Salesforce going forward and a major vertical for us. Of course, financial services remains a major opportunity and major capability, health care. These major verticals, that's a major focus for us. Keith has spoken extensively about that transformation. That's really complemented by our strong focus and Keith touched on this with the top 10 enterprise focus as well as our commercial business unit has continued to grow. So those are some of the examples. And then I would have to kind of couple in there the other major growth driver that we've kind of acquired our way into with ExactTarget, with Krux, with Demandware now becoming this incredible Salesforce Marketing Cloud and B2C. So when you look at things like government, financial services, health care, enterprise, commercial, B2C and I could go on and on in other critical areas for the company or by product, we touched on that. I think we have a very strong performance matrix that we are going to manage across all of our geographies, which also remains strong growth drivers, as you can see on the numbers for the quarter with Europe and Asia-Pacific and Latin America as well. So that's how I look at it. I would like Mark to kind of touch on that as well. Mark Hawkins : Sure, I'd love to add, and Marc, I was going to touch on international that you just covered as well. But I think the thing, Marc, that strikes me and some other really -- rather Raimo, I really appreciate when you teed up that question about going from $10 billion to $20 billion because it's talking about doubling the company and how do we think about doing that. Well, one of the things that helps us is we're used to thinking about doing that, we just doubled the company in the last 3 years, and we've been thinking a lot about laying the groundwork to make that happen and that's been a reality. So we obviously extended our planning to do it again. And I think that's one key thing. But the thing that really strikes me when we talk about that is obviously, it starts out with all the innovations and the offerings to make our customers successful to drive our top line, and we're getting that top line growth. You can see the market share progress. But what's hard to do is to get that kind of progress and success with the customer and the market share, Marc, and the operating margin that we talked about and the cash flow we're delivering all of that currently, and we're certainly planning to do that in the long-range plan. Marc Benioff : Yes, and I think that really just touches on our core values in our company, which starts with customer success. And I think is more important than the trust and customer success that we continue to focus on. I think you'll continue to see that be amplified as we head towards $20 billion. We hire people who are focused on customer success. We have a culture of customer success entrusted. We also hire people who want to build a growing business. These are people who like to work hard and who enjoy growth and who relish that. And that's important to us. And third, I would say innovation. We continue to deliver world-class innovation, both organically. You've seen that with Einstein, with Lightning. And inorganically, we've seen that with Commerce Cloud and Krux and Quip. And this kind of perfect combination of that has created an amazing innovation inside our company. And we hire people who are focused on equality because I think we all realize that we're in a world today where we have to focus on equality, that this is a time when each and every one of us has a personal responsibility to look at the world and ask, \"What value are we going to provide back to the world?\" And that's why you hear me talk extensively about the importance of K-12 education because I strongly believe education is equality. And you'll hear me talk more about that this weekend. And Saturday, we open our Indianapolis Tower, Salesforce Tower in Indiana where we become the largest tech employer. And that's a place where equality has become a very important and core value of Salesforce. So anyway, I want to thank all of our employees and customers and partners for an outstanding quarter and being so committed to our company and helping us to achieve these incredible milestones. And we're looking forward not only to the next level, but working together as a Salesforce family going forward to these incredible new heights. So thank you very much, everybody.

My name is Torres, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Salesforce Fiscal 2018 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Cummings, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Torres. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our fiscal second quarter 2018 results conference call. Our second quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today\u2019s call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; and Mark Hawkins, CFO. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Also, some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual Company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings including our most recent report on Form 10-Q. With that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Okay. Thank you so much, John. I really appreciate it. And before I begin the script and talking about our quarter, I really wanted to review something that I sent to the Company last week, regarding some of the things that we\u2019ve been seeing in the world. And I thought it would be appropriate if we just took one minute and just allowed you to hear these words as well. As the world has watched with all of us the horrors of the last week taking place in the United States and Spain. The pure hatred that we have seen displayed is everything we all want to end. And I\u2019ve been especially disheartened to see the display of symbols of hatred including Nazi flags and salutes to KKK hoods. The horrible tragic death of Heather Heyer was a senseless act of terror and this hatred must end now. Salesforce is a company that is built on the values of love, equality and generosity. We work hard every day to improve the state of the world through our own work and promote our Company\u2019s mission to others. We all have to recommit to our own personal acts of love and kindness as this is the only way to fight this pure hatred. We can all make our own choices between love and hate, and we can all love more. Now is the time for all of us to remember, love thy neighbor as thyself. Okay. Thank you very much for allowing me to say that. And now, I\u2019d like to move into the quarter. We had our best quarter ever and we reached a huge milestone for the company. As you might remember, two and a half years ago, I talked about our dream of surpassing $10 billion in revenue. And at that time, we were just on a $5 billion revenue run rate. While I can remember how many employees and customers and partners came up to me and said there is no way you are going to get to $10 billion. What kind of a dream is this? And now, I am absolutely thrilled that in the second quarter we broke through the $10 billion run rate, doubling the Company in such a short time. Now, Salesforce is the first enterprise cloud software company in the history of the industry to reach the $10 billion run rate. No competitor has pierced $10 billion this fast, not Oracle, not Microsoft, not SAP and certainly not which has $15 billion of deferred revenue on and off the balance sheet. This makes Salesforce the fastest growing enterprise software company ever to reach this milestone. And this incredible achievement is now coupled with an incredible dream. We now set our sights on $20 billion and doubling the Company again. And you can see today how we can get there organically with our unmatched product portfolio, world-class team, and as I mentioned $15 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet. While this was a phenomenal quarter of growth, we continue to improve our profitability, executing at scale and we remain the fastest-growing of all the top five enterprise software companies. Now, let\u2019s talk about some of the highlights of the quarter. Revenue for the quarter rose to almost $2.6 billion, which was up 26%, and we are heading fast to $20 billion in revenue. As I mentioned, we have more than $15 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet, that\u2019s up 29% from a year ago. In fact, we added more than $3 billion to this balance since last year. Based on these strong results, we are raising full year top-line revenue guidance by $100 million to $10.4 billion at the high end of the range, 24% growth for this dream, and I will tell you personally, I\u2019ve got dreams of 25%. This is the second quarter in a row we have raised our revenue guide by a $100 million and only the third time in our history. Now, there is a reason for our incredible success year-after-year and why we continue to be investing at such an incredible rate to be the number one CRM company, is because no other company like ours has ever been as committed to customer success as Salesforce, and that\u2019s reflected in how our customers are driving tremendous success for their customers. You all know that customer relationship management, whether it\u2019s B2B or B2C, has already become the most important and fastest-growing enterprise software category, growing at nearly 14%, and that\u2019s going to come for years to come. Well, it\u2019s a massive $100 billion plus opportunity that Salesforce is leading, and we are in a phenomenal position going forward. We all see the $1 trillion CRM opportunity in front of us. Now, we see that by our -- through our number one position and that\u2019s because we are number one in CRM, number one in sales, number one in service, number one in marketing, and we have the number one platform that we have a tremendous opportunity to deliver on these goals. And we are delivering this at a scale every single day, creating nearly 3 million sales opportunities, more than 5 million customer cases sending 1.4 billion emails, processing 1 million purchases, and producing 40 million reports and dashboards every single day, that\u2019s 1 billion reports and dashboards a month, by the way, all while delivering more than 5 billion platform transactions a day. And it\u2019s no wonder that Forbes just named Salesforce the most innovative company in the world again. We were the first to bring innovations like cloud and social and mobile to CRM, and now we\u2019re the first to deliver artificial intelligence to all of our customers with Einstein, right inside our core platform across all of our products. This is a massive $1 trillion growth opportunity. According to IDC, the combination of CRM and IA - excuse me, according to IDC, the combination of CRM and AI will create more than $1 trillion in new GDP impact worldwide; 800,000 net new jobs by 2021, amazing. And we\u2019re already seeing how Einstein is a game changer for customers, delivering hundreds of millions of critical insights, recommendations and predictions every single day. But, our biggest advantage is more than 27,000 talented employees of Salesforce, these incredible people who are focused on making our customers successful with our products. No other company can match this level of focus on the CRM market. All of this adds up to Salesforce, becoming increasingly strategic to our customers and to our partners who are trusting us to bring them into this incredible new future. You\u2019ll hear more about that in a second from Keith. While it\u2019s only August, we\u2019re officially on the road to Dreamforce, which is going to take place in San Francisco, November 6th through 9th, and it\u2019s going to be the most exciting, most inspirational and most innovative Dreamforce ever. And I hope all of you can be there; you\u2019re not going to want to miss one moment. Okay, Keith. Keith Block : Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everybody. As you can see from our results, Q2 was another outstanding quarter across the board. It\u2019s clear that our strong execution and commitment to customer success are enabling us to build deeper and more strategic relationships with companies around the world of all shapes and sizes. And every conversation I have with CEOs, they mention growth as their number one priority, and getting closer to their customers is a key driver of that growth. That\u2019s why leading companies like Amazon or 21st Century Fox, or Jefferies Investment Bank, Samsung, all of them chose Salesforce this quarter to drive their digital transformation. One of the largest automakers is also going wall-to-wall with Salesforce, building a seamless brand experience for consumers across all touch points and channels. Today, 8 of the top 10 automakers around the world rely on Salesforce for their digital transformations. We also expanded with one of the world\u2019s leading logistics and transportation firms to transform the way that they deliver service to their millions of customers worldwide across every channel, social, mobile and the web. We continue to establish and grow relationships with marquee brands and unlock new value for customers by delivering innovative solutions and executing on three key priorities, expanding internationally; focusing on industries; and growing our partner ecosystem. Now, our international growth continues to represent a huge opportunity for Salesforce as we march towards that $20 billion plus goal that Marc mentioned. We continue to make significant investments in our international go-to-market resources, our operations and our infrastructure to serve our global customers. In fact, more than 40% of our new hires year to date have been outside the United States. And in Q2, Salesforce went live on Amazon\u2019s cloud infrastructure in Canada, very, very exciting. Customers can now access Salesforce locally via the AWS Canada Region. And Amazon continues to be an incredible partner as we expand in Canada as well as Australia. These investments contributed to our outstanding international results this quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 31% in EMEA and 27% in APAC, complementing our strong and consistent growth of 24% in the Americas. In APAC, we had a very strong quarter in Japan, closing deals with established companies including Toshiba and Nomura, and we had some great winds in Australia with Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post. In Europe this quarter, we entered into new relationships with Kering, one of the world\u2019s top luxury groups. I think everybody was excited about that one. Salesforce will be their clienteling solution across all of their brands including Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. We also expanded with Carrefour, the region\u2019s second largest retailer, formed a new relationship with Groupe Auchan, and we close a strategic Commerce Cloud deal with Sephora Europe. All good stuff, and clearly the leading retailers of the worlds continue to turn to Salesforce. In fact, companies are coming to Salesforce as their trusted partner in digital transformation. Speaking of trust, we\u2019re committed to helping our customers comply with the forthcoming GDPR, including a GDPR website, a new trailhead module and the contractual addendum to assist our customers with compliance. This fall, we will be publishing product specific best practices and we will have several sessions at Dreamforce. Now, let\u2019s turn to industries. You\u2019ve already heard about our momentum in retail, we had a great quarter with retail, and we\u2019re very, very proud of those results, but we\u2019re also expanding our relationships in financial services with Hero Price [ph], New York Life, and HSBC. Hero Price [ph] chose the financial services cloud to deliver personalized, highly relevant service to clients across every channel. New York Life, a great customer doubled down rolling out Sales Cloud and Service Cloud to another 6,000 agents and customer service specialists. And HSBC will leverage Marketing Cloud globally across its retail and wealth management divisions to create personalized banking experiences for their customers. In the public sector, the Department of Veteran Affairs which is working hard to improve services for veterans expanded with Service Cloud analytics and platform in the quarter. Lastly, in health and life sciences, we had a very large expansion with one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world. And today, 15 of the world\u2019s 20 largest pharmaceutical firms rely on Salesforce. Our success in the quarter was driven by our ability to speak the language of our customers and that is translating into outstanding industry momentum for us. Now, as Salesforce grows, so does the opportunity for our partners. Salesforce partner certifications have increased 5x in the last four years, and partners are investing more in their Salesforce practices. Accenture is actually a great example. In Q2, they expanded their Salesforce capabilities in the federal market and they are also leveraging the Salesforce platform to provide vertical solutions across many industries. I\u2019m sure, you all saw the announcement that Accenture will provide trade promotion and marketing operations for Unilever, all of which is built on the Salesforce platform. Now, before I close, I want to give you a quick update on the integration efforts. We\u2019ve moved quickly to integrate both products and operations across the companies that we acquired in FY17 including Demandware, Quip and Krux. And it\u2019s clear that our integration efforts are absolutely paying off. In the case of Demandware and Krux, these products did not only enhance our B2C product offerings and expanded our total adjustable market but they also accelerated our growth. So, to close, I would like to thank our partners and our customers for their continued trust in us and of course our 27,000 employees who are laser-focused on making our customers successful every single day. Now, I would like to hand the call over to Mark Hawkins who will share a bit more about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark? Mark Hawkins : Thank you, Keith. And as you\u2019ve heard from Marc and Keith, we delivered a great second quarter. Revenue grew 26% in dollars and 25% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately $7 million. We also saw a sequential tailwind of approximately $23 million. Our portfolio of products performed extremely well in the quarter with balanced year-over-year revenue growth across the board. Sales Cloud growth accelerated to 17%, driven principally by core Salesforce automation and continue traction of Salesforce CPQ. Service Cloud continued to outpace the market with 21% growth. This is a slight uptick in growth from last quarter, reflecting the investments we\u2019ve made in the product and sales enablement. Platform and Other grew 32% where we saw especially strong growth from Heroku. Marketing Cloud excluding Commerce Cloud grew 36%, touching the $1 billion run rate this quarter and Commerce Cloud contributed $63 million to total revenue with $51 million in subscription and support revenue. Dollar attrition for the second quarter excluding Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses remained below 9%. We expanded our second quarter non-GAAP operating margin by 195 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, operating margin benefitted from an FX tailwind that was roughly offset by a margin headwind related to the fair value adjustments of Demandware. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.33, which was up 38% over the last year. Operating cash flow was $331 million, up 32% over last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $4.82 billion, up 26% in dollars and 25% in constant currency, excluding an FX tailwind of $32 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefitted from an FX tailwind of $17 million. Commerce Cloud contributed $54 million to deferred revenue in Q2. Moving on to guidance, starting with revenue. Coming out of another quarter of outstanding performance, we once again are raising our full year FY18 revenue guidance by $100 million to $10.35 billion to $10.4 billion for 23% to 24% growth year-over-year. We are also raising our FY18 GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $0.07 to $0.09 and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $1.29 to $1.31. It\u2019s important to note that coming out of a strong second quarter, we are accelerating our investments in expanding our distribution capacity, new product initiatives, and Trailhead. These investments are set up for the long-term growth while pressuring our near-term margins. Nevertheless, we remain on track to deliver a 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY18, despite a slight FX headwind. These investments are critical to sustaining our long-term growth and leadership in the largest and most important marketing and enterprise software. And at the same time, we are mindful of how important profitability is to our investors. And we remain committed to ongoing margin improvement year-after-year in our long-term non-GAAP operating margin target in the mid-30s. Turning to cash flow. We are maintaining our full-year operating cash flow growth guidance of 20% to 21% year-over-year. Among other items, guidance considered one, strong new business in the second quarter, which drove higher cash commission obligations; and two, the fact that Q4 is our second largest cash collection quarter. So, without the benefit of that quarter, it\u2019s difficult to further refine its full projection at this time. That said, we are closely managing our capital expenditures in the second half of the year and now expect FY18 CapEx as a percent of revenue to be approximately 5%. In context, we expect free cash flow to grow faster than operating cash flow for the full year. For Q3, we are expecting revenue of $2.64 billion to $2.65 billion; GAAP diluted EPS of $0.04 to $0.05; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.36 to $0.37; and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 18% to 19%. This deferred revenue guide reflects the continued deepening of invoicing seasonality that we\u2019ve been discussing for the past several years; and as a reminder, the same seasonality also impacts cash flow. And one final item, we\u2019re on track with our implementation of ASC 606 for Q1 of next year. We expect to talk more about this at our Analyst Day at Dreamforce on November 7th. If you\u2019re interested in attending, please reach out to our Investor Relations team. So to close, our second quarter wrapped up a great first half of fiscal 2018. I\u2019d like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, and our stockholders for their continued support. And with that, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Keith Weiss Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys, and very nice quarter. And also, Mr. Benioff, thank you for those comments; definitely, I think needed in these times. I wanted to ask a little bit about sort of the margin profile for FY 2018, sticking with 125 to 150. It\u2019s evident that with FX getting a little bit easier into the back half of the year, you guys see something from that to move for investment? [Ph] I was wondering if you could drill a little bit on the decision to sort of keep operating margin guidance where it is. And may be as a follow-up. What are those incremental investments you\u2019re planning on making to the back half of the year to offset that FX alleviation or the pressure. Marc Benioff : Thank you very much for asking that question. I think that when we think about earnings, and obviously we have this incredible top line growth, and there is one word that really comes to mind and that\u2019s balance, which is that it\u2019s incredibly important as we grow our company and exceed these incredible revenue targets that we also continue to grow our bottom-line. And I am sure that Mark will address the specifics of how much we\u2019ve grown our bottom line in the last few years. But one of the things that continues to be on our minds is, how -- what are the ways that we can grow our margin while also continuing to grow our top line, and we\u2019re absolutely committed to doing both. And I think that\u2019s on the mind of every single member of our management team. I think we\u2019ve continued to deliver those numbers actually very well and we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward. And that\u2019s also under the guise of pressure that we get from foreign exchange, like every time the euro increases, its valuation that puts more pressure on our bottom-line. Mark, do you want to address? Mark Hawkins : Sure. I am happy to do that Marc. Thank you Keith for the question. I will address both parts of it, Keith, one is the margin and one is the specifics of where we\u2019re investing. The first thing I just want to clarify is that for the full fiscal year, we\u2019re seeing a slight headwind from an FX standpoint for the full fiscal year. That\u2019s one point I want to clarify. We\u2019re maintaining the 125 to 150 basis-point improvement, again that\u2019s consistent with what the guide has been on a larger base now, as we raise the revenue and other $100 million; second time we\u2019ve raised a $100 million as you know, it\u2019s on a bigger base and consequently we\u2019ve raised the EPS by a $0.01. And what we looked at in terms of the opportunities, we looked at the big opportunity that Marc has talked about of over a $100 billion in TAM, and we see that opportunity with unit economics that are very attractive in the mid 30s in terms of unit operating margin economics. And so, we\u2019re pursuing that. Obviously, we\u2019re investing and accelerating investing in distribution capacity, number one, Keith, very specifically; and also in new product initiatives, number two; and also Trailhead, number three. These are three things very specifically that we\u2019re doing to really help us even in the growth beyond this current year. And so that is something that we\u2019re mindful of because this opportunity is very, very large, as we described. As Marc called out, this is the fourth year in a row of operating margin expansion. We are mindful of that. We are very focused on delivering this 125 and 150 plus the growth. Hopefully that gives you a little complexion of both. John Cummings : Keith do you want to address \u2026 Keith Block : Yes. I think that Marks have done a very good job articulating what our strategy is here. I think at the end of the day, we see the opportunity in the marketplace. We are already the market leader and we are expanding our share. We are taking share. But we do see that opportunity. So that means that we have the opportunity to invest and continue to invest in our innovation, in our infrastructure, in our customer-facing assets, to capitalize on that opportunity. And that\u2019s exactly what our strategy is. Marc Benioff : I\u2019d like to think of this investing in growth by design and enhancing our profitability every step of the way. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Bhavan Suri : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. And to Keith, Marc Benioff, thank you. Thank you for those comments. It was meaningful. I guess, I\u2019d ask my two questions quickly. One is, you\u2019ve seen acceleration now for a couple of quarters in Sales Cloud, Service Cloud accelerated despite the very, very healthy growth last year, Marketing Cloud on organic basis doing really well. If you were to think about the breakout outside the cross-sell, meaning how are these clouds doing on their own? Because obviously, cross-sell in Keith\u2019s business of sort of doing the enterprise deals is helping. Is there any way to understand sort of how these are doing on their own? I\u2019d like to get a little color on sort of pure Sales Cloud without sort of the cross-sell and its growth. And the follow-up question I had was one of the challenges you\u2019ve had over the years is sales people entering data into a CRM system and obviously Salesforce had a huge step forward above Siebel and Bon [ph] and Legacy Solutions and now Lightning has enabled that. What do you think sort of -- Marc, as you think about sort of acquisitions or organic strategy, like natural language processing, talk to systems as for sales guys enter data themselves is a path you will go? Just wanted to get some color on both of those? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, let me take the last question first, which is that Salesforce actually gets its data from a lot of different places. More than half of the transactions, when we talk about 5 billion transactions a day, more than half of those transactions are API transactions already, that\u2019s other computers filling our database with data. And we have just amassed a huge amount of customer data based on that. We have so many integrations and so many customers so deeply integrated. And then there is many different ways that customers get their information into our system. Of course, we have many natural language type systems like one you mentioned, voice type systems like you\u2019ve seen us do work with Alexa, with Amazon and I think you will continue to see an evolution of that. One area that I am especially proud of is mobile. I don\u2019t think any enterprise software company has done as good a job with mobile as Salesforce. Salesforce has -- with Salesforce1, with My Salesforce1, Salesforce Inbox, many of our mobile offerings and mobile platform capabilities, more mobile capability than any other enterprise software company. And that has really allowed customers to access and work with an input data in lots of new ways. Because mobile devices are empowered and enabled to so many kind of, I would say, next generation capabilities including many operating systems that have very deep AI, as you know, all of that is already tied into Salesforce. So, it\u2019s a very extremely powerful. Keith Block : Let me try to address the first part of that question. So, it\u2019s interesting. I think if you look at the history of software, most companies are lucky to have a great first act but Salesforce is a company that\u2019s had a great first act with Sales Cloud, a great second act with Service Cloud, a great third act with Marketing Cloud, a great fourth act with Platform, and we continue to innovate for our customers and we speak the language of the customer. So whether it\u2019s pure play cloud innovation with add-ons or just pure play features and functions, or it\u2019s the solutions that we assemble by vertical, the financial services industry was particularly strong one for this quarter, we have this retail as with HLS. This gives us the opportunity to cross sell and up sell. So, each of these clouds by themselves would be the largest cloud company in the world or amongst the largest cloud companies in the world. So, standing alone, they\u2019re very, very, very strong, they\u2019re each a market leader. But when we have the opportunity to drive digital transformation for CEOs, the walls between sales, service and marketing come down. And we have the right solutions and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these results. Operator : Our next question\u2019s from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Let me echo my congratulations, one for Marc Benioff, one for Mr. Hawkins. Marc, when you look at your goal to double the Company size to $20 billion in revenue organically, historically you\u2019ve seen some of your peers like SAP Oracle struggle to maintain that hyper growth once they hit the $10 billion mark after the ERP cycle ended. What have you been able to observe from history that gives you the confidence that you can overcome those odds and position Salesforce to be an organic growth company, even at that level at which Oracle SAP could not maintain their growth rate? And one for Hawkins. I calculated your bookings margin. By the way, your bookings growth rate included the off balance sheet backlog change and the on balance sheet for revenue. Your bookings grew about 39%, fully spectacular. And I also calculated your bookings margin to be 30%. And I was intrigued when you said your unit economics were running in the mid 30s. Just wanted to clarify and see what you meant by that. Thank you so much. Marc Benioff : Yes. Thanks for that, Kash. I think that number one for us, here we are, we\u2019re blasting through $10 billion, all of you have your models for Salesforce, you can plug these preferred revenue numbers into your models and do your calculations of where our revenues going to be in each of the next several years. And I\u2019ll tell you, we took our whole management team offsite two weeks ago to lay out our plan for what we call chapter three. Chapter one for us certainly was zero to $1 billion, it\u2019s well documented in the book Behind the Cloud, how we did it, what we did, all of those capabilities. We want to write a second book now for entrepreneurs of what we did from $1 billion to $10 billion. We think that\u2019s an important story that needs to be told. That\u2019s certainly chapter two. Now, we\u2019re in chapter three, which is to go from $10 to $20 billion. And I\u2019m sure all of you can see that\u2019s going to happen in fairly short order. I think that one of the things that we have done to focus on and make sure that we blast through $10 billion is to focus on customer success. I think a lot of mistakes that the other entrepreneurs have made and I can go through each one. In enterprise software specifically, it\u2019s not to really double down at this point, again on the customer. Get absorbed in your own myopia, get absorbed in your corporate politics, get absorbed in your corporate bureaucracies and yourselves, and try to break out of yourself and recognize the most important thing, continues to be the customer. And how do we enable that customer and empower that customer and of course, we\u2019re going hold ourselves accountable and we\u2019re also going to deliver all kinds of other capabilities along the way as well. But, that is really our focus, which is how do we make our customers more successful than ever. And I think that\u2019s the heart of our culture. We have a great culture at Salesforce, it\u2019s a culture built on our core values of trust, of growth, of innovation, of quality. But I think nothing is more important to our Company than customer success. And even though the vast majority, let\u2019s say half of the 27,000 employees that work for us today probably were not with us two years ago. So that is something that we really have to spend time with them at. We\u2019re different than other software companies because we really care about that customer and we\u2019re going to make sure that customer is successful. When you\u2019re an enterprise software, you have to realize, it\u2019s hard work, not everything is going to be perfect all the time, there is going to be problems. That\u2019s why being so committed to the customer I think is more important than ever. And I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to see extraordinary growth for years to come, because of this culture that\u2019s really driving it forward. And then we coupled it with this incredible CRM opportunity. And I have to say our competitors have really done a horrible job in last few years. I just would say that a lot of them have abandoned the CRM market. If you talk to the major CRM analysts and we do that, we just had one of them at our management conference, they are shocked, we\u2019re shocked of how these companies have really walked out of the CRM market, companies that had huge multibillion dollar positions in the CRM have ceded that market to us. And that\u2019s very exciting when you look at the huge investments that we\u2019ve made, not just in product but also distribution. More than half of our organization is a customer-facing organization. We sell directly and service directly to the customer. That is going to serve us very well for years to come. So, I feel very good and I think you can see it in the numbers here. As I said, we\u2019re here forecasting 24% growth for the year that\u2019s our official guidance. I have personal dreams of 25%. I think that would be amazing. No software company kind went through the $10.4 billion number at these rates. And so, when we chart, we had a chart couple of weeks ago, Microsoft\u2019s growth over 30 years, Salesforce\u2019s growth, Oracle\u2019s growth, SAP growth and wow, we really separated ourselves from those traditional growth trajectories. And I feel that that\u2019s going to continue to happen. Mark Hawkins : So, let me take the second part of the question. Kash, thank you for the question. Kash, I haven\u2019t seen the modeling that you\u2019ve done but let me disclose what we disclose, which is around the total book of business, we have billed and unbilled deferred revenue totally at $15.2 billion; the billed portion of course grew 26%; the unbilled portion grew 30% to make up that that total amount of our business. And as we like to think about, that total billed and unbilled deferred revenue is obviously revenue waiting to happen over time. The one thing I would say to you about the unit economics, if we go back to our Dreamforce presentations for the last several years, we talk about life time economics, the cost of book, the cost to serve and then what that results in over time is in the mid-30s in terms of the unit economics at mature growth rates and that\u2019s what we see very specifically. That\u2019s what I can share with you. And obviously that\u2019s against the $100 billion market that we\u2019re pursuing. So, that\u2019s what I would share. Operator : Our next question is from line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Pat Walravens : Marc, first of all, thank you for sharing that message and for standing up for what\u2019s morally right. I mean that\u2019s great to see from corporate America. What I would love to hear is your thoughts on the platform strategy, how the environment has changed and how you think the platform strategy should evolve over time? Marc Benioff : Well, the platform strategy has evolved over time. I mean, one of the cool things for us is we have a tremendous capability with our platform. And that really started with this idea that we are building these amazing CRM apps like sales and service app but our customers wanted apps really designed for them. The traditional approach has been companies building vertical apps, almost from the get-go and creating these customizations and enhancements right inside the hard line code. That never sat well with me, mostly because my background was in application development and deployment tools. So, we really built our platform in a way that let us build our core applications and let our customers extend them. And that is why so much amount of data has been built inside of Salesforce. I don\u2019t think a single customer has the same implementation of Salesforce. And yet when we upgrade and update our software which we do three times a year, we don\u2019t break links and we don\u2019t break these customizations, and customers get Einstein and mobile and all of our enhancements and yet they have their highly customized capability, no other company in the world has that. Even today when most companies upgrade and update their core applications even in the cloud, they don\u2019t upgrade all customers democratically, they kind of give customers warning bells that we are going to do this but it\u2019s going to break your system. We don\u2019t do that. We have a way through our metadata architecture to really extend that. And then, as we have acquired companies, we have brought that platform religion to them. So, when we look at all of our core products, they all have core platforms. Platforms are incredibly important because they let customers enhance their system in highly specialized way. Platforms are also extremely important because they drive down attrition. I think as we -- we just ran our numbers for this management conference that I mentioned, two weeks ago, if you look at our attrition rate over the last 10 years, one of the reasons we drive it down is because of our platform. I think one of the reasons we have been able to deliver so quickly this amazing work and financial services that Keith has led, which is the building of our financial services cloud and our financial services business unit is -- and our success in financial services is because of our platform, rapidly. When we figure out a market or capability that we want to have or focus on, we can rapidly deliver that. That\u2019s also true with Keith\u2019s healthcare initiative as well. And that I think has been a very powerful part of our approach. Our platform is unique, because not only of course do we have our core platform, which includes our Sales Cloud platform and our Service Cloud platform and our Marketing Cloud platform but we also have extensions of that platform like Heroku, which is one of the most powerful and popular application development and deployment capabilities on Amazon. And we of course have tightly integrated that into our core platform. So, customers for example, I\u2019m wearing this amazing new Louis Vuitton watch today. And this Louis Vuitton watch is connected to something called LV Pass, which is the Louis Vuitton app that helps me manage all of my Louis Vuitton products. And that is built on Heroku. And then all of the CRM data for Louis Vuitton however is built and managed inside our core platform, and all of it is deeply integrated. So, when I walk into a Louis Vuitton store, they know who I am, they know all the products that I bought like the watch, or my carryall or whatever it is that I like of their products, and I am managing it all through that Heroku app on my phone with all LV Pass. That\u2019s a great example of our platform strategy where we let customers build highly complex applications like Louis Vuitton with their icon app and you can see that inside any Louis Vuitton store when you go into work with a Louis Vuitton account executive and you can see it yourself as a consumer with Heroku when you use LV Pass on your phone. I hope that answers your question. Keith Block : I think it\u2019s great. At the end of the day the other thing is our partners, our ISV community. If you look at the explosion of our ISV community, we\u2019ve now gotten into a situation where our ISVs are building mission critical apps. Just a few short quarters ago, we made an announcement of a company that\u2019s actually building a clinical trial management software, which is pretty interesting, again on top of our allocation. You probably saw the Unilever announcement most recently with Accenture about Accenture building CPG related applications on our platforms. So, it\u2019s very, very robust for our partner community. And of course, we have our largest ISV, which is Veeva, which is unique in the sense that it focuses just on pharmaceutical firms. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC. Ross MacMillan : Thank you very much and my congrats as well and thank you Marc Benioff for the comments. One for Marc Benioff or Keith to start with. Just on Einstein, I know it\u2019s early days. But, we started to see some bigger customer announcements like Airbus and U.S. Bank. I am just curious as to when you think Einstein actually will start to have a material impact on your numbers, on the results? And then a follow up for Mark Hawkins. Just, we raised revenue for two quarters here, we raised EPS for two quarters here but we didn\u2019t raise the cash flow from operations growth guidance. And I just wondered if you could revisit that as to why. Thanks. Marc Benioff : Yes. I mean, I think Einstein has hugely exceeded our expectations. And I would say from my perspective, it\u2019s already material part of our results. I think it\u2019s a critical part of how we differentiate our product against now all of our competitors because we\u2019re the first company to take the robust AI capabilities including machine intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, and offer that to our customers in a unified CRM platform through our sales, service, marketing applications, commerce applications across the board. That has really happened faster than we expected, more deeply than we\u2019ve expected, and it\u2019s been more exciting for our customers than we expected. I think also, the branding choice that we made with Einstein also exceeded our expectations because it let us rapidly communicate to our customers that we\u2019ve extended our core platform with artificial intelligence. As we kind of head towards Dreamforce, you\u2019re going to see a lot of exciting things. With AI, I have seen some amazing things. In financial services, I just saw some amazing things in healthcare; I am not going to go into the details on the call because some of the results are still early. But, we\u2019ve seen some amazing breakthroughs in using artificial intelligence with healthcare. I think this is going to be one of the huge new drivers of growth. You can see that the cloud is a huge driver of growth for Salesforce, mobile is a huge driver of growth for Salesforce, and now you\u2019ve got AI as this next generation system. And every company has to look at what are they using -- what are they doing with AI to make their customer relationship better. I just gave you the story about Louis Vuitton. Einstein is built into all of those apps. And I can tell you that helps that Louis Vuitton account executive when I walk in the store; they are able to give me that next best offer. I think it\u2019s probably one of the reasons that we already closed at Kering Group in this quarter, another incredible luxury brand family with Gucci and Bottega Veneta because we\u2019re able to offer these companies the ability to have much better, much smarter relationships and do it so unbelievably quickly. I also just bought some amazing new sneakers on Adidas and called Primeknit Shoes, checked out some of the stuff they have or some of the stands that tennis shoes or other Yeezy 350s that they have on the Adidas and a lot of the recommendations and capabilities that you are getting already on the platform are through Einstein. So, Einstein is an incredible advancement and it\u2019s great for all of our clouds. And again, I don\u2019t think the other enterprise software companies that moved fast enough into artificial intelligence. Mark Hawkins : And let me pick up the second part of the question, Ross. Thank you for that. A couple of things here, one is our guide. You are absolutely right. We are holding that at $2.6 billion, roughly speaking. Really two things that I would elaborate on. One is that we have a very distinct seasonality in Salesforce. We get a lot of our cash in Q1 and then the other big cash flow quarter is in Q4. And so, at this time, with the line of sight that we have, I think it\u2019s better to wait and get better visibility than we have today. We think it\u2019s a very solid guide and we will revisit that in November, number one. Number two, I would say to you that, I did call a little bit earlier in the call, but I\u2019ll elaborate a little bit. We had deferred commissions, the obligations on that on a cash basis because we had a strong book of business in Q2, having effect in the year even if the expense is capitalized over a longer period of time. And so, obviously, we try to factor things like that into it. I would say the third point is just as a matter of reference, if you look at our trailing 12-month operating cash flow and revenue growth, they are pretty close together, looking back. So, that\u2019s where we are at today. We think it\u2019s appropriate. And lastly, we are managing our CapEx tightly and we will talk again in November. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : Thanks. I\u2019ve got two questions on two backlog numbers. First is the 30% unbilled backlog you put up, that\u2019s a fantastic number because it\u2019s actually accelerating I think over the last couple of quarters, despite that number getting larger. So, I am wondering, if you could offer any added color, maybe there was more multiyear deals, some larger deals? And then secondly is the 18%, 19% 3Q DR growth. I guess this one would be for Mark Hawkins. Mark, you mentioned that\u2019s due largely -- it\u2019s obviously less than normal seasonality. Is it due entirely to the invoicing seasonality, may be something else going on? I know Dreamforce drops in 4Q this year rather than 3Q. Does that pick any zip out of your 3Q DR growth? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Sure. Let me jump in and then maybe Keith or Mark might want to add on the first one and I will close loop on the second one on the 18% and 19%. You are absolutely right, Karl. The unbilled deferred revenue at 30% is a slight acceleration and a very, very big number in terms of growth. We have -- I think it\u2019s really reflective of a strong business that we\u2019ve been describing, that Keith has been describing in his dialogue, a large sort of deals over a long time but just overall health, across geos, [ph] across clouds. Keith, if you want to jump more into that, but I think the 30% is a slight acceleration. Karl\u2019s absolutely right. If you want to add any more commentary, I will circle back to 18% and 19% DR. Keith Block : I think at the end of the day, the strategy around the innovation of our products is very, very compelling and we\u2019re backing it up with incredible execution. So, I want to take you back to our three growth levers of international strategy, speaking the language of the customer, which is the industry orientation of course and our partner strategy. And all of three of those are just executing beautifully right now. We\u2019re very, very proud of the team. And that results in very deep relationships, very strategic relationships, multi-year relationships, multi-cloud relationships across all these different verticals, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing this bit of an uptick. It manifests itself in small companies and large companies, but certainly we\u2019re establishing or we continue to establish these very, very deep multi-year, very strategic relationships with these customers and that\u2019s why you see these financial results. Marc Benioff : Thank you, Keith. And let me just pick up the second point, Karl. In terms of the DR of 18% to 19%, this is really about the deepening invoice seasonality, it just continues. And one of the things that I would call out to everyone and I think just to share with you is that we have 12 years of history on our webpage, our IR webpage with supplemental information that shows every quarter for 12 years and the sequential impact because this has been a topic we\u2019ve been trying to share at Dreamforces for the past several years. But you can actually see the math and even fit in the guide for this quarter, and it really shows us deepening invoice seasonality continues. And the other thing that I would add and I do think there is one little extra bit of color that I would like to add, Karl, which is look at that trending just as it is and then you take a look at the fact that last year in Q2 2017, we had a seasonally soft Q2 2017 and we had a seasonally strong Q3 2017. And so, you put that and you look at that results delivered at minus 9% quarter-on-quarter and you\u2019ll see it perfectly on the graph but then you put it in juxtaposition to this year in Q3 2018, we have a -- obviously we\u2019re appropriately guided and we had a very strong Q2. So, those are the things to think about as well the bottom line and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at, that\u2019s what you should consider. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel Tom Roderick : Thank you for taking my questions. Nice job on the results. So, Keith, you referenced a great third act here in your Marketing Cloud. And if we look at the numbers, I think you said 36% growth, when you strip out the impact of Demandware. So, can you just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving that? What sort of role is the Krux DMP playing here? And then, how is the Demandware integration is going to serve to pull through core growth on the marketing side around the B2C business? Just love to hear little bit more about that. Thank you. Keith Block : So, there is a lot in there. So, I appreciate the question. So, let me just start by saying that we\u2019re absolutely thrilled with the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made. And they have worked out very strategically, not just in our financial results but more importantly with our customers driving success. If you think about the product portfolio and our pivot here towards more vertical orientation, the assembly of Marketing Cloud plus Krux plus Demadware/Commerce Cloud is a very, very nice portfolio. If you think about the companies that we\u2019re doing business with, we talked about Kering, we talked about Carrefour, we talked about Groupe Auchan, we talked about Sephora. I mean, we just continue to bring up quite a roaster of some of the world\u2019s leading retailers. And it\u2019s not just retailers by the way, because every company is trying to go from, for example B2B to B2B2C or directly to B2C, and that\u2019s where they are buying for our vision and what these products bring to bear. So, they are clearly resonating from a transformation perspective with these customers, not just in retail space but in other companies who are trying to become more consumer-oriented. We\u2019re trying to get more insights around their customers or just connecting to the customers, like they have never been able to do before. As far as the integrations are going, we\u2019re thrilled with the way that the integrations have gone. I think we all know that integrations can be difficult, they can be fraught with risk, there is lots of complexities associated with those integrations. And we\u2019ve certainly cut our teeth on a number of acquisitions. And no integration is perfect but I will tell you with Krux and Commerce Cloud, we\u2019re thrilled with the way those integrations have gone. And we continue to invest in those products more than those companies would have invested in themselves had they remained standalone. And again, you\u2019re seeing it with the market penetration. Just to give you an example, Marc alluded to earlier that we\u2019re investing in our second half. Well, one of the things that we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re doubling down on the Salesforce associated with the Commerce Cloud, because we see the opportunity for that particular product. So, the net-net is, I think we\u2019ve assembled a really course at our products whether its Krux across individually, whether its Marketing Cloud which has performed marvelously for us over the last four years or whether it\u2019s a Commerce Cloud acquisition that is resonating with our customers, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing such great results. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : I wanted to get to few areas with both Marks. I will start with you, Marc Benioff. I want to pick your brain on the overall macro backdrop and how you\u2019re seeing in particular the federal vertical? Are you seeing anything going around potential debt ceilings and anything there in regard to the federal strategy? And then, for Mark H. Hi, Mark. I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the channel work we\u2019re doing and finding, which has some nice early ASP uplift from new adopters of Einstein, in particular in services, sales as well. So, I really want to talk to you about, what is your Einstein strategy, where it\u2019s evolving, and how you see that uptake impacting the financials going forward? Marc Benioff : First of all, I think you can see this great win with the Veteran\u2019s administration this quarter is an indication of the government vertical is working better than we expected. We\u2019ve organized by specialized verticals, one I mentioned was financial services and built products there. We\u2019ve also organized by healthcare, we\u2019ve also built products there. Third one is government and we built products there. And I think our win with the veterans this quarter, I think all of us know that nobody delivers better systems and better customer service than our veterans, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited to be able to align with the agency to go to build these next generation systems for them. And I think we started to see government spending come back on line this quarter, really for the first time. And so, we\u2019re very excited about what the future could mean, as the government looks to kind build next generation systems, looks to move to the cloud and provide better service and support to its customers. Mark Hawkins : Okay. And the second part, Sarah, happy to take this well here, and may be, Keith, you might want to jump in too on the channel work that we\u2019re doing. I think the first thing I would say is that Einstein is early days sort. But with that being noted, to your point, we do see opportunity. Some of the Einstein capability is built into all aspects of our cloud. And some of it is incremental SKUs where there is -- the value is such that they\u2019ll be incremental money on those SKUs as well to deliver that specific value. And so, there will be a combination of those two. Everything gets smarter and then some things will have even more SKUs that will create even more solutions for our customers, which obviously, if done well, creates great growth opportunity for us. And that\u2019s the way we think about it and I think that\u2019s the way it will show up in the financials. And Keith maybe want to elaborate a little on that. Keith Block : I want to go back to the Marc\u2019s comments about the veterans administration. Our public sector team is one of our highest performing organizations of the Company. And they\u2019ve had over the last four years -- they have done incredibly well in terms of expanding their capabilities in all branches of the government, both federal and state and local. And that has been very, very exciting for us. I think we all know that the government is trying to undertake some sort of digital transformation. This is nothing new. It actually started under the Obama administration. And the CIO under the Obama administration was one of our former employees. And he was very keen on introducing the cloud to the federal government. So, we\u2019ve just picked that up and continued but it\u2019s clear that the government is really trying to accelerate that digital transformation, and that\u2019s why the veterans administration is yet again another example of trying to drive that transformation, leveraging our technology. Operator : Our last question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Keith, I want to follow-up on a comment you made around AWS and the partnership there in Canada. When we talk to some bigger financial institutions, data privacy has been something has come up as maybe something that\u2019s been a bit of a gluing [ph] machine in terms of feeling comfortable adopting Salesforce. It seems that this partnerships are opening up that. And as you look across other geos, especially with financial services customers. Do you feel like that that partnership is going to give a lot of leverage and hopefully accelerating there some deals that were stuck on some localization questions? Thanks. Keith Block : First of all, thanks for the question, it\u2019s great to hear from you. So, look, we have a great partnership with AWS. They are one of our largest customers. We continue to build that partnership out with them. So, we\u2019re thrilled about that. And of course, we\u2019ve chosen them as our platform in Canada and plan for the second half of the year in Australia. I think there is a lot of synergies there in the eyes of financial services customers as well as other customers outside of the industry. And we\u2019re going to continue to leverage that. Some of these customers already are already AWS customers, so there is a natural comfort level as well. So, look, I think at the end of the day, how a strong partner, having a set of very strategic partnerships is a great thing, obviously AWS is one; we have strong partnerships with others like IBM as another. And those things help to play out very nicely for our customers. But AWS, that relationship is strong and that just gives us a lot of flexibility as we continue to focus and expand internationally. Marc Benioff : Yes. And as you mentioned, IBM, we continue to get more and more integrations with IBM. We\u2019ve had some great early successes with Watson. And our opportunities are to work with all of these amazing companies to deliver a solution that serves our customers. And I think we\u2019ve been probably done a better job I think in forming the strategic alliances and maintaining them than probably any other company in the industry. And I think it\u2019s one of the reasons we had such a great quarter. Well anyway, thank you everyone for a great call. And we couldn\u2019t be more excited, as I said. I think this is probably our best quarter ever. It\u2019s far exceeded our expectations. We\u2019re thrilled to raise guidance for the year and set our next dream as $20 billion, and here we go. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Salesforce Q3 Fiscal '18 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to our host, Mr. John Cummings, SVP of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Doris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal third quarter 2018 results conference call. Our third quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO. And also joining us today is Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer.  As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Also some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Marc Benioff. Marc Benioff : Well, thank you so much, John, and thank you to everyone attending today's earnings call. As we all get in together here and gathering for the call during Thanksgiving week, this is definitely a unique time, and I just want to especially say on behalf of everybody at Salesforce that we have much to be grateful for. We're certainly aware, especially now that we have more responsibility, to focus on helping others, and that was especially felt by all of us at Dreamforce.  Honestly, that's why our thoughts remain so deeply with the victims and those who have lost their homes just this quarter in Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the 6,000 families in our local Bay Area who have lost their homes in these tragic wildfires. And we know that, that's especially difficult as we head into the holidays.  Salesforce, with the help of 80 companies in solidarity on these efforts, is really doing its part. And less than 2 weeks ago with the Band Together concert held in San Francisco during Dreamforce, we, with all of you, helped raise $17 million for the fire victims with 100% of the funds going directly to the families affected, and I wanted to say thank you to all of you for helping out on that. After Thanksgiving, we are going to announce another very exciting new program, and I will ask all of you to help me in raising even more money for these families who have lost everything. So thanks again to all of you who have contributed so much, and thank you to your support in the future as well.  Now as we move on, I want to just say that we've been able to do well in our business while helping those less fortunate than us. And to that end, we are now going to talk about the results for the third quarter, which were a record for Salesforce.  Revenue rose to nearly $2.7 billion, up 25%, and that was just incredible. We are organically adding the revenue of most other cloud companies now every year, and you can see that as we start to deliver guidance for next year.  We have nearly $15.9 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet. That's up 31% from a year ago. In fact, we added more than $3.8 billion to this balance since last year. And based on these strong results, we're raising our full year top line revenue guidance by $40 million to $10.44 billion at the high end of the range, 24% growth this year and delivering durable top and bottom line well into the future. And I think if you look back to where we were a year ago when we first gave guidance for this year, we've dramatically improved what we thought we were going to be able to do, and it's really thanks to our incredible team at Salesforce and to all of our customers and partners as well.  Now looking ahead, we told you Dreamforce for next year, we're now guiding revenue to $12.5 billion. This is at the high end of our range. And I'm especially proud that Fortune Magazine just ranked Salesforce #1 on its inaugural Future 50 list of companies best positioned for breakout growth, and we're very excited about that recognition that we've received and other recognition from them as well just this week. In fact, as the fastest growing enterprise software company ever to reach $10 billion, we are now targeting to grow the company organically to more than $20 billion by fiscal year '22, and we plan to do that, to be the fastest enterprise software company ever to get to $20 billion. As -- and as we continue on this path, we're going to invest in a new generation of leaders at Salesforce to continue to power our growth, and that's why I'm so excited to make this announcement that we have a tremendous promotion. Bret Taylor is taking on the role of President and Chief Product Officer, and Alex Dayon has been also promoted to position of President and Chief Strategy Officer. Both of these tremendous executives are now reporting directly to me and are really a critical part of our management team. And in these new roles, Bret is going to drive our product vision, design, development, go-to-market strategy, and Alex is going to lead strategic initiatives, working more closely with our customers on product direction and transformation. And I'm sure everyone on this call agrees that we are fortunate to have 2 amazing leaders at Salesforce to help us lead this next wave. And Bret is in the room with us, and we're going to talk to him in a second. Alex is on vacation in Asia with his family, but we are just thrilled for both of them.  In closing, I just want to appreciate everything that you have done for all of us. We appreciate everything that -- and know how hard all of you work to make Salesforce successful as well. And also, thank you for coming to Dreamforce. We want to send all of our best wishes to your families for a happy Thanksgiving.  And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Keith. Keith Block : Thanks, Marc, and thanks again for joining us during Thanksgiving week. We appreciate that very much. It was great to be with so many of you at our Investor Day just a few weeks ago at Dreamforce. And those of you who were there saw firsthand the power of the platform to connect companies and their customers, the energy of our Trailblazers and our deep commitment to giving back to our communities as Marc has talked about. And as Marc said, we are clearly building a company for the ages.  Our Q3 results were outstanding, and that's because, every day, Salesforce is helping more and more companies transform and connect with their customers in a whole new way.  Our customers want to deliver next-generation experiences for their customers who are always on, always connected. And to do this, they need a unified CRM platform, and that's what Salesforce is all about. They want industry-leading products in sales, in service, in marketing, in commerce and more, and that's what we've delivered. We've also delivered innovations like Einstein, Lightning and Trailhead that elevate the entire platform. No other enterprise technology company in the world is delivering innovation at this scale, and that's why so many companies, including Hilton, DuPont and MasterCard, are turning to Salesforce as their trusted partner in digital transformation. In addition to delivering these innovative solutions, we continue to fuel our growth through international expansion, speaking the language of our customers and growing our partner ecosystem.  Now as we discussed at Investor Day, we are increasing our investment in our international go-to-market resources, our operations, our infrastructure to deliver the highest-quality service to our customers around the world. We've increased our international headcount nearly 30% annually since FY '14, and year-to-date, nearly 40% of new hires have been made outside the Americas.  In the quarter, Salesforce also went live on AWS in Sydney in Australia, where we recently were named the #1 CRM provider by Gartner. And Amazon continues to be a key partner in our international expansion and a very large customer.  Now speaking of Australia, I'm very excited that, in Q3, we expanded our relationship with National Australia Bank, one of the country's largest financial services institutions. And as you may recall, we closed a significant deal with AMP last quarter, so clearly, we've got great momentum in financial services in Australia and our broader APAC region. We had another very strong quarter in Japan, deepening our relationships with Hitachi, Seven & i, EBARA and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance. APAC continues to be one of our fastest growing regions with 27% growth in constant currency in Q3.  In EMEA, we grew 33% in constant currency. And in the quarter, we expanded relationships with marquee brands, including BP and Groupe PSA, the second largest automotive group in Europe. We also formed a new relationship with another leading car manufacturer in Europe, and they're going wall to wall with Salesforce to manage every aspect of the customer journey from marketing to sales to service. In Q3, we significantly expanded our relationship with a leading global telecommunications company also headquartered in Europe and is leveraging the Salesforce Platform to attract new business, simplify payment to vendors and get a 360-degree view of their customers. So it's pretty clear that our international investments are paying off. Now around the world, speaking the language of our customers is giving us incredible momentum. In fact, 57% of customers who buy our industry products are brand new to Salesforce. And in Q3, we launched the Financial Services Cloud for retail banking to enable banks to deliver highly personalized, intelligent and connected banking experiences for their consumers. We also deepened relationships with PNC, KeyBanc and ING, one of the largest financial institutions in the world. ING is expanding with Salesforce globally to meet their goal of becoming a one platform bank. In fact, today, 17 of the top 20 U.S. and European banks rely on Salesforce.  So we continue to see momentum in other areas, including health and life sciences. Last quarter, I mentioned that 15 of the world's 20 largest pharmaceutical companies rely on Salesforce, and this quarter, we added another marquee customer to that list. And incredibly, we deepened our relationships with 13 of those firms. We also expanded our relationship with Anthem, one of the largest health insurers in the United States.  And in Q3, we closed one of our largest public sector deals to date with the Department of Homeland Security. This follows a large transaction with the VA last quarter. With respect to retail, the holiday season is the most important time of the year as we all know, and 3 years from now Black Friday is expected to be the busiest digital shopping day in U.S. history. I'm sure we will all participate in that. With the addition of Commerce Cloud and Salesforce DMP to our portfolio, we now have an incredible B2C platform that enables our customers to deliver brand experiences that are seamless, connected and personalized. And that's why international cosmetics retailer L'OCCITANE has chosen Commerce Cloud to replace their homegrown e-commerce solution to accelerate their global growth. And finally, as you may have seen at Dreamforce, adidas deepened their relationship with Salesforce in Q3 to drive their global expansion, deliver a hyper-personalized experience that today's customers all expect.  Our partner ecosystem continues to expand, as more than half of the new business today has generated new partners. And Salesforce is the highest growth practice for the top systems integrators. This was not the case just a few years ago, and we continue to build deeper, more strategic relationships with our partners.  At Dreamforce, we announced a new strategic partnership with Google, and that was to connect Google Apps and Analytics with Salesforce, making our customers even smarter and more productive. We also selected Google Cloud Platform as a preferred public cloud provider, and Google, of course, runs their business on Salesforce.  So in closing, I want to express my gratitude to our customers, our partners, our employees for their continued trust in us. And I want to wish those of you in the United States a very, very happy Thanksgiving.  So I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Hawkins, who will outline our financial execution in Q3. Mark? Mark Hawkins : Great. Thanks, Keith. As you've heard from Marc and Keith and as you've seen in our Q3 results, we delivered another quarter of outstanding growth. At Salesforce, we deliver customer success and help our customer grow. And in turn, Salesforce grows as well, and that's what we saw in the third quarter. Revenue grew 25% in dollars and 23% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX tailwind of $39 million. We also saw a sequential FX tailwind to revenue of $12 million.  We delivered a strong year-over-year subscription and support revenue growth across each of our clouds in the third quarter. Sales Cloud continued its strong growth at 17%. Service Cloud reaccelerated to the quarter to 25%. Platform and other also accelerated to 34%. Marketing Cloud, including Commerce Cloud, grew 40%, and keep in mind, this growth is organic as it's the first full quarter comparison with Commerce Cloud in the base period. Commerce Cloud contributed $64 million in subscription and support revenue.  Dollar attrition for the third quarter, which is now including Marketing Cloud, was approximately 10%, which is flat from a year-on-year basis. We expanded our third quarter non-GAAP operating margin by 360 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in sales and marketing and G&A.  Non-GAAP EPS was $0.39, up 63% over last year. Operating cash flow was $126 million, down 18% year-over-year. Our third quarter operating cash flow result was impacted basically by continued invoice and seasonality and the timing of Dreamforce and given the strength of the quarter, higher commission payouts. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $4.39 billion, up 26% in dollars and 24% in constant currency, excluding an FX tailwind of $60 million.  On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of $4 million. The strong Q3 result was driven by deals closing earlier than we had anticipated. Before moving on to guidance, I'd like to update you on the status of the adoption of the new and revised accounting standards, including ASC 606, ASC 340, ASU 2016-01, all of which will be adopted on February 1, 2018. Regarding ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard, we expect the impact of the opening balance sheet as of February 1, 2016, due to the recast of revenues to be immaterial. We are still working to determine the impact to revenue after the opening balance sheet.  For ASC 340, the commission accounting standard, the new standard will require us to capitalize more cost such as payroll tax and amortize them over a longer period than we do today. For new business, we expect to amortize the commissions over a 4-year period rather than over the contract term. ASU 2016-01, which addresses the fair market value of accounting for venture fund investments may result in greater variability in the OIE line of our P&L due to changes in market prices and our publicly held investments and the timing of additional rounds of financing for our privately held investments.  It's important to know that these standards will not have an impact to our operating cash flow.  Moving on to guidance. We are raising our full year 2018 revenue guidance to $10.43 billion to $10.44 billion for 24% year-over-year growth. We're also raising our FY '18 GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $0.12 to $0.13 and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1.32 to $1.33. We remain on track to deliver the 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY '18. We're also maintaining our full year operating cash flow guidance of 20% to 21% year-over-year. For Q4, we're expecting revenue of $2.801 billion to $2.811 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.03 to $0.04 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.32 to $0.33 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 19% to 20%.  Please note, as part of the adoption of ASC 606, we will be providing a roll-forward schedule of billed deferred revenue along with additional disclosures for unbilled deferred revenue. In that context, we do not expect to provide deferred revenue guidance going forward. And as you've heard at Dreamforce, we initiated revenue guidance for fiscal 2019 of $12.45 billion to $12.5 billion based on the current accounting standard. And as a reminder, we will provide operating cash flow, EPS and non-GAAP operating margin guidance for FY '19 when we release our Q4 results in February.  To close, we delivered a very strong financial result on -- in Q3, and I'd like to thank all of our Trailblazers, our employees, our customers, our investors and the community that we serve for their continued support and wish all of you an enjoyable holiday season.  And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : I was just wondering if you could share a little bit. Looking at the trends in your Marketing Cloud business, what do you see as the key drivers of that business accelerating like it has been? And what are you -- I guess, one of the other things, you commented that now your attrition rate includes Marketing Cloud, so -- and that's 10%. Is that the rate we should be thinking of kind of normalized going forward? Marc Benioff : Well, let me take the first part of that, and then I'll turn it over to Mark Hawkins to comment on the attrition rate and how he's calculating that. Yes, I think what we saw at Dreamforce really speaks to this question, and I tried to address this in my opening comments at Dreamforce. But I've had so many incredible experiences with customers but especially in the last 6 months. And I'll tell you that when we look at the transformations that our customers are going through, all of them are trying to connect with their customers in incredible new ways. But for many of those companies, it means that they themselves have to transform and go through what we call this digital transformation. But for so many of these customers, this digital transformation really begins with the customer. And I think you can look at Ducati, where we profiled at Salesforce and at Dreamforce and really look at what is going on with them. Here's an incredible product. They have an incredible community. They have the ability to directly connect with them through the product. And this is transforming Ducati. That's why they would come to Dreamforce and have their CEO there and have the bikes there and show how -- that they don't just have motorcycles. They've got Connected Motorcycles. That is all driven by the Marketing Cloud. It's a one-on-one relationship between Ducati and the consumer, the community, the commerce, the one on one, the ability to have messaging, direct interactions. I think that every company is becoming this -- I don't care if it's a B2B company or a B2C company. Every company's becoming a B2B2C company, and that is driving this forward. And I think if you saw the huge innovation that happened at Dreamforce with the Marketing Cloud especially in regards to Journey Builder and other aspects. And this is actually a great way actually for me to leverage now and to introduce you to Bret Taylor, who's our new Chief Product Officer, who's sitting at the table here with us. And Bret, you and I were just talking yesterday about the huge innovation that's coming in the Marketing Cloud, and it is driving this amazing growth. So can you just touch on that? Bret Taylor : Yes, sure. I mean, the trend we're seeing with so many customers, like Marc mentioned, is not just being a B2B company or a B2C company but sometimes both, whether it's Ducati connecting with their customers or customers that sell directly and sell to distributors. And what I really think is so powerful about the Salesforce Platform is we're the one CRM platform that can do both, whether you're a B2B company, which is where we started or you're a B2C company doing traditional marketing through our Marketing Cloud or you're a company that's a hybrid. The reason our vendors -- the reason our partners are choosing us as their vendor is because we offer a platform that can do both now and also grow them in the future. And it's really unique in these capabilities to truly provide that single view of the customer whether or not you -- they bought their product directly or indirectly. And it's something I think is a real strategic advantage for our product line and the area that we're investing in primarily. Mark Hawkins : Okay. Let me -- if I may just jump in to the tail end of that question, Heather. Also, I mean, obviously, Marketing Cloud was completely covered. In terms of the attrition rate, we've had core attrition that we've been reporting. We added on also Marketing Cloud and Pardot as part of the -- as we keep integrating the different acquisitions, and that trend has been flat year-on-year. So in aggregate, the more aggregated number taking our core plus adding in the Marketing Cloud and Pardot is 10%, and it's stable year-on-year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : My question is for Marc Benioff. Most of your CRM competitors are still relying on the older on-premise technologies or hybrid technologies, and so you had said recently that AI is going to be the future. Do you think those on-premise technologies could suffer a bit just from inability to handle AI if they can't kind of tap into the reservoir of data in the scalable compute capacity to power those algorithms in the way that Salesforce can? And I also wanted to ask, Keith, you mentioned closing one of your largest public sector deals with Homeland Security. Do you think the federal government has finally reached the tipping point where its adoption of cloud and Salesforce is going to begin to move faster? Marc Benioff : Well, I'll tell you, I'm going to tip that question actually to Bret if that's all right with you because I think that he could really address specifically this kind of -- what's happening with AI. Obviously, we've had a tremendous year with Salesforce with AI since releasing Einstein a year ago and now just releasing My Einstein at Dreamforce. We have seen an incredible advancement in artificial intelligence use at our customers. And I think you saw as well in the example I gave in my keynote of a Coca-Cola cooler and the dramatic advances that we can make with technology like that using Einstein Vision, what it means. And I think the speed that we are delivering and onboarding these customers with artificial intelligence, especially using our declarative model, that this has demonstrated to them the -- a lot of the advantages of going to the cloud. But let me tip it to Bret for his perspective. Bret Taylor : Yes. I think your -- the question was spot on. I think the artificial intelligence and the features we're launching with Einstein perfectly capture the power of the cloud. Our customers don't need to buy new hardware. With every release, they get these new capabilities automatically. And that is the power of the cloud. We are constantly re-architecting our systems to incorporate the latest and greatest technologies that our customers can use to transform their businesses. And because it's based on the cloud, it's just as simple as turning them on. And as Marc mentioned, it's not just cloud and on-prem. It's also the way we package them. You heard a lot about -- at Dreamforce about Trailblazers, and what this means to us is taking these technologies and enabling our customers to use them with clicks, not code. And fundamentally, our vision is to broaden the base of people who can adopt these new technologies within their companies beyond just computer programmers and experts and data scientists, but anyone with a domain expertise in their industry can actually adopt these new technologies. I think the combination of that declarative platform that Marc mentioned and that focus on clicks, not code, combined with the benefits of the release capabilities of the cloud, is truly unique to Salesforce in the CRM market. Keith Block : Mark, this is Keith. So just to follow up on the second part of that question, which is really about the public sector, I do believe we are reaching a tipping point. This is an initiative, certainly in this country, where the modernization of technology within the governments has been discussed. I would argue that it was launched really under the Obama administration, and in fact, one of our former employees was a CIO, as you know, of the federal government who was really one of the people who lead the effort of cloud first, which is very important. But now we're seeing increased momentum around this digital transformation. The deal that we signed with the Department of Homeland Security is certainly an indication of the modernization of the government. This is on the heels of the VA that we did last quarter. In fact, I had opportunity to spend quite a bit of time with the VA folks at Dreamforce. And some agencies are ahead of others. I think Homeland Security is ahead of some of the others. Thankfully, I think, we would all say. But I think it is the beginning of the public sector kind of catching up to where the private sector has been going for quite a few years now. So it is pretty exciting around the transformation. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : A question for Keith and a follow-up for Mr. Hawkins. Keith, you used a phrase wall-to-wall deals describing one of the deal that you guys signed this quarter. How prevalent has that become in sort of what you guys are selling today and what's in your pipeline? How often are you guys going for sort of across-the-board the entire suite? And then kind of related for Mark Hawkins, this was a really strong quarter ahead of the seasonality that we've seen in prior years, and these big deals have been pushing more and more business into the Q4. Was Q3 anomalous in terms of sort of going against that seasonality? Or is -- are we seeing just more back half business overall, perhaps not all in Q4? Keith Block : Okay. So let me take the first part of that, and obviously, Mark can respond to it. So what wall to wall really means is a multi-cloud deal. It's a solution that means it includes sales, service, marketing, cloud, community analytics, Einstein, et cetera. Depending on whether it's a B2B customer or a B2C customer, it may include Commerce Cloud and DMP. So as you know, our selling motion is to initially establish a beachhead with Sales Cloud, which is typically a leading indicator of new logos. And we will paint a vision of transformation, and the customer will start with the deployment of Sales Cloud. And then we expand out to the right. And that will typically include Sales Cloud to Service Cloud to Marketing Cloud, et cetera, to Platform. More and more customers are deepening our -- their relationships with us, and it's becoming more and more strategic around embracing this notion of digital transformation, which, again, means more multi-cloud solutions. And certainly, the strategic relationships that we expanded this quarter or established as new are an indication of satisfying that requirement and painting a vision for those customers and driving tangible business benefit. Mark, I don't know if you... Mark Hawkins : Yes, sure. Yes, let me jump into the seasonality. I think, Keith, I think you make a really good point. The first thing that gives you context, we see this persistent trend about evolving seasonality as you're touching on, and at the same time, it's informed in any given period, in any given quarter by what happened in that quarter. And we had a very strong quarter as we talked about. And it's evidenced by our total DR growing 31% in aggregate, and you can see the delta even to what our prediction was earlier, so very strong Q3 '18. And then you put that in juxtaposition to when you look at Q4 and last year's very, very tough compare, and that just adds a little bit of context, which is why the DR guide makes sense, 20% at the high end after applying that context. So that -- I think the pattern is persistent by this context with a very, very strong Q3 and a tough Q4 compare. We feel great about the 20%. We think it's the biggest new business renewal quarter of the year, and we think the guide's appropriate. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : One question for Benioff, one for Hawkins. First, for you, Marc Benioff, as the company becomes larger and larger, you've seen historically in tech core businesses at larger companies get more and more emphasis. In your case, you've got 3 products that are multi-billion-dollar products that you've nurtured organically. So when you look at the opportunity -- the emerging opportunities in business intelligence/analytics and even the products like Quip, how do you, as CEO, make sure that these are nurtured and achieve their full potential, which I personally believe that Quip is an exciting product and we saw it at Dreamforce? How can these products be nurtured to be potentially multi-billion-dollar businesses in the future? And one for Hawkins. When I do a calculation -- rough calculation of your margins, if you reported margins like a perpetual license software company that is taking your bookings and billings, I get about 40-plus percent operating margin adjusted for the fact that you -- if you had been doing business like a perpetual license company. Help us reconcile the margin performance. As it is, it's extremely strong. So at $20 billion in revenue, which is your long-term target, what could your reported operating margins look like? Marc Benioff : Sure. Okay. Well, thank you for that question, Kash. It's something that I think about all the time, which is that we have a rich portfolio of products, and it is constantly getting enhanced and extended and also integrated as we build out our vision of a single CRM platform. And certainly, collaboration is part of that with Quip. And you can see the incredible capabilities, and I know that you were especially impressed with that at Dreamforce. And it's had a huge impact on so many businesses that we have spoken about and talked about, including our own. And Salesforce has a very rich product line in marketing, in commerce, in service, in communities, in sales, in collaboration, like you mentioned, in industries and across all these kind of core capabilities we have that we mentioned some of those on the call already like Trailhead and Einstein and Lightning and IoT and Heroku and Analytics and AppExchange. And there's more to talk about besides that as well. I mean, we could go on. And I think that the way we look at that at Salesforce is that we are managing that full portfolio and moving that full portfolio to our customers and showing them, as they're ready to accept each one of those components, how it can extend and complement and make their connection with their customers so much richer. There's no doubt that the core that we're in, which is customer, is enhanced by each one of those capabilities. And each customer is ready to accept those capabilities at a slightly different time frame, but this has really given us the ability with our direct sales organization to listen deeply to the customer, to understand where they are in their evolution, in their own capabilities and what they're ready to. And if they're not ready to go into sales, we'll show them service. If they're not ready to do service, we'll go to commerce. If they're not ready to go to commerce, we're going to go to collaboration. So we have a full set of cards that we can play and go forward. And Keith, would you want to just touch on that as well and talk about what it's like to sell the full cocktail? Keith Block : Well, I think we're all ready for cocktails. But the -- no, look, the -- customers are ultimately looking for solutions. From internal to external perspective, as we manage the business and as we manage the portfolio, we are big believers in specialization. We organize around specialization, whether it's industry or our product lines so that we can make sure that we bring the best experience and the most rich content we possibly can to the customer. And from a customer perspective, when you think about their buying patterns, they want to buy a solution. If -- every customer is buying technology because they have a business problem to solve. So our job is to paint the vision for the future in a relative industry or relative size customer in a geography and paint that solution, mapping our technology capabilities, bringing the entire portfolio to bear to solve that business problem. And that's what we see every single day. Mark Hawkins : Okay. Kash, let me take the third part of the question here. You had kind of a multi-dimension to that. But the first thing is in terms of your assessment of kind of unit economics, I can't exactly see the analysis that you're doing, but I think we've long affirmed on a unit economic basis that mid-30s operating margin long term is certainly viable. The -- and that's what we're experiencing. Secondly, in terms of Q3, I agree with your assessment, very strong operating margin expanding 360 basis points, good scaling both in sales and marketing and G&A as planned and -- as planned for the year, which keeps us intact for our whole plan for delivering the operating margin percent improvement for the year on higher revenue base of course. And I think that also sets us up for finishing the fourth year in a row of expanding our operating margin consistent with the way we said we would. And as I mentioned, as you touched on to the forward-looking periods for '19, on the call in February, I'll also communicate the fifth year in a row of operating margin expansion at the same time while we've been doing this durable growth and driving this incredible opportunity going forward. As you touched on the last point, which is FY '22, like what to expect, I think the thing that I would say to you is, again, we'll talk about operating margin in '19. But as I said at Dreamforce, if you want to get in the right ZIP Code, you should just think about the kind of operating margin improvement we've been delivering while delivering this durable growth in the last couple of years. I think that's a good reference point. We know that, that will be helpful, and we also know that we have an incredible $105 billion TAM and a great setup in front of us. So hope that gives you the context. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Nemeroff : When you're talking to customers about digital transformation of their customer interactions, what percent of the talks nowadays are with customers that want to discuss their overall digital transformation strategy right at the beginning and go to wall to wall, as Keith described earlier, versus customers that are still only seeking a point product sale? And how has that trend been going over the last couple of quarters? Keith Block : So I'll take this one. Look, the good news is that we have a very, very balanced portfolio. And as we've discussed on the call and Marc and I have seen this over the last 24 months, there is a very accelerated increase in CEO-level dialogue. So that dialogue is all about digital transformation. And in some cases, they have a position on the particular topic, but in many cases, they're asking us for our point of view as I said earlier and for us to paint a vision about what that digital transformation. That is becoming a more, I would say, more frequent dialogue. Now Marc alluded to this earlier. The appetite to digest a full wall-to-wall digital transformation from the first interaction with a CEO is actually very, very rare. Typically, it is we love the vision, we understand what the future brings, whether it's our B2C platform, our B2B platform, what artificial intelligence and Einstein can bring, but let's start off incrementally and prove the value. And then we can go wall to wall. But the level of dialogue has up leveled significantly with respect to what levels in the organization we're talking to and what our capabilities are. I mean, just last week, I was in Europe and met with over 50 CEOs, and the topic was all about digital transformation and how these companies move. So it's becoming more and more frequent. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Terry Tillman with SunTrust Robinson. Terrell Tillman : My question is for Keith. Thanks for the data point earlier in terms of more than half of new businesses coming from partners, and that's up dramatically. Is that an area of leverage you can actually get in your sales and marketing going forward? And maybe you could just give us an update on how productivity is with your Enterprise Salesforce. Keith Block : Yes. So as you know, our whole ecosystem focus on partners is 1 of our 3 growth levers along with industry specialization and the international expansion. And when you think about specifically the SIs, and again, in my trip to Europe last week, I was with the CEOs of 2 of the 5 global firms. They have incredible reach. They're in the boardroom. They're able to paint a vision alongside with us. Many times, we go into the boardroom or with a C-level suite together. But just as important is our ability to drive the success of the customer, and that's where we need these very close relationships with the SIs. So it is a huge leverage point from us in terms of our ability to drive these transformations from both the selling and delivery perspective. And those relationships with the SIs are very, very healthy. Again, we enjoy a 360-degree view -- or, excuse me, relationship with these SIs. The top 5 all run their business on Salesforce. Their fastest growing practices are all the Salesforce practice, which is great news. And some of them, as you know, are actually transforming their own business and becoming ISVs and building product like Accenture has done traditionally and others have talked to us about as well. So it is a huge leverage point. It drives customer success, which is what we're all about. And it's a huge part of our strategy and it's paying off. You can see it in the results. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Adam Holt : It's Adam Holt from MoffettNathanson. I had 2 questions about the very strong revenue, and congrats on that and a terrific Dreamforce. First, Keith, I guess, for you. It sounds like you continue to see good new customer adds out of the vertical business. I was wondering if you could talk about the dynamics of those new customers, either in terms of how big the deals are from a C count perspective and/or the attach rate to some of the other products. And then, I guess, my second question would be for maybe Marc Benioff. We heard a lot of activity around Lightning, Lightning upgrades, Lightning adoption at Dreamforce, and I wanted to get your sense for what that means to your customer base and any comments about the financial impact that, that Lightning migration would be terrific. Keith Block : Yes. Okay, so generally speaking, when we sell a vertical solution or a product, let's say, like Financial Services Cloud, that is more likely to err on the side of the transformation. So those have a tendency to be larger deals, which kind of goes to the second part of your question, which is every time we sell one of these vertical solutions, it drags the other components of our customer success platform. So it may drag Service Cloud. It may drag Sales Cloud. It may drag Analytics. It may drag Einstein. But there is a more likely chance that when we sell one of these products like Financial Services Cloud, that it will drive a pretty substantial sized relationship into the future. So it drives more of a transformation, and it also brings along other products with it. Marc Benioff : I'll just touch briefly on the Lightning, and then I'll tip it over to Bret. Salesforce has done something, I think, really incredible, which is that we've delivered a massive transformation in how we actually interact with our users. And that is moving from our traditional, classic user interface, which we called Aloha, to our amazing new user interface, which we call Lightning. And the power of Lightning, of course, is that it's not just a new user interface. It's an incredible platform. It's an experience. And it's built on an amazing componentized architecture, and our customers absolutely love it. As you saw at Dreamforce, I think every single demonstration that I saw in the show, whether it was on the floor or with customers, was on Lightning. And I think very few companies have gone through this transformation that we've gone through so successfully. It is -- impacted our customers very dramatically, and it still has a lot more value to unleash for our customers, specifically in the application development and deployment area. We have a huge vision for declarative developers, where these executives who maybe are not traditional computer science professionals can build very, very complex, rich customer experiences and deliver those with very high levels of productivity. And I think we're going to see that play out this year. Lightning far exceeded our expectations. We have still a huge amount of work to do to get all of our customers and all of our users up on Lightning, but we have made huge progress already. And Bret, do you want to fill in kind of your vision on where Lightning will go over the next couple years? Bret Taylor : Yes, sure. I mean, the one thing I'd add -- I mean, the one thing to emphasize, as Marc said, is the power of Lightning is it's not just a new interface. It's a declarative platform. And what we've talked about over and over again but it's really important to internalize is this means that people who are experts in their business who are not necessarily experts at computer programming can make meaningful business applications that transform their companies and transform relationship with their customers. So it's truly an enabler. And I think that you heard one of the themes is just helping companies with their change management as they transform their businesses from the classic interface to Lightning. And you saw that in our Dreamforce announcements with the continued investments in Trailhead. Trailhead is our learning platform. And at Dreamforce, we launched a platform called My Trailhead that's enabling companies to customize this learning platform to be accustomed to their businesses. And this is really -- feeds into our company strategies to move to this new platform and also feeds into enabling a broader base with their employees to participate as developers on the Salesforce ecosystem, which is a big part of our Lightning strategy. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Abhey Lamba : Congrats, Bret, for the promotion. So continuing on the theme that you're talking about, Bret, can you talk about 2 to 3 big product initiatives that you think should be at the top of your list as you're starting out in your new role? Bret Taylor : Yes. I would say -- I mean, you're going to hear a lot of the same themes because I think they're truly transformational multiyear. The first is Trailhead. We really do think that our differentiator as a company is the community of people who've been built around it. There's a lot of folks here who have made mid-career transitions into technology because of the power of Salesforce and the power of Trailhead. We do believe it's an on-ramp for more people in our society to benefit from the economic opportunities of technology. And you see that when 170,000 people show up at San Francisco every year. They're there because they've defined their careers on Salesforce, and it really represents the opportunity we think we can provide just to really broad base of people beyond just the select few who have benefited from technology in the past. The second is artificial intelligence. We launched Einstein last year. You saw it was a big part of our Dreamforce announcements this year. We're just at the beginning stages of intelligence's impact on all of our businesses and all of our customers' businesses. We feel an obligation to help our customers navigate this, help employees navigate the changes to their jobs. And we know that as we sort of build not just products but platforms, help companies apply these very complex technologies in very simple ways. And that's always been our vision there. And then the final area of focus is our platform. Businesses use our products because they're customizable and extensible. It applies to our industry solutions that Keith was talking about. This is really the future for our growth, is enabling people not to have a \"one size fits all\" version of Salesforce but truly customize and extend and benefit from this ecosystem around Salesforce. So those are my areas of focus. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : I think questions for Marc Benioff. Was just curious on just geographic expansion with cloud, successful adoption of Amazon in Australia, in Canada. I'm wondering how you're thinking about potentially more aggressively expanding into new countries. I know that may be just part of the calculus there but be curious if we should expect more aggressive outside of the fairly limited countries that you've done over the last decade or more. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks for that question. I think you saw at Dreamforce, we dramatically expanded our relationship and alliances across the level. You mentioned Amazon, which is a strategic alliance for Salesforce, and we have turned on our Canada and Australia data center. We also have announced a strategic relationship with Google, and the intention there is to be able to turn on additional countries as well. And we also have strategic relationships with other key providers that are extending our technology, infrastructure and capabilities, including key companies like IBM and Dell and Cisco. And when we look at these opportunities to partner with these companies, it gives us tremendous flexibility in how we deploy our infrastructure, whether it's natively here or whether it's on one of their platforms. And we have made tremendous gains in the ability to deploy Salesforce in a variety of clouds and capabilities, and this, of course, is completely transparent to our customers. The most important thing to our customers is that we give them the reliability and availability and security and foremost, the trust that they expect from us. And then we can deploy that through a variety of capabilities. So I think that, that's still very much an evolving process for our company, as many of these companies, they have so many new capabilities now for us to be able to take advantage of. And we're able to do that in many, many exciting new ways. Bret, do you want to -- you've been spending a lot of time studying this. Do you want to add to that? Bret Taylor : No. I think the main point is we're really excited to partner with all of these different vendors so that we can essentially apply the best infrastructure strategy for the region and customer that we're deploying in. And that kind of flexibility I consider a strategic advantage, and expanding partnerships has been a great opportunity to have more flexibilities and move forward. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Jennifer Lowe : Bret, first, congrats on the promotion. And I wanted to ask a little bit in the context of both Bret and Alex moving into more senior roles, C-level roles in the organization. Should we read anything into that in terms of the relative -- I mean, obviously, you're a product-centric company and always have been. But is there any sort of shift in how you're thinking about the investment in product or product management? And how should we think about their roles relative to what Parker Harris will be doing? Marc Benioff : That's a great question. So I think that we continue to make very significant investments in our innovation. I think that's one of the reasons why you saw both Forbes and Fortune say that Salesforce.com is the most innovative company in the world this year and why we have been selected on those most innovative list probably more than any other company in our industry in the last 5 years. And we continue to make both organic innovation. And you've seen us, and I think Bret is a great example of this, bring in organic innovation into our company as well. Even Alex Dayon is an example of that. Both Alex and Brett were CEOs of companies that we acquired. And I think as Parker and I have run the company together over the last 18 years, we continue to have what we call beginner's mind when it comes to innovation. That is we're constantly amazed at all the technology and innovation and capability that is coming through our industry, and we look at how can we use that technology, whether we build it internally or whether it's coming externally to benefit our customers. And that philosophy has really benefited us really dramatically, and we've tried to stay away from traditional kind of NIH type environments, not -- which kind of NIH stands for not invented here and kind of be open to new executives and new companies, new technologies coming to Salesforce. Parker continues to run, and as our Chief Technology Risk Officer, responsible for all aspects of technology and engineering. He's my Co-Founder of the company and runs all of our engineering efforts and infrastructure efforts. Bret is our Chief Product Officer and President and Chief Product Officer now. And he is responsible for the overall product management org and marketing organization and as well as clarity of all the products that we're building and responsibility for defining those products and delivering those products. And Alex is now taking on a new responsibility that I feel is extremely important for the company, which is why I asked him to take this position, which is our Chief Strategy Officer, to help us to map out not to $20 billion because we have short-term clarity to that but really, beyond that, that Salesforce just has so much potential that as we really map out to become, I think, an extremely large company from where we are now, we need to have an executive team completely dedicated to mapping out the future. And Alex is going to be absolutely amazing in that role and has been -- done an incredible job since we first acquired his company. I think it's almost been a decade ago. So I want to congratulate both Bret and Alex on that, and Parker and I could not be more thrilled to -- with the state of our technology. And I don't think that there's a better mirror of that than Dreamforce, where, as Parker and I walk through together at the show, we were just amazed at the level of customer success. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. James Wood : I wanted to touch on Service Cloud. You've had some leadership changes over the last couple of years. You've had some evolving product focus, but you just reported a nice reacceleration in growth. So could you update us on the priorities to drive growth in Service Cloud and maybe what you've done recently to help strengthen that? And then a follow-up on Europe. We saw that highest growth in 3 years. You guys clearly are investing a lot in Europe. I'd be curious how much do you think the strength out of Europe is due to your own investments and how much is due to the macro or greater adoption of cloud in that region. Marc Benioff : Okay. I'll take the Service Cloud question, and then I'll throw it to Keith on Europe since he was there last week. I think on Service Cloud, this remains an incredibly exciting opportunity. I expect some of the acceleration numbers that you saw this quarter to continue for the next couple of quarters, and I'd be disappointed if they didn't. I -- Service Cloud has had a huge year for us this year, and we have some just amazing things happening with Service Cloud. You saw that at the show, especially in regards to some of the next-generation capabilities of customer service, including this idea of bots and Einstein bots that there's not just kind of traditional call center environment, not just the traditional customer service portal but that an incredible new customer channel is emerging with bots. So we're going to see that be a huge part, I think, of Service Cloud. Service Cloud has done a phenomenal job becoming the #1 customer service solution in the world not only by revenue but also rated by Gartner in their customer engagement Magic Quadrant. And as -- has grown so fast, you've seen a kind of an acceleration of that management team and growth of that management team. So as it went from 0 to $100 million, it had a different management team. In fact, that was run by Alex Dayon at the time, went from $100 million to $1 billion. It had a different management team as it went from $1 billion to $2 billion. And now as it goes from $2 billion to $5 billion, I expect it will continue to accelerate and grow. And that management team just changed again, and we couldn't be more excited with the team that we brought in to run Service Cloud. And I'll turn it over to Keith. Keith Block : Yes. Just a quick comment on that as well. Listen, the innovation around Service Cloud has been fantastic. I think the product team has done a wonderful job. If you talk to any company, one of the ways that they differentiate themselves is service. And certainly, another accelerator on that business has been field service Lightning. KONE was prominently -- and the CEO of KONE was prominently on display at Dreamforce, talking about their own transformation and how they're leveraging field service. In fact, they're co-innovating around that product with us. So that has certainly helped accelerate our Service Cloud growth. With respect to Europe, again, I did my European tour last week, hitting 5 countries, and it was very interesting in talking to these CEOs. I think it's pretty clear that when you look at the macro environment, at least the governments, what's going on in the U.K., what's going on with the Germany -- in Germany, it's a little bit of uncertainty. So our great performance in Europe is just incredible execution. There is clearly a need and a thirst for digital transformation. There is a need and a thirst for customer engagement. That's why you have companies like adidas and KONE and ING and others in all these great industries and these great brands that want to take a step into the move or -- move -- future, excuse me, around this digital transformation. So it's great execution. It is a thirst for moving into this new era that we're in, this new fourth industrial revolution. And I don't believe this has anything to do with lift or any particular headwind one way or the other with the macro environment. We are just executing and taking share. I mean, if you look at the overall market data, again, IDC market data suggests that we are growing 3x that of the CRM market. So it's -- again, I think it speaks volumes about our products, our customers, our partners and our employee execution. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : Two for Mark Hawkins. Mark, can you briefly elaborate on the decision to no longer give DR guide? What is it about 606 that makes the DR visibility change to that extent? And then secondly, do you mind just touching on the seasonality of cash flow? Obviously, the same thing happened last third quarter when cash flow was a bit light and then you ended up crushing it in the fourth quarter. Apart from maybe Dreamforce dropping in 3Q this year, is anything else changing the cash flow seasonality that you can call out as we think about 4Q free cash? Mark Hawkins : Sure, happy to do so, Karl. Thank you. First of all with ASC 606 for the new revenue standard, that would be live on the 1st of February. The key thing there is we will have a roll forward for the billed deferred revenue. That's for sure. And then we're also going to provide some information on the unbilled DR, so you'll have the information that you need. Obviously, things are changing, and the standard is such that the new information will be what you need effectively. So I don't know how to explain it better than to say that, fundamentally, the standard has changed. We're going to give good visibility to the information people need, and the world has just fundamentally changed in terms of what is expected, including the roll-forward balance sheet. That's the first thing I would say. The second thing I would say is in terms of the seasonality of the operating cash flow, you're absolutely right, Karl. You can see it on the compounding and the attachment on the IR slide deck, that continued compounding on the invoicing side and how that impacts, obviously, cash flow. The thing that I would say to you that's a little bit special this quarter, special context, if you will, a, you touched on Dreamforce timing. And then, b, you know we had a very, very strong quarter as evidenced by 31% growth in our total DR, both billed and unbilled, and there's commissions that come with that strong performance and including those commissions, have an impact on our cash in the short term. But the thing that I would say to you is the cash flow guidance is intact for the year. We're going to deliver the guidance that we had promised, and there's just a little bit of wiggle due to a couple of these different factors. That's what I would say. Operator : That's all the questions we have in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Marc Benioff. Marc Benioff : Well, thank you very much. And in closing for the call, I really want to appreciate all of you who have joined us during Thanksgiving week and taking your time. And I wish all of you and your families the very best for this holiday weekend, and I hope that you all have a healthy and safe Thanksgiving. At Salesforce, we have always been a company that believes in doing well and doing good, and as you know, that's because we're committed to a core set of values, trust, growth, innovation and the equality of every human being. And I'll tell you that it sees values and it's reminded at this time of Thanksgiving as much as these incredible technologies that bring so many amazing people, partners and yes, you, as well our investors, to Salesforce. You also know that's why 171,000 people registered for Dreamforce this year, the amazing energy that was there, incredible experience with so many people, and an additional almost 11 million people viewed it online with us. We're aspiring to build a company for the ages and a brand and a culture that will make the world a better place not simply for another quarter or another year but for decades to come. So with all of that, I want to thank you again for attending the call and to have a happy Thanksgiving. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

So with that, let me turn the call over to you, Marc. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: All right. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that, John. And I just want to congratulate our entire company and all of our shareholders and investors on just what has been an outstanding Q4, and this has really capped off just a truly record year for Salesforce. This has also just been an outstanding quarter of growth. You can see that we have propelled Salesforce over $10 billion revenue milestone, and we couldn't be more excited about that and having that fiscal year behind us because now our vision has never been bigger or more exciting as we have a very clear trajectory to $20 billion in revenue. No other enterprise software company has achieved this scale faster. Certainly, no other enterprise cloud applications company has achieved this scale faster, and it's our dream to get to $20 billion faster than anyone else. It's been a relentless focus on our customer success. And not just customer, but also all of our community, all of our employees, our customers, our partners, all of our key stakeholders, and the development of just an incredible culture that has allowed us to scale this organization and continue to strengthen our position as the world's number one CRM. There has been incredibly strong demand and execution, especially this quarter, across every industry, across every region, cloud, all customer segments, and as we get through this opening comments, I'm sure you will agree this may be perhaps our best quarter ever. We're on a path to exceed $20 billion faster than any other enterprise software company in history, and we're all very proud of that. Salesforce is number one today in CRM, which is the fastest growing segment of the enterprise software industry. Fiscal year 2018 revenues finalized out at $10.48 billion, up 25%, and that 25% obviously dramatically above where we thought we were going to be when we first gave you a forecast more than a year ago, 24% in constant currency. We're delighted with that result. Q4 revenue of $2.85 billion, up 24% year-over-year, 21% constant currency. But perhaps what we're most excited about and speaks to the velocity of the company, more than $20 billion of booked business on and off the balance sheet, up 40%, and that exceeded our expectations. Deferred revenue of $7.09 billion, up 28% year-over-year, and 25% in constant currency; unbilled deferred revenue of $13.3 billion, up 48% year-over-year; Q4 operating cash flow of $1.05 billion, up 49% year-over-year; and fiscal year 2018 operating cash flow of $2.74 billion, also up 27% year-over-year. We are also then able to raise our full year fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance by $150 million, bringing us up to an expected consistent growth rate projected over the next year of more than 21%. Great companies do more than create great products and great services. Companies like Salesforce build trust with all of their stakeholders, with our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, all of our community, or as we say at Salesforce, our Ohana, our family. That's how we're running Salesforce from the beginning. We establish trust as our number one value. Putting our values in action, we're making our customers successful and improving the state of the world at the same time. And I have to say, I'm here in New York today, just went through our Salesforce tower here in New York. New York is our largest market in the world. Incredibly exciting what's happening here, and when I see all these incredible people working at Salesforce, they're truly the best and brightest that I've seen. It's why we're recognized now by Fortune as the number one best place to work in the world. That is incredible for us. And also Fortune published earlier their Most Admired Companies list in the world, and we were ranked the 15th Most Admired Company in the world. And Forbes said we're the most innovative company in the year and their innovator of the decade. We couldn't be more pleased. And we could not have done it without all of you. We realize that we are all one family working together. And we're very grateful. And we're looking forward to an amazing fiscal year 2019 ahead of us. So with that now, let me turn this over to Keith Block in San Francisco. And Keith will give you a perspective of how the company is operating. Keith, as you know, is our Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. Keith? Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Hey. Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everybody. As you've already heard, we delivered just an outstanding fourth quarter to complete an exceptional year. We saw accelerating demand and strong execution coming from every industry and every region and every cloud and across all of our customer segments. More than ever, CEOs are coming to Salesforce because we fuel their growth, and we are fueling their transformation. Salesforce continues to be mission critical to the world's greatest companies, and our strategic relationships are deeper than ever. In fact, we have nearly twice as many $20 million-plus relationships than we did just one year ago. Twice as many. And our execution in Q4 was as strong as I've ever seen in my career. We closed more new business in Q4 than we did in the entire fiscal year of 2014. That is just four short years ago, and it speaks volumes to the momentum that we now have in the market. We are closing more big deals every quarter. In fact, the number of million-dollar-plus deals grew 43% in Q4. And our average deal size continues to expand. Also in the quarter, leading companies, including Siemens and ABB and Google turned to Salesforce to help them transform and grow. Now as you know, international expansion is one of our key growth levers. And we delivered very strong growth in the quarter, 31% in EMEA and 26% in APAC in constant currency. In EMEA, ABB, one of the world's leading industrial technology companies, went all-in with us this quarter, and they're using Salesforce to get a broader understanding of their customers across sales, service and marketing. Einstein AI is going to enable them to drive smarter sales and build deeper customer relationships. ABB also has an incredible vision to combine the power of Salesforce with ABB Ability and their industry-leading digital offering that enables 70 million connected device. Very, very strong partnership with ABB, and we are thrilled to continue to grow along with them. We also formed a new relationship with Deutsche Bahn, which is the world's second largest transportation company. And we expanded our relationship with BBVA, who is rolling out our financial services cloud for retail banking to more than 24,000 advisors. We also formed a new relationship with one of the largest insurance groups in Europe, and they're going wall-to-wall with Salesforce to get a complete view of their business. And also to increase their employee engagement and deliver a seamless customer experience across all of their brands. Great success in EMEA. Also moving over to APAC, we continue to see just excellent momentum in financial services, specifically in Australia, where we are deepening our relationship with AMP, a leading wealth management company. We also had one of our largest platform deals in APAC with an exciting company called Coin (10:54). If you're not familiar with Coin (10:56), they're innovating and scaling their cryptocurrency exchange on the Heroku platform. And in Japan we had another very strong quarter of incredible growth and strengthened our relationship with companies like Nissan and Amada. So really to capture the opportunity in front of us, we continue to increase our international go-to-market resources, operations and infrastructure to make sure that we can serve our global customers and continue our enterprise scale. In fact, in FY 2018, nearly 40% of our new hires were in regions outside the Americas. Now turning to industries, we also had a very strong performance across the board, but specifically in financial services. Now 18 of the top 20 U.S. and European banks rely on Salesforce. And in fact, in Q4, nearly half of those banks expanded their business with us in the quarter. Half of those banks expanded their business with us, again something that we're very, very proud of. That includes a significant expansion with one of the world's largest banks in the world, which will be deploying Financial Services Cloud across all their retail branches. TD Bank also selected Financial Services Cloud for retail banking to streamline their mortgage application process for customers. In addition, we expanded our relationship with Transamerica. They are extending Salesforce to an additional 60,000 insurance agents to give them a unified view of their clients. We also expanded with Pacific Life and MassMutual. In healthcare, we expanded our relationship with Anthem as well as another Fortune 50 healthcare company, who is using Service Cloud to better understand patient needs and provide more personalized care. We also deepened our relationship with the Cancer Treatment Centers of America, which is using Health Cloud to improve patient outcomes. Now you're going to hear more about our innovative healthcare customers and partners in Las Vegas next week at HIMSS, which is the country's largest healthcare technology conference. As for our ecosystem, Salesforce continues to be the growth lever for our partners, and more than 55% of our new business is generated with our partners. And at the close of FY 2018, our partners surpassed 110,000 Salesforce certifications. This is an increase of more than 30% over last year. Today, we have strategic partnerships with industry leaders, including Dell, IBM, Amazon, and in FY 2018, as you know, we went live on AWS infrastructure in Canada and Australia. And at Dreamforce, which was absolutely outstanding, we announced a new strategic partnership with Google to connect Salesforce with Google Cloud and Google Analytics to enable a smarter, more collaborative experience for customers. On the topic of integration, as you know, this past year we were focused on making sure that we integrated the incredible companies that we acquired in FY 2017, including Demandware. I will report, this is going very, very well. In fact, during the 2017 holiday season, the Commerce Cloud touched 540 million unique shoppers. Commerce Cloud is now one of the largest commerce environments of the world, alongside major marketplaces such as Amazon and Alibaba. Now Marc also mentioned that trust is our number-one value. It's obviously very, very important to us. But innovation is a core value as well, and in the fourth quarter, we rolled out our Spring '18 release to all of our customers which has over 300 innovations, including exciting enhancements to the Lightning platform and new Einstein innovations across our clouds. And speaking of Einstein, we are seeing tremendous momentum, and we just hit an incredible milestone producing over a billion predictions in a single day, and nobody but Salesforce can deliver these deep customer insights at scale. So it's very, very exciting with that momentum. Finally, I want to give a quick update on the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which will come into effect on May 25. We welcome the GDPR as an important step for customers to strengthen their privacy programs, and we are committed to helping our customers prepare for it every single day. So in closing, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees for their continued trust in us, and for contributing to just an outstanding Q4, and just great full year results. So thanks everybody for that. And now I'd like to turn it over to Mark Hawkins, who will talk about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Great. Thanks, Keith. And as you've heard, we delivered another year of outstanding financial performance. We posted strong top line and operating cash flow growth, and we importantly delivered non-GAAP operating margin expansion for the fourth consecutive year. This was particularly significant, given the exceptionally strong new business we achieved in the fourth quarter. Let me discuss the highlights of Q4 and FY 2018. The fourth quarter revenue grew 24% in dollars and 21% in constant currency, excluding the year-over-year FX tailwind of $64 million. We also saw a sequential FX tailwind of $8 million. For the full year, revenue grew 25% in dollars and 24% in constant-currency. We drove strong year-over-year subscription and support revenue growth across each of the clouds in the fourth quarter. Sales Cloud grew 16% and exited the year at $3.7 billion in terms of the run rate. Service Cloud grew 28% and is now at a run rate of more than $3.1 billion. Platform and Other grew 37% and is now at a run rate of more than $2.1 billion. And Marketing and Commerce Cloud grew 33% and is now at a run rate of nearly $1.6 billion. Each of these clouds benefited from an FX tailwind that was similar to our revenue tailwind of approximately 3%. Dollar attrition for the fourth quarter, including Marketing Cloud was slightly below 10%, which is an improvement over last year. Turning to margin, you may recall in November we discussed the dynamics of increased operating margin pressure associated with accelerating growth during our Analyst Day presentation. We refer to this as model leverage. This is exactly what transpired in the fourth quarter, as we saw an acceleration in our new business year-over-year and therefore incurred higher commissions and other selling-related expenses. In addition, there's four factors impacting our selling cost; first, our enterprise strength; secondly, our strength in our international businesses; third, the investment and the strength in our newly acquired businesses; and then fourth, the acceleration of our sales hiring. In that context, we're pleased to drive operating leverage in the business, and as a result we delivered 128 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement for the full year. The fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.35, up 25% over last year. For the full year we delivered $1.35, up 34% over FY 2017. EPS benefited by approximately $0.02 in the fourth quarter related to net realized gains from our strategic investment portfolio. Q4 operating cash flow was $1.05 billion, up 49% year-over-year. For the full year we delivered $2.74 billion, up 27% over last year. This translated to an operating cash flow yield of 26.1%, which was up slightly over FY 2017. CapEx for the year was $534 million or approximately 5.1% of revenue, down from 5.5% in FY 2017. CapEx primarily consists of leasehold improvements followed by global data center investments. For FY 2019 we expect CapEx to be approximately 5% of revenue. Turning to free cash flow, and that's defined as cash flow less CapEx, this was $914 million in the fourth quarter, up 63% over last year. And I'm very pleased to report that our full year free cash flow was $2.2 billion, up 30% over FY 2017. Deferred revenue ended the year at more than $7 billion, up 28% in dollars and 25% in constant currency, excluding an FX tailwind of $130 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of $56 million. Our unbilled deferred revenue ended the quarter at approximately $13.3 billion, up 48% over last year. And let me elaborate on those results. In addition to a very strong quarter of new business that we discussed, we also had a very strong renewals quarter, including some of the largest renewals in our history. Looking at our top 10 customers up for renewal in Q4, eight of the 10 expanded their relationships with us in this quarter. Both of these factors drove this outstanding growth in our billed and unbilled deferred revenue. Moving on to guidance, coming off our record fourth quarter we are raising our full year 2019 revenue guidance to $12.6 billion to $12.65 billion, up 20% to 21% year-over-year growth. Our performance in FY 2018 and especially the fourth quarter reinforces our confidence and our ability to reach our long-term target of $20 billion to $22 billion in revenue by FY 2022. With consistent, durable growth guided for FY 2019, we expect to deliver 125 basis points to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY 2019 driven by continued improvements in operating leverage. We are lowering our fixed long term projected non-GAAP tax rate to 21.5% for FY 2019 from 34.5% in FY 2018, primarily due to the new U.S. Tax Act, and this rate reflects our currently available information. Due to our ongoing analysis for the Tax Act over the measurement period, as well as the rapidly evolving international tax environment and the operations of our business, this rate is subject to change. We expect other income and expense to be roughly flat year-over-year when excluding the net realized gains from strategic investments recognized in FY 2018. Keep in mind that with the adoption of ASU 2016-01 in Q1, there may be additional OIE volatility as we mark-to-mark our investments as required. We are initiating our FY 2019 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.61 to $0.63, and a non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $2.02 to $2.04. We expect the full year fiscal 2019 operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year. For Q1, we're expecting revenue of $2.925 billion to $2.935 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.09 to $0.10, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.43 to $0.44. Turning to deferred revenue, as we transition from ASC 605 to ASC 606 in Q1 we will no longer be reporting or guiding to deferred revenue. However, for consistency, we want to provide you with a bridge to the first quarter until we report under the new accounting standard. In that context, we expect our year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 23% to 24% in Q1. Let me remind you that these results in our guidance are all under the prior accounting standards, including ASC 605 and pre-revision ASC 340. We expected to provide our updated Q1 and FY 2019 guidance, including revenue and EPS under the new and revised accounting standards in the first quarter. So to close, our fourth quarter results drove an outstanding finish to the fiscal 2018, including our fourth consecutive year of non-GAAP operating margin improvement. I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, and yes, our shareholders as well for your continued support. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. John Cummings - salesforce.com, inc.: Erica, we can begin the Q&A portion. Thanks. Operator : And your first question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to congratulate you on that unbilled backlog number of $13.3 billion. That's amazing. And maybe it's a two-parter, maybe for Keith. Keith, what's causing the unbilled to ramp so high? I know Marc mentioned a lot of renewals. But are these larger deals, longer term contracts that are contributing to that? And then maybe for Mark Hawkins, we don't know what the duration of that unbilled backlog is. Can you offer any color as to how it'll roll into deferred revenue in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020? Thank you very much. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah. Hi, this is Keith. So thanks for the question. I mean, there's a few things here that I think are really contributing to what's going on here. And at the end of the day, it really comes back to the strategic relationships that we're driving with these customers. They are more deeper, they are more meaningful relationships. We're driving their digital transformations, and that results in more large contracts than ever, more large customers than ever, longer contracts in terms of duration, and a lot of multi-cloud solutions, because we're selling solutions and not so much features and functions. So all those are certainly contributing to the financial metrics that you're referencing in your question. But at the end of the day, these are deeper, longer relationships with these customers, and that's why the deals are longer and we're seeing the renewals, which obviously is a huge, huge indicator of their confidence in our solutions, and in our partnerships. And we've had a record number of very large renewals as well. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah, and I'll just add on to Keith's point. I totally agree. The deeper and strategic relationships, people want to go longer and bigger with us, as you can see with the numbers. In terms of earl (25:07) specifically, the duration for unbilled DR, that duration is up slightly, about a month. Operator : And your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Congratulations on a spectacular finish. It's been, what, 13 years, 14 years since you went public. Question for Marc. As you look at other large technology companies in software, without naming names, they have had a hard time getting to $20 billion in revenue and maintaining very solid growth rate. How do you think, how should we think about salesforce.com given your organic revenue target of $20 billion? How much can the company continue to grow at an exciting enough pace capitalizing on all the innovation that you see in the industry? What is different about this cycle versus the older peers that have struggled to maintain that kind of growth? That's it from me. Thank you. Congratulations. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, thanks Kash. And I'll really just start out by congratulating Keith and his whole organization, because honestly I've just never seen a quarter like this. This was a blow-out quarter. And just the performance of that organization and their acuity, capability to deliver was shocking even to me. And it shows up right there in that number, and you can see it right there in front of you now. I've been really excited to be able to talk about that with you, more than $20 billion of booked business on and off the balance sheet, up 40%. There is no way we could have said that to you a year ago. That is beyond our expectation, and it really has to do with the performance of the organization, number one. Number two, and this really gets to your point, I think that \u2013 and I had dinner last night with 20 Fortune 100 CEOs here in New York, which is one of the reasons that I came to town. And of course, we're all on a very fast moving economic freight train. We've seen incredible increase in investment activity with our customers, especially accelerated with these tax cuts. That has been amazing to us. But squarely in the center of each and every one of their consciousness is the digital transformation that their company is going through. It doesn't matter if they're a consumer product goods company CEO or financial services or retail or any industry or any geography. Every CEO is thinking about their digital transformation. And I think you and I know that every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. This is very powerful. And it's why we have so much activity in our company. Of course, we're the number one customer company in the world. No other company in the history of the software industry has been as focused on customer-relationship management, but how companies can have a customer transformation at Salesforce. And this, and this alone, focus, has accelerated our growth. You can see that in the numbers. So certainly how we finished our year in fiscal year 2018 is not where we thought we would start. We raised guidance I think almost in each and every quarter, and yet we still ended up above that. And that's why we've raised again here $150 million. This is the most we've ever raised in the history of the company, because we're just ahead of where we thought we would be. So we are, obviously $10 billion is now behind us, and $20 billion is ahead of us. And it's our dream, we're going to be the fastest to $20 billion. But when you have $20 billion already on and off the balance sheet, you know that that is \u2013 we're a huge step on the way there. So that's what I couldn't be more excited about the position the company is in, its competitiveness, its ability to perform, the quality of its customer relationships, the quality of the products, the integration of the acquisitions, the culture, Fortune number 1 best place to work. All of these things have come together in just a really beautiful way, and I'm extremely grateful. Operator : And your next question comes from Richard Davis from Canaccord. Richard Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, thanks very much. Just kind of a strategy question. So if you think about it, whatever, 15 years ago no one thought software companies could run hardware, and then today you have Amazon, Google, Microsoft with kind of cloud computing systems. So the question that I wrestle with is, right now you guys kind of use those compute layer firms for surge capacity, you and others. But why or why not would it make sense for Salesforce to push out most of its compute mode to these specialists? Does that ever make sense in the future? Just kind of thinking about full circle in terms of evolution? Thanks. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah. Well, I think that the way to think about that is, we have a comprehensive integrated approach. And where it makes sense to use infrastructure, for example, in a country like Canada or Singapore, we have tremendous relationships with organizations like Amazon and Google, where we're going to do that. Even during the quarter we've announced that we're going to be using \u2013 IBM has become one of our preferred cloud providers. That's appropriate to have our ability to operate proprietary data centers like we do here in the United States. We also use that infrastructure, for example, underneath one of our core platforms, Heroku, as you know, which has become one of the largest application development capabilities in the world. And we are also live on Amazon in Canada and Australia. So we will use the correct provider at the correct time, whether that's us or whether that's Amazon, Google or IBM. Operator : Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Marc, listening to your comment about the macro, I guess I'm wondering, how far back would you have to go to find a time that you were equally as positive on the demand environment? And I guess the second question is just, with Einstein being embedded more and more into your product set, how do you see monetization evolving? Thank you. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, Einstein, let's start there. I mean we're ahead of our predictions there also, and that's what Einstein's all about. We are doing I think it's more than a billion predictions a day with Einstein already. So our systems are dramatically enhanced through our deep machine intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning architecture, known as Einstein, Salesforce Einstein, which has become a critical part of our CRM, first and foremost, highly differentiated against our competition, who has yet to be able to put in artificial intelligence of a quality, capability and scale that we have it deeply integrated into our application set across the board, whether you're using Commerce Cloud like Adidas is, whether you're using Sales Cloud like Cisco is, or whether you're using an incredible product like Service Cloud like Intuit is, Einstein is in there now. And customers love it because it just makes their employees better. It's the perfect use case for artificial intelligence, enhancing human performance. And we're going to do a lot more of that. We've only really been at this now for about a year, but it's going far better than we expected, and we'll continue to enhance and extend our artificial intelligence capability. In regards to the overall demand environment, and my personal experience is with Chief Executive Officers over the last month in both international, specifically in Davos where I was with hundreds of CEOs, or in other business forums here domestically where I've also been with hundreds of CEOs, I can empirically tell you I have never seen a demand environment like this. I cannot quantify that. I can just tell you that every CEO is using the positive economic environment, but also the domestic tax cuts as ways to accelerate their digital transformations, and it is putting it number one on all of their list, which it should be. And this is really exciting for us and for others, of course. But for a company like us, we can help these companies get connected with their customers in a whole new way. And that is, we have the ability, we have the great products and we have the distribution capacity to be able to directly address them. I hope that answers your question, Heather. Operator : And your next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. A question I have is on the enterprise business, and I think it's mainly for Keith but maybe for Mark Hawkins too. Keith, from our work, that enterprise business really started to kick in a little more than 2 years ago. And one of the nice things about this segment is that, when you become a strategic vendor or partner to your customer, some of the stuff that Marc Benioff was talking about, in time they come back and they buy more from you, which is often the form of add-on large deals again, and whether it's more seats or more products. And you talked about this happening in financial services, but we're also hearing about it in your other vertical focus areas. I guess the question is, shouldn't those add-on or follow-up deals essentially be more efficient captures, and for instance, perhaps requiring a shorter sales cycle? Shouldn't this at least directionally be more profitable over time? And I realize you've already given guidance, Mark Hawkins has, and you have other investments to make. But just on this particular, I just want to make sure I understand how this should evolve over time. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yes. Hi, John. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Hey Keith? Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yes? Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Before you jump in on that, I just want Mark to specifically address that because... Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Yes, happy to do so. And John, thank you for the question. In fact, we are raising our profitability, as we talked about. This is the \u2013 I just guided the fifth year in a row of expanding the profitability. One of the things that we see kind of akin to what we talked about at the Dreamforce Analyst Day is that there are some costs incurred with growth basically that impact the short-term, but we still were able to expand our operating margin. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, what happens when we blow out a quarter like we did in Q4, Mark? Does that impact then the amount of profit we show for that quarter? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: In fact, it does. What happens is we'll take go-to-market expansions like commissions and that type of thing in the short-term, and now you'll see that show up. And then basically what we have is great long-term economics that are going to \u2013 that benefit. So one of the things that I would say is... Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: So what you're saying is, you'll see if we have a great quarter in expansion, for revenue for example, but in in-quarter expense for commission is also \u2013 it expands. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: This is exactly right, Marc. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: So should we tell Keith then to be selling less? Is that the point? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: No, I think the thing that's powerful about this is that we have, if you think about creating an annuity, it has a lifetime economics of north of 35% margin. And what we're seeing is the short-term pressure even with add-on businesses, Marc. If we're paying commissions and people finish with a strong year, you're going to have accelerators and that type of thing, people have a strong demand environment, which we saw with the billed and unbilled DR. And in fact, that has a short-term depressive effect. But we still delivered, and this was the point, we still delivered the margin expansion despite that. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: So we should tell Keith then to go ahead and sell in Q1. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Definitely. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: All right. Very good. Keith, you can go ahead then and sell the first quarter, and if you blow it out again, it's okay. We'll handle it. Go ahead. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah, I think you gentlemen articulated that very nicely. So I think the only thing that I would add to that, John is, Mark used the phrase lifetime economics. And I think as we all know, we run a balanced portfolio of business, and we do a lot of work in the SMB, we do a lot of stuff in the mid-market. We have focused, as you pointed out, a lot in the enterprise as we continue to become a global company, and become an enterprise class company. That means longer, deeper relationships, as I said in my opening comments. But we really are playing the long game here. And I guess, there are two factors that I think about; one is the fact that we are able to land and expand in these large accounts, and over time build out those very strategic relationships which really culminates in these very large deals. I mean, when you think about the doubling the number of $20 million relationships that we have year-over-year, that's pretty staggering. But that also bodes well for the long game. And of course, there are natural \u2013 you would expect that there will be natural efficiencies over time. But the other thing you got to think about too is that many of these deals are aligned to the schedule of the customers as they deploy. A lot of this, as you suggested, is when a customer is up for renewal, we have the opportunity to expand the solution because the demand is there or because we've demonstrated our capabilities because we understand their business, because we speak the language of the customer and their industry. And that's why a lot of these renewals also included additional sales associated with them. So we're just executing very, very well across the board in the balanced portfolio. And I will say, I'm proud of every organization in the company that is focused in all these market segments and all these geographies. But yes, we have been focusing a lot on the enterprise. It's relatively a new capability within the age scale of Salesforce, but the execution has just been fantastic. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Thank you. So Marc, you described it as perhaps our best quarter ever. And Keith, you said execution was as strong as you've seen in your career, and it's a long, decorated career obviously. The number that is mind-bending is the 48% growth in the unbilled deferred revenue. And so I think that was growing in the 20%s ex-Demandware. Can you help us understand maybe just what that number looks like? If we try to normalize it for renewals and an extra month of duration, I mean, would it be 40%? If we just try to uncover the new ACV bookings growth, and if you can't do that is there just any other way to try to convey the acceleration that you mentioned in new business growth? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Keith, I can help a little bit on that too, if you'd like on the normalization if that would be helpful. Why don't I just share from that standpoint, if you think \u2013 again, we're talking about only unbilled DR. We put up a number of 48% because of the expanded and deeper relationships that the customers are driving, but if you adjust the term length... Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Except for short that Keith had a good quarter. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: He had a very good quarter. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: A very good quarter. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: And so even if you adjust when the customers want a slightly longer relationship because it's more strategic for the month, you have a number, instead of 48% it's growing closer to 39% on the unbilled if you normalize for that extension that the customers are asking for. So to Marc's point, even with that normalization, this is just a number that, maybe go back a lot of years to try to find that level. I hope that helps, and Keith you might want to add there. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, I think that, Mark, the analysts are probably, investors are looking at this and they're seeing, these are percentages that are much higher against companies that we've seen report this week and last week, cloud companies who are dramatically smaller than we are. So we're seeing much stronger rates. Is that fair? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: I think the demand, the growth at this scale is really \u2013 it characterizes what you and Keith said about an outstanding quarter. I mean, the top line is very, very strong. And I think one of the things that Keith said, that I feel also based on talking to a lot of customers, is the deepness of the relationship is you can feel it, you can see it. We've been talking about this for a few years. But that's something that we really see in the commercial side. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: And Keith, do you want to address that? I mean, coming into the quarter when we're on the earnings call about 90 days ago, you're obviously expecting a good quarter. We gave very strong guidance. How did the quarter play out for you? Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, look, I think this is a high performing company with a culture of high performance along with a culture of a lot of great things. And I think in every quarter we expect high performance. Again, I go back to my opening comments about, it was just really outstanding execution. We always expect great execution, and this happened to be one of those quarters for the \u2013 it's one for the ages. And so we're very, very excited about it. But if I think about what happened behind it, we've been investing for this for a very, very long time. When you think about our industry specialization, when you think about our international expansion, when you think about our partner ecosystem, these are three growth levers that have propelled us past the $10 billion mark. We're hurdling down the highway towards $20 billion, and these are foundational things that will help us turn the corner when we approach $20 billion. So you add all these things up with the right investments, with great execution, with a growth environment, a situation where the agenda for CEOs is growth, and our message and promise is all about growth, everything just aligned very, very nicely. So again, very, very proud of the entire company for just a complete set of execution in the quarter. Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: And, Keith, I just want to add one point that you noted here, which is, in Q4 we did invest an additional capacity to get prepared for this $20 billion to $22 billion in FY 2022 in terms of AEs and that type of thing as well. So that's a good attribute for us to position for the future. But that's also important for people to know it's an investment we made in Q4 as well. Operator : And your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats from me as well. I just wanted to see if you could double-click a little bit on the performances you saw in different clouds, especially Service Cloud reaccelerated again, and it's now on track to kind of maybe almost take over from the Sales Cloud. Just talk a little bit to what you're seeing on different ones, especially on the Service Cloud. Thank you. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, this is Keith. I'm happy to jump in on that, and our President of Products is sitting right next to me, Bret Taylor, so he may want to comment as well. But look, we saw a very strong balance across all of our clouds, which speaks to, again, our ability to have multi-cloud solutions. And specifically around service, if you think about how companies are differentiating themselves, they differentiate with service. And we have the leading solution in service. We're the market leader. We continue to separate and take market share in Service Cloud. We've had very, very strong execution, and of course, that drags additional product. But again, service is very, very strong, and whether it's core service or whether it's field service, these are differentiated products. I don't know, Bret, if you want to respond to that. Bret Steven Taylor - salesforce.com, inc.: Yes, I just want to say, I mean, when you think about transforming a customer experience, increasingly your brand is defined by your customer service, and that's really what this product represents. And beyond that, it's also being served by the technological changes we talked a lot about in the fourth industrial revolution. If you look at the confluence of artificial intelligence, the growth of devices like the Amazon Echo, the Google Home, mobility, they are transforming customer expectations about customer experience and customer service. And I think as consumer demand shifts and our platform really represents the opportunity for our customers to modernize their customer service experience, it's really becoming the tip of the spear for a customer strategy to transform their customer relationships. Operator : And your question comes from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Bhavan Singh Suri - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll add my congrats to the host out there. But two sort of strategic questions, I guess, and maybe for everyone on the queue. So first on Einstein and AI, the use cases are pretty broad. So you've got some of this lead-scoring stuff, and then you've got stuff as deep as sort of some of the stuff you're seeing with Coca-Cola, Coors, and things like that. As you think about customers, how are they migrating, and what percentage have use cases that are much more complex? And then how are you guys thinking about pricing those? Because the ROI and the value-add as you get to more complex AI becomes dramatically \u2013 it's huge. And so how are you thinking about pricing it? And then my second question, maybe for Bret even, is Dware [Demandware] seems to be doing really well, but obviously that's just B2C. How are you all thinking about the B2B e-commerce opportunity, which, in dollars, may be even bigger than B2C? I'd just love to get some color on those two things. Thank you. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, I think Bret can specifically start with that B2B opportunity, huh, Keith? Bret Steven Taylor - salesforce.com, inc.: Yes. I mean, I think that \u2013 I think the evolution of Salesforce as a company, we started as a B2B company. Over the past five years or so, we've really expanded our B2C offerings. And the trend we see broadly is those two markets really merging, where B2B companies, their customers are demanding B2C experiences, because their expectations are being set by these best-of-breed consumer experiences and consumer technologies. And we think that one of Salesforce's unique advantages, as it relates to B2B and B2C, is the fact that we do both. We're really the only company that has a complete customer success platform for both B2B and B2C. And it means that for B2B companies we can enable them to provide consumer-grade experiences, which is very unique in the marketplace. And for B2C companies, we bring this incredible sort of deep legacy of providing these next-generation sales and service experiences, and that experience is really driving our strategy in the B2C space. So we really view that as one of our strategic advantages is the fact that those are blurring, and we are equally interested in both parts of that market. And I think, Keith, do you want to take the artificial intelligence question? Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yes, I'm happy to talk about artificial intelligence all day long. Look, I know there was a question about pricing, and Marc Benioff may want to weigh in on this. But look, at the end of the day, we're at the dawn of a new era, and we're very, very excited about Einstein. We've got a lot of momentum. Marc talked about the billion interactions and insights that are provided on a daily basis. And that we're really excited about that. That tells you a lot about what the potential can be. And we get excited because our AI, Einstein, is applied to specific use cases around sales and service and marketing. And we have companies who continue to experiment and expand with Einstein. ABB is a classic example of that. Einstein is being used to help bring better experiences in their sales cycles with their customers, as well as the way that they service their customers. And that is all hooked up into IoT. So you can imagine the possibilities with all this data being collected on their devices and their robots, and how Einstein can help them gain better insight. So it is early days. I think over time we'll be thinking very creatively and in an innovative way to sort through the pricing of Einstein. But again, our customers seem to really, really enjoy the benefits that we're seeing. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question and, again, good quarter. Marc, I totally agree with you, I'm all for allowing Keith to go out and sign another $2 billion in subscription business, because at the end of the day, we know that's going to generate really good cash flows over time. And you guys are generating a lot of cash. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: I'm glad we're on the same page there. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. And you guys have been generating a lot of cash, it's building up on the balance sheet. There hasn't been a lot of M&A in overall software, and you guys haven't done anything big in a while. How should we think about the M&A environment going into calendar 2018, into the year ahead for you guys? Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.: Sure. One of the things \u2013 let me just lead with it, if I may, Keith, and thanks for the comments. I think we always look for \u2013 over the history of the company, we look at companies that can add to our customer satisfaction and customer success. We look at great entrepreneurs. But we look for very unique things in the world that can help and be additive as we go to the future and our market space. So that will not change. And so you should expect that the way we've operated and the way we think about that, there's real continuity to that from that standpoint. That would be a starting point. And as far as the cash on the balance sheet, I'll just add that we're always looking at that. We're always looking at our capital allocation. But the number one thing we think about with the capital allocation is the fund growth, and that's our starting point for everything in that respect. So maybe I'll turn it over to Marc or to Keith or Bret for other comments. Keith, any additional comments? Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah, look, I think we've talked about this historically, that when we think about M&A, we have a thought out process and methodology, and Mark Hawkins is exactly right. We look at a number of characteristics when we think about our growth strategy. But most importantly, when we think about acquisitions, we listen to our customers. Many times our customers guide us in terms of what we should be thinking about in terms of solutions for them. So whether it's the technology, the people as part of the acquisition, the culture and of course the financial metrics, these are all things that we consider. And again, there is a strategy and it's well thought out and there's a process to it. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: I think we could also have Bret touch on that, since he is a product of one of our great acquisitions. Bret? Bret Steven Taylor - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah. I'm personally biased, but I think Salesforce has had an incredible acquisition strategy to date \u2013 just joking. No, I mean, I think it's very important that when we think about growth we align ourselves with our customers and align ourselves with the technological trends that are shifting our customers' customers' expectations. And fundamentally I think that the reason why our customers have partnered with Salesforce in those increasingly deep relationships is because they view Salesforce not just as a suite of products we have today, but as a partner to help guide them in the technological transformation that are coming in decades to come. And that will always involve a combination of organic and inorganic innovation. I think I'll just echo Keith's point that we are really following our customers, and also making sure that as we recognize significant technology trends like artificial intelligence that are shifting our customers' expectations, that we are aggressively leading by example there. So that our customers can depend on us as that technology partner. Operator : And your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI : Thanks very much, and I'll add my congrats on the really strong close to the year. Keith, obviously one of the great successes over the last couple years has been your vertical orientation, both from a go-to-market and a product perspective. Obviously, it sounds like a great year for financial services in particular, but I'm sure a lot of other verticals. My question is about healthcare. I mean, healthcare has been a vertical or an industry that's been desperate for innovation for a while as people are sort of changing the way you pay for healthcare. Your strategy would seem to make a lot of sense. I was just kind of curious if you think 2018 or the next \u2013 however you want to sort of couch it from a timeframe \u2013 are the customers poised to start thinking differently? And are they talking to you differently about how you can help them transform into more of a patient-oriented organization? Thanks. Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.: Yeah. Hey, Kirk, great to hear from you. So look, obviously the vertical strategy is paying off. And you mentioned financial services as well, and we've seen a very interesting change in that dynamic environment. When you think about the ease of regulations, the changes in the tax laws, that has just created an environment where IT dollars can now be spent more on innovation than on maintaining the legacy environments around compliance, as an example. So that's exciting. Similarly, in healthcare, one of the things that's changing the healthcare industry is technology overall, number one. Number two, if you think about it, patients are more empowered by technology than ever before. So these healthcare companies and the healthcare industry overall is ripe for transformation. That being said, it can be unclear at times because of regulations and the regulatory environment where exactly healthcare is going. In the quarter, we signed up and expanded some very, very strong relationships in the healthcare industry. Fortune 50, that is looking to transform their business with our Health Cloud, one of our organic industry products. I mentioned Anthem, which is obviously a very, very strong and leading healthcare provider. So whether it's patients, whether it's providers, whether it's medical device manufacturers, there are many, many ways to transform those industries around customer or client or patient engagement. Service is an example. It really becomes front and center when you think about the mission of a healthcare provider. So we have a pretty good vision for where the health care industry is going. We try to do a lot of collaboration and co-creation with our customers. We also listen to our customers and let them guide us. But we think this is potentially could be a very, very big area for us. Operator : And your last question comes from Adam Holt from MoffettNathanson. Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. My question is about the Platform and Other business. It looked like it accelerated in the quarter in an environment that some people might characterize as being more competitive with the public clouds and some of the application vendors now more aggressively touting their own platform-as-a-service businesses. How do you think about the drivers of the strength there this quarter and the outlook for the next several quarters? Maybe that's a question for Marc Benioff. I'm not sure. But I appreciate the answer. Thank you. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, I think we've moved into a new world. This is the fourth industrial revolution. We all know that. We can see the huge advancements in technology in our fingertips, how we're running this call, how all the computers and mobile devices that we're using, the artificial intelligence that we talked about, the autonomous vehicles that I saw going down the street today. There's so many exciting things that are happening, information sciences and biotechnology sciences. But as every company sees the fourth industrial revolution underway, they have to pick their place in it, what are you going to do, what is your position, and also what are your values, what's important to you. These two ideas, your vision and your values, I think will define who will be successful and who will fail in the fourth industrial revolution. For us, it's very simple. We squarely believe that we're in the age of a customer, and that for each and every one of our companies that we deal with around the world, that they have to connect with their customer in a whole new way, and to build this high fidelity relationship, whether they're a B2B or B2C customer, that they need to have this single view of the customer. It doesn't matter, like, in the previous discussion, it could be healthcare, it could be financial services, it could be retail. In each and every case, company-by-company is thinking how do I get to a single view of the customer. That is Salesforce's single focus. And we do that across many product lines, as you know. And in terms of what is important to us, well, there's nothing more important than trust. Trust is our highest value. And of course, growth is important to us as well. You can you see that in our numbers today. And innovation, as Bret was talking about, the reason that we're the number one CRM in the world is the tremendous innovation that we've brought to customers like we have in things like Einstein, or our new Lightning platform, or even Trailhead where you can learn how to become part the Salesforce economy and jump on this train so that you can be part of the fourth industrial revolution and be part of Salesforce. These things are so important. You can see how it shows up on our AppExchange with thousands of apps and companies that have been birthed through this vision. And then at the end of the day, we all have to be aware that the fourth industrial revolution has a dark side, and it could be that it creates more inequality. And that's why our core value we talked about is equality that we so squarely believe that we have to keep an eye on the equality of every human being, whether it's our employees, our customers, the communities that we're in, or even the environment or public education systems. And that these four values, trust, and growth, innovation and equality continue to serve us very well in our pursuit in this age of the customer. Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.: Well, I want to thank everyone for an amazing fiscal year. All of our employees, customers, partners, all of our Ohana, thank you for everything that you have done for us, every single day. We appreciate it so greatly. And we will see you again at TrailheaDX, our annual Salesforce Developer Conference which will be March 28th and 29th in San Francisco. And I hope that all of you will join us for this exciting event. We'll have some very exciting product news and some incredible surprises there. And I'm about to show up on Kramer and from Salesforce tower here in New York City in just a couple minutes. If you'll turn on CNBC, you'll see me there. So thanks everybody. And we'll see you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Mr. John Cummings, you may begin your conference. John Cummings : Thank you, Erica, thanks so much. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our fiscal first quarter 2019 results conference call. Our results press release and SEC filings, including our Form 8-K which contains re-casted financial information under new accounting standards ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR Web site at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; and Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Additionally, our commentary and our guidance today are under accounting standards, ASC 606, ASC 340-40 and ASC 2016-01, all of which we adopted in the first quarter. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions proved to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q. With that, let me turn the call over to you, Marc. Marc Benioff : Well, thank you so much, John. And thank you to everyone on today\u2019s call for being here with us. And look, as you\u2019ll recall fiscal 2018 was a record year for Salesforce and Q4 was our best quarter ever. In fact, the most recent Fortune 500 ranking, Salesforce has moved up nearly 200 positions over last two years and based on last year's revenue, we\u2019re now the 285th largest company in United States. And we\u2019re thrilled that our phenomenal momentum continued right now in the first quarter of fiscal year \u201919. Revenue for the quarter rose to more than $3 billion, up 25%, putting us on $12 billion revenue run rate that was just amazing. And we now have $20.4 billion of future revenues under contract, which is the remaining transaction price, that\u2019s up 36% from a year ago. Based on these strong results, we\u2019re raising our full year top line revenue guidance to $13.125 billion at the high end of our range, 25% growth for this year. And just as we\u2019ll be fastest enterprise software company to reach $13 billion, we\u2019re well on our way to surpassing the $20 billion revenue goal faster than any other enterprise software company in history. With another quarter of amazing growth, we\u2019ve strengthened our position as the world's leading CRM Company. Earlier this month IDC named Salesforce the number one CRM provider for the fifth consecutive year. In fact, according to IDC, we increased our CRM market share in 2017 by more percentage points than the rest of the top 20 CRM vendors combined. We\u2019re the number one in sales, number one in service, number one in marketing, and we have the number one CRM platform. We continue to be the fastest growing of all the top five enterprise software companies. And these incredible results are because of our relentless focus on customer success. In fact, I\u2019ve just returned from a series of meetings with customers around the world. I was in Tokyo, Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, I was in Washington DC. And I\u2019ll tell you, everywhere I go, every CEO wants to talk about digital transformation, which begins and ends with the customer. Only Salesforce can deliver a highly personalized engaged B2B and B2C customer experiences, powered by the world's number one CRM customer success platform, across sales, across service, across marketing, commerce, communities, analytics and even application development through our platform. Only Salesforce is giving customers an intelligent 360 degree view of their customer. And this month, we closed our acquisition of MuleSoft, giving us the industry\u2019s leading integration platform as well. Well, integration has never been more strategic. So many of the CEOs I spoke with told me that data remains locked in their legacy systems, and is holding them back. With MuleSoft, we\u2019re now enabling our customers to connect all of their data across any public or private cloud, and on-premise, to radically enhance innovation and create incredible customer experiences. So we couldn\u2019t be more excited to welcome MuleSoft to Salesforce. And just this morning, Forbes named Salesforce again one of the world\u2019s most innovative companies for the eighth year in a row. Since Forbes started listing in 2011, Salesforce was placed in the top three every single year. In fact, our innovation in artificial intelligence is delivering incredible value to our customers. Salesforce Einstein now delivers nearly 2 billion predictions every day, and that's a doubling of our daily predictions just last quarter. This is the most strategic technology for our customers. How are we growing so consistently quarter-after-quarter, as I've described before, it's about staying true to our values, including customer success and innovation. But our number one value at Salesforce is trust, earning and keeping the trust of our stakeholders, our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders and all of our communities. That's why I called for a national privacy law to protect the personal data of American consumers, and to help restore trust in the tech industry similar to what's happening in Europe with GDPR. In closing, as I've pointed out before, CRM is the fastest growing enterprise software category. It's a massive $120 billion market opportunity and we are determined to continue leading the way for our customers and for their success. And we're keeping our eye focused on the future after record world tours in New York, Washington DC, Amsterdam, Toronto, London, and Paris. We're looking forward to welcoming 10,000 attendees to Connections in Chicago in two weeks. I hope you all attend. It will be the digital marketing, commerce and customer success event of the year. And as I said before, we're well on our way to surpassing $20 billion in revenue and doing it faster than any other enterprise software company in the history you can see that in the numbers from this quarter, the trajectory is clear. Anybody who sees the numbers and these financial results could see it's going to happen and we could not be more excited. So we're incredibly proud of another quarter of remarkable growth. Of course, none of this would be possible without the partnership and dedication of all of our stakeholders, especially our 30,000 Salesforce employees, the world's largest team dedicated to CRM, thank you. Thank you. Thank you to all of our Ohana. We're number one in CRM because our employees, our customers are number one, and to all of them and to all of our Ohana again, I say thank you. And with that, I'll hand it over to Keith. Keith Block : Thanks Marc. Good afternoon, everybody. As Marc said, we're off to a fast start to the year and we're taking share through our relentless focus on the customer. We continue to grow internationally and expand across industries and leverage our partners on this drive towards $20 billion and beyond. Our momentum from Q4 carried over into Q1, and we signed several significant deals in the quarter, including the largest transaction in the Company's history. And we delivered outstanding performance across all of our clouds. Sales Cloud grew at 16%, 33% faster than the market, a clear indicator of our strength of our core business, and we are taking share. Service Cloud grew 29% in the quarter as creating connected customer experiences to become a priority for every company all over the world. Field Service Lightning is a key part of that growth. In fact, one of the world's largest food and beverage companies selected Field Service Lightning for retail execution to boost employee productivity and improve customer experiences. Retail execution is the life-blood of consumer packaged goods companies. Marketing and Commerce grew 41%. In Q1, we strengthened our relationship with Citi, which is rolling out marketing cloud across their business in Asia. And we also continue to see incredible momentum with Commerce Cloud as more and more customers select our platform as part of their broader engagement with Salesforce. We had notable expansions with another leading athletic apparel maker, who is enhancing and expanding their direct-to-consumer business. We also deepened our relationships with one of the largest luxury groups in the world who is transforming their retail experience with Commerce Cloud. And finally, our Lighting Platform grew 36% as customers continue to build intelligent, connected apps fast with Lightning App Builder and Heroku, and leverage the power of Einstein. In fact, one of the largest media and entertainment companies in the world is using Einstein Analytics to get deeper business insights and build more personalized customer experiences. Now, we not only delivered strong growth across our clouds but across all of our key regions. EMEA grew 31% in constant currency, fueled by expanding relationships with brands like Philips and Santander UK as our international investments continue to pay off. In May, we opened our first European innovation center at Salesforce tower in London, and announced plans to expand our datacenter capacity in the UK to support our growing customers in the region. APAC grew 30% in constant currency, driven by remarkable growth in Japan where we strengthened our relationships with SoftBank and luxury e-commerce site LUXA. In Asia, we also expanded with Cathay Pacific Airways and Lazada, the leading ecommerce player in Southeast Asia. Our ability to speak the language of customers is deepening our relationships with the most important companies in the world, and you can see that in our results. In Financial Services, we expanded with Manulife in Canada and formed a new relationship with Investors Bank. And we continue to see incredible momentum with Financial Services Cloud. In Q1, we had a significant expansion with a Fortune 50 financial services firm that is clearly vetting their digital transformation on us, and is now one of our largest customers. The public sector continues to be a huge opportunity for us as well. We had our most significant public sector win ever with U.S. Department of Agriculture, and they are using service cloud to transform how they engage with constituents across the country. We also deepened our relationship with one of the largest federal agencies in the United States, and they\u2019re deploying Service Cloud and Einstein Analytics to improve the services they provide to millions of Americans every single day. Our strong ecosystem is helping us gain lion share and drive success for our customers as well. In Q1, partners help generate 59% of new business, and we\u2019re involved in 75% of our largest deals. And Salesforce continues to be the growth lever for our partners. In fact, the top five global FIs increased their Salesforce practices by more than 70% year-over-year. In Q1 alone, Bluewolf, an IBM Company, increased the number of certified consultants by more than 200%, a huge indication of demand. We\u2019re also seeing tremendous momentum in our driving ISV community, which grew 52% year-over-year. Now, let me give you a quick update on our most recent acquisitions. First, every company launched that delivered the same buying experience to businesses that they provide to consumers. And to capture this opportunity, we acquired long time partner CloudCraze, a leading B2B ecommerce platform, similar to our acquisition of SteelBrick and CloudCraze both natively on the Salesforce platform. So we\u2019re up to a good start on that integration. Second, as Marc said, unlocking data is critical to accelerating our customer\u2019s digital transformation. Just last week, I was with a CEO of a major corporation and has data trapped in disparate legacy systems, it is a huge barrier to innovation. But through acquisition of MuleSoft, Salesforce now provides one of the world\u2019s leading platforms for building application networks that connects enterprise apps, data and devices across any cloud on-premise whether they connect with Salesforce or not. And that integration is going extremely well. We have received in overwhelmingly positive response for our customers and those who\u2019ve been incorporated MuleSoft into global strategic events, including world tours and Dreamforce, this has been highly successful thus far. And we\u2019ll continue to invest further MuleSoft\u2019s distribution capacity and R&D to build innovative products that enable our customers\u2019 success. So to close, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees, for their continued trust in us and for very, very special start to the year. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hawkins, who will discuss our financial execution and updates to our accounting standards. Mark? Mark Hawkins : Great. Thanks, Keith. Before discussing the results, I want to remind everyone that the results were released today are under the new accounting standards ASC 606, ASC 340-40 and ASC 2016-01. Additionally with our release today, we provided re-casted financial results under the full retrospective method for the full year of fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018 and each quarter of fiscal 2018 under ASC 606 and ASC 340-40. With that, let me turn to the first quarter results. First quarter revenues grew 25% in dollars and 22% in constant currency, reflecting continued strength in the demand environment, strong organic growth and keeping us on pace to achieve the FY22 target of $21 billion to $23 billion, including MuleSoft. Now, the dollar attrition exited the first quarter below 10%, it was down a bit from Q1 of last year. First quarter GAAP EPS was $0.46 compared with the breakeven last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.74, up 155% over the last year. Mark-to-market accounting for our strategic investment portfolio as required by ASC 2016-01 benefitted GAAP EPS by approximately $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.22 in the first quarter. We had a record quarter of operating cash flow, delivering $1.47 billion in the first quarter, up 19% over year-over-year. And I'm very pleased with this result, especially coming up our strong collections and cash flow quarter in Q4 of last year. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $1.34 billion in the first quarter, up 25% over last year. Turning to the balance sheet. As a result of the new accounting standards, we now report unearned revenue in place of deferred revenue. And as you know, the new revenue standard has us recognizing certain revenues sooner than under prior standards. And therefore, reduces unearned revenue at a faster rate than historical deferred revenue. This causes our unearned balance to be lower than our historically reported differed revenue. Unearned revenue ended the quarter at $6.2 billion, up 25% in dollars and 23% in constant currency. As we've always said, deferred revenue was an imperfect growth predictor as it was impacted by a number of factors, including invoicing timing and billing terms. To provide more transparency and a better indication of our future revenues, we are providing a new disclosure called, remaining transaction price, which represents all future revenues that are under the contract. Essentially, our prior billed and unbilled deferred revenue. This balance is broken down into the amounts we expected to recognize as revenue in the next 12 months or current our remaining transaction price, and the amount we expect to recognize as revenue beyond 12 months, which we\u2019re calling non-current remaining transaction price. At the end of the first quarter, our total remaining transaction price was $20.4 billion, up 36% over last year. And the current remaining transaction price was $9.6 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Now, keep in mind this balance is not impacted by invoicing terms unlike deferred revenue was. We believe that this metric will be a better indicator of our future revenue than unearned or differed revenue. Before turning to guidance, let me take a minute to discuss MuleSoft's accounting practices going forward. During the transaction close process, we made the decision to conform MuleSoft's revenue recognition policy to Salesforce's policy under the new accounting standard ASC 606. Through this process, it was determined that a portion of the revenue related to on-premise implementations will be recognized as license revenue going forward. As we will be providing MuleSoft results separately for the remainder of the year, this license revenue will be included in our subscription and support line for FY19 and will be recognized upfront upon delivery. Moving onto guidance. With our strong first quarter results giving us a fast start to the full year, we\u2019re raising our full year 2019 revenue guidance to $13.075 billion to $13.125 billion for 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. The guidance includes approximately $315 million from our acquisition of MuleSoft, which closed on May 2nd. Turning to operating margin. With the close of the MuleSoft acquisition, we now expect our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement to be flat to plus 25 basis points. This guidance includes approximately 125 basis points headwind from MuleSoft. We are updating our FY19 GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $0.49 to $0.51, and our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $2.29 to $2.31. Keep in mind that that guidance does not take into account the possible future impact from mark-to-market adjustments related to ASC 2016-01, which may cause EPS volatility based on the market conditions. We now expect full-year 2019 operating cash flow of 14% to 15% year-over-year for an operating cash flow yield of approximately 24%. This guidance includes a headwind of approximately $150 million related to the MuleSoft acquisition. For Q2, we\u2019re expecting revenues of $3.22 billion to $3.23 billion, GAAP loss per share of minus $0.09 to minus $0.08, and a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.46 to $0.47. As I mentioned previously, we believe the current remaining transaction price provides you a better looking metric than unearned revenue. However, given the limited historical remaining transaction price data, we're going to provide incremental transparency by temporarily providing guidance for unearned revenue for the remainder of this year. In context, we expect year-over-year unearned revenue growth of 22% to 23% in Q2, excluding MuleSoft. Once we have full year comparables numbers, we will expect to stop providing unearned revenue guidance. To close, we delivered a strong first quarter that positioned us well for another year of durable growth. I\u2019d like to thank our customers, our partners, our employees, and our shareholders for your continued support. And with that, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Phil Winslow : Congrats on a great start to the year and a particular shout out to Hawkins for the awesome 606 data historically, super helpful. A question for Marc B on MuleSoft, I mean obviously, nobody knows CRM data better than salesforce.com. But wondering if you could talk about Einstein and MuleSoft, and that in the AI context, because obviously you\u2019re delivering already 2 billion predictions? How do you think MuleSoft, or how do you see MuleSoft, augmenting that? And what kind of uptick you think you\u2019ll see their insight customers? Marc Benioff : Well, as we go deeper into our vision with so many of our customers, the key thing that we are focused on is their single view of their customer. We just talked about so many of our key wins in the quarter. I mean, it could be carrying with their reprocessing incredible brands like Gucci, or Bottega or Yves Saint Laurent, the UFDA and their relationship with their farmers and ranchers, it could be the work that we\u2019re doing with the [Align] [ph], giving their orthodontist the ability to connect with their consumers in a whole new way, or it could be the incredible work that you\u2019re seeing with Adidas. In each and every case, they\u2019re working to understand and have a 360 degree view of their customer. And the power of that is really augmented by our suite of CRM applications that do that for them. Things like our sales, commerce, service, communities, analytics, our core platform, collaboration, marketing and exactly what you said, by adding integration in that, it helps us bring in data from multiple public clouds, because many of our customers are now using multiple public clouds and/or they might be, let's say for example, the healthcare company seeking data from the healthcare system itself like an insurance system, or maybe some other type of key databank associated with the healthcare industry, integration is mission-critical for our customers to gain that 360 degree view of their customer. Now, we\u2019ve always known that at Salesforce, that's why we built up an open system. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had an application program interface. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had an AppExchange. That's why we focused on ISVs and had relationships with companies like MuleSoft. But it has become more important for our customers to be able to have and rely on an integration cloud. This idea of deeply embedded inside our products, they can rely on this technology to be able to integrate all the key data so they can build that single view of the customer. And we have Bret Taylor here who is our President and Chief Product Officer. And Bret, do you want to just touch on that and your -- I know you\u2019ve been traveling the country and talking to hundreds of our customers about their vision for integration. Can you tap that for us? Bret Taylor : Yes, sure. When we talk to our customers, they talk about three main priorities as it relates to integration. They want to create customer experiences that transcend individual customer touch points. They want to integrate sales, service, and marketing into a single seamless customer experience. They want to make sure that they have multiple acquisitions and multiple regulatory climates, because they exist across international borders that they can accomplish that with our platform. And they want to unlock the data from other legacy systems, and bring it into these customer systems. So they can do these transformations around their customers. And about the point you\u2019re asking about Einstein is very insightful. They know that their AI is only as powerful as data it has access to. And so when you think of MuleSoft think unlocking data. The data is trapped in all these isolated systems on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, and MuleSoft they can unlock this data and make it available to Einstein and make a smarter customer facing system. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to achieve with MuleSoft. And I think the thing you heard from Marc that I\u2019ve heard over and over again from customers is that integration is a strategic priority for our customers, because without it they can't move fast enough on their customer facing systems. So we\u2019d like to say it unlocks the clock speed of innovation, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really seeing from our customers. And I hope we\u2019ll accelerate our ambitions with Einstein. Marc Benioff : And Bret I just want to ask before we go on. When we look at this next generation of intelligence, obviously, Salesforce has done it a little bit differently than other companies, because we've taken a consistent artificial intelligence platform, Einstein, and we've now allowed all of our applications to flow through that. So whether it's our Commerce Cloud our Sales Cloud, or our Service Cloud, they're all augmented now through Einstein. And I guess one of the major results that I'm so proud of your team, and our engineering teams, is 2 billion predictions a day. Where do you see that going? Bret Taylor : Well, I think the reason why Einstein has gotten so much adoption, so much traction is because it\u2019s simple to use. The power of the Salesforce platform is you just turn it on. And with things like our Commerce Cloud, you can do very simple things with Einstein to sort the products differently in your product listings, and you'll drive more GMV and drive more transactions, because of the better customer experience showing better products to the right people at the right time. Every single one of our cloud benefits from Einstein in this way. And by making it easy to adopt and easy to use, our customers are actually seeing the value of AI without hiring a legion of data scientists, and that's really the promise of Einstein and really our philosophy behind building AI for CRM is our ability to make it easy for our customers to use and adopt, and benefit from this revolution we're seeing in AI. Marc Benioff : So what you're saying is just by turning on Einstein our Commerce Cloud customers for example, have seen some incredible increase, what is it 15% or 20% in revenue, just by turning on artificial intelligence the ability for that AI to start working with consumers who are using those Commerce Cloud Services? Bret Taylor : That's absolutely right. I mean, we see one of the biggest barriers for our customers in adopting AI is just how challenging it is to understand and use. And we view the value of Einstein and the value of integrating it deeply into our platform is that ease of turning it on and actually seeing the impact on your business immediately. And that's what we aspired to achieve with Einstein. Marc Benioff : It's not a programmatic interface -- I mean, it is programmatic it can be, but it's really declarative. It\u2019s easy to just get going. Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : And your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant : Mark Grant here on for Heather, just a quick one for me. You saw some acceleration in Service Cloud growth in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of how those conversations are going with customers, specifically around that cloud? And maybe an update on the appetite you're seeing in the market for some of those larger transformative multi-cloud deals? Keith Block : This is, Keith, let me try to address this. So generally speaking, if you think about how companies differentiate themselves, they do it on service and they do it specifically around the consumer experience. And so that's why we're seeing quite an uptick in our Service Cloud business. Now, also another piece of that is Field Service Lightning. So we see an incredible amount of demand for Field Service Lightning. Again, because customer are taking advantage of these amazing technologies to drive and gather insights around what their customers are doing. Service Cloud reached about $3.4 billion run-rate in Q1, that's more than double the market, which is pretty amazing. And as Marc has indicated in his early comments, we're number one in the market and we continue to take share in a very, very strategic market for us and our customers. So that differentiation by service is very, very strategic for these customers, many times service is at the core of our all their digital transformations, which obviously peaks the interest of the CEOs that we're having these conversations with. And it's not just service it's all of our other core products that rotate around service that allows to drive these transformations, and that's where you see these very, very large multi-cloud deals that I talked about earlier. Marc Benioff : Keith, I want to ask you a question about -- in the quarter, you closed one of our largest transactions ever, and also just an incredible transaction with a very large insurance company. And one of the things about working with that company is you\u2019re really building a complete family of applications around the customer, like I mentioned. That is, they\u2019re using just one cloud, right? They\u2019re really looking to us to bring together the entire customer experience. And we see that, I mean, insurance is a great example of an industry where we\u2019ve seen incredible transformation across all different types of insurance, and globally too, not just here in the United States, but in Japan and Europe, et cetera. How is that idea that we\u2019re able to come in with a complete customer experience differentiate you in the marketplace? Keith Block : I mean, first of all, their blown away when these data capabilities that we have. I was with, just a couple of weeks ago, with the CEO of one of the largest insurance companies in the world. And we\u2019re having a conversation about changing their business model and transformation around how their agents could be more productive, how they can retire all these legacy systems, so that they have a single unified view of the customer, how they can leverage Einstein for artificial intelligence and insights, issues around locking or unlocking the legacy data from their legacy systems. And all of these things together, we\u2019re the only company and the industry that can provide solutions as it relates to that 360 degree holy grail of the customer. And that\u2019s why -- I mean, insurance is obviously a sweet spot for us but all financial services there is sweet spot for us. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re having so much momentum in that industry. Mark Grant : So you\u2019re able to put together many different types of solutions to offer to that customer then that 360 customer view? Keith Block : That\u2019s exactly right. Operator : And your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : I have a question for Marc B on the Marketing Cloud, which obviously had a great quarter in Q1. But one of your competitors in the space is now adding commerce functionality by way of an acquisition, which I think as many investors comparing the different strategies in the market. And if we look out in the future when Salesforce is 20 billion plus in-size and then reflect back and how you got there. How of the battle will have been won in B2C versus B2B, and do you think you need to be deeper in content management to get there? Marc Benioff : I think that as we\u2019ve expand our vision of what the customer experiences and where the market is going, of course, we\u2019ve inspired other competitors to think about the future as well. And that\u2019s our job too is to create followers, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of other companies, smaller companies like the one you\u2019re talking, really try to look at where they\u2019re going in the future. And I think that that\u2019s great, because of course we want a competitive environment. So our approach is really different, because we really see every B2B company and every B2C company becoming a B2B to C company, and I see that over and over and over. Again I mean, I gave a great example of Adidas. So I think you know -- when you look at a huge commerce story, like Adidas, of course, when there is new shoe like the Yeezy 350 is launching, we have to go to provide that tremendous customer experience with highly differentiated for Adidas on our Commerce Cloud. But of course that\u2019s not the only cloud that Adidas is using with us, because they need to build to provide many different types of services to their customers. And that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to build to jump in and offer them great success. But of course with an example of a company like that, you\u2019re going to find that maybe only 20% of their revenue is in that B2C commerce experience. Many of those companies, 80% of their revenues then complicated in the B2B commerce experience this is why one of the most exciting acquisitions that we did in the quarter was a relatively small company that have been built natively on our platform called CloudCraze, because it really all of a sudden extended us in not just B2C commerce but B2B commerce as well. And I don\u2019t think anybody can really touch the tremendous success we've had since acquire and demand where it's been an awesome journey in just a couple years. But it's really because we've provided that complete experience around the customer. Now when you think about that, there is three major components to that. There is the system of record of course, which is where Salesforce started. And I would say that we probably have the strongest system of record experience in the industry. Then there is the system of engagement itself, whether it's internal users or externally. Again, we have such tremendous capability whether it's a Heroku or communities, or even our commerce. And three is the system of intelligence, Bret touched on it with Einstein with AI. But even look at our advanced analytics capabilities that we now bring to bear, no one else can provide that experience. Now, we\u2019re not a close solution, we're going to work with every company, of course we have to, because our customers have many different types of solutions in their companies, and so we're going to do that. But when you look at some of these core areas, like the customer experience; the ability to provide enablement, like you've seen with our Trailhead capabilities; the ability to have that deep engagement, like I just mention, the level of intelligence; and now integration having the number one integration cloud in the world; it really helps when we walk in to our customer and say look, we\u2019re the number one sales cloud in the world; the number one service cloud in the world; we\u2019re the number one marketing cloud in the world according to IDC; and we've done all that in a flash of an eye. And I think that that's why you can see a very fast line. I mean, you guys were all tremendous financial analyst. You can put the numbers together and figure out when we're going to get to $20 billion. We think that we're going to get there as faster than we could have imagined. And that's why we're so excited about our business. And then we're going on by the way. This is not -- this is I think the most exciting ever in our industry. I've never seen customers more excited about investing, especially in their digital transformation and their customer transformation. And we're well positioned as the number one CRM provider in the world. I hope that answers your question. Operator : And your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : A question press for Bret and maybe one for Mr. Hawkins as well. I was wondering if we could get an update on the product strategy around MuleSoft, now that's disclosed. I guess, maybe some time frames on when we should see the integration cloud, the Salesforce.com integration cloud rolling out. The product plans for the course of the existing MuleSoft platform that they have. And then maybe one for Mr. Hawkins, any plans on expense reduction, or any expense synergies you plan to get out of the MuleSoft platform as you do the integration with Salesforce.com? Bret Taylor : So to start to talk about our integration cloud and MuleSoft, our focus right now is bringing MuleSoft to in the Company and making sure that were consulting with every single one of our customers and every single one of our engagements about their integration strategy. Just helping them knowing that every digital transformation starts and ends with the customer, how can we help them set up an application network and unlock this data to transform their customer experience, is not starting now. MuleSoft has just incredible customers success, and so we're looking to accelerate that with our amazing distribution team, all the deep customer relationships we've had. And really attaching to the strategy that Keith\u2019s team has around speaking language of our customer and talking through the lens of healthcare, through the lens of finance and really helping people realize and transform their customer experience, you need to unlock the data from every system at your company. We\u2019ll be adding to that over the course of connections and Dreamforce with out-of-the-box solutions for across our cloud built on MuleSoft and built on the integration cloud over the course of the year. Mark Hawkins : Thanks Keith on that point, a couple of things here. One is that, as called out, we know that as per normal protocol, we\u2019ll have the headwind in the current year in FY19 do to things such as deal costs, integration costs, purchase accounting and the entire deal write down. We\u2019re taking all that on board within the guide. And then of course we\u2019re going to invest to accelerate the success of this to really help drive the reality of helping our customer do all the things that customer wants in their success. So we\u2019ll make the appropriate investment. The key point to your question is yes, we will be driving appropriate progress and synergy over time after we get through the -- bring them on board get them integrated and plugged-in, much like we did with ExactTarget and Demandware. And when you look back and see what the effect was and you see -- you fast forward a little bit, these both penciled out very, very nicely. We pick up gains across where we need and this will be part of the picture where we continue to expand profit, while we grow as well. So you should expect that over the longer term, yes. Operator : And your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Question for Keith Block, just on large deals. It sounds like this Q1 maybe it was stronger from a large deal perspective, and it\u2019s not usually a quarter with that as a driver. Could you help us understand, are you seeing an uptick in large deals generally that you expect to sustain this year and what's driving that? Keith Block : So obviously, we have this terrific fiscal year last year, we had this amazing Q4 that momentum, has absolutely carried into Q1. I\u2019d say that is a little bit different than the typical Q1. And we are very, very pleased with all these transactions and these relationships that we\u2019ve expanded and created in the quarter. Again, I just think it's an indication of our position in the marketplace what our customers are looking for and our ability to answer the bell for those customers, and paint a vision around the 360 degree view of their customers. And that is just become more and more important with these amazing technologies. This notion of the 360 degree view of the customer is the holy-grail and we\u2019ve been talking about it for a very, very long time. And as I said earlier, we\u2019re really the only CRM platform that can deliver on that promise to our customers. So the new wave of digital transformation is all about the customer, everything starts and begins, and ends at the customer. So we\u2019re just in a tremendous position and we have very, very strong execution, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these results. Walter Pritchard : And then for Mark Hawkins, just curious on the MuleSoft contribution to Q2, or the year. Any possibility giving us that just so we can calibrate our modeling? Mark Hawkins : Walter, I think a couple of things you should think about. For the revenue -- top line revenue of $315 million, additive Q2 through Q4, that\u2019s on top of a powerful core growth where you can see we did an organic raise separate from that so $315 million at the top. And again as per expectoration, we\u2019ll have the 125 basis points impact on our operating margin would otherwise be. We\u2019re fully taking that on board with all the deal costs, purchase accounting, a lot of those types of things that you would expect and positioning it for the years ahead. We\u2019re pleased with this, especially post close. I think we like what we see. So that would be the effect there. On the cash flow side, Walter, we would expect about $150 million impact on the headwind, on the cash flow. Again, putting it together, you think about our core cash flow, absolutely on track with a very attractive cash flow margin. Even with this temporary impact of some of the more transitional issues you would expect with an M&A integration and deal cost and such, we still have an operating margin yield of roughly 24%. So those will be the attributes that will impact us this year, and we look forward to having this also continue to progress much like ExactTarget and Demandware. Operator : And your next question comes from Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Adam Holt : Just a follow-up on Walter\u2019s question, first for Mark. Could you maybe narrow that commentary around Mule for the second quarter specifically, that was very helpful for the year. But just for the second quarter? And then secondly, for maybe Marc Benioff or Keith. You had another really good quarter on the platform side standalone, 35% growth, now you\u2019re layering in Mule and we\u2019re doing much more big deals. Could we talk -- why don\u2019t you just talk us through the synergies and symbiotic relationships between the larger customer relationships when it might be more integration, more middleware, more what have you have and the business, because it seem like you\u2019re doing so well, both at the standalone and now that you layer in Mule. Thank you. Mark Hawkins : Adam, I guess a couple of things here. One is that we\u2019re pretty much giving you the attributes for the full year. We haven\u2019t broken it down to guide every single quarter on that side of it. So just to let you know think about the full picture of the year is the view that we\u2019re taking. That would be what I would say there. And I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Marc Benioff : And I\u2019ll just fill in for you on -- I think that when we, walk-in I was in Europe last week and I was with the CEO of a very large life insurance company. And they\u2019re a very large service cloud customer. And he actually has the service cloud running at his desk and we were going through that. And turned out he is also a very large MuleSoft customer as well. And it expands our relationship with that customer, and it makes us much more strategic with them. And then at that point, my ability to consult with that customer is really around, okay, now let\u2019s look at each one of your policyholders and your ability to have 360 degree vision with them. And that goes everything from their internal systems and their policy management systems, to even their capabilities that they have in other public clouds that they\u2019re using. We\u2019re going to wrap all of those things with all of our customer capabilities, because what he is mostly focused on is what are his customer relationships and how is he driving those customer relationships forward. And that ability to have that conversation, well, it just gets extended each and every year. I mean, I was even able to start to talk to that CEO about enablement, that we have this tremendous platform, called Trailhead, where we\u2019re giving this opportunity to enable so many of our customers. And now giving that platform to them as well, the ability for them to enable their employees and their customers, it becomes a very critical part of our story. And gives our customers the ability to realize that we are strategic part of their future, and we\u2019re going to help them become more successful than ever through that fully integrated complete CRM platform. Bret Taylor : One thing I might add on to just one tack on here thing that might help you, Adam, is that one attribute that might help you in Q2 is just to know that when we guided UR, we guided it off of our core which excluded the MuleSoft. And the one thing you should think about is that we think about URs adding for MuleSoft, $75 million to $100 million. So that might be useful to you as one other attribute that might be helpful. Operator : And your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : When you look at these mega transactions that's happened in Q1, can you talk about what the pipeline for these mega transactions looks like? Is it from existing customers that had a longest period of run time with Salesforce.com? And this largest deal that you did today, if I heard it right, can you talk -- you've not already spoken about that customer. Can you give us a little bit more color on the deployment what exactly are they looking to achieve, and how much of a driver of digital transformation. I want to wrap it up, but Mark Hawkins. Previously when you announced Q4 results, you gave guidance for deferred revenue growth rate of 23%. Can you -- if you were to recap the unearned reported in Q1 in the light of deferred revenue growth rate, what would did that have looked like? Thank you so much. Marc Benioff : Mark, why don't you take that last part? Mark Hawkins : Sure, let me take the last part. Thank you Kash on all accounts here. First thing that I would say here is when you look at our UR, you look at a growth rate of 25%. And again, as described in UR, it's basically DR less the cumulative effect of revenue pull forwards related to the ASC-606 revenue implementation. So by definition, UR, in this particular case, is less than DR. And so one of the things that you could see is when you look our growth rate on an apples-to-apples basis growing 25% adjusted for this accounting change, that's obviously a number that we're happy with. And so in that respect, just look at the growth rate of UR that we're actually reporting compared to the DR apples-to-apples growth rate that we\u2019 re guiding, and we\u2019re actually pleased with the outcome. Keith Block : Kash, this is Keith, just to answer the first part of your question. We're looking at this market that we've created and we're really driving. And if you go out to 2021, this is a $120 billion plus marketplace. And if you look at every category in that market, whether it's sales or service or marketing or commerce or platform or analytics, et cetera, we are vastly outstripping the market in terms of growth. Again, whether it's sales or service or marketing, in some cases nearly 3 times the pace of the market. So why is that? Well, number one, it starts with the fact that we\u2019re one of the world's most innovative companies. Number two is that with all this amazing technology, again these CEOs are looking for transformation opportunities around the customer, which is the new frontier. And we're basically the market leader and the only one that can provide the 360 degree view of the customer and the insights associated with that. So we have become and continue to become very, very strategic to these customers. And lastly they trust us. They trust our brand. They trust our platform. They trust our partner. And as they think about their future and the future relationships that they want to have with our customers, they're turning to us. And that's why you're seeing these very, very large deals. Now, I would love to tell you that we wake up every day and we need a new customer and we sign one of these large deals. But the reality is that we work very, very hard. The team is doing incredible job of establishing that trust, speaking languages of customer, having a global scale and thinking a vision for the future. And that's why you see these large deals. They really represent the customers\u2019 endorsement and trust of us to bring them into the future. Operator : And your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Mark Murphy : Thank you, congratulations. Question for Marc Benioff. Where do you stand philosophically on positioning as 100% pure cloud architecture versus being open minded, which you seem to be acute, crossing over into the edge of the hybrid cloud once in a while if it make sense. And I\u2019m asking in the context of MuleSoft and your future plans for it, because MuleSoft seem to succeed by offering a mix of cloud and on-prem deployments. And I\u2019m just wondering, is that going to be the exception to the rule? Or do you think that your infrastructure layer would actually increasingly have more of a hybrid cloud feel to it? Marc Benioff : I think that\u2019s a great question and -- yes, MuleSoft, because of the nature of MuleSoft and the nature of integration itself and the ability to do complex integration, which is what MuleSoft is really excellent at and building tremendous integration layer, we call a bus across the enterprise, the ability to have an application interface to that bus, the ability to accelerate innovation, the ability to build the mobile apps or other kind of capabilities, while unifying all these services to provide this 360 degree customer, this is what MuleSoft excels at. I mean, we think it\u2019s absolutely the best in category, and that\u2019s what our customers have said. Of course, we\u2019ve been involved with the company almost from its very start where we were very early investors in the company, and carried it all the way through to IPO. And it has an architecture where it runs partly on-premise. And that\u2019s one of the reason it's able to do everything that it can do from an integration layer. From Salesforce\u2019s core platform, we\u2019re still 100% public cloud. I don\u2019t see that changing. There's going to be little instances here and there, especially when we acquire a company like MuleSoft or maybe other things in the future. I think that we\u2019ve talked about, we begin and end our day at Salesforce with a beginners mind, and what the Japanese call shoshin, the idea, that look, we\u2019re not attached to any kind of religious dogma around the cloud. We\u2019re going to do what\u2019s best for our customers and what\u2019s best for our company. And in the case of MuleSoft, I think it very much reflects that vision, that idea that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver the best integration cloud. Bret, how do you see this? Bret Taylor : I think, MuleSoft is interesting, because the power of integration, as you can integrate every system, every device and every user you want to reach, every customer. And that means you have to go wherever your systems are, on-prem, on mobile devices, everywhere. So we are extremely committed to the neutrality of the MuleSoft platform. When I say neutrality, it means it connects every system, whether or not the system is related to Salesforce, because that\u2019s the power of integration. And we want to unlock data from every system and bring all of that data to wherever your customers are, on every device. And so I think MuleSoft is special in that respect, because that\u2019s the power of integration. And as Marc said, from technology standpoint, we\u2019re committed to the cloud, because it means we can deliver innovation to the customers faster, three times a year, consistently since the company was founded. And we think that\u2019s the power of the cloud. But as you'll see what MuleSoft is, if our customers need us to have different architectures to unlock innovation, we'll go there. And I think you're seeing that with integration. And then we\u2019ll continue to have that beginners' mind, which I think is vital for innovation. But we're committed to the cloud, we're committed to that piece of innovation delivery, which is really the reason why we\u2019ve seen so many customers recommit to us over the years, it's because, they know they are just getting the product through us today, but the products that we\u2019ll be delivering over the coming years. Marc Benioff : And I think you can see that also in how we deliver our product. Of course, we have many first party datacenters where we have our own proprietary datacenter and capability. But in other cases, we've partnered with great companies like Amazon, like Google and IBM, in many cases at the customers\u2019 request, to be able to deliver an alternative delivery experience. And so if you\u2019re using Salesforce in Canada for example, you're using that on the back of AWS, and there is so many other examples of what we're doing with different type of cloud deployments. And it's really driven by what our customers want for flexibility. And the ability to have great relationships with great alliances with companies like Amazon, or with Google and with IBM, give us even more capability to deliver this, kind of, what I would say, highly flexible execution environment for the customer. Operator : And your last question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Alex Zukin : Marc, maybe two quick one\u2019s for you, you mentioned GDPR and you mentioned the push for data privacy law domestically. I wanted to ask what impacts, if any, have you seen or anticipated on your marketing cloud business? And then maybe bigger picture then as we think about the move from systems of record to systems and intelligence. How are you positioning the Company as a system of automation for customers as well? Marc Benioff : Well, I think it's a great question. And as we head towards Dreamforce and as we head towards -- if you don\u2019t have it on your calendar, it's the week of September 24th here in San Francisco, it feels like we are just at Dreamforce. But Dreamforce is approaching very fast, and you should all plan coming back to San Francisco for our biggest and best Dreamforce ever. I think about how does that look for customers, and things are changing and some of that has been induced by our industry, where for the first six months I think that in many aspects of our industry, we\u2019ve been going through a crisis of trust. And where the headlines in many of the newspapers have been about vendors who are having trust issues with their customers, we saw that a little bit last year in San Francisco and this year we've seen it again. I think from the European perspective the way they look at data is data belongs to you, it's your data. Now for us at Salesforce, we understand that. We've had that position from the beginning. Our customers\u2019 data belongs to them, it's their data. I think in some cases, the companies that are start-ups and next generation technologies here in San Francisco, they think that data is theirs. I think the Europeans with GDPR have really flipped the coin, especially in advertising but in another areas saying hey, this data belongs to the consumer or to the customers, you guys have to pivot back to the consumer, you have to pivot back to the customer. We need a national privacy law here in the United States that probably looks a lot like GDPR. This is going to help our industry. It's going to set the guardrails around trust, around safety. It's going to provide the ability for the customers to interact with great next generation technologies in a safe way. I think that this is going to accelerate with artificial intelligence. We saw that recently with an AI demonstration from our industry where average customers could not tell, were they\u2019re interacting with a computer or were they interacting with a human being, that starts to cross the line on what is trust. And that's where our industry really has to come forward and say we're going to make sure that these technologies are trust-based. And I think the Europeans definitely got that figured out. And I think the rest of the regulators in the world are looking strongly at that. When it comes to the advertising industry and companies that serve the advertising industry exclusively, honestly, while I think that that advertising is a model that will continue to be successful and digital advertising, well, I think that the idea that you need to build a one-on-one relationship with your customer, something that we've been saying now for almost 20 years, is probably more true than ever. Because ultimately your ability to have success with your customer will be able to sell or service, or market to them, or conduct with them in a one-on-one way based on the system of record that you have with that customer. Salesforce is a system of record oriented company, that\u2019s where we started. And then we evolved in the system of engagement. We evolved in the system of intelligence. And in many of way, we\u2019re becoming a system of systems, which I think will show you at Dreamforce. But at the end of the day, where we see the world going is, we have -- we're providing to our customers the ability for them to have that unique customer experience. To say that you\u2019re going to have this fully anonymized relationship with your customer, and if that\u2019s the future, I\u2019m really not buying into that. I know Bret you used to travel both worlds. Where do you think is going? Bret Taylor : I think the thing that I\u2019ve noticed from the industry is the confluence of the controversy is driving a lot of technology companies and Silicon Valley recently with GDPRs making trust really the number one topic for a lot of our customers with us. And you\u2019ve heard us talk a lot about trust in the context of our customers\u2019 trust in our platforms. We also want our platform to be a mechanism that our customers can use to engender trust with their consumer and with their customers. As you are a multinational right now, you're dealing with different regulatory frameworks in different regions. And one of the strengths of our platform is to be able to not only have maybe in personalized marketing and commerce experience with your consumers, but do so in a trusted way. They can handle all the different regulatory permutations that you deal with on a daily basis as a multinational company. And when you think of the strength of having one platform for your system of records for your customers, I think it's really the rapidly changing regulatory landscape and the rapidly changing expectation of consumers, is really striking our position with our customers right now, because it\u2019s so challenging for any company to navigate. And I think that really comes with -- that really amplify the value of proposition of Salesforce, because you can build these systems of engagement and systems of record in a way that actually follow consumer trust, and follows the evolving regulatory landscape. So I think it\u2019s really trending to something that we are really trying to lean into, and really lean into the value of trust is our number one value. Marc Benioff : Amy, you\u2019ve done so much work with GDPR and you\u2019re helping so many of our customers around the world implement GDPR. And of course, Saleforce has now become a system that is allowing our customers implement GDPR. Where do you see this going from a legal and privacy point of view? Amy Weaver : I think this is really a critical point for the U.S. with privacy law. We\u2019re seeing the global conversion around the important of privacy. And it\u2019s going to be important for the U.S. to be a leader now, and not just a follower. I think you\u2019re tracing that we really have to focus on as a country. One is insisting that organizations are transparent about the data practices that\u2019s what's collected, how it\u2019s used, who it\u2019s been shared with. The second is giving individuals more rights to control about their personal data. As Marc said, it starts with individuals, their privacy and their right. And then the third that\u2019s holding organizations is it\u2019s truly accountable for the privacy practices. And I think that this is going to be a key for our entire industry and establishing trust. Marc Benioff : Amy, you see a big movement here in California. There\u2019s a group of very well respected executives, not just from our industry, but also from the privacy and legal community trying to build the California GDPR. We\u2019ve called for a U.S. version of GDPR, a national privacy law. How do you see these things coming together, what is your dream for privacy in the United States? Amy Weaver : Well, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any doubt that federal privacy law is the best for the go. One of the nice things about GDPR is that it replace the patchwork of laws throughout Europe. Now it may be necessary to have a state-by-state implementation in the United States as a practical step forward, but the idea is really to get us to one national privacy law that we can all agree to. Marc Benioff : What can Salesforce do to help customers implement GDPR today? Amy Weaver : I think we can do a lot. We had spent the last year working very-very carefully with our customer's data. We have some terrific resources, two things I would steer to, first, if you go to salesforce.com/gdpr, there\u2019s a trove of resources on that. There\u2019s frequently asked questions, there are white papers, there\u2019s information about all of our system. I can also send people to Trailhead and over 22,000 people have already earned Trailhead badges on the EU privacy basics. Marc Benioff : So for financial analysts and other people on this call, if they actually want to take a course on GDPR and get up to speed, they can do that right on our Trailhead platform? Amy Weaver : Absolutely, it\u2019s a terrific place to start. Marc Benioff : And you just go to Trailhead and do a search on GDPR and that trail will come up and you can get badged and certify a GDPR, terrific. Alright, well thank you so much everybody, and we\u2019re looking forward to see you at Connections in Chicago in a couple of weeks, which will be marketing event of the year. Bret is going to be doing an amazing keynote there and demonstrating -- I think our vision for customer 360 and the integration cloud, and then we\u2019ll see you again at Dreamforce in September. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect, thank you for your participation.",

Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual Company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q. With that, let me turn the call over to you, Keith. Keith Block : Thanks, John. Thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. It\u2019s an exciting time in our industry, it\u2019s an exciting time for our customers, and it\u2019s an exciting time for Salesforce. And as you can see from our results, we continue to deliver incredible growth at scale. You saw it at the end of FY18, you saw in Q1, and you see it again in Q2. We are seeing unprecedented level of CEO engagement, driven by an appetite for real digital transformation. And at the same time, we are in the midst of an economic environment and fueling innovation. And as a result, our customers are making major and sustained investments in growth and Salesforce is at the forefront of their growth strategy. CRM has never been more strategic. It is the largest and fastest growing category in enterprise software. Salesforce is the number one provider and after 20 years, we continue to take share and separate from our competitors. In fact, we\u2019re growing at nearly twice the rate of the market. This gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to reach $23 billion in revenue by FY22 faster than any enterprise software company in history. Our vision, our execution and our relentless focus on customer success resulted once again in excellent performance across all clouds, all geographies and all industries in Q2. Revenue for the quarter rose almost $3.3 billion, up 27%. Revenue under contract, which we now call remaining performance obligation, grew 36% to approximately $21 billion. And based on these strong results, we\u2019re raising full year revenue guidance by $50 million to $13.175 billion at the high end of the range for 25% growth this year. Clearly, we are set up for a strong second half. In Q2, Sales Cloud grew 13% surpassing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. That is incredible milestone. And in the quarter, we expanded our relationship with 100-year old CPG company that\u2019s undergoing a multiyear digital transformation. We\u2019re leveraging Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud and Einstein to accelerate decision-making and support customer-centric growth across their portfolio of brands. This is a great example of an iconic industry leader stepping into the future with Salesforce. Service Cloud grew 27% as more and more companies include National Grid and Southwest Airlines turn to Salesforce to power their next generation customer engagement. Southwest, which has won awards for its customer service leadership is extending Service Cloud and Einstein to 4,000 service representatives nationwide, enabling them to deliver smarter and more personalized customer experience. Marketing and Commerce Cloud grew 37%. In Q2, we expanded the Kimberly-Clark whose products are used every day by one quarter of the world\u2019s population. We also deepened our relationship with Hulu, which is using Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud and Einstein to personalize the viewer experience for more than 20 million subscribers. And finally, the Salesforce platform grew 32% in Q2, 54% including MuleSoft. Customers continue to embrace the platform and Heroku, the Lightning App Builder to Shield and make all of their apps smarter with Einstein. Now, this is our first full quarter with MuleSoft, which is off to a fast start. The MuleSoft Anypoint platform has become [indiscernible] for digital transformation. It\u2019s in every conversation we have with senior executives. And in Q2, New York Life, the State of Colorado and Schneider Electric selected MuleSoft to transform their enterprise. In our international business, we continued to deliver strong revenue growth across key regions, 32% EMEA, 28% APAC all in constant currency. In EMEA, we strengthened our relationships with Rabobank Group. We also had a great Commerce Cloud win with leading Dutch retailer Ahold Delhaize. In APAC, we expanded with MUFG and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance in Japan. In Australia, we expanded with the country\u2019s largest telecommunications provider Telstra and we formed an exciting new relationship in the public sector with Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. Now, turning to industries. We continue to see great momentum in this space. In healthcare, we launched Health Cloud for Payers to make it easier for insurance companies to effectively and efficiently connect with members and providers. We also significantly expanded with one of the largest private payers in U.S. leveraging Health Cloud and Service Cloud to enhance their members\u2019 experience and reduce the cost of care. In the quarter, IQVIA, a leading life sciences company significantly expanded with Salesforce and they are leveraging Health Cloud and the Salesforce platform to build innovative solutions to address the clinical, commercial and regulatory needs of their clients. In financial services, we expanded with [indiscernible] and had a great financial services cloud win with one of the largest banks in the UK. You may also remember that we had our most significant public sector win with the U.S. Department of Agriculture last quarter, while in Q2, the USDA significantly expanded again with Salesforce rolling out Service Cloud and the Salesforce platform across their entire agency. Now, on the partners. Partners are absolutely critical to the Salesforce growth strategy, bringing deep industry and domain expertise that they extend our reach and help drive our customers\u2019 digital transformation. And our partners continue to strategically invest in their Salesforce practices. In fact, our top five SIs increased their total Salesforce certification by 50% in Q2.  Now, as mentioned before, to keep partners run their businesses on Salesforce and in the quarter we\u2019ve had significant expansion with Deloitte and they are rolling out Salesforce to more than 300,000 employees. So, as you can see, it was a fantastic quarter of execution across the entire Company, our clouds, our geographies, our industries. And we\u2019re absolutely well-positioned for the second half of the year. And finally, I celebrated my fifth anniversary at Salesforce in Q2. It has been an incredible five years and I couldn\u2019t be more excited to lead this Company with Marc for many years to come. I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees and our shareholders for their continued trust in us. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : All right. Thanks so much Keith and congratulations on your promotion as co-CEO. Well done. And as you heard from Keith, it was another outstanding quarter here at Salesforce. And honestly, I feel things have never been better. And I want just take a few moments to talk about the larger forces that are fueling and shaping the phenomenal growth of this Company and our industry. Our drive to $23 billion in revenue in fiscal year \u201822 and beyond is being driven by a technological revolution that\u2019s fundamentally transforming our society, the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In terms of its size, depth, capability and speed, this revolution is altering the human experience in ways we\u2019ve never experienced before. Our customers are going through an amazing digital transformation, each and every one of them; it\u2019s starting and ending with their customer. And as every company transforms their relationships with their customers using amazing technologies from artificial intelligence to the cloud itself, they are fundamentally changing how they sell and how they service, how they market and they innovate. They are connecting with their customers in a whole new way. They\u2019re building incredible new intelligent 360 degree views of their customers, and they are using extraordinary new tools to get faster, more informed decisions through advanced analytics. And at the heart of all this transformation is Salesforce. Our position as the number one sales, number one service, number one marketing and number one CRM platform is enabling our customers to stay ahead and drive in this Fourth Industrial Revolution. And as more and more companies connect everything and everyone, they are realizing that integration is vital to their success and to their digital transformation. And now, they are turning to Salesforce MuleSoft, the number one Integration Cloud to do it. Looking more closely. One of the critical aspects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is artificial intelligence, the power of machine learning and especially deep learning to give computers the ability to learn from all kinds of data and giving our customers the ability to learn about their customers and be far more personalized, efficient, effective in their relationships. Salesforce Einstein, our own artificial intelligence platform now provides our customers with over 3 billion predictions and insights every single day. That\u2019s amazing. And with the next generation of Salesforce Einstein that we introduced in the second quarter, Einstein Bots, first made available on our Service Cloud. Our customers can now unlock even deeper customer insight, deliver a transformational customer experience whether it\u2019s with the service agent, whether a sales agent or whether a bot itself. We\u2019ve demonstrated our leadership in AI by open sourcing our automatic machine learning library for structured data, which is the engine that helps power Salesforce Einstein. And our Salesforce research team introduced deep learning breakthroughs that make it possible for the first time for a single model to master 10 different natural language processing tasks at once, significantly improving the way machines understand the many nuances of human language. It\u2019s an incredible step forward for artificial intelligence. With our acquisition of Datorama, also happened in the second quarter, we are also now able to expand our Marketing Cloud and bring all of our customers\u2019 marketing efforts to do single intelligent task forward, so customer spend less time looking at spreadsheets and more time acting on the right insights to drive business decisions. Also, in the second quarter, we extended our strategic alliance with Google to deepen the integration between our Salesforce Marketing Cloud and their Google Analytics 360. And we\u2019re seeing amazing traction with customers that are experiencing the best of both worlds, Salesforce and Google together. Salesforce Commerce Cloud continues to be the fastest growing enterprise commerce solution, delivering amazing results this quarter for marquee clients, like adidas and L\u2019Or\u00e9al. We extended our Commerce Cloud with another great acquisition CloudCraze, the leader in B2B commerce, natively on the Salesforce platform. This means, now with the Salesforce Commerce Cloud, our customers can prove the same commerce experiences for their B2B business buyers that they do for their B2C consumers, all from a single platform. As you can see, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is well underway here at Salesforce. Everyone and everything is more connected than ever before. And as part of that, we see an incredible community grow up as well, all around us and supporting each other to incredible new heights. These are our trailblazers. And they are harnessing the power of our technology to transform not just the companies and industries, but their lives and their careers. I have to tell you, these trailblazers are an inspiration. More than 1 million people have now used our free online Trailhead platform to learn Salesforce skills and elevate their careers and become Salesforce trailblazers. They have run more than 8.5 million batches, certifying their skills and positioning them for jobs into digital economy. In fact, this Salesforce economy will now create 3.3 million new jobs by 2022. That\u2019s amazing. And yet another example of how Salesforce is powering is Fourth Industrial Revolution. And that\u2019s why this year\u2019s Dreamforce, which is just going to happen on September 25th is going to be even more than highlighting our incredible technology, it\u2019s going to be a celebration of these trailblazers. Dreamforce is going to run from September 25th to September 28th in San Francisco. We\u2019re bringing together thought leaders, industry pioneers and more than 100,000 trailblazers for whole four high-energy days of learning, inspiration and quality fun, and I\u2019m sorry to say, if you don\u2019t have your tickets, it\u2019s already sold out, amazing, first for Dreamforce.  Finally, in all of our work, Salesforce is guided by our core values. Many of you know that; you heard us talk about that now, our core values, trust, customer success, innovation and the equality of every human being. As you know, Salesforce has always tried to use those values as a beacon of life for our industry. This started with our finding, with our 111 model getting back. And most recently, it has evolved with our deep work and the quality. Discussions we have had with our Ohana over the past few weeks, have raised larger questions about not just the Fourth Industrial Revolution and what\u2019s happening, but also about how our values and our core values apply to the use of Fourth Industrial Revolution technology and also any unintended consequences of their use. We\u2019ve seen this discussion take place in many companies. As well we can see that happening today on the new cycle. It\u2019s been amplified by the amazing recent progress in artificial intelligence and especially deep learning. Now, here at Salesforce, we have determined that this ethical and humane use of technology, especially within this context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it must be clearly addressed, not only by us, but by our entire industry. Our industry has reached an inflection point that must be supported by a strong set of guiding values. We all know that and you see that every single day. We know the technology is not inherently good or bad. It\u2019s what we do with it that matters. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re making the ethical and humane use of technology, a strategic initiative at Salesforce. We have appointed a new officer, an individual task for a new office and ethical and humane use. And we will work with all of our Ohana, including our customers, our employees, our partners as well as industry groups and thought leaders and experts in this area to encourage, promote and publish and implement industry standards guidelines and living frameworks around the ethical and humane use of technology. This incredible aspect of the Fourth Industrial Revolution was the way forward not just for our industry, but for humanity. We have to make sure that technology strengthens our societies, instead of weakening them. Technology needs to improve the human tradition, not undermine it. We\u2019re looking forward to working with all of our Ohana and all of you in illuminating this important task together and continuing this incredible and critical discussion, especially here at Salesforce and including coming up at our Dreamforce conference. With that, I want to turn it over now to Mark Hawkins and to discuss the financial details of the second quarter. Mark Hawkins : Well, thank you, Marc. And as you\u2019ve heard, we delivered a strong second quarter result across all our products and the regions. Second quarter revenue grew 27% in dollars and constant currency. While there was not a significant year-over-year FX impact to revenue, sequentially we saw $38 million revenue headwind due to FX. MuleSoft contributed $122 million to total revenue, net of purchase accounting adjustments. This was higher than we anticipated due to a higher mix of license revenue in the quarter. We\u2019re very pleased with the MuleSoft\u2019s performance to date. Dollar attrition exited the second quarter below 10%. Second quarter GAAP EPS was $0.39 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.71. Mark-to-market accounted for a strategic investment portfolio as required by ASU 2016-01, benefitted the GAAP EPS by approximately $0.18 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.14 in the quarter. GAAP EPS also benefited by approximately $0.18 related to the partial release of our tax valuation allowance as a result of the MuleSoft acquisition. Operating cash flow was $458 million, up 38% over the last year, driven -- the overall strength we saw in the quarter, improving profitability and strong cash collections in Q2 were the drivers. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $288 million in the second quarter up 42% over last year. Unearned revenue ended the quarter at nearly $5.9 billion, up 24% in both dollars and constant currency. So, in revenue FX did not have a significant year-over-year impact on unearned revenue, but we did see a sequential FX headwind of approximately $66 million to unearned revenue in Q2. MuleSoft contributed approximately $77 million to unearned revenue in the quarter. As you may recall, in Q1, we started disclosing a new metric called remaining transaction price as part of our adoption of ASU 606. To conform with the emerging industry standard language, we have changed our terminology for the remaining transaction price to remaining performance obligation. At the end of the second quarter, our total remaining performance obligation was $21 billion, up 36% over last year. This metric represents all future revenues under contract. The current remaining performance obligation expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was $9.8 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Keep in mind the current portion of this metric is not impacted by invoicing duration unlike unearned revenue. Moving onto guidance. Let me briefly touch on the FX environment. As I mentioned previously, we experienced a sequential FX headwind to revenues. And we continue to see some movements in rates. In context, we are now anticipating an FX headwind to revenue of approximately $75 million to $100 million for the remainder of the year. Despite this FX headwind, we are raising our full year 2019 revenue guidance by $50 million to $13.125 billion to $13.175 billion or 25% year-over-year growth including MuleSoft. Speaking of MuleSoft, let me quickly touch on the revenue for the remainder of the year. We are were very pleased with the performance of MuleSoft in the second quarter. That said, as a significant portion of MuleSoft\u2019s revenue is recognized upfront as license revenue under ASU 606 and as we have limited history in forecasting under this model, we are not updating our guidance for MuleSoft contribution to revenue. We will however continue to provide our quarterly revenue contribution for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Turning to operating margin. Based on our strong performance in the quarter, we are raising our FY19, non-GAAP operating margin improvement range to 25 to 50 basis points for full fiscal year non-GAAP operating margin of 16.75% to 17%. We are raising our FY19 GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $0.97 to $0.99 and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $2.50 to $2.52. This guidance implies non-GAAP OIE of approximately 250 million for the full year. Keep in mind this guidance does not take into account any possible future impact from the mark-to-market adjustments related to ASU 2016-01, which may cause EPS volatility based on market conditions. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2019 operating cash flow growth guidance to 15% to 16% year-over-year. We also now expect full year CapEx to be 4% to 5% of revenue compared to our prior guidance of approximately 5%. For Q3, we are expecting revenue of $3.355 billion to $3.365 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.01 to $0.02, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.49 to $0.50. We expect year-over-year unearned revenue growth of approximately 20% in Q3 including MuleSoft, our Q3 UR growth rate reflects significant FX headwind to unearned revenue year-over-year in addition to the continued deepening of our quarter on quarter seasonality of UR. As a reminder, we will only provide unearned revenue guidance one more time on the third quarter call at which point we intend to stop providing this guidance, as you will have more history with the remaining performance obligation metrics. As you update your models for the back half of the year, keep in mind that Dreamforce is in Q3 this year and was in Q4 last year. So, the associated costs will occur a bit earlier in FY19. To close, we delivered a strong second quarter closing out a great first half year, positioning ourselves very well for the back half of FY19 as we head into Dreamforce. We continue to execute on our strategy of delivering durable growth at scale with some leverage and are on track for our FY22 target of $23 billion. And speaking of Dreamforce, I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Investor Day on Wednesday September 26th. I want to say thank you to our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders for your continued support. And with that, I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. John Cummings : Thanks, Jerome. You can queue up the Q&A for us, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Bhavan, your line is now open. Bhavan Suri : Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Keith, congrats there. I wanted to touch on sort of a broader question here, given the Integration Cloud. Sort of starting to see a lot of this integration with ERP and into back office systems with MuleSoft. And you sort of verticalized the front end, Financial Cloud, Health Cloud et cetera. How are you thinking about tying that back end then? Is there sort of an idea of a supply chain cloud or something along those lines? Do you think about potential new verticals? How do you sort of capture some of the value of the data that you\u2019re integrating with the ERP? I\u2019d love to get sense how you guys are thinking about that. Bret Taylor : Yes. Hi. This is Bret Taylor. It\u2019s a really great question. I think one of the best opportunities we have from MuleSoft and our Integration Cloud is aligning it with our vertical solutions. If you look at what we\u2019re doing with financial services and healthcare, it\u2019s really about transforming the customer experience in the industry. And we can\u2019t do it unless we unlock the data in this legacy system, whether it\u2019s an electronic medical records or whether it\u2019s the incredible amount of investments that the financial industry has made in their back office system. So, when we think about the opportunity from MuleSoft, it\u2019s really about aligning with our overall value proposition, transforming customer experiences and upleveling the conversation of integration from an IT tactical decision to strategic decision about how to transform your customer experience. And that\u2019s the opportunity that we see over and over again. We\u2019re talking about integrating with our customers. It\u2019s not just the problem for the CIO, it\u2019s a problem for the CEO, and that\u2019s the opportunity of integrating this value proposition. Keith Block : Just to emphasize this point. This morning I received an email from the CEO of one of the largest banks in EMEA who wants to bring their entire executive team over to talk about the integration with MuleSoft could do to unlock their data. So, it\u2019s a perfect proof point of exactly what Bret is talking about. There is huge opportunity in the space. Bhavan Suri : Can you just tell us how the integration is going... Keith Block : We\u2019re thrilled with the integration. As you know, it\u2019s just our first quarter. And we\u2019ve done many, many acquisitions here. I would say that this is probably the smoothest integration that we have. The integration with the field, the product teams, the marketing organizations across the board, all the lines of businesses has really, really been fantastic. And you can\u2019t have a conversation right now with the customer, I was talking about MuleSoft. Everybody wants to talk about the importance of integration as it relates to digital transformation. So, we\u2019re very, very optimistic. Bhavan Suri : Bret, you said kind of the acceleration of the public cloud combined with customers major investments in their own data centers is driving this Integration Cloud, or what do you see as the core driver? Bret Taylor : There are so many trends happening simultaneously that is driving this investment and integration. We have customers who want to transform the customer experience. And they\u2019re also lifting and shifting their infrastructure from their own on-premise data centers to the cloud. And every customer I talk to at scale public cloud, private cloud, on-prem, sometimes even mainframe systems. And they can\u2019t wait for all that technology change to shift before transforming their customer experience. And that\u2019s the promise of MuleSoft is we can actually transform it now. And that\u2019s why the conversations that Keith mentioned are happening right now is all these trends are driving integration, sort of upleveling the discussion or negotiation to a strategic level. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Kirk, your line is now open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. And I\u2019ll add my congrats to Keith on his new appointment. I guess, my one question and one follow-up for Mark Hawkins. I guess, just my question was around Marc some of your comments on deep learning and AI. I was just curious, how often Einstein is coming up in these engagements you\u2019re having with CEOs. Is having an AI platform becoming really table stakes to participate in this digital transformation discussion? And then, just a quick clarification for Mark Hawkins. Mark, I assume the guidance you gave, I guess the FX headwind was [incremental][ph] relative to what you were thinking earlier, meaning it\u2019s become a bigger headline since we last talked to you three months ago? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks so much for that question. I mean, it\u2019s been quite a few years now that we made a strategic decision here that artificial intelligence had to be a core part of the Salesforce platform. Of course, we\u2019re seeing so many exciting technologies emerge that we knew -- that had to become a part of our platform on our journey over the last 20 years. But, I think AI was probably the most daunting because there is many different aspects of artificial intelligence. And through a lot of core native development, through acquiring companies, refining incredible talents, we\u2019ve been able to build a phenomenal platform with Salesforce Einstein. I don\u2019t think that there is a more successful business implementation of artificial intelligence than Einstein. Not just core in our platform, but also now in all of our core clouds as well. I mean, you can see how Sales Cloud Einstein or Service Cloud Einstein or even the Marketing Cloud helps transform the customer experience. But probably the most powerful is our Commerce Cloud. When we actually turn Einstein on in the Commerce Cloud and customers have the option to do that, but when they did turn it on, they see double-digit revenue growth above what they were already experiencing on the Commerce Could is amazing. And it really goes to show how the ability to take this really powerful next generation technology can have dramatic business outcomes. And we\u2019re deeply committed to artificial intelligence. And as I said, we\u2019re also deeply committed to the ethical and humane use of that technology that we all realize that AI is developing a lot faster going a lot farther than any of us realized. And Salesforce, as I believe probably is the premier provider of artificial intelligence, certainly in business applications and enterprise applications, we still feel a deep responsibility to help with the guidance of that capability. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark. Mark Hawkins : Kirk, you are correct. Yes, this is bigger since we talked prior and despite the FX headwind that we see that is affecting us in the second half, obviously, been raising our revenue, our operating margin and our cash flow. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. Richard, your line is now open. Richard Davis : Maybe just a broader question for Marc Benioff. Look, there are thousands of companies out there. As you and I both know, most of them hit a wall and often times the stumbling block is CEO who doesn't change with the company. So Marc maybe this will be a better question over a beer or whatever. But you and I have met a bunch of private companies, but it would be super helpful if you passed on one or two key things that you've done to scale as a CEO, because you've seen it that CEOs hold on too tight, they don\u2019t do it that or the other but that would be actually another swansong question, but I was just curious. Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, it\u2019s a good question and I\u2019ll tell you in the room here is Monica Langley, and we're working on and you've probably read the book behind the cloud. And we're working on a new book right now, which we're really excited about. And we just thought one of the key chapters that really answer your question and still firmly believe that you're an entrepreneur that really the key to having durable success over multiple decades, which is what Salesforce have now done, is really to maintain in the beginners mind. You probably heard me talked about this, but rarely does a morning go by where I don't take some time for mindfulness myself, and really say okay now and everything that\u2019s going on in the industry, in the world, in our company, with everything that\u2019s happening, what do I want right now; to really start fresh, completely clear my mind; to really let everything go that has happened over multiple decades; and to say, okay, what do I want now; where are we going. And we do that -- I do that with myself and we do that also at our management team, we just finish one of our major management conferences; and we take that same approach where we really say, okay, what is that we really want; and I think that\u2019s an incredible time; we're all still connected all the time, everything that\u2019s going on, so much email; we're on our phones and for everyone on this call is looking down at their phone right now; and just put our phone down and stop and just say okay, well let's take a moment and then move forward. And I don\u2019t think for my commentary other entrepreneurs, is they need to take care of themselves just a single month a quarter and then starts with their beginners mind. You can see that new book I assume hopefully, right Monica? Monica Langley : In one year. Marc Benioff : In one year actually, all right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo, your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : I just had a question Keith for you. Now that you have MuleSoft in for a little bit, what has been the feedback from the Salesforce? Because I am sure where you could say MuleSoft is a little bit more of a technical sale, but you guys also talked about that the whole discussion is to coming a lot more strategic. How has your sales force being able to take on MuleSoft and integrate it into the overall offering? Thank you. Keith Block : So I would just characterize it this way, nearly universal euphoria. And if you think about the conversation that we're having at the CEO level, these are all about digital transformation. And the whole concept of integration just complete the thought and the promise of digital transformation again, by unlocking the data from these legacy systems. So MuleSoft already has a very, very capable and high-performing sales organization, which we continue to invest in. And we've been able to have very, very tight alignment enablement with the core Salesforce with the sales organization and that's just created lot traction. But again, if you think about the conversation and the dialogue that we're having with our customers, this is just one of a missing piece of the puzzle and we listen to our customers that's why we made this acquisition, because we knew exactly how important this is going to be to completing that digital transformation. So the integration is going very, very well the traction is there, the alignment is there, the synergies are there, the enablement is there. And the customers want this message, they want the store, they want the solution. Raimo Lenschow : Bret, are you surprised that the rate of acceptance with the integration cloud and what's happening. I know you have a lot of surprised planned for Dreamforce around that as well. But is this a shock? Bret Taylor : It's not a shock. For me when I look at our product portfolio and I don't view it in the separate products for separate clouds. I really view it as stages of customer lifecycle, customer touch points. And we're really saw an integrate it transformed customer experience. It just like automation and AI are in every conversation, because every company wants a more predictive smarter personalized experience with our customers. Every customer want that integrated experience that pulls together all the different departments, all the different legacy systems, provide an integrated view of the customer. We want every single person that addresses the customer to be able to have a single view of the personal topics view. And that's fundamentally what NeoSoft and our integration routes provide, it's relevant in every single customer conversation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith, Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : I was wondering if we could dig in little bit to marketing cloud, we've seen a couple of quarters of acceleration there. Marc Benioff, on the last call you alluded to benefits that you expected to see from GDPR. Are we starting to see those benefits roll through, or is it too early for that and other things? And then maybe if I could sneak in a second question, I was just wondering about the decision to open source parts of the Einstein Data Framework. What was the rationale behind that, pushing that the open source community, what's the benefits you're expecting to see from that open sourcing of that technology? Marc Benioff : Well, I think that number I mean, I would say it was last week in the conference and I met with more than a hundred of top European CEOs and probably each. And every conversation that I have with them, I see a deep yearning for them to have a more complete relationship with their customer. But it's a deeper aspect of that, they want a one-on-one relationship with their customer, especially consumer companies you can see that you look -- if you go to some of the major consumer sites that and companies that we work with like Louis Vuitton or Adidas or L'Oreal or Puma or New Balance, you can see that you're starting now one-on-one relationship with the company that they're able to really provide a one-to-one experience with you and that's not just in commerce, when it's in marketing, in conservative, in sales and to bring in from the previous questions, it's intelligence is that is we're using AI to make that a more personalized experience to give you that opportunity. And that's what every company wants to get to, whether they're a B2B company or a B2C Company. It's one of the reasons I'm so excited, for example, in the CloudCraze acquisition and a company like Adidas, they have significant percentage of course with their commerce is B2C. We all know that we go on their site and we buy or use these. But did you know that an even larger percentage of their electronic commerce is B2B that is of course they need to be able to go and sell to all the other companies that sell Adidas and we all know who those companies are. And that opportunity to offer a B2B and B2C experience, that's one-on-one that is really driving this phenomenal growth, especially you can see in the marketing side. Of course email is a key driver there and no one sends more business emails than in a highly personalized intelligent way than we do. You'll also see that it drove our acquisitions this quarter is Datorama. If you haven't seen Datorama, it is an amazing company. It's a company that through artificial intelligence it's automatically able to integrate all these different marketing automation applications. Of course, Salesforces is probably the number one marketing cloud in the world but there are other marketing clouds as well and there is other marketing technologies. Datarama is able to automatically reach out to those and then provide to the marketer automated dashboards and integrated KPIs to give them basically an incredible opportunity to drive their market, that is going to be future growth of our marketing plan. I am so excited and we're able to acquire this company and that we're able to rapidly start to integrate it into our system. Finally, you mentioned open sourcing, key part of our AI. We're working closely with the entire AI community. And as part of that, we believe that we're all working on artificial intelligence together. And we're certainly -- we've benefited from the open source community and we're going to contribute as well back to the open source community, that's part of our philosophy at Salesforce. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather, your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Marc Benioff, I just had a question about MuleSoft. You've obviously had great success from founding the company almost 20 years ago. But how do you see MuleSoft, if at all, helping to modernize your own internal IT and your clouds? And are there new offerings as a result of that that you envision you might be able to offer to customers as you do this? And then my follow-up is just related to, you've been very vocal about how great the IT spending environment is this year? And I'm just wondering, I know it's early but any reads from all the customers that you've done as you look up to next year? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, I'll take the last part first, which is I've never seen such a robust spending environment. This is just the time when now to speak really to the CEO level, I've never seen CEOs spend so aggressively. They've benefitted really dramatically from these tax cuts and also from the deregulation focus, especially in the United States. And it doesn\u2019t matter of its American or European as I mentioned out there last week, or an Asian CEO. I've had occurrences with all of them recently and I can tell you that across the board, I don't know a CEO who is not aggressively spending at a level that I have not seen them spend that before. And probably the number one thing that they're spending on is their own digital transformations. They are really positioning their companies for the future. I mean we're really in an incredible time and I have been continued to be extremely impressed with that. Of course, we have tremendous offering for them as well. We have the right product at the right time that is really helping. In regards to integration cloud, this is the company with MuleSoft that of course we help funding at the beginning. I personally recruited other investors like Cisco into the company board members I really always love the company. And them something amazing happened last year. I was just talking to a lot of customers and I keep hearing that integration was moving up on their priority list. And the reason why is very simple, everybody knows that public clouds are becoming more dominant. We've seen the incredible growth of amazing Salesforce customers like Amazon and Google, two of our largest customers and their public cloud. But as our customers move to these public cloud environments, including ours by the way, it really motivates the integration issue, because not only do they have their data in their data centers, but now they have data in multiple in most cases, public clouds, as well as they're getting data from other SaaS vendors and these another public data sources. All of these things created integration gambit like never seen before. And yet here this company MuleSoft that has a radically new API driven approach to integration that\u2019s just phenomenal. And it's just been out, and of a sudden I turned to Keith and Bret and they know this, impact from one specific customer and I said, what, I mean we can offer our solution to the customer and provide an incredible 360 degree view of the customer and their customer for that customer, and give them insights like never before. But we are not going to be able to do that without this level of integration, because the customer their ability to have that 360 degree view of their customer is in so many different places now it's unbelievable. So Bret, do you want to just amplify or extent anything? Bret Taylor : Yes, I mean if you think about the fourth investor revolution really is about the pace of technology change, increasing more rapidly than we've ever seen. And I think when I talked to CIs and CIOs the, main thing they're focused on the agility, how can we move our business more faster and keep pace with the changing expectations of our consumers and is constant concept of the API economy and breaking your company up into services and API so you can empower your business units to actually move faster than ever before is on everyone's mind. And we also have really amplified that strategy and really helps CEOs increase to fox speed of their digital transformation. And there is incredible opportunity, because the way they approach it's perfectly aligned with this concept of agility to become self-strategic in the fourth industrial revolution. Heather Bellini : And Keith, I just have to ask you because obviously you've been here for five years, you've seen us to do lot of acquisitions. Has there ever been an acquisition that's has this rate of growth, speed and acceptance by customers that this one have that? Keith Block : Well, we had a lot of great acquisition, as you know. I think that this one is very, very exciting and as it goes back to the comments that both of you, both you and Bret had made. If you think historically about what is going on in the world with the legacy debt, the processes that have built up over decades, the technology processes, the business processes. And then companies now more than ever because we are in the fourth industrial revolution and we have these amazing technologies, they has to be agile, they has to be Nimble. They have to reinvent themselves and driving business models. And if they can't get access to the data, if they can't leverage the strength of the data that is -- it's like an ocean of data then they will miss out on the opportunity. And you can think about offensive strategy if you're a CEO or a defensive strategy, but you must do something and that's what we're seeing in these conversations. So that's why I get excited about MuleSoft as I talk with customers and I know our employees as well, because this is really an opportunity to unlock that. So it's good as all these other acquisitions have been and they've been fantastic. I'm very, very excited about this and we're off to a great start. And you're going to see an incredible new reveal at Dreamforce, we're not going to stop these but Bret has done some amazing work, too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Mark, Your line is now open. Mark Murphy : Keith, congrats to you on nice performance. Mark Hawkins, I wanted to ask you, MuleSoft contributed $200 million to the total RPO balance. And I am just curious if you're able to ballpark what it would have contributed to the current RPO balance if there was anything material. And then also for Keith and possibly Brett, we started to hear some feedback about underappreciated emerging jewels in the product portfolio. And in particular, those were references to commerce with CloudCraze and CPQ with SteelBrick. A couple of your partners are now saying that they've these three big focus areas of sales, service and marketing and that they're now going to have a fourth pillar in these areas. And sometimes they're seeing the contract values are increasing 20% or 30% when a customer adopts commerce and CPQ. So I just wanted to ask you. Do you see the ingredients for those products to supply it to the upside and possibly how that billion dollar multi-year potential? Marc Benioff : So let me take a first one, thank you, Mark. In terms of RPO, you're absolutely right. In aggregate, there was $200 million that MuleSoft to our total deal, if you will. Wanted to share with you is the breakdown of that. We have about $100 million of that with the in the current RPO and obviously the $100 million will the non-current. So that's a little bit additional granularity that I can provide to you. Keith Block : I think the success of our Sales Cloud and our Service Cloud our marketing plan is pretty amazing. The Sales Cloud growth is now $1 billion plus run rate, which is unprecedented marketplace. We've obviously seen great success with Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud. But all of this really speaks to our culture of innovation, whether it's our organic innovation or our cloud innovation. And I'm very, very close to the partner community and in the ecosystem. I mean, it's one of our free growth levers to have the largest ecosystem in the cloud. And we'd love the fact that our partners are investing in these elements of innovation. I mean, our partner certifications year-over-year are up 50%. I think that speaks volumes about their confidence in our solutions, whether it's in CPQ, whether it's in Commerce Cloud. All of these are solutions and this is a hand in glove conversation, these are solutions that are oriented around our industry focus, on their -- organized around our line of business focus. We are long gone from the days of focusing on single clouds. We are out there driving solutions, driving digital transformation and multi-cloud solutions and that's why you see the great result that we've seen in the quarter, which you saw in Q1 like you saw at the end of last fiscal year and why we're still talking about the second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line is Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Ross, your line is now open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much and my congratulations as well, and to you Keith on the new appointment. Maybe one for you Keith and just a follow-up for Mark Hawkins. Keith you mentioned Einstein I think in a numbers of descriptions of the major wins this quarter and CPG and airlines, et cetera. And I'm just curious as to how fast that's evolving. And are we getting to a point now where you're feeling more confident that Einstein is an incremental monetization opportunity for the company? And then I had a follow-up for Mark Hawkins. Thanks. Keith Block : Einstein is -- it's an incredible product and we're just at the beginning here. It's an incredible piece of innovation. We put a lot of time and effort into this. We've got some amazing talented associated with it, and thought leadership and Bret's team is just done unbelievable job. And it is part of every dialogue because customers, no matter what industry, no matter what geography, what no matter what size of company, you are inside. And what I love about Einstein, I mean there's many things to love. But what I particularly love about Einstein it is applied with intelligence, lot of people talk about artificial intelligence in the without really having a scope or definition, of any boundary. And ours is real, it's tangible, it's pragmatic, it's practical. So it is something that\u2019s applied to fantastic use cases whether it's in sales, services, marketing commerce it makes our conversations even more relevant. And our customers get even more value out of our existing product. So we drive more value, there is an opportunity to grow deal sizes, to extend relationships, to deepen relationships, and there is a long way to go. But boy, the results are, from a mind share perspective and early days on the money side and revenue side, we feel very, very good about where we're going here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. John, your line is now open. John DiFucci : My question is for Keith. Keith, it sounds like the vertical businesses are doing very well they continue to do very well. And Salesforce, as an organization, hasn't been shy about standing up for just causes beyond the business at Salesforce.com. And I want to ask one question on one of these verticals and it's really the public sector. And according to what we hear the public sectors virtually sounds like it's been doing very well for a while here. I guess have you seen any recent impact on that business due to recent corporate activism by Salesforce.com? Just curious if that\u2019s affecting that business at all. Keith Block : Public sector is one of our strongest verticals. It continues to be one of our strongest verticals. Whether it's the United States government and UK government or any government in the world, they're charged to provide a higher level of service to their citizens. And that comes to the modernization of their legacy systems and using new technology like ours so that they can engage with citizens in an unprecedented way and that\u2019s the truly fueling our growth. That business is very, very healthy and we support those organizations and their missions, and the results speak for themselves. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from SunTrust Robinson. Terry, your line is now open. Terry Tillman : Just one question, I know you guys tapped the idea of durable growth over time. What I'm curious about is if you look at the platform business and you back out MuleSoft, the platform business has just been chugging along in well over 35% growth. I guess, could you talk about maybe what's been driving growth more recently, in terms of is it just custom-built extensions off of your core cloud apps or ISV traction? Just wanting to double-click more into the strength of your platform business. Thank you. Keith Block : So I\u2019ll just answer this and Marc if you want to chime in, please do. But our core platform business is very strong and when you think about the capability around growth, you think about capability around the core platform, you think about shield, you think about analytics these are all growth drivers and difference makers to our customers, it just extend the platform. And we've had a great deal of focus and energy on this topic and we've executed incredibly well. So I think you're just going to continue to see that happen. Marc Benioff : I\u2019d just -- I totally echo that. I think things are -- it's really been exciting to be able to see that growth of addition and all the other things you had called out Shield, these are things that we're really getting even our ecosystem and what that contributing as well has been positive. And I\u2019ll just add that at Dreamforce, you're going to see some amazing extensions to the core platform. We're not going to go just throw them right now, but I am sure you will be as well as way I am. You saw yesterday we also announced our lead band tour Dreamforce, which is Metallica but we have a lot of other amazing entertainment plan and speakers. Some of that we're going to be dribbling out as we've had between now and September 25th. And a lot of it you're going to see reveals for the first time during the Dreamforce keynote. I promise all of you that this will be the Dreamforce that you will all never forget. And I look forward to seeing all of you there. And with that\u2026 John Cummings : Great. Well, thanks so much everyone for joining us today. If you have any further questions regarding our second quarter results, please feel free to email us at investor@salesforce.com. Otherwise, we'll look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Investor Day, Dreamforce on September 26th. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the CRM Q3 Fiscal Year \u201819 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for reply purposes. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Cummings, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal third quarter 2019 results conference call. Our results press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today\u2019s call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Keith Block, Co-CEO; Marc Benioff, Chairman and Co-CEO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; and Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that, let me hand the call over to you, Keith. Keith Block : Thank you, John, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As you can see from our results, we had another great quarter as we continue to deliver strong growth, customer success and execution at scale. Revenue in Q3 was up 26%. And given the strength of the quarter and our outlook for Q4, we are raising our FY19 full year revenue guidance to $13.24 billion at the high-end of the range. This represents 26% growth this year. Obviously, we are very, very proud of the quarter and momentum in our business and our leadership position in the market. We\u2019re also initiating revenue guidance for FY20 at $16 billion, at the high end of the range, representing 21% growth for year and demonstrating the incredible demand for the solutions only Salesforce can deliver. We are clearly executing on our vision of transformation and success for our customers, and we are doing it at scale. Every company in the world has a mandate to digitally transform its business. We continue to see this in Q3 with strong performances across every industry, every market segment and every geography. We grew 25% in the Americas, 26% in APAC and 31% in EMEA in constant currency. Now, since Dreamforce at the end of September, I've traveled around the world meeting with more than a 100 CEOs and world leaders. The conversation is consistent everywhere I go. It's about digital transformation, it's about leveraging our technology, it\u2019s about our culture, and it's about our values. This sea level engagement is translating into more strategic relationships than ever. In fact, in Q3, the number of deals generating more than $1 was up 46% over last year and the number of $20 million plus relationships we have continues to grow significantly. In fact, in the quarter, we renewed and expanded a nine-figure relationship with one of the largest financial services institutions in the world, very, very excited about this. As you know, an overwhelming majority of our revenue is multi-cloud. Customers like DuPont, Citi, Uber, many others are all driving more meaningful relationships with our customers across sales, service, marketing, commerce, integration and more. I was recently in Australia where I met with dozens of government officials and CEOs across several industries, many are being challenged by disruption and all agree that being closer to their customers and citizens is critical to their growth and their success. And this is not unique to Australia. Digital transformation is a global phenomenon. Now, we had a great quarter in EMEA where we strengthened our relationships with Deutsche Telekom, NG, Dyson, Galois [ph]. In APAC, we expanded with [indiscernible] and Bajaj Finserv and formed a new relationship with MLC Life Insurance. In Japan, we expanded with heavy industrial manufacturer IHI as one of the world's leading manufacturers -- auto manufacturers.  Our industry strategy, which is all about speaking the language of the customer, continues to drive exceptional growth. Our strong momentum with Financial Services Cloud continued in Q3. And as I mentioned before, one of the largest financial services institutions in the world selected Financial Services Cloud as well as Einstein. Mutual of America Life Insurance also selected Financial Services Cloud and they're leveraging Salesforce Einstein to improve their go-to-market strategy and customer engagement. Heading on, Federal Credit Union, with nearly 2 million members is also going all the way with Financial Services Cloud as well as Community Cloud, Einstein and MuleSoft to deliver a best in class member experience. And the Salesforce platform now powers mission critical applications across the Department of Veterans Affairs while Service Cloud helps ensure veterans can reach a life support agent 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, very, very important for those folks. We also expanded with a branch of the United States Armed Forces to transform how they engage with the service members from recruitment to retirement. And with Health Cloud, we formed a new relationship with WorkSafe Victoria in Australia and we expanded our existing relationship with Alcon, one of the world\u2019s leading eye care and medical device companies. Now partners, which is so critical to our growth, they continue to expand our ecosystem, which extends the power of our core offerings. At Dreamforce, we added Apple to our roster of strategic partners, which we're very excited about. And that roster includes Amazon, Google, IBM and others. In this quarter, our SI partners were engaged in 64% of our new business globally and continue to invest in their Salesforce practices. Global partner certifications are up 26% year-over-year. That's the 19th consecutive quarter that our partner certifications have grown by double digits. Now finally, we continue to execute again and again with our proven integration model. As a result, we're already seeing great returns from our acquisitions of MuleSoft and Datorama and CloudCraze. And speaking of MuleSoft, integration has become a strategic imperative for all of our customers, it has captured the attention of C level executives in virtually every conversation I have. And in the quarter, companies like Ahold Delhaize, WeWork, Michael Kors [ph] and contingents just love MuleSoft because MuleSoft is able to unlock data from legacy systems and accelerate their digital transformation. In closing, we\u2019re thrilled with our results and our strong momentum heading into Q4 and FY20. It's been an outstanding year-to-date and we're well on our way to achieving our goal of $21 billion to $23 billion in revenue in FY22, faster than any enterprise software company in history. I want to thank our customers, our partners and employees for their trust and continued support. I also want to take a moment to thank the firefighters and first responders who courageously battled wildfires here in California. Our thoughts remain with them and all of those who have been affected by these terrible events. With that, I will turn the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : All right. Well, thank you so much, Keith. And, before I start, I do want just come back to that and thank all of the first responders and everyone who\u2019s worked so hard over the last two weeks. We've had terrible tragedy here in Northern California and also one in Southern California and certainly here during the holidays, 14,000 families that lost their home, 500 businesses, half of all first responders lost their home in the fires and it's been a terrible disaster here to serve. Obviously, we had a terrible fire last year; this one is even worse, worse ever in Northern California. And all of our hearts are with the victims and their families. And also, all of our gratitude is with first responders. We had a city here filled with smoke for a couple weeks and that smoke just reminded us how connected we are, not only to each other here in San Francisco but all the way up to Butte County. And our hearts remain with them during the season. And we really want to thank our -- not only our employees but also customers, many of whom came to our lobbies here where we filled supplies up and brought them up to Butte County and distributed gift cards. Many of our customers who are retailers helped us prepare gift cards for first responders as well as for the families in Butte County, I want to thank them. And we're going to continue to work on that. It is still in our mind. And we're also giving $2 million initially to these relief efforts. And all of us at Salesforce are going to continue to stand with our neighbors and communities across California as we're rebuilding. Thank you for letting me just talk about that for just a moment, because it's been something that we've all gone through here over the last two weeks, several weeks. Okay. Now, with respect to the numbers. Keith said it, this was absolutely a fabulous third quarter. It was incredible. Obviously, we\u2019ve given guidance for an incredible fourth quarter coming. And I'm hoping that Keith is going to improve on that even though the fourth quarter guidance is incredible. And here we are $16 billion for next year and only two years from our goal of $22 billion to $23 billion, which is amazing that in fiscal year \u201822 we have this vision. So, thank you to our team and our ohana, who are delivering these incredible results. It\u2019s just amazing and incredible moment in history. We are all in this midst [ph] here. And I just was talking to Jim Cramer, and he was like what is happening? [Ph] This is all about the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This is about the cloud, it\u2019s about artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning. I mean, there\u2019s so many technologies that are happening. I mean, I read this morning in the newspaper about CRISPR being used to genetic editing of twins in China. I mean, we are in a lot of uncharted territory here. And we\u2019re going to continue to see incredible expansion. But, when it gets right down to a digital transformations, well, every digital transformation starts and ends for all of our customers with their customer. And CRM has never been more strategic. You could see that in the growth rates for the CRM marketplace. [Ph] It remains the fastest growing market segment in enterprise software. That\u2019s a big change from when Keith and I started in the enterprise software industry, started [ph] in 1986. And it was all about other types of technologies that have been downplayed. Now, it\u2019s all about the customer, it\u2019s about CRM. And this is a big and exciting market. We\u2019re obviously largest player, we have these incredible growth rates that we\u2019re putting up. When we look at other companies in the CRM marketplace, a lot of companies are doing very well, because this is what it\u2019s all about; it\u2019s all about the customer. And Salesforce remains this global CRM leader. We\u2019re the number one CRM. We continue to take share and outpace the market. You can see that in our results as we\u2019re moving to $16 billion. This is because we\u2019re the only company that is dedicated 100% to CRM at this size and scale. And we\u2019re the only company with a complete Customer Success Platform for both these B2B customers and their B2C companies as well. For those of you who joined us at Dreamforce, I always look at that as the ultimate manifestation of our Company and how we\u2019re doing. You saw the huge turnout, especially compared to some of our competitors. I\u2019m not going to name any names, because they\u2019re very sensitive, they get upset. But some of our competitors also had conferences recently, they didn\u2019t have a big, huge turnout like this, 171,000 registered attendees, 10 million watched us online, largest Dreamforce ever. Probably everyone at the call was at Dreamforce, it was incredible. And we saw these amazing companies where Marriott, and Brunello Cucinelli was here from Italy and Unilever was here from the United Kingdom. And everyone connected with their customers in a whole new way. We also saw -- my friends that are right [ph] here did incredible new product. Bret Taylor launched his Customer 360, customers blow away, [ph] connecting all of our clouds together, giving our customers a single 360 degree view of their customers across every touch-point, across sales, across service marketing commerce, but really thinking now special of MuleSoft, how do we give those customers that 360 degree view they so badly want. And that\u2019s why this is one of the biggest [indiscernible] we\u2019ve ever made, and Bret will talk about it later on the call. And of course, you can see the acceleration in our business, and also in our positioning, our relationship with our customers, the MuleSoft, the number one integration cloud, giving customers extraordinary power of integration, bringing together vast amounts of data across all kinds of systems in this incredible API architecture. I always loved this company and I love it more now as part of Salesforce. They\u2019re right here with us now in Salesforce Tower. Greg and Steve just did incredible job. And we saw that not just at Dreamforce but through the whole quarter. And I think both companies are just hugely surprised that how well it\u2019s come together but also their execution dynamite. And then, you also saw the release again Bret came up with this with Parker, Einstein Voice, amazing. And you saw these amazing demonstrations of the voice, not just interactive voice response, but now Salesforce can actually parse the data and actually inset it correctly in the customer database automatically. So, anyone can talk to Salesforce, makes every employee and customer more productive, amazing. And Einstein, talking to Siri. Einstein and Siri are now friends. Hopefully they become friends, because we had Apple for the first time, strategic relationship, something we've always wanted, at Dreamforce, amazing to have this great relationship with Tim Cook, probably the best executive in our whole industry. Thank you Tim for your leadership and what you've done, the relationship with Salesforce, very grateful to you. And as we roll out these new mobile apps, our customers are expecting more innovation to come. Now, you also saw that we're strengthening our relationships with amazing companies in the cloud world including Amazon, and Google, IBM delivering these incredible innovations. And our customers are just loving what the amount of innovation that's happening in our industry, especially as the cloud becomes mainstream. And at Dreamforce, we were thrilled to announce on these strategic partnership, again expanding that capability and giving that -- giving us that that capability to have it not only with Amazon and Google but Apple as well and other companies. Okay. Let's talk about Einstein for a second. I told you Einstein was delivering 3 billion predictions and insights everyday in the last quarter. Well, now, few months later, we are doing 4 billion Einstein predictions every single day, exceeding our expectation. The transformation of all of our products, artificial intelligence, all of our products getting smarter, all of our products having Einstein built in that Einstein is at heart of the Customer Success Platform, making it more powerful, more capable every day. They look at the many layers of our Customer Success Platform. The center is the customer, then of course everything is going in and out of Einstein with Einstein making the customer smarter. Being our partner every day, I know I used that that's incredibly important to me, surrounded by this whole range of capabilities, whether it's sales or service or marketing or commerce or a platform, or integration or a community or enablement or engagement, I mean all levels of the Customer Success Platform has been made better by Einstein and then wrapped by this amazing trailblazer community, so awesome.  Now, we really saw this weekend, I'll tell you during Black Friday and Cyber Monday of course our customers have deployed this Customer Success Platform. So, you're like wondering what's going on; I discussed it\u2019s amazing, report I can't talk about it because it's a public company and working very closely who had this massive success over the weekend. And they are retail industry. But, I look at all these companies and we are powering more than $20 million orders on the Customer Success Platform, double digit growth, amazing. But one thing that really stood out for us was 50% of the orders are placed on the phone, wow! Mobile traffic to retail sites reaches 67%. So obviously that's a huge transformation that we've gone through with our customers, especially retail customers are going through that. I\u2019d just like to touch base briefly now on our trailblazers. The outer ring of our platform. Our ohana is so important but especially our trailblazers, and we've got a million of these trailblazers who are empowered and enabled with all of this capability, and they're doing that on Trailhead. For those of you who\u2019ve not been on trailhead.com. Please get on trailhead.com. This is our free online marketing platform. It's letting everybody go through the workforce development they need to get into the Fourth Industrial Revolution to have their place in the digital economy. This is center to our strategy. And you can see that because a quarter of these customers are on trailhead, it\u2019s self reported that they have changed jobs because of skills they have gotten on the platform and the jobs they're getting are these phenomenal six-figure jobs and so excited for all of our trailblazers and our goals are to get to millions and millions of these trailblazers. So, we are really excited. We also saw that we have received -- continue to get some great recognition. And of course paramount to Salesforce as our culture, Keith and I work on that the end every day. That's reflected in our core values of trust and customer success and innovation and of equality. But, our culture is very important for those of you\u2019ve been to any of our towers around the world, whether it\u2019s in San Francisco or Indianapolis, or London, or Tokyo, or New York. I can tell you, you can feel it when you walk in, the culture is so important to us and we're trying to cultivate a great culture. But thank you Fortune magazine ranking Salesforce, again the number one best place to work in the world and that is not just true globally but in so many of the cities also that we have -- do business and we've been called out by Fortune magazine. So thank you for that, that\u2019s so important to us. And also I also want to thank Harvard Business Review called out Salesforce, and obviously top CEOs but really calling to us number six top company in the world Harvard Business Review and number one American company for best performance for 2018. So, thank you Harvard Business Review, we're very, very grateful as well to you.  We saw this quarter how the two parts of our vision at Salesforce changing the way the world does business and improving the state of the world go hand-in-hand. At the Global Climate summit in San Francisco, many of you were with us. Salesforce united with 21 other tech companies in the Step Up Declaration decarbonize [ph] companies. We realized it\u2019s more important. World Economic Forum says that by 2015 we're going to have more plastic in the ocean than fish. Who wants a plastic ocean? I don't. We're deforestation, losing 1 acre of forest every single second. Who wants a planet without forests? I don't. We need the forests right now more than ever, and this was evangelized by Jane Goodall at the conference because of the carbon situation. So, we've got to improve our situation with our climate. So, we've continued to focus with others in our industry to decarbonize and to improve our relationship with the climate. Onward to public education. With the end of the Fourth Industrial Evolution, we've got to bring the kids with us. That's why we've now put more than $50 million in our local San Francisco and Oakland public schools. This is halfway to our short term target of $100 million. And everyone knows that we are thrilled that San Francisco passed Proposition C, amazing and record turnout, incredible turnout. San Francisco is coming to the polls realizing that we could do something together, which is passing Proposition C. Spoke to the Mayor this morning, and we are very excited moving forward with Proposition C, the city will begin collecting the tax January 1st and looking forward to getting that into the hands of amazing NGOs that we have here in San Francisco, like Hamilton families, like Larkin Street, like Glide, like Catholic Charities, so many people hero helping our terrible, horrible, homeless situation, and we experience it every day being here. I know many people who live in cities in the United States are experiencing that homelessness and there's so many things that we can do. We learned so much during Prop C, and saw so many great insights. But the number one thing that every homeless person needs is a home. And at this time of the year during the holidays, all those homeless people are on our minds more than ever. And thank you for your strong support here in San Francisco. And the largest and most successful businesses are coming out for the good of the homeless. And thank you to Twilio now for giving $1 million and thank you to Airbnb for giving $5 million to homelessness since Prop C. Others are now able to -- coming in to support the homeless situation and we plan for another major announcement this week regarding the homeless. So, be on the lookout for that. It's another reminder, business does not exist in a bubble, we\u2019re part of the city, we\u2019re part of the community, we\u2019re part of the ohana, we\u2019re part of the planet, and we realize we're all connected, we're all one that our companies are only as strong as these connections and our communities, and that's something Keith and I are talking about all the time how Salesforce can be a light unto the nations and be a beacon for others and show what's possible when business becomes one of the greatest platforms for change. And with that let me turn it over to Chief Financial Officer to talk about how the company did during the quarter. Mark? Mark Hawkins : Thank you very much, Marc. As you\u2019ve heard, we delivered strong third quarter results as we continue to execute at scale. Third quarter revenue was 26% in dollars and in constant currency, despite experiencing a year-over-year FX headwind to revenue of $15 million and a sequential FX headwind to revenue of $19 million. And MuleSoft contributed $128 million to total revenue net of purchase accounting adjustments. Looking at the year-over-year subscription and support revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 11%, Service Cloud grew 24%, Platform and Other grew 51%, including approximately $105 million in MuleSoft, and Marketing and Commerce grew 37%. Our attrition exited the quarter below 10%. Operating cash flow was $143 million, up 14% over last year. Third quarter OCF included our first bond coupon payment of approximately $44 million on the MuleSoft acquisition debt. Unearned revenue ended the quarter at nearly $5.4 billion, up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency with MuleSoft contributing approximately $103 million. Unearned revenue was impacted by year-over-year FX headwind of $34 million and a sequential headwind of $39 million in the third quarter. We've already said that unearned revenue can be lumpy due to invoice timing or renewal timing, duration changes, et cetera. And we saw that in the third quarter, where unearned revenue came in a bit better than our guidance, just had the effect of reducing the quarter-on-quarter sequential decline in unearned revenue from Q2 to Q3 we have historically seen. This also has an impact on the sequential change from Q3 to Q4, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Total remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenues under contract, ended Q3 at $21.2 billion, up 34% over last year. MuleSoft contributed approximately $300 million to the balance in the quarter, the current portion of the remaining performance obligation, business that\u2019s both billed and unbilled expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was $10 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Moving on to guidance, we came off a strong third quarter results. We are now once again raising our full fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance to $13.23 billion to $13.24 billion or 26% year-over-year growth. This guidance includes approximately $375 million from MuleSoft. We expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin improvements of approximately 50 basis points at the high-end of our prior guidance range, even while the demand environment gives us the confidence to continue investing in MuleSoft and other growth initiatives. We are raising our FY19 GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1.06 to $1.07, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $2.60 to $2.61. And keep in mind, this guidance does not take into account the possible future impact related to ASU 2016-01. We are maintaining our full year fiscal 2019 operating cash flow growth guidance of 15% to 16% year-over-year. And as we discussed previously, this guidance includes a headwind of approximately $150 million related to our acquisition of MuleSoft. For Q4, we\u2019re expecting revenue of $3.551 billion to $3.561 million; GAAP diluted EPS of $0.89; and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.54 to $0.55. Turning to unearned revenue. We expect fourth quarter year-over-year unearned revenue growth of approximately 17%. This implies a sequential growth rate of approximately 52%. And let me take a moment to provide some additional context to this UR guidance. First, the FX environment has changed significantly over last year. And we now anticipate a year-over-year FX headwind to UR of approximately $200 million in Q4 versus an FX tailwind of approximately $130 million in Q4 of last year for $330 million FX swing year-over-year. Now, that represents about 5 percentage points of growth. Secondly, as you may recall, in Q4 of last year, we had an extremely strong renewal quarter, including some of the largest renewals in history. This drove outsized growth in our billed and unbilled deferred revenue in Q4 of last year. And thirdly and finally, as we discussed at the most recent Investor Day, the timing of invoices and renewals can impact the UR balance in any given quarter. Third quarter UR came in ahead of our guidance. And as a result of this dynamic, which has a direct impact on UR balance of successive quarters, and the related sequential changes. As a reminder, this is the last quarter we\u2019ll provide unearned revenue guidance. That\u2019s said, when we report our fourth quarter results, you will have two full years of data on the current remaining performance obligation, which we think is a more complete metric because it\u2019s contract based versus invoice based. Now moving on to FY20 guidance. As you\u2019ve heard from Keith, our demand environment remains very strong. And as a result, we\u2019re initiating fiscal 2020 revenue guidance of $15.9 billion to $16 billion for year-over-year growth of 20% to 21%, keeping us on track to deliver our target of $21 billion to $23 billion in revenue in FY22, now only little bit more than two years away. We will provide our cash flow, EPS and Non-GAAP operating margin guidance for FY20 when we report our fourth quarter and full year results in February 2019. To close, we delivered another strong quarter of results and we have great momentum as we look to close out the year. I want to thank our employees, our customers our partners and our shareholders for your continued support. And I wish you all a wonderful holiday season. And with that let's open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Karl Keirstead : Thank you very much. Maybe a question for Keith and Marc. Keith, you did mention you've been in front of a lot of customers of late. I'm just wondering, whether the tone of those conversations have changed much in the last few months, just not so much in terms of the Salesforce projected spend; that sounds like it's very strong, but just your broader view of the economy and the macro. I don\u2019t want to force you into being an economic forecaster, but just wondering if the tone has shifted at all. And then maybe a follow-up for Mark Hawkins. Mark, given that the performance on operating cash flow through the first nine months, you only need about 5% operating cash flow growth in 4Q to hit your 16% growth target. You were obviously much higher than that last fourth quarter. I know it's hard to predict and it's based on timing in of invoice payments. But just curious if there is anything you\u2019d provide for us. Thanks so much. Keith Block : Yes. Hi, Carl; it's Keith. So, I have been on the road quite a bit actually in the quarter. So, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time on the front lines with the troops and our customers. And here is the message I'm hearing. It is all about digital transformation. I am not going to make any comment about the macro environment; from what we see, it's all good. And this is a CEO level agenda; this transformation is important. The scent [ph] I get regardless of any speculation around the economy is that this has really become a mandate. And this wave of innovation, this wave of technology that is sweeping the globe is an imperative for these CEOs to be those Chief Transformation Officers. And that's what's going on in the market, that's why you see the results with us. Marc Benioff : And let me just add to that that I think -- I said this a little bit already at Dreamforce as well, which is and I said this recently on TV. When I speak to CEOs and that happens probably every single day, especially some of these tax cuts that have happened, CEOs have been investing aggressively and the economy has really been ripping. I think that a lot of the forecast that I've seen in the 4% level in the United States, we felt that before that happened and we were talking about the economy was ripping before those aggressive growth estimates. When we look out for next year, I'm not sure I can see it going faster than it is now because I'm not sure that we -- where we would get all the people to hire that we need to hire. This is amazing what's happening and not just for us but for all -- for everybody. But maybe there is a modest -- a modest production [ph] growth, if it's 2% to 3% next year of the GDP, I wouldn't be hugely surprised, but I don't see some huge sea change in the economy, I consider to see strong growth because  the strong growth because I've seen so much investment this year, it's going to pay out for these companies going forward. So, I see still several years ahead of good solid growth for the economy. And where that gets tampered, I think I've mentioned this before is when I talk to European CEOs, they tend to be more conservative. And some of those CEOs, they maybe specifically in their region are not as optimistic potentially as I would say American or Asian or CEOs based in Asia. So, that's how I still look at it that we are still in the economy right now and look at these numbers that are ripping and we still see very much a huge investment focus going on. Mark Hawkins : Yes. Let me just jump on to second part of the question, Karl, thank you for that. Yes. We are obviously pleased with our operating cash flow performance year-to-date as you've called out. We're very much tracking the fiscal year number that we have been driving toward ever since we acquired MuleSoft, which we -- as we called $150 million impact that would be negative in the first year of the acquisition, mainly due to debt expense and some lost interest income. But, when you -- the other factor to look at that besides the fact that we're absolutely tracking our fiscal year, it\u2019s Q4 is one of the biggest quarters of the year for us. And obviously, we'll know more as we get to the end of that. We feel that this is appropriate to stay with the fiscal number, especially in light of the fact that Q4 there is clearly an FX headwind if you just look at the FX rates year-on-year that's another factor to be considered. We're staying on track for the year. We'll know more at the end of the quarter. But given the FX headwind, I think this is totally appropriate. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Phil Winslow : Thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. I just really want to focus on the concept of front office suite. Obviously, you guys have talked about that for several years now and we're obviously believers. If you think about this year, we've seen probably north of $15 billion of M&A from some of your competitors trying to build out the different pillars of a suite. What are you hearing from your customers in terms of the competitive landscape, especially sort of post this M&A and even beyond the M&A some of the data sharing initiatives out there between frenemies, what are you hearing from customers, how do you think about how the landscape changed? Marc Benioff : Well, I think that we should ask our President of Products, Bret Taylor to share kind of his vision of where we're going with our Customer Success Platform. Bret Taylor : Yes. I think our strategy as it relates to competition is really reflected in our Dreamforce announcements, particularly Customer 360. When you talk to our customers, they're not looking to buy a piece of technology looking to transform their business. Our strategic advantage is that we\u2019re the number one in sales, the number one in service, the number one in platform, and the number one in marketing. As you look at Black Friday, I think you can really see where our customers are using every single one of those technologies to transform their customer experience. You might send out a promotion for your Black Friday sales, via a text message or via email in our marketing product. You transact in our Commerce Cloud, you provide service via our Service Cloud. We're the only company that can provide all the solutions in a integrated way. And now with Customer 360, you have a single view of your customer through all the touch points. And so, our strategic advantage relative to competitors trying to catch up by acquiring the second place product in each of the spaces is that we are an integrated solution. And keep an eye and I have talked a lot about this. Our customers are looking for an integrated solution to their business problems, not just pieces of technologies and that\u2019s our strategic advantage in our product portfolio. Marc Benioff : So, Bret, you've done a great job. I mean when we look at that product portfolio, we look at you've built out with the Customer Success Platform, you've got, of course, sales; you've got service and field service; you've got marketing; you've got B2C and B2B e-commerce; you've got engagement with Heroku, which still remains on its air; you've got platform and this incredible ecosystem; you've got integration, matches with Customer 360, this work with MuleSoft; you've got advanced analytics, the word in industries; you saw what Financial Services Cloud did this quarter, got partners and communities enablement collaboration, and on top of all of that you have that whole trailblazer community. I don't think there's any company that has built out a comprehensive Customer Success Platform like that. Now, when you've got to Dreamforce and saw it tied together with Customer 360, what was your biggest surprise? Bret Taylor : My biggest takeaway was the importance of Trailhead and that trailblazer community. In addition, when one of our customers decides to deploy our technology, we're not the only person there helping them. Our partner ecosystem is there with them. And then partner ecosystem is fueled by trailhead. One of the things that you mentioned Marc in your opening, I think it\u2019s really powerful, there's over 1 million people learning for free on Trailhead and one in four have gotten a new job on the other side of that, because they're developing new skills. And ways to think about it from our customers\u2019 perspective and the thing you see in the Dreamforce is, when someone use -- decides to deploy Salesforce, they have the best ecosystem of support of partners around them. That's really what\u2019s driving the success of our customers with the technology which is the thing that we are exclusively focused on. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks. Keith, one of the things that we commonly heard at Dreamforce is that partners are finding it harder to hire and build up Salesforce, certified resources to meet the demand, which is I guess, especially saying that demand is outstripping supply from a consulting and implementation standpoint. Do you hear this as a trend in the field from your partners? And do you ever see it weighing on pipeline conversion cycles? And then, you were just talking about Trailhead. I know it\u2019s been in the market for a little bit. How effective do you view Trailhead in helping to virally cultivate resources? And can it help maybe populate talent in a quicker fashion that you\u2019ve historically seen? Keith Block : Thanks for the question. So, as you know, the relationship that we have with our partners is very strategic to our business. You've heard me talk about in the call that they're involved in about 64% of our go-to-market efforts. And the certifications, 19 consecutive quarters of double-digit certification growth. I mean, there -- you have got talk to any of these firms, whether it's PwC or Deloitte or Accenture or IBM, and ask them what their fastest growing practices and scale Salesforce. And this is great news for our customers, because we wake up every day, as you know as a Company and we think about what's important for our customers. And the partner ecosystem is certainly a big part of that. We are very, very focused on our partners, and we have plans with them to not only increase their capacity, but also to enhance their capabilities. And the centerpiece for that is Trailhead. And offering and extending Trailhead for them to make sure that they get the right skills at the right time so that they can convert and cannibalize their practices from their legacy providers. And that's been a part of their strategy. We also encourage the growth of boutiques but it\u2019s not just the enterprise based business; it's also in the mid market and the SMB. And we invest as part of our funds with Salesforce ventures to provide startup the opportunity to build and cultivate these practices to help with the SMB. So we\u2019ve got a pretty comprehensive strategy to build out these SMB, SMB boutique consulting firms, these Accentures of the world et cetera. And in my entire career, I\u2019ve never seen a closer relationship with the SI ecosystem like the one that we have in Salesforce. We do a lot of joint planning, there is a lot of collaboration, they\u2019re very integrated and everything that we do inside the company. And again, they are a big part of our future and we\u2019re very optimistic that they will continue to expand and convert the resources they need to drive success for our customers. Marc Benioff : So, Keith, let me ask you a question. Let\u2019s say, there\u2019s entrepreneurs listening on the call today and they\u2019re hearing what you\u2019re saying. Are you saying that, if I\u2019m an entrepreneur, I want to starting a new company, starting a company providing these kind of boutique services in the Salesforce ecosystem, that\u2019s a good business opportunity and is Salesforce investing in those companies, so you\u2019re going to invest? Keith Block : That is a fantastic business opportunity. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got the consulting firms setup in Salesforce ventures around the world. Marc Benioff : And then, we\u2019ve seen so many of those boutiques get acquired by the mainstream SIs motivate to grow their practices\u2026. Keith Block : Absolutely. And the important thing for us to continue to do is to keep cultivating and growing those practices into new marketplace. Marc Benioff : I mean, you look at some of these companies that we that were strong independent companies like Google is a great example or some of the other. But, they\u2019ve been acquired now by this very largest and most important systems integrator. And so, this remains a great opportunity for everybody. Keith Block : Absolutely Marc Benioff : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Congratulations to the Salesforce team. I have a bit of a philosophical question. You\u2019re sitting on some markets, massive TAM, 145 billion. But only one of your cloud is really dominant in terms of market share and it\u2019s industry which is Sales Cloud. I\u2019m curious at what point, like some of the commanding technology companies, the SGAs, that\u2019s Oracle and database market or Microsoft, the operating system market, where they\u2019ve defined the market. So, at what point are we -- how close are we to a tipping point where service, marketing, commerce, platform all these markets start to tip in your way that it\u2019s not really so much of outbound -- of course, there\u2019s always going to be outbound selling motion. But the market really starts to come to you, you start to get these dominant shares and the other markets, so you can start to realize you TAM 144 billion TYAM in a more significant way. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you and happy holidays in advance. Marc Benioff : Kash, I think you normally see this in the growth rate that we\u2019re reporting on all the clouds. So, this is not anything that we\u2019re trying to keep from you. You can see in the numbers that we are --it\u2019s an abundance of riches in Salesforce. And yes, we have a great product for Sales Cloud, it\u2019s doing just fine, but we also have a phenomenal service business, field service business and service add-on business that\u2019s also growing extremely well. We also have an amazing marketing cloud business, that\u2019s growing extremely well and an commerce. And I\u2019ve mentioned Heroku, it doesn\u2019t get reported, but it\u2019s part of our platform obviously, very important part of our platform integrated, which is also great business. And now, we have an integration business which is also -- it\u2019s an unbelievable business. And we have an analytics cloud that\u2019s an unbelievable business. And we have industries that Keith has cooked up with financial services and health cloud, which is also an unbelievable business. And by the way, we acquired Bret Taylor\u2019s company Quip, which is an unbelievable business. And that just has a huge deal with Citibank for the quarter. I mean that was awesome to see what the Citi with Quip, enabling all of their employees around the world. Congratulations to Bret and Kevin helping city work together faster in this incredible productivity environment. It's a product I use every day. If you haven\u2019t downloaded, it's worth, it\u2019s what Amazon uses, it's what Apple uses, the Citibank uses to manage their productivity and you saw it at Dreamforce we announce Quip Slides which is incredible. But it\u2019s abundance of riches. And key organizing principle though for us is customer. So, yes, we're in all these areas, but there is other companies in service and there is other companies in marketing, there is other companies in a lot of these areas but our organizing principle is that we're here to tie it all together to give you 360 view of your customer and that's what unique for Salesforce. Every company has organizing principle has its own organizing principle as you know, because you cover all these companies. And you know what ours is and you know what our answer is going to be that everything begins and ends with customer. Bret, do you want to add to that? Bret Taylor : Yes. I think Marc put it exactly right. And the backdrop that I\u2019m really excited about and the reason why I think you see a such amazing growth and Service Cloud for our marketing cloud and continued growth in our Sales Cloud is. , these product aren\u2019t staying still. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming each of these markets. Take Service Cloud, which is just an amazing product with amazing growth rate. Right now, artificial intelligence is completely transforming our industry and it's driving every CEO to Salesforce to say hey, how can you help me transform my customer service experience, which is really the tip of the spear that relates to customer experience. And that's why Service Cloud is growing 24% year-over-year, one of our largest and fastest growing businesses. We assume that's in every single cloud. So, as a technologist here, what's exciting for me is not just really TAM but also just seeing the motion of change in each of these businesses and how we can help our customers navigate these technology changes happening around them. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Pat Walravens : Great. Thank you. And let me add my congratulations. So, MuleSoft is clearly proving to been a great decision for you. What sorts of things might make sense for Salesforce to buy next? And then, Marc, I'd love to hear your thoughts if it fits in there on SAP's acquisition of Qualtrics. Marc Benioff : Well, I can just tell you that there is a lot of things that Salesforce can do, because customer opportunity is much bigger and more exciting I think than anybody really ever realized. But for MuleSoft, it\u2019s the company that I loved for years, it's the company that I helped lead our early investing in and then helped go public and so forth. And while I wanted to buy them for years, unfortunately I have a very strong and sovereign management team that's sitting around the table and they're not that easy to deal with. And they make it hard for me to do what I want to do, but I did get that one over the line. So thanks a lot for that. But, there is a lot of others that I love to see that I think that our customers would love to have more tightly integrated, more part of our product, really important. And what other companies -- I don't know if you\u2019ve seen the front of the Wall Street Journal lately, but with sort of market share graph, CRM on the cover of the Wall Street Journal, have you seen it? I think we also put it in our slide deck here for you, hopefully we did. Because it's our number one marketing graphic. And not everyone is doing as well as we are in CRM. So, not everyone is doing as well as we are in cloud. And you know that. So, every year, I've got some new thing, whatever and I can't follow them all because they're also difficult and they buy companies I've never heard of. So, I can't really comment on them. But, God bless them. And I hope that they're successful in CRM because it's good for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Let me add my congratulations for the quarter. I want to ask the question about verticals maybe for Keith, you talked about the amazing success in financial services. The big deal with the financial institution with the success being driven by Financial Service Cloud, which we also picked up in our field work. I guess, I wanted to understand could you talk about what is the incremental kind of value prop and features that are available to customers that go from generic Service Cloud to Financial Service Cloud and any commentary on the financial uplift that Salesforce sees through those migrations would be appreciated. Keith Block : Hi, Alex. I'm happy to do a feature function conversation with you if you like. But here's the way I\u2019d think of our Financial Services Cloud. So, first in the beginning of time there was the Service Cloud. Right. And then, on the seventh day, God created something else and said it was Financial Services Cloud and then Financial Services Cloud started on a wealth management and then it went from wealth management to retail banking, then it went to consumer banking and then it would go to commercial banking, and the list will go on and on. By the way, Financial Services Cloud has made great integration points with partners like Guardwire and Velocity as well. So, those are compelling solutions for our customers. At the end of the day, this is a capability that customers want to buy off the shelf software. They don't want to be customizing and building their own capabilities, because in a sense, it\u2019s just repainting [indiscernible] you're just doing in tech refresh but really you're not retiring your legacy debt. And that's why customers want these capabilities embedded in our technology and that's exactly what we're doing. We're responding to our customers in these industries by providing very rich functionality that is specific to what those customers are looking for. And that's been the strategy. Now, we can do that two ways. One is that we can enhance our product so that these customers get the commercially available off the shelf software or we can go partner with an ISV, like an [indiscernible]. So that has been our strategy. You can see the results. If you think about the pace of Financial Services Cloud, arguably it's the most successful cloud that we've ever launched. It has established very deep and meaningful relationships with our customers. The roster of financial services companies that we're doing business with now, they all want Financial Services Cloud and we just continue to win and win and win, and that's faith. So, it's very, very exciting for us. Marc Benioff : And for the previous question where there was a question about how we're doing with our competitors, I put on my Twitter feed for you the market share information. So, you just get that directly. Keith Block : I do want to make a comment about the competitors because listening to Marc and Bret talk about this, just a lot of these companies have been in the business for a very, very long time. They've been in the legacy business. They have not been in the cloud business. They claim that they could be cloud companies because maybe they have an architecture that\u2019s suggested for the cloud but it's not just about the architecture, it's also about the business model. Most importantly, it's about the culture of the company and the focus on customer. And since the day this Company was started, everything that we do is focus on the customer. If you look at some of these legacy companies that are trying to get in the game in the front office and say that they're now CRM companies, it's not in their DNA. So, as Marc said, we wish them luck. And, we'll see you in the marketplace. But please don't underestimate the importance of having the customer is part of the culture. Marc Benioff : And I have really had to start to curtail my comments. And I'd love to talk about specific companies and other CEOs, every time I do, I get a phone call, they\u2019re very sensitive. And I don't want to heart anybody\u2019s feeling during the holidays. So, I'm really holding back on the call. So, I'm just going to do that once at least. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel. Your line is now open. Tom Roderick : Hey, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. So, question for Marc Benioff. Marc, you're constantly in touch with global tech leaders, partners. And going back to Dreamforce, you certainly had some nice updates relative to Google as a partner, some of the things you're working on there. They of course had some changes at the leadership at the top. I'd love to hear a little bit more if you could talk about how that partnership has progressed? And now that they are sort of going through some new leadership changes at the top, what sort of opportunities exist to further extend that partnership? AWS has been fantastic. This one has a nice so start off the ground with the analytic side where can you take it from here? Marc Benioff : Well, you just mentioned two great companies, Amazon and Google. They both have phenomenal cloud offerings, they both have very strong CEOs. Jeff is amazing and also Sundar is amazing. And they're both doing extremely well in our customer base. We see lots of action with both of those customers and partners. And specific to Google, I mean Bret obviously is the creator of Google Maps and worked at Google for while. So, So, I don\u2019t know if you want to touch, how do you -- unique perspective and all of those. Bret Taylor : Yes. I just had such a great privilege to have such amazing partners. And we really worked at customer success and what our customers need to be successful. And I look at Amazon Web Services, Apple, Google, we\u2019re really saying who are companies that our customers want to partner with, and who do they want us to partner with, to drive success. And when I look at Google, every single one of our marketing cloud customers, Commerce Cloud customers has a deep relationship with Google, because of the providence of Google Search, their ad network marketing analytics. And so, I really view this is an amazing opportunity to bring the best of both companies to bear when we're trying to provide the solutions to our customers. And our customer response has just been fantastic. And we -- I hope to deepen that relationship in the future and just make sure that when we provide these to our customers, the products work together across, the companies work together and our customers have an amazing experience. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is now open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. As you start to talk with CEOs and senior decision makers about these big strategic digital transformation projects, and you mentioned many of them are multiyear in scope, it strikes me that these touch a lot of systems, a lot of processes, and it's a challenge to sort of figure out what comes first. But, as you sort of start through that prioritization process, how often are you going in and creating a new application that didn't exist before, versus replacing legacy off the shelf software versus custom app development or replacing legacy custom applications? And how has that evolved as you increased your strategic value to those customers? Keith Block : Hi. This is Keith. So, that's a great question. The way I would think about this is that the whole environment is just right for innovation, okay. The innovation could be something that's custom developed with our technology or it could be something that's just using our standard product. Obviously, customers like to take advantage of flexibility that our products provide. And they want to model their processes aligned to our technology, rather than building custom apps themselves, comma. The power of the technology is such n nowadays that you can do amazing things that you couldn\u2019t have done before. So, it\u2019s kind of hard to give you an apples-to-apples comparison, but it\u2019s really an interesting phenomenon, because the wave of innovation is just so impressive in what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. And that innovation is supported by our platform, it\u2019s supported by our Service Cloud or host and Customer Success Platform. So, it\u2019s hard to give you the exact number. But, it\u2019s all about innovation and creating. Marc Benioff : All right. Well, as we bring our call to a close, I want to thank everybody for participating on today\u2019s call. As I opened the call, I also mentioned our hearts remain everyone, who suffered during the horrible fires. And I\u2019d like to bring your attention to our local organization who is doing so much and has done so much support already, which is our North Valley Community Foundation, which is providing tremendous support for the campfire relief. And if you could support them, we would appreciate it. It\u2019s nvcf.org as Nanacy, Victor, Charlie, Frank.org, North Valley Community Foundation and our hearts or looking entire community of Paradise and the surrounding areas affected by the campfire. We love for you to please consider a tax deductible donation to the campfire relief fund. And to assist to the many community organizations who are serving evacuees, and especially our tremendous first responders. So, thank you, everybody, and we look forward to talking again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This will conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to John Cummings, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us for our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2019 results conference call. Our results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today\u2019s call can be found on our IR website at salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and Co-CEO; Keith Block, Co-CEO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; and Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. So, with that, let me turn the call to you, Marc. Marc Benioff : Thank you, John, and thank you everybody for being on the call today. As you can see from our results, Q4 capped off another record year for Salesforce. Revenue in the quarter rose to more than $3.6 billion, up 27% in constant currency, truly amazing for a company of our size. And for the full year, we delivered more than $13.2 billion in revenue, making Salesforce the fastest enterprise software company ever to reach $13 billion. Based on our outstanding fiscal year \u201819 results, we are raising our fiscal year \u201820 revenue guidance to $16.05 billion at the high-end of the range, representing 21% projected growth year-over-year. And we expect this incredible growth to continue which is why we are now initiating a revenue target for fiscal year \u201823 of $26 billion to $28 billion organically doubling our revenue again in the next 4 years. I have never been more excited about the opportunity ahead for Salesforce. Around the world, more and more companies are investing in their digital transformations which start and end with the customer. Earlier this year, I was at the World Economic Forum at Davos where I met with hundreds of global customers. And I have also been on the road meeting with customers across the U.S. And everywhere I go, I hear the same thing. Companies are continuing to make incredible investments in their customer experience. They know they need to invest in becoming more customer-centric, more efficient and more automated. And when they invest, they are looking to do it with companies they trust, and that\u2019s why they are looking to Salesforce. Salesforce is not only the number one CRM, but we are really their most trusted enterprise software vendor. And whether they are B2B or B2C, they are now becoming a B2B to C company. They are all transforming to connect with their customers in all new better way and we are the only company with an intelligent customer success platform for both B2B and B2C companies. Salesforce is the number one CRM. And as you all know, with MuleSoft, we are now the number one integration platform. We are also a leader in sales and service and marketing and in digital commerce. And in fact, service is on its way to becoming our largest cloud. That\u2019s incredible. That is allowing us to deliver a level of digital transformation never before possible. It\u2019s redefined the CRM experience for so many of our customers. And over the last 20 years, no other company has been more focused on customer relationships. We have not only remained totally focused on CRM. We have constantly redefined and expanded what CRM means. CRM is the largest and fastest growing market of enterprise software today, bigger than operating systems, ERPs and databases and we continue to take share and outpace this market. According to Edge IDC, Salesforce commands 20% of the overall CRM market, more than the next three competitors combined. With Dreamforce, we introduced the Salesforce intelligent Customer 360 giving our customers a unified 360-degree view of their customers across every touchpoint in sales, service, marketing, commerce, communities and more. And we have a tremendous vision for the next decade with our intelligent Customer 360, a major growth engine for Salesforce moving forward. We are operating at a tremendous scale at Salesforce. Just look at some of the daily milestones our customers have helped us achieve on our intelligent Customer Success platform. Everyday, 3 million sales opportunities and 3.2 million leads created in sales cloud, everyday 9.7 million cases logged in service cloud, and everyday, 1.9 billion emails sent from marketing cloud, amazing. Everyday, 44 million reports and dashboards created in Einstein Analytics and now, everyday, more than 6 billion predictions in Salesforce Einstein on our AI. During the holiday shopping season, the Commerce Cloud processed more than 4.2 million orders and supported 690 million e-commerce page views in a single day. No other vendor provides CRM at scale and it\u2019s why Salesforce has been named one of the world\u2019s most innovative companies 8 years in a row by Forbes. Take Salesforce Lightning, we have revolutionized the Salesforce user experience with a redesigned, intelligent and intuitive new platform that is now making millions of users more productive. And Lightning makes it easy for them to build incredible innovation, customer experience, with Clicks, not Code. With Salesforce Essentials, we are now making it possible for millions of small businesses to tap into this innovation and deliver incredible customer experiences. But as we all know, every digital transformation isn\u2019t just a customer transformation, it\u2019s also an AI transformation. It\u2019s an automation transformation. This is a big shift for our customers. And the industry is undergoing it everywhere. That\u2019s why we built Salesforce Einstein AI innovation deeply into the Salesforce platform. I am thrilled with the adoption of Einstein, which as I said, is now delivering more than 6 billion predictions every day. Now, with Einstein, we are enabling our customers to interact with Salesforce as easily and as naturally as they think and as they talk. Just as Salesforce brought our customers the cloud, social, mobile and AI, we are bringing them voice as well. In fact, half of the U.S. households already have a voice activated device. It\u2019s going to become a dominant user interface. But Salesforce is no exception. We have taken these consumer voice experiences and we have brought them to our customers and make them more productive at work. Now and very, very soon, every Salesforce app that has ever been built will have Einstein available to it. The power of voice isn\u2019t just getting information it\u2019s getting information into your database and into your CRM system. It has to be fully interactive. With Einstein Voice, customers will be able to update all of their data in Salesforce with voice command. AI is critical to every customer transformation. And the automation it delivers is driving the next generation of efficiency for companies. It\u2019s also radically transformation in the nature of work. And it\u2019s why all of the CEOs I have met with are talking about rebalancing and rescaling their workforce for the future. As automation impacts the workforce, we recognize we have a responsibility to deliver our solutions to help people scale up for the jobs of tomorrow, especially for jobs in the amazing Salesforce economy that is growing around us, one that will create more than 3 million new jobs and more than 850 billion in GDP impact by 2022. That\u2019s why we created Trailhead, a personal learning cloud that empowers everyone regardless of their background, to learn and demand skills for free. We now have more than 1.2 million learners on Trailhead and are changing people\u2019s lives everyday. This week, as we celebrate another record year, we are also celebrating another great milestone, Salesforce\u2019s 20th birthday on March 8. In 1999, Parker and I could not have imagined that Salesforce would be the company it is today. What I am most proud of is the trust we have of all of our stakeholders. There is a clear connection between customer success and the company\u2019s values and that\u2019s why trust is the heart of our culture. And we have seen this as we have grown our company over the last 20 years, focused on our culture as a key part of who we are as an organization, because we realize exactly as Drucker told us, our culture eats our strategy for breakfast. People are drawn to Salesforce, yes, because we are focused on customer success, but it\u2019s also because of our culture. Companies are excited to do business with us. They trust us to deliver the innovation they need to succeed in this fourth industrial revolution. In fact, Ethisphere just named Salesforce one of the most ethical companies again. Well, all of this is so exciting as we turn 20. Now, together, we build trust with our communities through the impact we have made. And over the past 20 years, together with our foundation and Salesforce.org, we have now given out $260 million in grants, 40,000 non-profits and NGOs use our software for free. And our employees have volunteered nearly 4 million hours in their local communities. I could not be more proud of them. And as Parker and I reflect back on the last 20 years, there is one word that comes to mind, that\u2019s gratitude. To close, I want to thank all of our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, our investors, our analysts and all of our trailblazers and communities around the world, who joined us in this amazing journey over the last 20 years. I am so deeply grateful and I hope you all celebrate with us on March 8. Now, let me turn over to our Co-CEO, Keith Block. Keith? Keith Block : Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everybody. As Marc said, we delivered outstanding results. As we continue to take share and lead the market Salesforce pioneered 20 years ago. It\u2019s been an incredible journey to $13 billion in revenue and our relentless focus on delivering innovation and customer success has fueled our growth and solidified our leadership in the market. We continue to grow internationally, expand across industries, and leverage our partner ecosystem as we drive toward our new revenue target of $26 billion to $28 billion in FY \u201823. Salesforce has redefined the customer experience. We have become mission-critical to companies of every size and industry and we are deepening our relationships strategically all over the world. In fact, our $20 million plus relationships grew 48% compared to last year. This includes two 9-figure renewal expansions in the quarter. Our enterprise class relationships absolutely reflect the unprecedented mindshare and trust we have with CEOs. Take Barclays as an example. At the World Economic Forum in January, their CEO, Jes Staley proudly said that with Salesforce, they have just signed the largest technology agreement in their 300-year history. We are very, very proud to be Barclays\u2019 trusted partner in digital transformation as they deliver faster, more convenient services to their 48 million customers. I remember when our goal was to have the top 10 banks running their business on Salesforce. Then the goal was the top 20 banks. Well now, we do business with nearly every financial institution in the Fortune 500. We also significantly deepened our relationship with one of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications companies. They are leveraging Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Einstein and MuleSoft to personalize in-store and online engagement for more than 100 million subscribers. And we are thrilled that today, 96% of the media and communications companies from the Fortune 500 are our customers. And this is just the beginning. I recently spoke with the head of one of the largest consulting firms who said that roughly 85% of their top 50 customers are just getting started on their digital transformations. So clearly, that\u2019s an indication that we have tremendous runway ahead of us. And this opportunity is global. In Q4, we strengthened our relationships with some of the leading companies around the world from expanding with Toyota, National Australia Bank in Telstra and in Japan and Australia to form a brand new relationship, also in Germany with BASF, the world\u2019s largest chemical maker. These global strategic relationships are driving our year-over-year revenue growth 26% in the Americas, 26% in APAC and 31% in EMEA in constant currency. We continue this momentum and better serve our multinational customers. 42% of our new hires in the fourth quarter were in regions outside of the Americas. Our thriving partner ecosystem is fueling our growth worldwide and making our customers more successful. In Q4, the total number of global partner certifications increased 41% year-over-year. And in FY \u201819, net new partners grew 79% in APAC and 110% in EMEA compared to last year. In fact, I have met with the leaders of our top 5 consulting partners in the last month. And they have all said they are doubling their Salesforce practices over the next few years. So, not only are our partners investing more in their Salesforce practices, they are also running their business on us. Three of our top SIs expanded their relationship with Salesforce in Q4. We also significantly expanded our relationship with Google. We are excited to support their increased adoption to deliver more connected customer, employee and partner experiences at scale. And we are thrilled with the innovation we are delivering to make our customers more productive, including the integrations between the Salesforce platform and Google Cloud. Also in Q4, we became a reseller of Google Analytics 360, enabling marketers to act on insights and drive smarter engagements with our integrated solutions. Google Analytics remains the number one analytics solutions with our customers which we are very, very excited about. Vertical solutions, Health Cloud, and Financial Services Cloud, they continue to deepen our relationships across industries. Now, earlier I had mentioned Barclays and financial services, but with Health Cloud, in Q4, we had significant expansion with leading biotech company, Amgen. And they are using Salesforce across their business from improving patient outcomes to building apps for commercial applications with Heroku. Overall, we increased our business with Fortune 500 healthcare customers by 22% year-over-year. Now, we are coming up on 1 year since our acquisition of MuleSoft and we are absolutely thrilled by their outstanding performance and the value we are creating for customers like SunTrust, State of Colorado and Unilever. And to keep pace with increasing demand, we hired more than 450 additional MuleSoft employees in FY \u201819 and we nearly tripled the MuleSoft architects driving our customers\u2019 digital transformations. We added nearly 2,000 MuleSoft developers to that ecosystem. So, it\u2019s something we are very, very excited about. And based on my conversations with our largest SIs, they are also very excited about the growth of their MuleSoft practices. Now, core to our customer success and to our future success is our people. And recruiting and developing talent is the top priority for us as we head into FY \u201820. We are very, very proud of the strength of our culture. It\u2019s what drives our growth and innovation. It\u2019s one of the reasons companies of every size and industry want to do business with us. And that\u2019s why we are recently recognized by Fortune as the Best Company to Work For, for the 11th year in a row. Again, something we are very, very proud of. So, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees for another outstanding year. And I am looking forward to what we will accomplish together in FY \u201820. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Hawkins. Mark Hawkins : Thanks, Keith. We delivered another year of outstanding financial performance, continuing to trend strong, durable top line and operating cash flow growth. We also delivered non-GAAP operating margin expansion for the fifth consecutive year while integrating the biggest acquisition in our history. Let me discuss the highlights for Q4 in FY \u201819. Fourth quarter revenue grew 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. Our revenue had a year-over-year FX headwind of $38 million and an immaterial sequential headwind. For the full year, revenue grew 26% in both dollars and constant currency. MuleSoft continued its strong execution as part of Salesforce, contributing $181 million to total revenue in the fourth quarter. Of the $156 million of subscription and support revenue from MuleSoft, roughly 60% was licensed revenue. For the full year, MuleSoft added $431 million in total revenue net of purchase accounting adjustments. This came in far ahead of our initial guidance as we quickly executed on our plans to integrate MuleSoft and accelerate digital transformation projects for customers around the world. Let me quickly discuss MuleSoft\u2019s revenue contribution and how to think about it going forward. As you know, the fourth quarter is MuleSoft\u2019s largest quarter of the year and you can see that in the results. However, as you build your models keep in mind that due to the license component, MuleSoft revenue is a bit more seasonal than our core products and can experience sequential revenue declines from Q4 to Q1 similar to the seasonality we see with Marketing Cloud. Our portfolio of industry leading products continued to deliver strong year-over-year subscription and support revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Sales Cloud grew 11% at a run-rate of more than $4.2 billion. Service Cloud grew 22% at a run-rate of more than $3.8 billion. Platform and Other grew 54%, including approximately $156 million from MuleSoft and is now at a run-rate of more than $3.3 billion and Marketing and Commerce Cloud grew 34% crossing a $2.1 billion run-rate. Dollar attrition remained below 10% at the end of the year. Turning to margin, I am very pleased that we are able to drive continued operating leverage in the business while integrating MuleSoft and other acquisitions and investing in our growth initiatives. For the full year, we delivered 57 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement, the fifth consecutive year of improvement. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS was $0.46, coming in much higher than our expectation. EPS benefited in large part from approximately $0.17 related to the net benefit of tax adjustments and $0.12 related to the mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investments as required by ASU 2016-01 as well as the outperformance in the quarter. Turning to cash flow, we had a very strong cash collection in the fourth quarter driving operating cash flow of $1.33 billion, up 27% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered $3.4 billion of operating cash flow, up 24% over last year, an outstanding result that I am very pleased with, especially considering the impact from the MuleSoft acquisition cost. This translated to an operating cash flow yield of 25.6%. And with these strong collections, we chose to payback our $500 million term loan about 6 months early, saving on future interest expense. CapEx for the year was $595 million, approximately 4.5% of revenue, down from 5.1% of revenue last year. For FY \u201820, we anticipate CapEx to be approximately 12% of revenue. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $1.16 billion in Q4, up 27% over last year. And for the full year, free cash flow grew 27% year-over-year to $2.8 billion. Unearned revenue this year ended at $8.5 billion, up 22% in dollars and 24% in constant currency, excluding an FX headwind of $104 million. On a sequential basis, unearned revenue had an FX tailwind of $42 million. Remaining performance obligation representing all future revenues under contract ended Q4 at $25.7 billion, up 25% over last year, including $450 million from MuleSoft. Currently, RPO a business that is both billed and unbilled and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was $11.9 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Moving on to guidance, we are raising our FY \u201820 revenue guidance by $50 million to $15.95 billion to $16.05 billion for 20% to 21% growth year-over-year. With a great opportunity in front of us, we remain on track to deliver the $21 billion to $23 billion of revenue in FY \u201822. And we are establishing a new long-term organic revenue target of $26 billion to $28 billion in FY \u201823, representing growth of more than 21% year-over-year in FY \u201823 at the high-end of the range. This long-term target is consistent with the durable growth that we\u2019ve been delivering year after year. With this consistent durable growth, we expect to continue to deliver non-GAAP operating margin in FY \u201820 of 125 to 150 basis points year-over-year driven by continued improvement in operating leverage. We are adjusting our fixed long-term non-GAAP tax rate to 22.5% for FY \u201820 from 21.5% in FY \u201819. The increase is due to several factors, including changes to our forecasted geographic mix of earnings. We expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $70 million for FY \u201820. And we expect FY \u201820 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.66 to $0.68 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.74 to $2.76. Our OID and EPS guidance assumes no contribution from mark to market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. Finally, we expect FY \u201820 operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year. For Q1, we\u2019re expecting revenue of $3.67 billion to $3.68 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.10 to $0.11, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.60 to $0.61. Now, based on your feedback, we will provide the guidance for current remaining performance obligation going forward. And in that context, we expect to see RPO growth of approximately 24% year-over-year in Q1. To close, we delivered another outstanding year of financial performance, durable top-line growth, a fifth consecutive year of non-GAAP operating margin expansion, strong cash flow generation, and the integration of the biggest acquisition in our company\u2019s history. I\u2019d like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, and our shareholders for your continued support. And with that, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much and congrats on a fantastic and to a phenomenal year, guys. Your new fiscal \u201823 guidance implies you will organically double the size of the company over the next four years, add massive scale and implying you\u2019ll be able to sustain a roughly 20% compounded growth rate. What gives you both the confidence and visibility, especially as just about every macroeconomic forecast out there has some degree of economic downturn between now and then? Thanks. Mark Hawkins : Let me start, Brad. First of all, thank you. One of the things that I would say of course, you know we look at a long-range plan. It\u2019s based on the market. We happen to be, as we know, in the hottest part of enterprise software market and CRM, number one. Number two, the TAM in FY \u201822 alone is over $142 billion for all addressable market for us. Number three, our competitive position and differentiation continues to accelerate. You can see that in the market share when you add up the next three most notable competitors. And it\u2019s less than our market share which persists and continues to grow. We feel like we\u2019re in the full position with a great product offering, most importantly with our true north, the customer. I would start with that, Marc or Keith? Marc Benioff : And I think that when you couple those core aspects of our model, including that the majority of revenue is deferred, and you look at this incredible off-balance basically, the RPO, and then you look at what\u2019s happening in the market today, we see three incredible levels of focus with our customers which, number one, is the movement to the cloud. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a more exciting macrotrend in both business and technology where so many companies realized that they can get much great acuity and speed in their business by moving to cloud-based systems. Number two Digital transformation, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a company that I\u2019ve met with of size and scale that isn\u2019t going through a dramatic digital transformation. And each one of those transformations begins and ends with the customer, just as I said. And it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re a B2B company or a B2C company they are all becoming B2B to C companies. And it\u2019s requiring them to fundamentally transform their entire approach to what I would say is the third major trend, the customer. Those three things together, the cloud, digital transformation, and the customer become three dramatic trends that are moving all of our customers forward and have really taken the CRM market and made it the most important market in enterprise software. Last week, I was on the road all week in the United States. And I had the opportunity on Thursday and Friday to meet with hundreds of the largest companies in the world and their CEOs and I continue to see incredible optimism for the year and for the economy. Those CEOs are all talking about growth in investment. And they don\u2019t have what I would call economic anxiety, certainly not in the United States. When I was in the World Economic Forum in Europe, while I also saw a lot of confidence, European CEOs definitely have more anxiety. Yet, they are also continuing to invest aggressively. The reason why they\u2019re investing so dramatically in these areas is this is critical for their future growth. IT is not an optional area of investment for them. It\u2019s how they\u2019re going to achieve their future results. And I\u2019ll tell you and I\u2019ll end with this. It\u2019s not just about digital transformation. It\u2019s really about digital automation. And that level of digital automation is not just AI. It\u2019s not just RPA. It\u2019s just a broad rethinking of their entire company structures and rebalancing their workforces based on a new level of automation that\u2019s available to chief executives to reevaluate how they run their businesses fundamentally. And that is something that we have really adjusted our company for. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen us make major investments in Einstein. And that has really paid out so well for our customers and has kept them really competitive, right at the very top of all digital transformations. The level of AI now in place with our customers is dramatic. And it\u2019s given them the ability to create new levels of efficiency in their organization as well as they\u2019ve seen dramatic increases in their revenues because of it. And I think as all of these trends continue to play out over the next 48 months, you\u2019re going to see us have this dramatic increase in our revenue that we\u2019re forecasting today. And by the way, of course, that\u2019s a midterm forecast in terms of the growth of our business. In the very short-term, I\u2019m excited that not only are we going to do more than $16 billion this year, but you can see we\u2019re rapidly approaching the $20 billion revenue mark for Salesforce. That is absolutely amazing. Keith Block : I would just add one more comment to that. Marc is absolutely spot-on with respect to the digital transformation. I think if you take a look at the way companies have budgeted their IT spend with a balance of innovation versus maintenance just a few short years ago, for example, in the financial services industry, you would see that 90% of the IT spend was focused on maintenance. And now what you see in financial services is a drive toward more of a 50-50 spend between maintenance and innovation. So, this level of digital transformation is an imperative. And I\u2019ll go back to my opening comments as well. When we have one of our leading partners, one of the best firms in the world talking about how 85% of their top customers are just beginning to think about and strategize and embark on digital transformation that just gives us a lot of runway and confidence. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Questions for Mark Hawkins, [indiscernible] we have gotten pretty accustomed to doing the analysis around billings. And I know in the past, you\u2019ve even said you don\u2019t manage the business for billings. But focusing us on RPO, could you help us understand some of the factors that drive volatility in that number? And as we calculate it, we\u2019re looking at maybe bookings growth calculated off RPO that would imply growth below what revenue grew in both Q3 and Q4. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with understanding the drivers [indiscernible]. Thanks. Mark Hawkins : Walter, thank you. Certainly, glad to talk about RPO. And again, everyone, and when we think about Dreamforce presentation, I want to put that out as a reference for folks too. But the way to look at that, obviously, is we have all - that\u2019s all the revenue under contract both for the current RPO which is the next 12 months that will show up and also beyond the next 12 months which is the long-term RPO, all making up the RPO. The factors that can impact that for sure are the timing of renewals. The attrition can affect that. There\u2019s a number of different things can affect that consistent with our Dreamforce presentation that we talked about. And one of the things when you look at RPO for this particular period, again, as we called out last year in Q4 \u201818, we had a that\u2019s when we were in pre-606 where we had billed and unbilled figure which is not perfectly comparable as we know with the transition, but we had 8 of the biggest 10 renewals in the history of the company. And we called that out distinctly. The other thing that could impact things, at least on the long-term RPO, is the weighted average term length as well. That\u2019s why we like to focus the most on the current RPO which is the next 12 months that\u2019s coming. These would be some of the factors. The thing that we look at is once you get over a really unusual compare, which we called out last year both in Q4 of last year and at Dreamforce for Q4 of last year, you quickly see a normalization when you come back to Q4 of this year. And we think the 25% growth rate with $25.7 billion of RPO is a strong number and very consistent with the durable growth that we are delivering going forward. So, Walter, those are a few of the things that I would look at. Obviously, there\u2019s some FX headwind even in Q4 even on top of that. But the 25% with a $25.7 billion RPO is a number we\u2019re glad to see. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask either Mark or Keith about Einstein. You mentioned that the uptake rates have been very strong in usage. I wanted to see if you could speak on monetization. Our conversations with customers, including our own bank, are that interest level is very high but, in fact, Salesforce is pricing incrementally that makes it harder to purchase it. And I just wanted to see how are you thinking about monetization. If you could speak more directly about uptake rates associated with payment on Einstein, thanks very much. Mark Hawkins : Alright, great. I\u2019d love to address that. And I think I\u2019ll ask Bret to take that on and to give us his response. He\u2019s listening to us from Australia. Bret? Bret Taylor : Yes. It\u2019s a great question. First and foremost, our strategy with Einstein is to improve the value that our customers are getting from our products. And I\u2019m going to give you a very concrete example of this. One of the major retailers I just spent time with a couple weeks ago, over 60% of their customer service cadences are now completely automated thanks to Einstein. They\u2019re doing that with actually improved customer satisfaction scores. So, it means that they can actually use their agents in more productive and for more complex. So, when we talk about Einstein, their satisfaction is through the roof because they\u2019ve been able to take their human capital and spend it in more valuable ways for their customers. Similarly, as I think you\u2019re aware, with products like the Einstein capabilities built into our Commerce Cloud, the value we get and the value our customers get are very aligned because our Einstein capabilities are choosing how to rank product listings and suggest products in a way that improves and increases the gross merchandising value from the retailers which improves the revenue that we get from those customers and improves the quality of our customers\u2019 business by enabling them to sell more. So, across our clouds, we\u2019re trying to align our Einstein capabilities with our customer value and make sure that our pricing is aligned with our customer value because fundamentally, as our relationship with our customer evolves from that of a vendor to that of a strategic partner, we want to make sure our monetization is aligned with our customer\u2019s value. And that\u2019s the strategy that we\u2019re taking. It will vary across our B2B and B2C products. We just want to make sure our packaging and pricing of our intelligence is aligned with the value that our customers get from the products. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And very nice quarter. I think it\u2019s pretty remarkable we\u2019re seeing Service Cloud sustaining its 20%-plus growth into the end of FY \u201819. And like you said, it\u2019s well-positioned to become the biggest cloud into FY \u201820. Can you talk to us a little bit about the drivers of that scale it\u2019s almost twice the growth of what you\u2019re seeing in Sales Cloud and to what extent the vertical solutions that you guys have in the market are driving service cloud more so than a Sales Cloud or the like? Marc Benioff : Well, hi, Keith. So, look. I\u2019ve long said that especially in this fourth industrial revolution, as our customers think about digital transformations, really, the way that they differentiate themselves and take share is providing the world-class experience to their customers. And that starts with service. So, this is really the heartbeat of a lot of digital transformation. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing such great results with our service cloud. And that\u2019s why we continue to take share in service cloud. The other area that obviously is dragging that is that when we in a positive way, when we go to market, we go to market by industry solution. And so, customers don\u2019t really think about buying point solutions or point products. We\u2019re talking about a solution for their enterprise that will drive a different set of experiences for their customers. And when you think about Financial Services Cloud and Health Cloud and also some of the partnerships we have with other companies like Velocity, those also drag and put at the front and center of any of these transformation service clouds. So, we\u2019ve got a very, very good strategy around our industry solutions. And Service Cloud is really the heartbeat of digital transformation. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Mark Murphy : Yes, thank you. And I will add my congrats. So, when we see this abnormal growth and scale, what crosses my mind is that your competitors are trying to sell software tools to the IT department. And in contrast, you\u2019re really selling transformations at the top levels of the org chart. I don\u2019t think any other software company has ever had this kind of vision of transformation selling. So, I\u2019m curious where are you in that journey of building that muscle across your sales teams. And is that something that\u2019s helping you convert these nine-figure relationships? Keith Block : So, again, we are in a very enviable position. And there\u2019s been a lot of work on this over time to really change the game in terms of our strategic relationships. And that\u2019s why we do have these trusted advisor type of relationships with CEOs. And it\u2019s very interesting because they\u2019re CEOs from basically every industry and every geography. And they want to talk to us about transformation. We spoke earlier about the Barclays deal. And you\u2019ve heard me talk about this on earlier calls, how CEOs like Jes Staley have brought their entire executive team out to speak with us. I was on the phone with a CEO in Australia last week who is going to bring his entire executive team all the way from Sydney to talk to us about digital transformation. So, we put ourselves in this enviable position because we\u2019re driving transformation. We\u2019re driving value. And they trust us. Obviously, trust is our number one value as well as far as our company goes. So, there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into this. It\u2019s a lot of building muscle and capability and process and methodology. But at the end of the day, a lot of this is our customers trust us. And we have great products and solutions and incredible innovation. Again, it\u2019s one of our core values. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these great relationships that we enjoy with other CEOs. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Can I stay on that subject, Keith? If you think about, for example, the deal that Barclays is closing versus if you look at some of our customers, you are the guys who\u2019re driving the additional transformation around customers. But there\u2019s no other vendor that is anywhere close to your market reach and scope. So, where are we on the journey then for the other guys because to me that sounds like a massive opportunity. Can you talk to that? Thank you. Keith Block : So, thank you for the question. Look, I think this is early days. We\u2019ve talked about the Fourth Industrial Revolution for a couple of years. And I still think we\u2019re trying to get our arms around that as an industry and as a society, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of implications across the board. Marc talked about rescaling the workforce and rebalancing workforces. There\u2019s a lot that goes into this, a lot of things that, again, we\u2019re just trying to understand in the beginning. But as far as these transformations go, when you have one of the largest consulting firms in the world say that 85% of their largest customers are just beginning this, and that\u2019s anywhere from having the dialog to planning these transformations. There is a lot of room for us to run, and we are in a unique position. There is no other company like us that has these sort of trusted relationships and earns the trust of these senior executives on a daily basis. And again, I go back to our culture. I go back to the caliber and quality of our solutions. I go back to the levels of talent that we have in the company. And all of these things have come together to put us in this market-leading position and we have really a very bright future. Mark Hawkins : I\u2019ll just also add to that \u2013 I\u2019ll add to that, that I think that one of the really strong parts of what\u2019s happening in the market today is when you are talking to these CEOs, they are all prioritizing digital transformation as one of the most important things they\u2019re doing. At the same time, the line of business buyers are still out there buying sales, service, marketing, and these other capabilities. It\u2019s an incredible pairing of opportunity for us, and it\u2019s really kind of a nod, which I\u2019m about to give to some of these next-generation products like we\u2019ve mentioned in the call like Einstein and Service Cloud, Sales Cloud and MuleSoft, all of these things together building this intelligent Customer 360. And Bret, you\u2019re in Sydney and you\u2019re \u2013 you have \u2013 you\u2019re sold out, you have over 11,000 people registered to attend your event tomorrow at the ICC Exhibition Hall. Can you give us some insights into what kind of messages and what you\u2019re preparing to say there? Bret Taylor : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s perfect timing to be here in Sydney. I actually just got off of a Product Roadmap Tour, where I visited 8 cities and 200 customers and shared our roadmap and talked to them about how they\u2019re applying our technologies. And it\u2019s exactly what you said, which is we have some customers who are just starting on this digital transformation journey who are really looking to us as a strategic consultant. One great example here in Sydney is a mattress company that was a traditional B2B seller. And because of a number of direct-to-consumer digital-first company, they\u2019re looking to us to help them become a B2C company. And what\u2019s really unique about that I think really represents the opportunity that you spoke about is, we\u2019ve had a multi-year almost decade-long relationship with this company with our traditional B2B products like Sales Cloud. And now they come to us and say, build on that trust that they have built with us and say, help us transform not just our technology, but transform our business model. And that\u2019s the kind of relationship that I think Keith is talking about where we have this privilege of having earned the trust over many years with these companies. And they\u2019re coming to us with problems that I know kind of geek in the room can look like a technology problem, but to the CEO, it\u2019s a business problem. And I think that gives us the types of relationships that we\u2019re talking about. And as I think Marc said very eloquently in the introduction, the fact that we\u2019re both B2B and B2C and that we are on the forefront of these business model transformations that are happening in every industry give us a very unique vantage point. So, that\u2019s the keynote tomorrow that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be talking about and the customers that we\u2019re highlighting I think are a very interesting combination of B2B and B2C, and as Marc said, B2B2C. And I think that every one of these companies wants to understand their customer and get that intelligent Customer 360, and we\u2019re in a very unique position to be able to provide that uniquely in the marketplace. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much, and my congrats as well. I actually just, Keith, wanted to get your sense of two things around digital transformation and where we are. One is international versus U.S. So, is it fair to say that international markets are a little later on that curve or is that an incorrect statement? And then just by vertical industry, I\u2019m curious as to \u2013 similar question, which vertical industries do you think have got the most opportunity ahead in this journey on digital transformation? Thank you. Keith Block : Yes. Our strategy as you know has been as we\u2019ve moved into the enterprise to make sure that we\u2019ve had a strong international push and so we\u2019ve made those investments, that\u2019s why 42% of the employees that we hired were outside the Americas in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s because we\u2019re seizing upon the opportunity and working very closely with our customers. I think rather than look at it geographically, I think really to your point, really your second question, you have to look at it on an industry-by-industry basis because some industries are just further ahead, it\u2019s just the way it is. So, for example, a lot of financial services companies historically have thought of themselves as technology firms, so, they\u2019re further ahead. And that is an industry that is ripe for digital transformation and we see it on our results. Another industry that is ripe for digital transformation is the public sector, the governments around the world. And that obviously is a huge opportunity for us to work with the government and to provide higher levels of service through digital transformation. So, I think about financial services, I think about public sector, I think about healthcare. These are all industries that are going through a lot of transformation, retail, but at the end of the day, no industry is immune from digital transformation. If you\u2019re a CEO and if you\u2019re not thinking about your digital transformation strategy, you\u2019re going to miss the market, and that\u2019s playing out all over the world in every geography because it really to me is industry-based. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Phil Winslow : Hey, yes, thanks guys for my question, and congrats on a great end of the year. Just wanted to focus on Marketing Cloud, we\u2019ve talked a little about Service and Sales Cloud. Marketing Cloud still seems to be for MarTechs having great momentum. Can you give us just some color on sort of what\u2019s driving that? And then a question specifically for Marc, when you think about MarTech and AdTech and you mentioned Google in the prepared remarks. Where does sort of MarTech end and AdTech begin? And how do you see Salesforce from a sort of competitive or partnership perspective in those areas? Marc Benioff : Well, you\u2019re right. You can see it in the numbers. Marketing Cloud has been a tremendous growth driver for us and this year has been no exception. The numbers have been really incredible. And it\u2019s been driven by many things. Of course, as you know, it really is a product line that we have put together through many exciting acquisitions, including companies like ExactTarget, as well as Demandware. And what it\u2019s resulted in is probably the most comprehensive solution for companies, who are building that one-on-one relationship with their customer. The most powerful part of our Marketing Cloud I really already hit and I\u2019ll have Bret touch on it in a second is that it\u2019s both a great Marketing Cloud for B2C companies and one that can operate at scale, tremendous scale as I mentioned in my comments, I\u2019m sure you saw, when we\u2019re sending out that many emails or addressing that many cases, no one else can really deliver that type of opportunity, but it\u2019s not just for B2C companies, it\u2019s also great for B2B companies too. And in one of the core areas of our Marketing Cloud, which is our Commerce Cloud, you saw how not only do we, for example, run all of the B2C interactions for a major customer like Adidas, but with the most recent acquisition with CloudCraze, we\u2019ll also be able to step in and provide incredible B2C capabilities. On top of that, we\u2019ve really added tremendous analytics capabilities and that\u2019s in partnership with Google. As you know Google Analytics is really the number 1 analytics solution for companies trying to understand their relationship with their customers. And Google Analytics continues to gain market share with our customers and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve tightened our integration with Google Analytics. And in addition to that, we\u2019ve added our own comprehensive analytics solution, which integrates with that, as well as with all of our clouds which is why we acquired Datorama, which is the Israeli-based company who provides really marketers the ability to have really a mission-critical dashboard that shows them exactly how to invest and how to move forward based on the successes of all their marketing organization. So Bret, would you like to just touch on some of the success of Marketing Cloud this year? Bret Taylor : Yes. I think Marketing Cloud has really been driven by these trends that keep us talking about this Fourth Industrial Revolution. One of the very unique value propositions of our Marketing Cloud is that, it completely uniquely in the marketplace can do personalization at scale. Now what that means is, every single engagement that you have in our Marketing Cloud whether it\u2019s a push notification or an email or a page that you see in our Commerce Cloud, it is personalized to you and your preferences. And to do that at scale essentially demands the technology that we\u2019ve invested in as a platform like Einstein, so that we can not only know how to reach you, but what message to send and understand all of your previous interactions in this intelligent Customer 360 to provide that personalized experience. And you mentioned MarTech and AdTech, I think it\u2019s a good question. We really view it as a continuum. We want to enable you to discover these products from our customers, we want to engage you, we want to drive you towards a transaction, and then we want to enable our customers to create loyal customers, and we really think of it as a cycle. And as Marc said, thanks to I think our very strategic acquisition strategy here, we have the most complete solution to drive that entire continuum, everything from discovery to loyalty. And that\u2019s why that cloud is growing so quickly because our customers don\u2019t just want the point technology solution, they want to enable themselves to compete with these digital-first retail customers that are really driving the consumer experience in this area, and our cloud is uniquely capable of doing so. Marc Benioff : And Bret, as you are building this intelligent Customer 360, which is really the next wave of the product line and as you march towards Dreamforce this year to show customers what that next-generation intelligent Customer 360 looks like, what are some of the extensions that we would see to the Marketing Cloud that kind of demonstrate why that vision is so important? Bret Taylor : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. I think historically, people have thought of things like Commerce and Marketing as separate, but with the intelligent Customer 360, we think of them in a very integrated way, and I\u2019ll give you a very practical example of this. With the intelligent Customer 360, once you\u2019ve purchased a product on our Commerce Cloud, your subsequent email journey will be personalized based on your product history, and that\u2019s enabled by this Customer 360. Similarly, if you added something to your shopping cart and you forgot to actually purchase it, you can be put on a journey to remind you to go back and purchase it. All this drives personalized experience for consumers which is a wonderful consumer experience and for our customers it improves their revenue and it improves their relationship with their customers. And really this vision for this intelligent Customer 360, the reason it\u2019s so strategic, you\u2019ve heard Mark Hawkins talk a lot about the strategy of multi-cloud engagements and how strategic they are to our business. For our customers, it means can we provide a truly integrated customer experience, so you don\u2019t see the seams between your different departments, you don\u2019t see the seams between these different technologies, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to create with the intelligent Customer 360. Marc Benioff : The customer that comes to mind when you\u2019re talking about that and I think I\u2019m just cueing off of Keith\u2019s comment is, you saw that Dreamforce that when you see a CEO show up at Dreamforce like Brunello Cucinelli was there, the reason why he\u2019s able to partner so close to Salesforce is and why we become their digital transformation partner is, we\u2019re not there for just one silo of their business, sales or service or marketing or commerce. We\u2019re there to really help him bring his entire company together. And it\u2019s really the comprehensiveness of the solution that then really yields that result for them. And I think that\u2019s what has really given us so much satisfaction especially this year when we see a company like that or like when Keith talks about Jes Staley\u2019s ability to partner at the CEO level and for them to know that we\u2019re going to be able to bring all of these assets to bear and they\u2019re not going to have to just go to individual silo organizations within the customer segment that we\u2019re able to bring that entire CRM solution to them. Mark Hawkins : Yes, I agree. I just would add one last comment. With all the innovation that Bret talked about with Marketing Cloud and Marc talked about with Marketing Cloud and the Google partnership, Marc that you and Bret had talked about, what strikes me is 37% growth. We\u2019re growing at multiples of the market. And that\u2019s something I\u2019m encouraged to see at a fiscal year level for Marketing Cloud. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is now open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. We spend a lot of time hearing about how some of the biggest and leading \u2013 most leading companies are using Salesforce technology to engage in their digital transformations. But the smaller and midsize businesses have been a pretty big part of your bread and butter historically as well. Can you talk a little bit about how \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing sort of in the volume of your business in terms of how they\u2019re thinking about digital transformation? Are they even starting to dream about that at this point or is it still a ways out? And as you think about that longer-term target of $26 billion to $28 billion, how instrumental is the companies outside of those biggest companies going to be in achieving that? Marc Benioff : Well, I think that as you look at where we\u2019re going \u2013we\u2019re certainly excited to initiate our 4-year guidance. And as we kind of head to $26 billion to $28 billion as we kind of work toward this year guidance of $16 billion and our very short-term guidance of $20 billion, which are just enormous numbers for any technology company. In all of these cases, I think it\u2019s going to really get back to one very important thing and that is something that our company has been very fortunate to build which is a relationship with all of our stakeholders. When we look at all of our employees here at Salesforce and our customers, when we look at our partners, when we look at our trailblazers, our MVPs or like we say at Salesforce when we bring all of these together, it\u2019s really our ohana. And we\u2019re still grateful to be able to have all these relationships with them that we together have been able to build these trusted relationships, that we have been able to focus on customer success, that we\u2019ve been able to deliver this incredible innovation and be recognized for it so broadly, and also at the same time to build a culture here at Salesforce that has been able to stand for so many incredible things especially quality. Marc Benioff : But I just want to end the call by saying this, that as we approach Salesforce\u2019s 20th birthday on Friday March 8th, that it\u2019s really our fifth core value gratitude that comes to mind, because we are very deeply grateful for everything that has been given to us every single day over the last 20 years.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. John Cummings, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal first quarter 2020 results conference call. Our results, press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and co-CEO; Keith Block, co-CEO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; and Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q. With that, I hand it over to you, Marc. Marc Benioff : Okay, hey, thanks so much, John, and thank you everyone, for being on the call today. I am sorry I'm a little bit late here. I was working on Kramer and that will be on in 45 minutes. So, let me just say, first of all, we are just happy to share that revenue in the quarter rose to more than $3.7 billion, up 24% in dollars and 26% in constant currency. And in Q1, we delivered nearly $2 billion in operating cash flow, up 34% year-over-year, and I just want to congratulate our entire team for these cash flow numbers because they are just phenomenal. For fiscal year 2020, we're guiding to $16.25 billion at the high end of the range, representing 22% projected growth year-over-year, and that's up $200 million from 90 days ago when we had our Q4 earnings call. No other enterprise software company of our size and scale is growing at this rate. Just last month, IDC Worldwide Software Tracker ranked Salesforce the number one CRM for the sixth year in a row, and I'll tell you that is more important than ever, especially so many of our customers are going through these tremendous digital transformations and we all know every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. And when I'm with these CEOs all over the world, this is really front and center in their mind. It's probably as exciting to them and it's important to them as it was to CIOs who were buying for Y2K, which is almost 20 years ago. I think the digital transformation remains just a huge growth opportunity for our entire industry. And it's not only that, in 2018, Salesforce gained more CRM market share than the other top vendors combined, 15 top vendors combined, that's amazing. We're number one in sales, we're number one in service, and we're leading in so many other areas. We're number one in model-driven application platforms driven by our amazing community of 6 million developers. We're also a leader in marketing and commerce and continue to gain share, and with MuleSoft we also have this number one integration platform, it's incredible. We have amazing opportunity ahead of us and we're taking advantage of that through a relentless focus on innovation, which is why Forbes has ranked Salesforce as one of the most innovative companies for 8 years in a row. We have a powerful vision for the future, with intelligent Customer 360, giving our B2B and our B2C customers a unified 360-degree view of their customers across every touch point, sales, service, marketing, commerce, communities, and more, and I'll tell you, this vision that has been so well articulated now by our product organization that we call Customer 360, this is really driving tremendous opportunity at the highest levels in these customers, and we'll talk about that, but every company needs to have this Customer 360 capability. It doesn't really matter what industry you are, even the Federal government, it's just a tremendous driving force. And Customer 360 will continue to be a major growth engine for Salesforce going forward. At its core, it is our, core Salesforce Platform, which is the most powerful and easy way for companies to build modern, intelligent applications. In Q1, we announced our new Einstein Platform Services that enable everybody, regardless of their technical skill, to build custom AI-powered apps with just a few clicks, and that has been so important for our customers because just as we've infused these Einstein AI capabilities across our entire product line, and made Einstein Voice and also Einstein Vision capabilities available to every Salesforce app, we're now doing this exact same thing with another critical technology for our customers, which is blockchain. So, when you look at our platform, you see this incredible capability of not just AI, not just blockchain, not just mobile, I mean there's so many things that are in the platform and the ability for our customers to easily build these state-of-the-art applications, it's pretty awesome or just simply extend our CRM apps. Last week, at TrailheaDX, our sold-out developer conference in San Francisco, we introduced Salesforce Blockchain. It is a breakthrough. Every customer app can have blockchain capabilities. It's the world's first declarative blockchain service solution, and it's built in deeply now into all of our apps. It's built in deeply into our platform. It's built natively on our platform enabling customers to easily create blockchain applications with simple drag-and-drop as they can with every other Salesforce app. And I'll tell you, in Minneapolis, on Friday, demonstrating it to one of our very large customers and showing how they can use it for their supply chain, and it's just incredible what it's going to do for so many of our customers in every industry. Also, our ecosystem is just developing in a huge economy around Salesforce, one that is going to create more than 3 million jobs and more than $850 billion in GDP by 2022, and that is why we're so excited about Trailhead, which is our online learning platform and our online reskilling platform that empowers everyone. Now we have more than 1.4 million learners changing their careers and their lives on Trailhead, and I'm sure so many of you have met these inspiring people and their incredible stories of how they transformed themselves using Trailhead. And in the quarter, our new myTrailhead product became generally available and now any of our customers can actually create their own branded service just like what we have done and reskill all their employees, customers, and partners too. So it will be a huge driver of workforce development, which is why we are so excited that two weeks ago, we were with Ivanka Trump at our First-Ever Trailblazer Day in Indianapolis, in our headquarters in Indiana, where we signed the White House Pledge for America's Workers, and we plan to give more than 1 million Americans the skills they need and earn these Salesforce credentials and badges and do everything necessary to make them successful and to get top jobs in our ecosystem over the next 5 years. Finally, at Salesforce, our vision has always been to change the way the world does business, and at the same time improve the state of the world. And that's why I'm extremely excited today that salesforce.org is reunified officially as part of Salesforce, providing an even better experience for all of our non-profit education and philanthropy customers, empowering them to fulfill their missions and tightly unifying our .org employees with our company \u2013 they are already sitting in our buildings and are already here with us, but now they're fully part of our structure as well and it's tremendous opportunity to accelerate our work in this incredible non-profit world. And now, as you're going to hear from Keith, we're well positioned to continue on our path to organically double our revenue again in the next four years, achieving a revenue target of $26 billion to $28 billion for fiscal year 2023.  And now, over to Keith. Keith Block : Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining us in the call today. As Marc said, we have never been positioned for the future better than we are right now. We delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter and we're seeing great momentum across all of our clouds and all of our industries. In fact, for the first time ever, sales cloud \u2013 Service Cloud exceeded $1 billion in revenue for the quarter, becoming our second cloud. That is pretty awesome, right? That is admittedly. Mark Hawkins : $1.25 billion for Service Cloud, you know a lot of these other cloud companies that we read about all the time, they're not even doing $1 billion quarters in their VIM, service clouds, congratulations. Keith Block : No. It's pretty amazing. So it is becoming our second cloud, as Marc said, to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $4 billion, which is pretty incredible. Marc Benioff : It is pretty awesome. Keith Block : And MuleSoft, by the way, also had an outstanding Q1, capping off a record first year in celebrating its anniversary here as part of Salesforce. Now, we are well prepared, as Marc said to deliver on our FY 2020 goal and also our goal of $26 billion to $28 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2023. So we're all excited about that. Quarter-after-quarter, we continue to take share and outpace the competition. I think that's pretty clear. As Marc alluded to, we have been meeting with CEOs around the world and the common theme that we're hearing is the importance of transforming their customer experience and the value of providing a 360-degree view of the customer. And that's something that Salesforce does better than anybody, and that's why we continue to see massive demand for our solutions from both new customers and existing customers across the world, every industry, every market segment. And you can see this, it's in our results, 25% year-over-year revenue growth in the Americas; 27% in APAC; and 32% in EMEA in constant currency, very, very proud of those results. Now a great example of a customer who understand the importance of transformation in the customer is Dell, who's really done a fantastic job in their transformation around customer experience. Dell is a long-time customer, they're a strategic partner. In the quarter, they expanded with us to deliver more automated and intelligent customer service experiences with Einstein Bots and predictions and Next Best Action, very, very important. In Q1, we've also built and strengthened relationships with some of the leading companies around the world including Tokio Marine Holdings, one of Japan's largest insurance providers. They're standardizing sales and service and marketing on Salesforce which is very, very cool. And they also were deploying Financial Services Cloud to a million of agents in over 50,000 agencies. We also expanded with Hera Group, an Italian utility company. I just came back from Italy, last week. This is a company that is serving over 4.4 million citizens. And we also formed a new relationship with People's Choice Credit Union, one of the largest credit unions in Australia. We can see this as an ongoing phenomenon globally. Again, very, very excited with what's happening. We continue to deepen our relationship with the U.S. Federal Government. The Department of Education recently selected Salesforce as its platform to modernize and streamline the experience of millions of citizens with federal student loan. Southwest Airlines, which has won awards for their world-class customer service is creating an entirely new employee experience with a centralized knowledge and to build on Salesforce using certified communities. Southwest is transforming delivery of their HR services with new sales service chat and mobile capabilities for more than 60,000 employees. It's also about our partner ecosystem. We all know the importance of our partners and they continue to play a critical role in our customer's transformation and not only were partners involved in 63% of our new business in Q1, but they were some of our leading adopters as well. Accenture selected myTrailhead, this is very important, still their culture of continuous learning and provide top talent for their clients business and leveraging custom content for re-skilling employees on topics like artificial intelligence, networking and leadership development. Again, think about the business that Accenture and these other providers were in, it's all about talent and bringing value to the table. We're also seeing strong momentum beyond the United States, Australia's Telstra with another great myTrailhead win for the quarter. I was recently with their CEO and board discussing the strategic importance of reskilling the workforce is the common theme and its top of mind as Marc alluded to for every CEO in the world. It comes up in every single conversation. Our vertical solutions continue to drive success and value for our customers. In Q1, we launched Einstein Analytics for financial services. This is the first complete intelligence platform for wealth and banking. In the quarter, we had incredible Financial Services Cloud wins with clients in CIBC. We also released new health cloud capabilities to provide a complete new factor's that contribute to a patient's health, again, very, very important, enabling providers to deliver better care and improved outcomes. In Q1, Cerner, a leading provider of health care information and EHR technologies chose to replace their current CRM in Salesforce to continue transforming how they engage with their consumers and their providers. Finally, as I mentioned, it's been a year since we acquired MuleSoft and we're absolutely thrilled with the combined success. In April, MuleSoft was named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Integration Platform as a Service and that makes us the only company \u2013 the only company to be recognized as a leader in both these and Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management. So to close, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees, our strong results this quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Hawkins. Mark Hawkins : Well, thanks, Keith. And as you've heard from Marc and Keith, we're pleased with our first quarter results, delivering strong revenue growth across each of our clouds and geographies, year-over-year operating margin improvement and a record quarter of operating cash flow. Let me take you through some of the details for Q1. First quarter revenue grew 24% in dollars and 26% in constant currency. As you can see, we experienced FX headwinds in Q1, which on a dollar basis represented $61 million or two full points of growth year-over-year. Our industry-leading product portfolio continue to deliver strong subscription and support revenue growth in U.S. dollars year-over-year. Sales Cloud grew 11% in U.S. dollars; Service Cloud grew 20%; and this quarter, as noted, eclipsed the $4 billion annual run rate. Marketing and commerce grew 33%. Platform and Other grew 46%, including approximately $140 million in subscription and support revenue for MuleSoft, of which 55% is treated as term license. Keep in mind, the FX headwind for total revenue affected each of the clouds on a similar proportional basis. Driving into MuleSoft a bit more, we continue to execute well with MuleSoft contributing $170 million for total revenue in the first quarter. While this is our final quarter of discrete revenue reporting for MuleSoft, we intend to provide additional color on MuleSoft going forward as appropriate. Our renewal rate remained healthy in Q1 and dollar attrition continues to remain below 10%. In fact, our attrition rate continued to improve modestly in the first quarter year-over-year similar to the year-over-year improvement in attrition that we saw last quarter in Q4 2019. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.49 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.93. Required mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investments benefited both GAAP and non-GAAP in the first quarter by approximately $0.27. Turning to cash flow. I was very pleased with our strong cash collections in the first quarter, which drove the operating cash flow of $1.97 billion, up 34% year-over-year. In fact, in Q1, we generated more operating cash flow than we did in our entire fiscal year 2016. CapEx for the quarter was $159 million, leading to free cash flow, as defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of $1.81 billion, up 34% over Q1 of last year. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenues under contracts ended the first quarter at approximately $24.9 billion, up 22% over the last year. Current RPO balance or cRPO, which is business that is both billed and unbilled and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was approximately $11.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, cRPO was up 24% year-over-year after considering an FX headwind of more than $100 million. While we make changes to our sales organization as we do every on Q1, we did not see a material impact to our cRPO, as you can see in these results. Before I turn to guidance, let me turn -- touch on the FX environment and the combination of Salesforce.org and the related impact to in Q2 FY 2020 guidance. First, regarding FX. As is evident in our results, we're seeing a substantial decline in our FX rates since our Q4 call. The Great British pound, for example, decreased approximately 5% since our fiscal fourth quarter 2019 earnings call and our euro declined by approximately 2% over the same period. Second, regarding Salesforce.org. With the recently announced closing, we continue to expect to Salesforce.org to contribute approximately $150 million to $200 million in revenue in FY 2020 with approximately $40 million to $50 million of this revenue recognized in Q2. And as previously discussed, we will incur a one-time non-cash accounting charge of approximately $200 million in second quarter related to our settlement of the reseller agreement with Salesforce.org, which impacts our Q2 GAAP to non-GAAP EPS guide by approximately $0.20. We expect the combination of Salesforce.org to be additive to our long-term revenue targets and we'll provide more detail during our annual Analyst Day in the fall. Now turning to Q2 and FY 2020 guidance. We are now expecting north of $200 million in FX headwinds for the year. And given this context, we are pleased to be able to absorb these headwinds and still finish FY 2020 revenue guidance of $16.1 billion to $16.25 billion for 21% to 22% growth year-over-year and with the dollar strengthening relatively to GDP and the euro, we're not only experiencing headwind to revenue, but also have an increase in pressure in operating margins as well. And that context along with the integration of transaction expenses associated with the combination of Salesforce.org, we were also pleased to be able to maintain our plan of delivering flat to 25 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improving year-over-year. As a result, we are raising our FY 2020 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.78 to $0.80 and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to $2.88 to $2.90. And as a reminder, our EPS guidance assumes no future contribution for mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. For operating cash flow, we maintain our FY 2020 operating cash flow guidance of 20% to 21%. For Q2, we expect revenues in the range of $3.94 billion to $3.95 billion; GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.08 to $0.07; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.46 to $0.47. We are also expect cRPO approximately 20% to 21% year-over-year in the second quarter. To close, we had another quarter of strong results and we maintain to be on track for FY 2020 revenue and profitability goals and achieve our long-term organic target of $26 billion to $28 billion in FY 2023. I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support. With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had a couple. Marc, I was wondering if we could spend a little bit more time on MuleSoft. And if you could just share with us some examples of how it's helping you expand your reach within your existing customers. And any success you might be able to share about how it's brought new customers into the Salesforce fold? And then I just had a quick follow-up for Mark Hawkins. Just -- you mentioned the cRPO that you -- the headwind in the quarter from FX. Were you expecting -- could you share with us were you expecting an FX headwind in the quarter for cRPO because that's where we're getting things as well? So thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks. Let me just check on that just briefly. And I'll tell you right now, we really pivoted our entire company into something that we call Customer 360. It's a pretty hard pivot for our company, and we're so excited about this opportunity, and a lot of it is because of tremendous momentum that we've seen over the last year with MuleSoft. And this idea that what our customers want us to do is to be able to take everything they're doing in regards to their customers. So that is their sales, their service, their marketing, and their journeys, their commerce and their customer engagement systems, apps they're building, APIs that they're building for developers to integrate with those customers. All the analytics, custom applications by industry, the communities, the learning and reskilling systems that I mentioned, and the employee experience as well. And to bring it all together, using all these amazing technologies that you know are becoming so important to us like blockchain, AI, whether it's vision or voice, it's incredible what has happened just in the last two years or three years, put it all on a phone, deliver it all as a programmatic capability, make it secure, and then wrap it all together, put a bow on it and call it Customer 360. And we're the only ones who are really trying to do this. It's kind of interesting because as I meet with customers all over the world, and in this quarter, I've been basically nonstop on the road. I've been in Japan, I've been throughout the United States, I've been through Europe, and Keith as well. And when we basically \u2013 come back and go \u201cwow,\u201d this is what all these customers are trying to do and this is really our vision. And what has accelerated it for us, and our ability to execute it and yet it's a hard tidbit for us is MuleSoft because MuleSoft has given us the ability to come into the customers and say we're going to bring in everything you have into that 360. We're not going to be a silo, we're not going to be all about this application that we're building that our platform is giving you the ability to connect all of your systems together into one. And so, so many exciting customer stories around that that I could touch on, but Bret, do you want to just kind of go a little deeper into that vision. Bret Taylor : Yes. I mean, it's actually a great time. We just had our TrailheaDX Developer Conference in San Francisco last week, and MuleSoft was really highlighted. One of the stories that was on stage, and the keynote ASICs, they really capture that vision of Customer 360 that Marc was talking about. In that story, we were just talking about that ASICs was building their mobile app and their e-commerce experience, and as Marc said, [indiscernible] customer 360, so every ASICs customer has a personalized one-to-one experience. It wasn't just about our technology, it was about the order management system, the on-premise systems, the legacy systems, and all that data is trapped. And if you talk to the CEOs who are trying to do these digital transformations, they are trying to create those next-generation customer experiences to integrate with smart watches and smart speakers and smart TVs and smart thermostats. Their barrier is the legacy systems that are data trapped in legacy systems and MuleSoft has been such an accelerator for that vision technologically, which is why if you walked around the floor in TrailheaDX last week, MuleSoft was on everyone's mind. We launched this product called MuleSoft Community Manager, which enables companies create ecosystems around their APIs. APIs are becoming the lingua franca of how companies communicate with each other, and you can see really the convergence of our technologies and our Community Cloud and the API orientation of MuleSoft I think really transforms the way companies are thinking about the data and thinking about integration strategically. Heather Bellini : The another thing that really comes across when we're talking about that, Bret, is this vision of building a Customer 360, and much of the story that happened just last week where I was with a customer at a lunch, and we\u2019re talking about everything you just said but they're concerned because maybe they are going to make a decision about what their social implementation is. Maybe they're making the decision about their customer service call center over here, maybe they're making a decision around their marketing systems or their sales force or their apps. They want to bring it all together. They need to be able to have a unified customer view. So, is that a daunting challenge for these companies or how are you going to make that easy for them? Keith Block : Yes, it is. Let's take e-commerce as an example. We were just talking about ASICs. If you are a modern retailer, it's not just about making a storefront anymore, you have to integrate with Pinterest and Instagram, you have to be able to show where your customers are, and that's evolving day by day, week by week, month by month. The MuleSoft team will tell you, MuleSoft is a technology that increases the clock speed of digital transformation. And I think what I hear from the most strategic Chief Digital Officers and CEOs is, their focus isn't just deploying a solution, it's making sure that the pace of integration as a company increases. And I think fundamentally that is more profitable. Heather Bellini : Okay. And unfortunately, Keith just left the room, Mark, do you just want touch in a little bit and give us some fill on MuleSoft color and how important this been to company? Mark Hawkins : Well, for sure. I mean, MuleSoft has been just a great offering for us. It's a great customer response. We're super happy with it, that's for sure. It's been great to customers who have them. When we talk about our entire Customer Success Platform and how this is going to helping us more enable that. So that is more positive marketing. The only thing I might touch on is the second question that had been asked regarding the RPO, cRPO in particular. And we did incur the $100 million FX headwind. This is clearly significantly incremental to anything we would have expected for sure. And the only thing that I would like to call out, and we talk a lot about as a management team, we're looking today on a hunt for $200 million at our revenue level for FX headwind this very moments. This is clearly something different that's happening. What I'm pleased with is we're able to absorb this and still deliver our fiscal year high-end guide number of 16250 or 22% growth this year. Heather Bellini : You touched on this a little bit in your script for foreign exchange, but we have gone through foreign exchange environment making it really heavy for us. Like how much foreign exchange headwind do you have for the year? Keith Block : For example, in the first quarter, we took a $61 million headwind in revenue alone, for example. We have $200 million that we're looking at as a headwind for this year thus far. And I think the good news is we've got that covered within a plan and -- and little place that we can deliver what we deliver with that. Marc Benioff : And it's amazing you're going to deliver 16,250 for the year but you're still picking up all these foreign exchange. This thing that I appreciate is our predictive business model, it's really something that we talk a lot with our customers about and that really helps us what is a lot or things I think our investors understand. Keith Block : You can't predict foreign exchange very well, which is hard to \u2013 that\u2019s what Marc was suggesting that and I would second that as well\u2026. Marc Benioff : Backing agreement, technically keeping together. Keith Block : I don\u2019t know \u2013 something is not working. I am not saying enough. Heather Bellini : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Karl Keirstead : Thank you. Marc Benioff, I wanted to ask you, I think everybody on this call realizes that it's -- there's a little bit more macro uncertainty out there, but I wanted to ask whether as you and Keith and Mark Hawkins sat down to set the guide for 2Q and the full year, whether you're assuming any broader spending environment change for Salesforce? Thanks very much for any comment. Marc Benioff : I think that's a really good question. I mean I'll just give you my -- I mean, I'm not an economist. Everyone on the call knows that. I'm just out in the field talking to customers like all of you are. And I've been all over the world the last 90 days and I've talked to hundreds and hundreds of customers face-to-face. And I would say that this is -- we're still in a very strong economy. Maybe this is not 2018 economy, but it's a 2017 economy. I think last year, of course, we have that radical crazy acceleration because of the tax cuts, but there's still a strong buy-in emotion by all these CEOs. But I will say that I think they do all have some anxiety around what's going on with this trade situation. And even in a customer that I was with as early as last week, they -- I think are not very happy with how that could potentially impact them, but I don't see it coming in on the economy right now. Now, we don't do business really in China, so we're not a good company to talk about that kind of trade situation as these trade things don't affect us. We're mostly free of that. But when we look into the customers' eyes, we're always like saying to ourselves, are they buying? Are they investing? And the thing that hits me and this is where I am, and I'm going to -- I'll let Keith talk about this, again, which is that I have just been really impressed with how every CEO and really C-suite that I'm talking to is actually quite obsessed with digital transformation. And I think they all see the tremendous revenue growth opportunities now from these new technologies. Maybe they didn't understand what blockchain was, maybe they didn't understand AI, maybe they didn't understand some of the subtleties of mobility and all of the opportunity, but something is going to change that in the last, I would say, 18 to 24 months. And sitting at this very table that we're at right now, we have the CEO of a very large healthcare company here I guess maybe about two weeks ago, through the demonstration show them, talking to the computer, your artificial intelligence sales understand and talking back to us which was amazing. And then also we use the camera to have a direct artificial intelligence analysis of what was going on in a retail shop which was so cool. And we've demonstrated that before. And now how we integrated into the blockchain where you see the whole transparency of the supply chain was amazing. And of course, we didn\u2019t allow mobile phones, it was secure. And then bam, we had Customer 360. And the CEO was not shocked. They're kind of following along as we got at that level, I think that CEOs have very much become Chief Information Officers or Chief Digital Officer themselves, and we're now rolling into that level of executive. And because of that, I think they really have the ability to transform their companies, in many cases, those visions are not coming from middle managers who are obviously deeply involved, but from the chief executives or C-suite themselves. And if you try to lay back, you can. You're the right person to talk about blockchain by the way. Keith Block : So, many, many points here. None of us are economists, Mark that we have to anybody in the conference but that being said, I do think we're in an enviable position for the company what's going on with digital transformation around the world. I wish we could return from EMEA and I was with CEOs from financial services institutions of the U.K., France, and Italy and they're all talking about digital transformation and the customer experience and the importance of providing that customer experience and customer loyalty, and providing higher levels of service with our technology. I was also with the CEOs of few retail companies in the U.K. and France and before I left for the United States, and obviously, retail is a challenged market. And these companies are reinventing themselves and the experience they have at least with the CEO with the largest companies in the world, and he's talking about a direct relationship directly with a patient for the drugs that they're bringing to market. And these are things that we couldn't think about two years ago, three years ago, four years ago or consumer packaged goods companies begun with the largest CPG companies in the world, I was sitting here, talking about how that CPG company gets closer to their end consumer and how they can optimize their own retail execution where there's so many possibilities here. And Marc nailed it. I mean the CEO [Indiscernible] has become a Chief Digital Officer, Chief Information Officer and that's why the company keep coming to Salesforce. Because we really are the only company that can provide this capability and this 360-degree view of the customer. This is the Holy Grail. Marc and I have been in this interview for quite a while, this is the Holy Grail for customers, and we're in a great position for them. Karl Keirstead : When you look at customer's ability to have full effects of this technology. Where are they? Are they at this point really able to see this technology and deploy it? Are you seeing that transformation? Or is there still technology transfer issue? Marc Benioff : Well, there's many, many companies, I think are in very early days. In fact, if you talk to one of our largest consulting partners, they'll tell you less than 20% of their strategic customers have been engaged in the digital transformation, but there's a lot of room for them in the marketplace. Going back to the first question about MuleSoft, who would've thought that a CEO would be thinking about integration and the importance of data being strategic to their transformation. And that is the value and the beauty of what MuleSoft brings to the table. So, we have an opportunity here again around this digital transformation and one of the beauties of a product like Trailhead and My Trailhead is helping these companies through their transformation and scale them up with modern technology because the modern worker has to have modern skills. And that's what Trailhead and My Trailhead really provide the customers. So we really are coming out with an amazing innovation at the right time to satisfy the needs of these customers [Indiscernible]. Karl Keirstead : Great. Thank you. Operator : And. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks. I guess for Keith. Headcount adds in the quarter were quite strong for Q1, and up 24% on a year-over-year basis. It's almost the highest in two years. So, are there any areas you would highlight you're accelerating investments whether at certain function, geography or product area? And I guess, as a follow-up, since you're getting so large and almost 40,000 employees, can you just touch on how you ensure you continue to manage onboarding and the threshold and maybe how attrition is tracking these days? Marc Benioff : So, thanks for the call. Look, I think you know that we've got a very, very strong international strategy, so we've invested significantly globally, but certainly outside the United States as we continue to take share. We've obviously made a commitment to our industry strategy so you continue to see a verticalized with our product, whether it's our customers and our partners and our headcount as well. MuleSoft, of course, is certainly a growth area for us, it's our core cloud. So, there's a lot of opportunities for us to make these investments. But at the end of the day, all the investments that we make rotating around making sure that we're driving success for our customers. And when we think about on-boarding and as we bring in all these new people, one of the advantages that we have in the marketplace is that we have this amazing technology called Trailhead. And we -- all of our employees get upskilled using Trailhead. And it allows us to get these people hitting the ground running a lot faster than you would say through traditional learning system. So, we will continue to invest internationally and we'll continue to invest internationally in our key markets, in our international geographies, of course, in the United States. We'll continue to invest in our customer success because at the end of the day, the customer success is what it's all about. That is an amazing transformation under Brian Mill in our customer success organization and we'll continue to leverage Trailhead which I think has been very, very important to us. In fact, I would encourage all of you to go ahead and go to our website and try Trailhead and see how it can change your life. How's that? Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Keith, I actually wanted to follow-up on -- your comments around myTrailhead, especially as it relates to the comment you had on Accenture. Can myTrailhead become a force multiplier for you from a go-to-market perspective, especially in places like Europe and Asia where you might not have the reach historically? It seems to me that, that could be a potential way for you guys to accelerate even faster in those markets where you have the demand but maybe not the people on the ground to go capture the demand. So would love just kind of your thoughts on that. Thanks. Marc Benioff : Yeah, let me answer this and then I'm going to pivot and ask Bret to comment on it from a broader prospective. Look, as Mark and I go around the world, every CEO has this something that is top of mind besides digital transformation. And that is around their workforce development and their reskilling. That's why myTrailhead is so powerful. When you think about the digital transformation that these CEOs are going through, whether it's in the United States, quite frankly, or whether it's internationally, responsible CEOs were thinking about how do they absorb this amazing technology, how do they reskill their workers as they think about digital transformation. How do they act responsibly from a social perspective because if you think about it, these CEOs, they're in charge of tens of thousands, hundreds and thousands of people, and they care about their people? And that's where myTrailhead is an excellent example and an excellent solution, not just how they can scale their people up on this modern technology, but also to prepare them for this modern world. And we see this again everywhere in the world. And we have special programs with companies all over the world to talk about how they reskill the workforce. I mentioned in the opening comments the meeting I had with the CEO of Telstra and his executive team and how concerned they were about the modern reports and what they wanted to do with our reskilling their workforce. Marc and I have the same conversations with CEOs all over the world. So myTrailhead is a force multiplier. It is so important on so many levels when you think about modern skills and we're very, very excited about that. Bret, do you want to comment more from a product perspective? Bret Taylor : Yeah, I'll bring up this TrailheaDX conference because I think, Keith is talking about is really came out strong at that event. One of the women that we highlighted in this event was a woman named Angela Mahoney, she runs a certain vision called RAD Women which it\u2019s her condition to train women to become experts on the Salesforce technology in just 10 weeks and get them into the Salesforce ecosystem. This is entirely done by independent organizations who are just trying to help people with this, big problem of workforce development and empower people to get into the technology ecosystem. And what's incredible about it, at the end of this conference, we still need to bring into I think 100 something cities, but that wasn't us, what we did is, we put all of our content in a box and our ecosystem, our community is going to put on these events because they want to spread the word about the opportunity of this technology and the opportunities at Trailhead. That's exactly Bellini mentioned in her question, which is our community is spreading the word on our behalf because there's so much opportunity on the other side. It all comes from the completely ablative view, so we really think the Trailhead is one of the most significant differentiators of our platform. Our community is helping to teach other people about native technologies. It is also helping us with findings of our result that are helping I think a lot more members of our society benefit from the economic case of technology which is incredible opportunity for the world. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Your line is now open. Tom Roderick : Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So I know you've been getting a lot of questions this quarter just around not just the general environment, but also some of the strategies related to the install base and how you're handling renewals. I'd love to hear beyond just what is happening and what you're doing with, but what is reported strategy as you go to market, and this is probably a good question for Keith, as you think about the role of renewals and customer success with respect to the broader portfolio, how do you approach that customer? And is that philosophy changing at all? Thank you. Marc Benioff : So thank you for the question. Look, I think you know from our business model, the importance of renewal, that's why customer success is one of our most important values. We have entire organization, the customer success team that is focused on success, but it goes beyond the customer success to admit a cultural thing. I believe amongst the 40,000 employees we wake up every day, having a focused on customer success. So renewals, which are very, very small, and our attrition is excellent. I mean it's unprecedented, particularly for a company of our size and scale. That is obviously an indication with our customer satisfaction. Now we have doubled down in this transformation. We're all making sure that our customer experience is second to none. And what's interesting about that is if companies become a large companies of our size, they forget they are focused on the consumer. This is a company Salesforce that since day one, we\u2019ve benefited to driving successful customers. And a lot of companies along the way, they just loose their focus on the customer. And we have doubled down and renewed our focus on the customer. And again, part of that is renewals. But it really is about providing an incredible experience, a seamless experience at every single touch point that the customer have. And that's why Gartner recently recognized Salesforce as an incredibly strong company as it relates to customer experience, giving us that recognition. They know what's going on the marketplace. And it's -- because it's part of our culture, we're dedicating ourselves to it and we're not going to lose who we're, whereas other companies have made that strategic mistake along the way. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two really quick ones. Maybe first for Marc, you mentioned some Salesforce reorganization and the fact that didn't any impact on current RPO this quarter. Can you maybe touch on what kind of reorgs or what are you doing this year from a strategic go-to-market perspective around the sales team that's little different from last year? And then maybe just given the continuous mention around Trailhead and talent as being important strategic differentiators, have you given any thoughts to expanding your role in the talent kind of market from organic or inorganic matter? Keith Block : Hi, Alex, this is Keith. Why don't I take the question. So look, at the beginning of the fiscal year, we made some adjustments. You know we periodically do that and we do it to take advantage of the market opportunity that support the long-term growth plan that we have that's why we make adjustments. When you think about the endgame here, these decisions are really about getting close to our customers, right? And that is about driving the highest level of our customer success. Any of these adjustments that we made, they are essential, they are important and strategic in fueling our long-term growth which has been exceptional, as we know, at the size and scale. And we are very optimistic about where we are in FY 2020 and the demand that we are seeing in the marketplace and we're excited about where we're going with these adjustments. So we feel strongly about where we are. Operator : Thank you. And our next question -- go ahead. Marc Benioff : I just wanted to touch a little bit on the part of that employee experience. I just think and I think Bret should probably touch on this too which is this is really become I think a critical part of Customer 360 is that the employees inside of our customers, they need to have a good experience and have access to all of those customer information as well. And probably a great example this quarter was Southwest Airlines, since actually long-term customer of ours, he has been using our Service Cloud to deliver amazing customer service experience, and we've really enjoyed working with them. But now, Southwest is really turning to this employee experience. And they use our communities product and they use Service Cloud and they use a centralized HR help desk for 60,000 employees to check their benefits, manage rotation time and questions via chat and also in a mobile device. I don't want to think in any way that we're going into HRMS or anything like that. This is really something that's very much enhancing the customer experience and regards to employee experience and the interception between employees and customers. And there's many areas where this is touchdown for us. It could be our employee portal that we've provided for our customers, it can be provided in this HR help desks, it can be the integration of the customer information into the employee collaboration system and it's one of the key reasons we acquired Quip which has been just continues to be a tremendous success at Salesforce. And Quip is all about getting employee productivity and the productivity up in collaboration. And Bret, do you want to handle your vision here on employee experience and all the things that you're doing in our product to enhance the employee's experience with Customer 360? Bret Taylor : Yes. Whether you're in the airline industry or the hotel industry or the retail industry, the most important thing is you're empowering your employees for really touching the customer community and the customers provide that Customer 360. And really the words that I hear, time and time again, from CEOs is around enablement. How do I help my employees through this transformation, this digital transformation of technology and it's not just about the technology, it's about the human beings going through that change. So that's why we have things like myTrailhead, which speaks of learning platform that Keith and Marc talked about. They enabled something that you did for your own transformation. That's why Quip for Salesforce which is embedding productivity and collaboration into every single one of our products. And we think it's so important really to focus on this trailblazing employee and not just the technology and have enablement strategic capability of our platform. Keith Block : Yes. I will just add that I think one of the key things, and I'd love your take on this Bret, is that when we're talking with our customers and when we're talking to specifically the C-suite positioning ourselves, one of the things that I always say specifically is what we need to understand, we only have really one word in our company and that's customer. We're just here to do that for you. We're not going to do the HR fees, we're not doing the financial fees, we're not doing all these other things. We\u2019ll never do that as a company. What we do this -- we got but one of the things after 20 years I've been focused on this word customer and it has morphed, it has changed, it has evolved. When you look at the Customer 360, approach is very different, of course, where we were even just 10 years ago or 5 years ago. So how do you see that intersection between employee and customer and where you see that transformation going? Marc Benioff : Mark, I think the main word I am thinking is stakeholder. When you think about what it means to provide a Customer 360 now surrounding everyone engages with your customers with the right information. It might be a pharmacist, it might be a doctor, it might be a gate agent, it might be someone, a the customer service agent talking on the phone with your customer and we really even make sure we're serving every stakeholder that makes up that Customer 360 which is why the employee is a key constituency in providing us. But to me, it doesn't really deter from that those become the customerswhether it's helping you unlock your data for that Customer 360 through MuleSoft or enabling your employees with Quip and Trailhead, it\u2019s all about enabling this digital transformation to start presenting to the customer. Mark Hawkins : Well -- and [indiscernible] so I thought I'd really be remiss if I didn't say that one of the key players on our team is here, what Amy has really given us is a light on privacy and the security of our data and making sure that our customers have that privacy because when you take all these Customer 360, Amy, how do you see that evolving over the last quarter or two in regards to privacy which has been a major shift going on. I think worldwide, certainly going through the GDPR shift, where are we going with that? Amy Weaver : Sure. Thanks, Mark. GDPR, as you mentioned, just celebrated its first birthday. So we are through the first year and I'm happy to have that going on. I think the really the next big step in United States is looking for a federal law. At California, as you know, passed the CCPA and that's an important first step, but with the all Americans regardless of the code, which state they're in, very strong privacy protection and that's why we've been advocating our IDC advocate for a comprehensive federal privacy law. Marc Benioff : So this would be like national privacy laws which speak nationally state-by-state California is the first \u2026 Amy Weaver : Yes. Marc Benioff : \u2026 like a domino effect, we want to have the federal government step up and really deliver on national privacy law, is that what you are saying now? Amy Weaver : That was one of the real benefits of GDPR. We went from a patch work of privacy law all over Europe to one law that companies can work with as well as all of the systems know what to expect wherever they are in Europe. That's what we need in the U.S. and we need something which really required companies to be transparent about their privacy practices for individuals they have more control of their personal data than they do currently. And also frankly for companies to be held accountable for their actions. Marc Benioff : Well, I think that's just an awesome vision. I don't think anything would accelerate our Customer 360 vision more than having that in the United States as Europe. Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Terry Tillman with SunTrust Bank. Your line is now open. Terry Tillman : Yeah. Thank you for fitting in gentlemen. My question just relates to as we progressed to the rest of the fiscal year and Customer 360 with the last couple of questions and the answer has been focused on that, how do we help investors in terms of looking at metrics and barometers of success? Is it seven, eight figure deals? Or certain cloud products more likely to be pulled through or cash because of a Customer 360 conversation? Just wanted to learn some more perspective on that. Thank you. Keith Block : Well, this is Keith. Let me answer that. So if you go back to where we are in this modern age with this amazing technology where there is incredible disruption which is really should bring opportunity and we're really in a growth era. When you think about what's important to a CEO besides taking care of their employees, they're thinking about growth. We're not in the age of cut your way to prosperity anymore, that's a 20-year-old phenomenon. This is really about growth. And the most important thing about growth is with the customer in the center of the world and that means Customer 360. So when we're out there talking with our customers, we're looking for a solution, we're looking for a platform to grow, they want to think about Customer 360. So the way I would think about it is that every CEO has a strategic mission and an obligation to all their stakeholders around growth and success. And it is all about putting that customer in the center of the world. So that's just being that when we were out talking solutions, we will become more strategic, have a deeper relationship with these CEOs and C-suite because we're solving their number one problem. Their number one problem is about growth and putting that customer in the center of the world. So that is the way I would be thinking about this is that this brings Salesforce through a whole new position in terms of this relationships and deep meaning into the strategic strategy with the customers. We also have this amazing motion going on in the organization. MuleSoft, we have been providing the organization, but then some has worked maybe on single one of our clouds, if you will, the sales cloud, the service cloud, the cloud, integration cloud that Bret was talking about a little bit. And then once you have a new logo, then you have this kind of transactional throughput whereas you go to work and make them a multi-cloud customer or a vertical customer or taking on the vertical applications, how do you see that balance between new logos and existing customers and continuing to build market share. Marc Benioff : Well, we do have a new logo motion as well as an install base motion, they're both very, very healthy and continue to be a focus area for us. But at the end of the day, we're here to solve these customer solutions and drive success for them. And that means we position the right solution at the right time which may be a particular product or maybe a whole transformation. .: Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference call. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, it is my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. John Cummings, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Cummings : Thanks so much, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter results conference call. Our results, press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and co-CEO; Keith Block, co-CEO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer and Amy Weaver, President of Legal & Corporate Affairs. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q. Before I turn the call over to Marc, let me provide a brief comment regarding Tableau. I'm incredibly excited about our acquisition with Tableau software which closed in August 1st and have provided revenue guidance for Tableau for Q3 and FY 2020. As previously disclosed in our 8-K United Kingdom Competition and Market Authority or CMA is reviewing the transaction and has imposed a whole separate order pending completion of its review. Due to the whole separate order our ability to discuss Tableau today on this call is limited. We're happy to be working constructively with the CMA as it conducts its review.  And with that, let me turn the over to Marc Benioff. Marc Benioff : All right. Hey, thanks so much John. I really appreciate it. And hello everybody, I'm actually in Geneva, Switzerland and the team is in San Francisco. I am in Geneva at the World Economic Forum headquarters where I'm attending our annual Board of Trustees meeting and also our international business committee of our top 200 CEOs in the world. And it's been fascinating meeting. But I'll tell you one thing that everyone is really excited about here is what happened in the United States which is that the business roundtable, one of the top two business groups in the U.S. published an incredible statement this week on the purpose of a corporation and talked about how the purpose of the corporation is to serve all stakeholders. And why that's exciting here is many of the words that they were using almost exact phrases were written by Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. Over 50 years ago when he was at UC, Berkeley, and it's great to see the BR team take this incredibly progressive stance and I'm just very grateful to them because of course at Salesforce we do believe that business is the greatest platform for change. Well, I want to just thank you, John for introducing that and also thank you everybody for being on the call today. And as you can see, we had just incredible quarter here. Revenue in the quarter rose to $4 billion, up 22% in dollars and 23% constant currency and we ended the quarter with more than $25 billion in total remaining performance obligation. That was up 20% versus last year. It's really amazing what's happening at Salesforce. With our organic growth in our acquisitions of Tableau, Salesforce.org, ClickSoftware, we are raising our fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance to $16.9 billion at the high-end of our range representing about 27% growth year-over-year. Now, we have really been very strategic in building out our Customer 360 platform. This is our vision that really is at the heart of what's happening at the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Everybody knows the Fourth Industrial Revolution is underway. Everyone and everything is getting connected. But behind all of those things is the customer and certainly all the customers that I'm working with here in Geneva, all the customers that we work with around the world, well, they realized that behind all that Fourth Industrial Revolution is their customer and that they need to build that Customer 360 platform. And that's what we're doing. We're doing everything we can to build/deliver this incredible vision and we couldn't be more excited to build out our Customer 360 platform organically as well as through the acquisition of some phenomenal companies and some phenomenal talent. Now with Customer 360 we have just never really been better positioned for the future. In fact, we're the beginning of an enormous wave of digital transformation, I'm certainly seeing that here in Geneva. IDC forecast global spending on digital transformation to reach $1.18 trillion in 2019, that's an increase of nearly 18% over last year, truly quite amazing. And Salesforce is at the center of this massive shift because every digital transformation of every single one of these companies that we're talking to begins and ends with the customer. In fact, IDC also forecasts global spending on customer experience alone to reach $641 billion by 2022. Every company needs a intelligent, 360 degree view of their customers. They need to personalize every customer experience. They need to predict customer behavior and anticipate their customer needs, and they need to build modern mobile apps quickly and deliver the right services at the right time on any device. Well, that is Customer 360. Our vision for bringing companies and their customers together and it will be a huge growth engine for us over the next decade. And for our customers it's their aspirational goal. They're all trying to create a Customer 360. They want a Customer 360 to see what's happening with their customers in this incredible time of change. And they want to understand their customers and connect with them like never before. Salesforce is their number one CRM, and our Customer 360 platform is a leader in sales, in service, marketing, commerce, communities, integration, app dev and more. Customer 360 includes amazing platform services such as absolutely leading artificial intelligence and breakthroughs, envision and voice, in mobility and security. And because they're all built into the foundation of that platform they're available to everyone our customers, to every app, and everyone. We're operating a tremendous scale. Just look at some of the daily milestones our customers have helped us achieve with our Customer 360 platform. 4 million sales opportunities and 4.3 million leads generated today, 77 million service case interactions log, 4.1 billion messages and email sent, 4.2 million orders processed bot, 53 million reports and dashboards created every day and 700 million commerce pages. We're delivering world-class AI with Einstein, Salesforce Einstein in Customer 360. It's actually generating now and I know many of you've been following this and it's been incredible for me to see this. But we actually do now 8.6 billion Einstein predictions a day using our market-leading artificial intelligence platform. We've also made Einstein Voice and Einstein Vision available to every Salesforce app and these AI-powered capabilities are the future of the customer experience. We're also extending the power of Customer 360 with new services like Salesforce Blockchain, Salesforce Maps and as we've seen this quarter is specifically Salesforce Blockchain is the world's first declared Blockchain solution for CRM built natively on our platform. And with this new Salesforce Maps we're adding intelligent location-based services that improve productivity for sales and service employees to the field was built really building out that Customer 360 vision and our team has just done an incredible job getting this in the hands of customers. At the heart of Customer 360 is our incredible community of our Trailblazers. They are using Trailhead, our free online digital learning platform to get the skills they need for the jobs in the digital economy. We're more focused on this digital education than ever and we realize to achieve this vision of a new economy that we all want, we have to deliver this next-generation vision of education as well. We now have 1.5 million learners changing their careers and changing their lives on Trailhead. It's a 50% increase over last year and really cool, just last week we announced a partnership with Southern New Hampshire University, one of the fastest growing universities in the U.S. so that Trailblazers can now earn college credit for free on Trailhead. That's just an incredible lean forward for Trailhead. Well, Saleforce skills are in high demand. For those of you who watch what happen, I think just now about a week ago we saw that the Salesforce developer was ranked at the second number two on GlassDoor's list of jobs are the best career opportunities that was amazing for us. A huge economy is developing around Salesforce one that will create more than 3 million jobs and more than 860 billion GDP impact worldwide by 2022 and we'll continue to create opportunities for everyone to participate. With our Customer 360 vision with amazing Einstein innovations, the millions of Trailblazers innovating on our platform, Salesforce is incredibly well-positioned to help companies transform their customers. And you'll see all this at our \u2013 all this amazing innovation and all this amazing customer success at Dreamforce which this year will be November 19th in San Francisco. You probably know it's almost sold out, so you better register now. We are really right down to our last few seats and we'll be bringing together the thought leaders, industry pioneers, amazing innovators, incredible customers and of course all of our Trailblazers for four days of customer success stress, innovation of quality and learning. Dreamforce is an expression of our core values, our commitment to giving back which have been the key to our success to the business over the last two decades. For those of you know, we also something about to come out which is my -- our new book Trailblazer, the Power of Business is the greatest platform for Change including many of the concepts pioneered by Klaus Schwab here at the World Economic Forum in Geneva. It comes out on October 15, so you can preorder your book now and I hope you'll get a chance to read it. And let me know what you think at Dreamforce. And until then, I will look foresee you all of you in November. And now, over to Keith. Keith Block : Thanks Marc and thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. As Marc said, we have an incredible opportunity ahead as more and more companies invest in their digital transformation. Across every industry, every geography, they are turning to Salesforce as their trust advisor into our Customer 360 platform as the foundation and catalyst of their growth. That's clearly reflected in our Q2 numbers as we continue to see great result across our clouds, our industry solution and our region. The hundreds of customers that Marc and I meet with every quarter are looking for a vision and they're looking for strategy that will help them propel their growth and to get closer to their customers. They're asking us about the future of their industries. They are asking us about their peers, their competitors and how are they transforming. They're asking us about best practices from other industries. They're asking us most importantly about how to innovate. But it's not just about technology. They also want to learn about Salesforce culture and our values and how we can help them drive success with their customers, their partners and their employees. Now, throughout the quarter, we continue to build and strengthen our relationships with leading brands around the world. FedEx selected Salesforce in the quarter is the platforms for their customer service transformation. FedEx will use Service Cloud Einstein in their call centers to drive agent productivity with AI-powered recommendations in Einstein analytics to get a deeper understanding of their customers needs across their business. The Union Pacific Railroad system, one of the world's largest transportation companies chose Salesforce as its unified CRM platform to deliver faster, more proactive service. Now that includes automated shipping notifications and tracking updates, so customers can plan better and improve their shipping experience, very important. Airbnb turned to Salesforce to power its global messaging program. Airbnb expanded with Marketing Cloud that continue to deliver meaningful hyper personalized communications with its community of guests, hosts and travelers engaging with all Airbnb users across the globe on a single platform. And we continue to expand our relationship with Marriott, one of the world's great companies which is using Salesforce to better anticipate each guest travel needs and display relevant offers during that stay and provide a more personalized customer experience. Now, in May we have announced Einstein Analytics for financial services giving wealth advisors, managers and retail bankers that AI-powered insights they need to better serve customers and grow their book of business. Our momentum in financial services continues. We expanded our relationship with HSBC and form the new relationship with Unicredit in Italy in the quarter. In the public sector, the U.S. federal government increased its Salesforce investment including the Bureau of Land Management, the USDA and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. A critical part of customer service for many of our customers is also field service. It is incredibly strategic to their operations and differentiates them, and that's why as of Q2, Field Service Lightning is growing at nearly 100% year-over-year. Now in the quarter FOX Sports chose Field Service Lightning to manage production workflows, employees, equipment, facilities, rentals and more for its live broadcast. And with our recent agreement to acquire Click Software we'll be able to deliver even greater field service innovation to our customer, so that's very, very exciting. Our international revenue growth continued in the quarter, super strong with EMEA growing at 30% ,APAC growing at 27% year-over-year both in constant currency, AXA , one of the largest insurance companies in the world is on a journey to a global 360 degree view of every customer and in the quarter they made a number of strategic investments across several divisions including deploying service filed to give their insurance agents the complete view of every customer enabling them to have smarter or personalized conversation. In EMEA, we form new relationships with HDM in Germany, the largest global manufacturer of offset printing press and fashion retail organization Esprit, both choosing Commerce Cloud in the quarter. In Australia we expanded with ANZ Bank [ph] and form new relationships with Ramsay Health Care and the Australian Department of Environment and Energy. In Japan, we expanded with Hitachi and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance. Our partners very critical to our strategy continue to help us deliver customer success. In Q2 partners were engaged in 68% of our new business. And these partners continue to invest in their Salesforce practices. Global partner certifications are up 40% year-over-year. That just keeps going and going and going. All seven of our top consulting partners run their practices on Salesforce, and Salesforce is their fastest growing enterprise practice. Strategic partnerships are absolutely critical to our future and that's why we're thrilled about our new relationship with Alibaba, as a global company it is important for us to support our multinational customers wherever they do business. And finally, we close our acquisition of Salesforce.org in the quarter and we continue to seek incredible demand in the non-profit and education verticals. We work with more than 44,000 non-profit and higher education customers and our employees have given more than 4.3 million volunteer hours and we delivered nearly $300 million in grants which is pretty amazing. Last quarter, I mentioned making investments to fill the next chapter of our growth around the world. Now part of that investment is bringing incredible talents into the company and we've been very fortunate at two extraordinary executives at EMEA and APAC to our international leadership team. Later this fall, Jayne-Anne Gadhia will become CEO for Salesforce U.K. and Ireland and Pip Marlow will be joining us as CEO for Salesforce Australia and New Zealand and we're very excited to have both on board. They are both great executives. And on closing, I'd like to thank our employees, our partners and our customers around the world for their support and of course our company's great execution, so thanks to everybody. And now, I'll hand this off to Mark Hawkins. Mark Hawkins : Well, thanks, Keith. As you've heard we delivered strong results in the second quarter, including generating durable organic revenue growth and organic operating margin expansion year-over-year. Here are few highlights. Total revenue grew 22% in dollars and 23% in constant currency. Excluding Salesforce.org total revenue grew 20% in dollars and 21% in constant currency. cRPO grew 23% in dollars and 25% in constant currency and we continue to put up solid organic revenue growth across each of our clouds and in our geographies. There are few moving parts here for Q2 results, so let me take you through some of the additional details starting with revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter was $3.997 billion including $54 million of acquisition of Salesforce.org. Just as we saw in Q1, we continue to experience FX headwinds to revenue in the second quarter of approximately $34 million year-over-year and approximately $20 million sequentially. Looking at the drivers of growth by cloud, we continue to see strong subscription and support revenue growth year-over-year with sales cloud growth of 13%, service cloud growth of 22%, marketing and commerce cloud growth of 36%, and platform and other 28% which probably includes $159 million of MuleSoft, approximately 54% of MuleSoft subscription and support revenue is treated as term license. Let me call out a few other items related to the various cloud growth rates in the quarter. First, the FX headwind of a total -- for total revenue that I mentioned earlier, represents approximately one percentage point of growth year-over-year, and that affected each of our clouds on a similar proportional basis. Second, our acquisition of Salesforce.org represented approximately one to two percentage points of growth year-over-year across each of our clouds. Third, this was the first quarter of a normalized year-over-year compelling MuleSoft. So where MuleSoft now on the base period, the rate of growth of platform and other moderated in Q1 to Q2 as expected. Adjusted for these items, we are very pleased to deliver robust organic constant currency revenue growth across each of our clouds in Q2. Attrition also remain healthy in Q2 as we have seen over the past several quarters, with dollar attrition continuing to decline modestly year-over-year remaining below 10%. Turning to operating margin, Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 14.3%, down 349 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder our Q2 operating margin EPS results were affected by the settlement of our reseller agreement with Salesforce.org. This one time non-cash accounting charge of $166 million is reported as a discrete line item on statement of the income and was slightly lower than we anticipated. We continue with our efforts to improve our operating efficiencies and we're pleased to deliver Q2 non-GAAP operating margin improvement excluding the Salesforce.org non-cash accounting charge of approximately 66 basis points year-over-year. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.11 and non-GAAP was $0.66. In Q2 below the line mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS in the second quarter by approximately $0.10 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.11, business outperformance in the quarter ,along with a lower than anticipated salesforce.org settlement charge benefited GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.08. Turning to cash flow. Second quarter operating cash flow was $436 million, down 5% year-over-year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was impacted by a recent M&A activity as well as continued FX headwind. On a trailing 12 month basis, we're pleased to deliver operating cash flow of 25%. CapEx for the quarter was $178 million, leading to free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of $258 million down 10% over last year. On a trailing 12-month basis we're pleased to deliver free cash flow growth of 26%. Remaining performance obligation ended the second quarter approximately $25.3 billion, up 20% versus last year. Current RPO which is approximately $12.1 billion was up 23% year-over-year and on a constant currency basis was up 25%. Salesforce.org contributed approximately $200 million to this amount. Now turning to Q3 and FY 2020 guidance. We're pleased to be raising our full year FY 2020 revenue to $16.75 billion to $16.90 billion for full year growth of approximately 26% to 27%. This guidance includes approximately $550 million to $600 million in revenue from our acquisition of Tableau. Approximately $200 million in revenue from the acquisition of Salesforce.org and approximately $25 million in revenue from Click Software, excluding these acquired businesses we expect top line revenue growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year. This outlook reflects approximately $200 million in FX headwind for the full year. Turning to our outlook for operating margins we now expect FY 2020 non-GAAP operating margins to be down approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Our FY 2020 non-GAAP operating margin guide is the result of several factors. First, is the one time non-cash settlement charge of $166 million related to Salesforce.org reseller agreement. Second, is the blended margin profile of the recently acquired businesses namely Salesforce.org and Tableau, which we'd anticipate at roughly break even non-cash margins for FY 2020 inclusive of the purchase accounting. And Click Software which is modestly diluted along with the associated transaction cost. In fact, excluding the impact of these acquisitions this year, we expect our FY 2020 non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year to be more than 150 basis points, which is higher than the improvement we've initially laid out at the beginning of the year. For EPS we're updating our FY 2020 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.28 to $0.30 and our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.82 to $2.84. For operating cash flow, we're pleased to be maintaining our FY 2020 operating cash flow guidance of 21% to 22% despite the increased expenses from recent M&A and the cash impact of FX headwinds. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.44 billion to $4.45 billion or 31% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes revenue of approximately $300 million from Tableau and approximately $75 million from Salesforce.org. We also expect Q3 GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.21 to $0.20 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.65 to $0.66. We expect cRPO growth of approximately 24% to 25% year-over-year in the third quarter. This guidance assumes around two points of growth from Salesforce.org and two to three points of growth from Tableau. Click Software does not have a material impact on the cRPO growth and excluding this acquired cRPO, we anticipate that our cRPO growth would be approximately 20% year-over-year. Lastly, regarding our long term FY 2023 revenue target, we continue to be on track for this and to achieve our long term revenue goals on an organic basis. And as previously discussed we plan to update these targets factoring in recent acquisitions during our annual Analyst Day at Dreamforce in November. To close, we delivered another strong quarter of durable revenue growth and organic margin expansion. We continue to invest to foolproof -- future proof our technology and scale of our business globally. And I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders for your continued support. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Mark Murphy : Yes. Thank you very much. Congrats on a superb quarter. Marc, I wanted to ask you, we're witnessing such a bifurcation in the retailer's results this year. We've seen companies like Target and Wal-Mart and Home Depot doing well. And at the same time it seems like the Amazon is hurting some of the others whether it would be Sears or Barneys or Nordstrom or the GAP or others. I'm wondering if you're finding the retailers that adopted Demandware are actually competing better. And then, and just -- is this retail apocalypse kind of causing companies in other industries Q1 to adopt Salesforce a little faster so that they don't get Amazon or uberized? Marc Benioff : Well thanks so much for that question. I'll tell you that I think that we are rapidly heading towards this Fourth Industrial Revolution and that this digital transformation is hitting every industry, and retail certainly is one of the major industries that is really been taken the stand and deliver, and you are seeing a bifurcating between those organizations who are ready for this transformation and those who aren't. But it includes not just the ability to have a strong digital presence but also being able to understand what your strength is in regards to your physical presence and making those to work together in a synergistic way. Well, that is where the magic is for many of the organizations that you mentioned. I work with a lot of those CEOs personally and I can tell you that they've done a tremendous job. You mentioned Target, I mean you just have to go in and see what they've done online is matched as well as what they've done in the physical store. I think that that's kind of an indication of where the future is going. You didn't see of course Amazon moving into the physical world as well. We've seen tremendous success with our own e-commerce platform. We're very excited with Demandware. And some of the customers that we've seen on that platform have really just trounced their competitors. Of course there's a lot of good examples; Adidas [ph] is one, but there's so many others. And every one of these companies needs a strong platform like Demandware, but I'll tell you it's more than that, it means that they have a real Customer 360 because once that customer actually gets to the store you want to know everything about them in terms of a 360 experience. And we have a number of luxury retailers some that I can mention by name, but honestly a lot of them, so I just cannot by their own request who have done a tremendous job of integrating their digital experience and their physical experience. And when you walk into one of their stores they say, hey did you know we have this new capability or that new capability where you purchase something and in this product line and it's made a big difference for them. So you're 100% right that transformation in retail is underway and we're excited to offer that Customer 360 vision to the top retailers, so that they can offer whether it's in sales or service or as you mentioned e-commerce or marketing or app development or so many other things the ability to be competitive. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you so much. I mean, Marc you've been one of the most strategic visionaries in the software market over the last two decades. And obviously you built one of the biggest cloud companies to-date through a combination of internal R&D and M&A and I guess that's where my questions would lie. Can you share with us your vision for M&A as you look ahead and how you think especially now that you've kind of gotten into the on-premise market as well? How you think about the marriage of the cloud footprint and the on-premise footprint? And I guess the other question that we get asked a lot about and I'm sure others do on the line is, how do you think about the margin tradeoff that come with that bigger TAM? And given Mark Hawkins talked about it on the call, the fiscal 2023 target there -- are there any thoughts of maybe ever adding a margin target to the [Indiscernible] inorganic number? So I guess that's where my focus is. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks Heather and I'll let Mark directly addressed the issues of guidance. But I'll tell you that, the way we look at it is innovation is happening everywhere and we have tremendous innovation happen been in the Salesforce, and that's been so important for us over the last 21 years. But we're also in all of -- a lot of other innovation that's happening outside of our company and we've been fortunate to have a big enough view of innovation that it's motivated us to be one of the most innovative companies in the world because we were the hardest both organic and inorganic innovation I think in a really positive way. And I have to also thank our customers because a lot of the ideas that we've created whether it's software we've \u2013 software we've built or companies we've bought it's really been driven by those customers. I mean a great example just tying back to the last call is Demandware, one of those luxury retailers is based in Paris. I was having a meeting with them, and they took me aside and they said the company that you should acquire is Demandware and here's why. They had already moved to Salesforce and other services and -- but they had a gap in their Customer 360 and they wanted our ability to be able to connect Demandware into what we were doing so that they could have, be more competitive themselves. And that has turned out to be really great for them and augment our vision of what CRM is and also being able to execute our Customer 360 vision. I think that when I look out and I just was thinking about conversations that I had today, we're really at a moment in time where these top CEOs in the world all realize not only do their digital transformation has to be under way, their customer experience has to be first. And I'll let Marc to answer the rest of the question. Mark Hawkins : Sure. Thank you, Marc, and thank you Heather for the question. We certainly highly prize the operating margin expansion. It's something that's very important to us. Over time as you can see over the last several years we've been expanding that. We do make tradeoffs between our organic growth and margin. The tradeoffs are something that we always look at when we look at this opportunity to serve the customer. We have been making considerable progress over the years, but we know there's more work to be done and that's something that we're always thinking about and trying to focus on constantly improving. We're certainly going to be talking about that in February when we give out our operating margin targets. And I hear your point about exploring beyond one year, but certainly we'll be talking about the operating margin in February. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from a line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. I'd like to first applaud the company for the tremendous amount of clarity and the straightforwardness of how you report your financials such as the organic versus the acquired currency impact. You go through excruciating detail to make it abundantly clear how your core business is doing particularly the fact that margins are projected to grow excluding the acquisitions more than you anticipated. So I just want to give you a round of applause on the clarity and straightforwardness of the disclosure. Now the question for you Marc as you move ahead you're targeting a $28 plus million revenue company with the diversity of end markets that we've just simply not seen in software, the prior analogs and the on-prem with this SAP or Oracle. Just didn't quite have the diversity of end markets that Salesforce.com is pursuing. So as you plan to roughly doubled revenues, how does that go-to-market nature of how you're going. How does the go to market strategy evolved as you attacked a breadth and complexity of markets that the world has simply just not seen, and there's no recipe to follow? Marc Benioff : Well, let me fill in some of it, but then also let me ask Keith really to fill in the rest. I think you said it really well which is that we've worked really hard to build this Customer 360 platform. It's taken us 21 years and it turns out, this is exactly what customers want and really need to be competitive in today's world. And as we go to now execute and deliver that, we are focused on how do we do that by region, by country where we're really looking at how we're doing that by segment, it's extremely important. And I think that for us certainly we started just with Salesforce automation. That was our kind of soul app if you will. But it was it was clear from a focus with customers that if we're going to continue to build serve them we had to get to customer \u2013 to Customer 360. So, Bret maybe you also want to add to that and then Keith I think maybe it'd be great if you filled in on the go-to-market as well. Bret Taylor : Yes. I think Marc, you put it well, which is as we think about our value proposition, it spans a lot of different markets, but it's all under this umbrella of digital transformation. And I think the defining characteristic of companies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the things driving the digital investment is customer experience. Customers are demanding that their interact with these companies in new ways. And that does span the entire portfolio. The question that came up earlier about Demandware and commerce, its a lot more than that. When you think about what it defines your retail experience, it's about customer service, it's about buying online and picking up in-store, its about merging the physical and the digital. It's about how you get recommendations and marketing after you've purchased something. And so when I look at our portfolio, it spans wide breadth of functionality. But when I talk to the CEOs of all the major companies in the world that's what they need to transform is all of the above. And when they fragment their customer experience by thinking of them as separate categories or silos they can't actually achieve the vision of the digital native companies that you mentioned before. So, I think our breath is an asset when we go into these conversations with our customers because I think we can provide a more complete vision for their digital transformation than any other company. Keith Block : Yes. And listen, on their go-to-market side, we made a conscious decision over the last few years to really focus on three things. One is how do you take an international company and turn it into a global company. And there is a large difference between being an international company and being a global company, a lot of that is around culture behavior and how you solve customer problems. The second was really a movement towards selling solutions and speaking the language of the customer and understanding an industry. And just to give you an example of that, in two weeks, I have to go to New York which I'm very, very happy about to address the board of one of the -- I would say the most prestigious retailers in North America. I talk about the future of retail. A couple weeks ago I had dinner with the CEO of a different company, although same industry, but it's one of the largest retailers in the world and they want to talk about how our Customer 360 platform can help them drive growth and optimize customer experience. So being able to understand the industry and enabling our field organizations and our entire company on understanding an industry and being able to solve the customer problem is a huge part of it. The third piece of this is moving from a partner ecosystem to a strategic ecosystem. And part of our ecosystem is really encompassing with our classic firms that we do business with like the Accentures, and the PWCs and the Deloitte to the world who are just well processed, but how do we extend that community to drive success for our customers everywhere in the world. And that's why we formed partnerships with companies like Alibaba because we have the service companies all over the world, we have global operations, again I mentioned the word global. It also means that we continue to invest in this Trailblazer community, where we want millions of people who evangelize and architect solutions that drive success for our customers. And then the final component which I mentioned on the call is talent. We are fortunate enough because of our culture and the type of company and our values to be a destination company for talent. And we have attracted some amazing people whose careers we continue to grow, who are very focused on customer success, as well as these other folks like we talked about with the Jayne-Ann Gadhia, for example who's going to be running the U.K. eye for us. And having those executives, having that talent in place who are passionate about customer success and driving solutions really makes us I think a very, very unique company and that's why you see the success. And that's why we're optimistic about the future. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. Question for Mark Hawkins or for Keith Block. I think it's been a couple of years back, you gave a framework around cost to serve on Dreamforce Analyst Day. And I'm wondering you are talking about seeing really good underlying margin progression in the business ex-acquisition. Could you update us on into those two drivers where you're seeing the margin improvement which \u2013 it's a little bit harder for us to tell given the acquisition influence on each of the OpEx and cost of revenue line items, that'll be helpful? Mark Hawkins : Sure. Well, first of all, thank you Walter and I'm happy to do that. I think the thing that we are making progress on right now is in the area of gross margin. You'll take note, we've been investing for quite some time to get more scale and capability there and we're pleased to see some progress on that. We're getting also progress in our G&A areas as we look to make G&A more efficient as we scale up the company. That's certainly an area that we're making progress as well. We have a great initiative. I think our team driving even customer success there in it to really help deliver an even better performance while also scaling. And I think these are some of the areas in the cost in particular that we're doing. And Walter, I would add just one additional point in an area of cost to book, that's always a choice, it's always a tradeoff. And we just had a great market opportunity in front of us to serve our customer. And we're obviously investing there but always looking for progress as well. But those other areas are the key areas that we're focused on. Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thank you. Mark Hawkins : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted just Keith Block opinion on or perspective on potential synergies from the recent acquisitions particularly Tableau, given the success you guys have seen with MuleSoft over the past year, where should we expect sort of the biggest synergies? What are you most excited about in terms of adding Tableau, and may we can put Click Software into there as well into the portfolio as we look over the next year? And then one for Mark Hawkins, can you repeat the Tableau guidance again in terms of what the full year contribution is and what the Q3 contribution is. Because it seems like it implies like a smaller Q4 than Q3. I want to make sure I have those numbers right? Marc Benioff : Let me address \u2013 hi, Keith. Let me address the first part of this and then I'll ask Mark Hawkins to comment as well. So look, we're incredibly excited about Tableau. It's a great company, a set of great products. It's got an incredible development community. It's got a great executive team and customers love their products. As far as Click Software and I'll let Mark talk about Tableau in a second, but as far as Click Software, we're very, very excited about the Click Software acquisition. As you may know Field Service is incredibly strategic to a number of industries such as utilities, telecommunications, equipment manufacturers and we have a very strong product in Field Service Lightning. And the combination of Field Service Lightning which grew 100% by the way year-over-year in the quarter and Click Software is very, very compelling. So that's a great example of marrying innovation organically and inorganically. So we're super excited about that. And Mark I know you have some comments specifically on the Tableau. Mark Hawkins : Yes. I do in fact. And let me take the numbers first and we'll talk about the synergy secondly. First of all, Keith I just want to call off for the year as it relates to Tableau we're anticipating $550 million to $600 million contribution for the year, and of course that's not of the DRE [ph] write-down, number one. Number two; for the quarter for Tableau I just want to reiterate that we're looking at $300 million and the Q3 time period again net the DRE write-down. That's the first part of your question. The second part of your question has to do with synergies. And I just would call out and say that look, we're incredibly excited, but as discussed at the beginning of the call, we're running the companies separately right now as operating independently. Right now, it's an incredible company with a fantastic product and leadership team. We're so pleased about that and so excited about that. But let me take a step back and address the spirit of your question. We have a tremendous history with acquisitions of complementing organic innovation and being able to make progress in that way. And when we do M&A, we're always looking for opportunities to make these companies even better and have even greater success for our customers, which is what it's all about at the end of the day. So I've never been more excited about our ability to create more success for our customers that with the strategy, that's what I would say. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter. My question might be for either Keith or Marc Benioff. I was wondering if you could just talk about Europe a little bit. It's obviously been a real source of strength through you over the last few quarters. Just where is the market. I think broadly just in terms of adoption and thinking about things like Customer 360 it seems like it's hitting a little bit of an inflection point and we just love your thoughts on that? Thanks. Keith Block : Yes. So, Marc and I have actually been flying around the world quite a bit. I spent about a four-week trip where I was in Japan. I was in the United States I was in Canada. I was in the U.K. and Switzerland and France and Italy and meeting with CEOs from various industries in those geographies. You can see from the results EMEA continues to be very, very strong for us with 30% growth in the quarter. And just go back to the UniCredit situation that I mentioned in the earnings call. This is a very strong bank in Italy. I think we're all aware of the situation that's going on in Italy from a macro perspective, from a government perspective. But the CEO of UniCredit is really betting the future of UniCredit around Customer 360 initiative and the experience for his customers that he wants and how he wants to transform that bank. And that is the same conversation that is going on in every industry. I was in Paris meeting with one of the largest bank\u2019s CEOs in the world. You know the Barclays story that we have in the U.K. We have industrial manufacturers in Germany automotive manufacturers who are trying to improve the customer experience and driving 360 degree. So the one thing that is very, very clear to me is that whatever is going on around the world we see a buying environment. We see CEOs investing. And top of mind for them is digital transformation, which begins and ends with the customer. And that's why they're talking to us and that's why you're seeing these results. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from our Richard Davis with Canaccord. Your line is now open. Richard Davis : Hey, thanks. So, maybe a technology question. So, I saw that you guys at Gartner ranked you guys, Salesforce as a leader in low-code and in addition you're doing really well in Decision Support with Einstein. And then the other third area that's really hot these days is this whole robotic process automation. So the question I have you maybe for Marc is because you're you think about these things is you know how do you see Salesforce participating in each of those three markets, because it sure seems to me that those three technologies are going to have to work closer with each other over time because they just feel like they're going to intersect and so how does Salesforce position itself for that kind of next wave of those three things kind of connecting with each other? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, I'm going to actually ask Bret to answer that question. I mean I think it's perfectly set up for him to deliver, so Bret you want to hit it. Bret Taylor : Yes, absolutely. This is really our vision for the Customer 360 platform, which is a platform that works together with all these technology that's accessible to all of our Trailblazers. And when we talk a lot about Trailhead and we talk about this vision of low-code, that's what we mean. There is 1.5 million people are earning 15 million badges, are learning how to apply these advanced technologies and the technologies you mentioned in the first half of this year alone the capabilities had this platform are incredible. We added the Salesforce Blockchain. We added Salesforce Maps. We added Einstein translation, Einstein Voice, Einstein Vision. We have all these capabilities and they're accessible to everyone on our platform in a low-code way. And what that means for our customers is it's easy for them to leverage these technologies to improve their customer experience. And all those technologies you mentioned the challenges that we hear in the market is these customers are excited about these new technologies and what they could do for their customer experience. But it's often cost prohibitive or too complex to do so. And that's the value they see in our Customer 360 platform. That's why as Marc mentioned Salesforce is the number two most appealing job according to GlassDoor. In the first half of this year alone over 72,000 new job postings for Salesforce jobs were posted on just the top two job sites. You're seeing the draw of this platform and you're seeing how empowering it is for \u2013 I think anyone in the world can become a Salesforce developer. You could if you go on fill out after this call. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Thanks so much and congrats again on a fantastic quarter. I'll throw this question out up for grabs and it's really just to dig in a little bit deeper on Service Cloud with the re-acceleration this quarter, just wondering if you could help unpack that a little bit. You called out Field Service Lightning strength in your prepared remarks, but I'd love to hear any additional color in terms of competition win rates and also how you see the products coming together with ClickSoftware coming into the fold? Thanks. Mark Hawkins : So, why don't I take that and then I think Bret will want to weigh-in as well from the product strategy perspective. This way the digital transformation is really fueled by so many things that is the foundation of it is the 360 degree view of the customer and each of the elements of that 360 degree view of the customer important whether it's relative to the use case and the problem that you're trying to solve whether it's sales or service or marketing or commerce. And service is just very powerful. If you look at companies in a variety of industries they like to differentiate themselves by service and customer experience is a big component of that. And field service is a big component of that. So as we talk to these executives about the future of growth you can't have growth without the great customer experience and that starts with service. So Bret, I'm sure you want to add to that as well. Bret Taylor : Yes. I'll add to \u2013 I do think our customers are driving us here because service defines their brand. But I also think it shows the power of this Customer 360 platform because all of these fundamental technology innovations we're investing in really I think benefits service in an unique way. Obviously, with Einstein bots enabled customers to deploy frontline support using AI. This past quarter, we added Einstein case routing, so we can route support cases that people have the best skill to provide the best customer experience at the right time. You saw the growth in field service which we are really proud of. It really shows how our investment in maps and geo location and mobility are all sort of converging to enable these customers to provide the right support to the right customers wherever they happen to be. And so I really want to say that this is really what I view as the power of the platform. We're doing so much leverage from our technology investments to enable the experience that Keith talked about. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is now open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. I wanted to circle back on some of the discussion earlier about going from international company to a global company and the addition of CEOs in a couple of particularly strategic markets? And I'm curious as you add that role what sort of the mandate there? What do you view as sort of core competencies that need to start by global leadership versus providing regional leadership with the flexibility to make the changes or run the business in a way that they see as most appropriate on the ground in that market? Mark Hawkins : Well, Jennifer, one of the important things of being a global company is to be able to think globally and think strategically and act locally. And we want to empower our leaders in the field so that they can make decisions on behalf of the customers in front of the customers. There's an expression that says, the best decisions are not made in the office. They are made out in the field. And by hiring these senior executives and cultivating and growing our other executives inside the company so that they're empowered to make these decisions. We think this is a perfect way to skill [ph] a company. With respect to being a global company versus an international company, kind of the key tenant of being a global is that you act the same, you behave the same, you execute the same no matter where you are all over the world, whether it is with one or many customers. And as we bring in these senior executives, we're augmenting and enhancing an already incredible management team. So we're super excited about these adds and challenges and important strategy for the future. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session for today. I'll now hand the call back over the company for any closing comments or remarks. Marc Benioff : Thanks everybody for participating in the call today. And I specially want to thank all of our Ohana who just did a fantastic job this quarter and we couldn't be more pleased with the outcome, and John. John Cummings : Yes. Thanks so much. Thanks so much Marc. And thanks for everyone for joining us today. As Marc reminded everyone, go ahead and register for Dreamforce. We look forward to seeing many of you there at our Annual Analyst Day. And we'll look forward to giving you an update on our results in Q3. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.",

And with that, let me turn the call over to Marc Benioff. Marc Benioff : Very good, thanks everyone, and good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our fiscal 2020 third quarter results conference call. I am delighted to be with you, and thanks John. John is with Keith Block and they are in Phoenix, and we are here in San Francisco at the top of Salesforce Tower. It's been just two weeks since I saw most of you at Dreamforce, and I hope you have all had an amazing time. I'm thrilled to share that our Q3 results were outstanding, revenue rose to $4.5 billion, up 34% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with more than $25.9 billion and total remaining performance obligation up 22% versus last year. As we announced a couple of weeks ago, we've raised our full year fiscal year revenue guidance to $17 billion, at the high end of the range. That represents 28% growth for the year. We also initiated fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance of $20.9 billion at the high end of the range or approximately 23% growth for the year. What's more significant and extremely exciting to me is that we are also intended to double the company by fiscal year 2024, with a revenue target of $34 billion to $35 billion, making us the fastest enterprise software company to reach that milestone. It's really incredible, and it's really exciting for all of our Ohana.  And as we continue to deliver record revenue year in and year out, we continue to -- we committed -- we are committed to balancing this growth with incremental operating margin. This growth is driven by the success of our incredible customers. Companies are coming to Salesforce for transformation because every digital transformation starts and ends with the customer. That's why for the sixth year in a row, Salesforce is the number one CRM. Provider by market share according to the latest IDC worldwide semi-annual software tracker, we're the leading trusted solution in sales, service, marketing, and model driven application platforms. And at MuleSoft and Tableau, we have the leading solutions and data integration and now analytics, two extremely valuable components of every digital transformation and two very valuable components at every one of our customers\u2019 strategic information technology architecture. Every company needs an intelligent 360-degree view of their customer and that's the power of Customer 360. Our vision for bringing companies and their customers together, you saw this at Dreamforce with companies like State Farm and MG and Louis Vuitton. Now they can personalize every customer experience, they can predict customer behavior and anticipate their needs. They can build modern mobile apps fast on any device. The magic in Customer 360 is now Customer 360 Truth, which we unveiled at Dreamforce. It connects all the data from across sales, service, marketing, commerce, our entire Customer 360 to build an integrated, single source of truth. We're giving companies a complete view of every customer making it possible to deliver highly personalized, highly intelligent, and highly connected experiences across every customer touch point, and it's built right into the Salesforce platform. This is what our customers have been asking for and we're making it available to every one of them. No other company could do this. And by bringing all of this data together at Salesforce, we can apply our powerful analytics solutions, Tableau, Einstein, Datorama and others that allow anyone inside a company to see and understand their data to make smarter decisions. We know this data is not just in Salesforce, we know our customers have many platforms. That's why we're open and why we work with all of our strategic partners; IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, HP, Dell, and many others. Because it's critical for us to work with these strategic partners to deliver a working, incredible solution for our customers. That\u2019s what our customers want. These partnerships continue to deliver incredible innovation and success. We're doing all of this at tremendous scale. Just look at how Customer 360 fueled our customers\u2019 growth during Cyber Week. Commerce Cloud processed more than 30 million orders, up 27% year-over-year, amazing. It also powered more than 614 million retail site visits, up 17% year-over-year also incredible. Digital sales on Commerce Cloud were up 13%, Marketing Cloud delivered more than 24 billion emails during Cyber Week up 18% and Service Cloud processed more than 428 million agent interactions during this critical time for our customers. We also saw 9% of digital orders during Cyber Week, driven by our Einstein product recommendations that is incredible to see the velocity of Einstein and with the new Einstein voice skills, any company can build their custom voice powered Salesforce apps giving employee a personalized CRM guide. At Dreamforce, we showed you an Einstein speaker, demonstrating how Einstein can work on any smart speaker, and now you can ask your speaker, Hey Einstein, what's my forecast, and Einstein will tell you whether or not you're going to make your numbers for the quarter. At the heart of the Customer 360 is our incredible community of trailblazers. We now have 1.8 million learners changing their careers and lives on Trailhead, and free online learning platform. That's because Salesforce ecosystem will contribute 4.2 million jobs, and $1.2 trillion in new business revenues worldwide from 2019 through 2024. We continue to invest in Trailhead to enable more people to participate in the digital economy. Before handing off to Keith, I want to take a moment and remember our loving friend and Board member Bernard Tyson. We dedicated Dreamforce to Bernard\u2019s memories. Bernard did so much for others and for the world. He was one of the greatest CEOs, but he was a very close friend of mine, and it's very sad to see him leave us. We have incredible gratitude for Bernard's incredible contributions to the Salesforce Board, as well as to the World Economic Forum, to the healthcare industry, and the Kaiser, we will miss him dearly. Now over to Keith. Keith Block : Thanks, Mark. Hello, everybody. I want to echo Mark's comments on Bernard. He was an incredible CEO, a great community leader and as Mark said, a close friend of many of us at Salesforce. So we're all going to miss him and our heart certainly go out to his family.  Now, as you just heard from Mark, we had another great quarter, and really an amazing Dreamforce last month, and is really just a few short weeks ago. You saw that we continue to innovate harnessing the power of cloud and social and mobile and AI and voice and other amazing technologies to fuel customer growth and success. During the quarter in at Dreamforce Mark and I met with hundreds of CEOs and they clearly understand that the speed of innovation is increasing and that digital transformation is absolutely an imperative. All companies want to become more customer centric, they want to deliver experiences that exceed expectations. And that's why more and more companies across every industry and geography are making major sustained in the Salesforce. But they're turning to Salesforce for more than just our technology, they're also coming to us as their trusted advisor. And together, we are absolutely reorienting their businesses around the customer. We're working with them on all three pillars of digital transformation, technology, business model, and culture. And we're helping them break down silos, liberate their data and remove legacy obstacles. These three pillars are absolutely essential to achieving a 360 degree view of each customer, every customer and that is the holy grail of digital transformation. And as you saw this quarter, we continue to build and expand relationships with leading brands across industries, and geographies. We expanded with nationwide. Now historically, most touch points with nationwide customers and wealth managers happen on the phone. Now they're expanding with Salesforce to take advantage of the digital channels to provide a more consistent, personalized experience for customers. Carmax the largest dealer of pre-owned vehicles in the United States expanded with us in the quarter as well, with Salesforce reps will have a 360 degree view of the customer, whether they're shopping online or in dealerships, and they ensure a seamless buying experience, Excel Energy, now Excel powers millions of homes and businesses across the United States. They expanded their use of Salesforce to deliver a unified experience for customers across all channels. And then there's Corteva, a global agriculture company focused on seed and crop production. They also expanded with us in the quarter to continue to modernize its business and better serve the farming community. As we discussed during our Analysts Day at Dreamforce the international expansion is one of our key growth levers and we continue to make investments across the world and see great results. In Q3, we grew 33% in the Americas, 28% in APAC and 42% in EMEA, all in constant currency. And that, of course, is with our recent acquisition of Tableau benefiting year-over-year growth in the Americas and EMEA. At EMEA expanded with Algae, a global provider of low carbon energy in services headquartered in France, that deliver a 360 degree view of customers\u2019 energy consumption, so they can provide a personalized set of recommendations and define these solutions to reduce carbon footprints. Siemens, one of the world's great brands, one of the largest industrial manufacturing companies in Europe also expanded with Salesforce in the quarter and we've been a strategic partner to Siemens as the 170 year old company addresses the digital revolution transformation in its industry. We also expand it with British Airways and food services company Sodexo, in an APAC, there was ANZ Bank, funding some super retail group. They also chose Salesforce in the quarter and we have wins with a Life Solutions Company, Panasonic Corporation, and EON in Japan.  And finally in Latin America, we had a win with Cera [ph] in Columbia, a leading insurance company. Speaking of the language of our customer that continues to propel our industry momentum and our success, and our customer success in the quarter we introduced two new industry clouds very proud of that innovation, manufacturing cloud and the consumer goods cloud. We also rolled out new insurance capabilities for our financial services cloud one of our most extensible clouds. We also had a number of strategic wins around the industries in Q3, Ameriprise Financial which manages more than $875 billion worth of assets. They expanded with FSC, financial services cloud, we also formed a new relationship with Farm Credit Services of America, which also chose financial services cloud. In healthcare, Children's Health, one of the largest pediatric providers in the nation chose Salesforce, including health cloud to help them reach more patients and provide even better care experiences. We continue to see significant opportunity in the public sector. In fact, two of our largest customers are U.S. government agencies. In the quarter we expanded our relationship with the United States Department of Veteran Affairs, enabling the agency to provide the highest level of service to 20 million veterans for a variety of programs. And this isn't just the business opportunity.  It's a moral obligation to better serve those who have served us. At Dreamforce we heard incredible and powerful and inspirational stories from our veterans and these are people who are transitioning from serving their nation to new careers in the Salesforce ecosystem. I truly believe that all of us should be focusing on hiring veterans. We also expanded our relationship with the state of Colorado, which is implementing MuleSoft to integrate Seven Health and human services agencies to give country -- excuse me, county workers a single view into key aspects of all these agencies to better engage and serve citizens. Our partners, they continue to help drive our growth as well. We have 20% more partner certified individuals year-over-year, our ISDN consulting partners have contributed more than 5,000 listings to the app exchange and that is with a 20% increase year-over-year in customer installs. Turning to integration, MuleSoft has been an incredibly successful acquisition, allowing our customers to unlock and unified data across their enterprises. A strategic to every conversation we've been having and adoption continues to accelerate. I see a very similar opportunity with Tableau. I spent some time with Adam, who is excellent, his management team is excellent and their entire team at the Tableau conference in Dreamforce last month, and I will tell you, I could see the tremendous impact Tableau is having on customers like Nissan and Morgan Stanley and Home Depot, and many, many others. We are just beginning this integration process, but we have clear synergies from a distribution, product development and cultural standpoint, and our customers are very, very excited and so are away. So in closing, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees for their trust and continued support. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark Hawkins : Well, thanks, Keith. We delivered another great quarter in Q3 with strong top line revenue growth on both the reported and organic basis, as well as strong operating cash flow growth. Here are a few highlights. Total revenue grew 33% in dollars and 34% in constant currency. Total revenue grew 21% in dollars and 22% in constant currency, excluding acquired revenue from Tableau and Salesforce.org. CRPO over 28% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. CRPO over 22% in dollars and 22% in constant currency, excluding the impact of acquired CRPO from Tableau and Salesforce.org. Let me take you through some of the details in the quarter starting with revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter was $4.513 billion, including approximately $327 million from Tableau, and $80 million from Salesforce.org. Just as we saw in Q1 and Q2, we continue to experience FX headwinds in revenue and in the third quarter of approximately $29 million year-over-year, and approximately $19 million sequentially. Looking at the drivers of growth by cloud, we continue to see strong subscription and support revenue growth, with year-over-year growth for sales cloud at 15%. Service cloud growth of 24%, marketing and cloud -- commerce cloud growth at 32% and platform and other at 73%. And as a reminder, our acquisition of Tableau added approximately $308 million to platform and other, while MuleSoft grew 77% year-over-year, contributing approximately $185 million to platforms and other. Lower attrition continue to support our growth in the third quarter with dollar attrition down modestly year-over-year, remaining below 10% and continuing the downward trend we have seen in the last several quarters. Turning to operating margins, Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.4% up 250 basis points year-over-year. Our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin reflects the timing of Dreamforce in Q3 last year versus Q4 this year, as well as the variations in the timing of sales and marketing other investments in the quarter. Q3 GAAP loss per share was $0.12 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.75. In Q3 below the line mark-to-market adjustments benefited the GAAP loss per share and the non-GAAP diluted EPS by approximately $0.01. In addition, business performance in the quarter including better than anticipated results from Tableau, as well as better than expected shares outstanding benefit GAAP loss per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS by approximately $0.08. Now turning to cash flow, third quarter operating cash flow was $298 million, up 108% year-over-year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was driven by one, the timing of collections due to a number of renewals, which occurred earlier than planned. And number two, cash contributions from Tableau in terms of operating cash. On a trailing 12-month basis, we were pleased to deliver operating cash flow growth of approximately 30%. CapEx for the quarter was 170 million, leading to a free cash flow which is defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of $128 million. On a trailing 12 month basis, we were pleased to deliver free cash flow growth of approximately 31%. Now remaining performance obligation ended the third quarter at approximately $25.9 billion, up 22% versus last year. Current RPO was approximately $12.8 billion, up 28% year-over-year. On a constant current basis, CRPO growth was up 28% year-over-year, Tableau and Salesforce.org contributed approximately $600 million to this amount. Now turning to guidance, as we discussed at our Analyst Day on November 20th, we're pleased to be raising our full-year FY20 to $16.99 billion to $17 billion for a full year revenue growth of approximately 28%, excluding top line and revenue contributions from Tableau of approximately $650 million and Salesforce.org of approximately $220 million we expect top line growth of approximately 21% year-over-year. This outlook reflects approximately $160 million in FX headwinds for the full year. Turning to our outlook for operating margins, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 16.6%, down roughly 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions this year, we continue to expect our FY20 non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year to be more than 150 basis points.  For EPS, we're updating our FY20 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.44 to $0.45 and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to $2.89 to $2.90. For operating cash flow we are pleased to be raising our FY20 operating cash flow growth guidance to 22% to 23% year-over-year. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.743 billion to $4.753 billion or 32% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes approximately $320 million from Tableau and approximately $80 million Salesforce.org. We also expect Q4 GAAP loss per share of $0.04 to $0.03 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.54 to $0.55. We expect CRPO growth of approximately 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This guidance assumes approximately 5 points of growth of recent acquisitions. Before I close, I'd like to provide some additional insight into our guidance for FY21. As you will have seen in our press release, we are also providing revenue guidance for Q1 of FY21 of $4.800 billion to $4.835 billion, up 28% to 29% year-over-year. We are providing this one-time guidance for Q1 of FY21 given the newly acquired businesses especially Tableau, which have more seasonal revenue profiles in the first quarter. To wrap-up, we delivered another quarter of strong top line organic and reported revenue growth, with continued organic margin progression and strong cash flow growth. I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for your continued support, and to wish you a wonderful holiday season and a Happy New Year. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Brent Bracelin from Piper Jaffray. Brent Bracelin : Great and thank you for taking my question. I guess the first one here, you're coming out of hundreds of customer conversations at Dreamforce. I was hoping you could just maybe rank order the top two or three Salesforce products where the customer appetite seems to be the highest to invest next year. Any color you could provide us on where customers are most excited from a product perspective would be very helpful. Thanks. Marc Benioff : Sure, I'm happy to take that, and then I\u2019d love to pass that on to Bret also. So, number one, I would say that, for me, Dreamforce is an amazing process. It's not the event that is the most impactful for me, I'm sure that is for everybody else, it's the conference that's extremely impactful. For me, it's the process coming up to it. Before Dreamforce, I had the opportunity to get on the road with my team. And we take the keynote out, and we meet with hundreds of customers. And in my case, I personally have the opportunity to have one-on-one conversations; and in this case I had conversations with almost 100 customers directly about Salesforce, their experience, what they're using in technology, where they're going with their business over and over again. This is the most important thing I do every single year is this deep work. And I have many of my key executives with me. What I was most focused on this year is of course, being able to present these incredible strategic changes that we've made to our business, especially MuleSoft, especially Tableau, but also to be able to communicate what our core strategy is in terms of Customer 360. And what I took away with it was that customers today view us at Salesforce as their trusted digital advisors and also look to us to help them have a clear vision of connecting with their customers. That's what Customer 360 is all about. It's really bifurcated. They're looking for a trusted advisor relationship in many times, as Keith mentioned, at the CEO level, but it's also at other parts of the organization, where there's been so much change in the industry they're looking for companies that they can rely on and bet on. On the second side, it was really Customer 360 that just was so amazing to me, that customers are really implementing Customer 360, but every customer can start at a different place. Sales, service, marketing, you probably noticed that one of the things that we focused on is the new Salesforce 360 Truth profile. This is the Holy Grail for me in computing the single source of truth. When customers saw this, the comments were, I'll paraphrase what a large financial service company in New York said to me. This is for us the single most important thing in our company, we need a single source of truth of our customer information that all of these apps can come together in a powerful way and deliver that single source of Truth. That is what customers were just amazed by.  And I have to take my hat off to my engineering team, because I didn't think it was really possible to see it all come together. Some of these products are organic, some of them are inorganic, but now that they are integrated and have a clear architecture and that they have the ability for the customer to have extreme value, that was incredible.  And then I have to add to that, and I think Keith touched on this. I definitely agree Tableau far exceeded my expectations from a customer reception, so many of our customers have Tableau, I could not believe it. And in many cases, because Tableau has been a much smaller company than we are, for example, they don't have a direct relationship with Tableau.  They don't have an executive relationship. The number of Chief Executive Officers, CIOs, who have directly come to me and my management team and ask us to go wall to wall with Tableau has far exceeded any expectation that we could have had. That combination of those three things; one, our trusted relationship with the customer; two, Customer 360 resolving in the Truth profile; and three, Tableau as a huge catalyst for growth. That to me is what I tried to then get on stage and present in the keynote. But I can tell you, that after talking to these hundreds of customers, now, both before Dreamforce and after this is a highly differentiated position in the industry.  No one else is working on this. Nobody has this vision. No one else is trying to help these customers solve this problem. We are in a very unique position with a highly stratified position of customers globally and by industry. So that's really my takeaway. I hope I answered it for you. I mean, it's been a very powerful several weeks for me, and it's also been an extremely emotional moment because I'm sure you know, the day before the keynote, I was at my -- one of my very closest friends Memorial. And then I came into that keynote, and I just felt all of those customers there and I went, Wow, this is just incredible what was happening. And I really tried to open myself up to really express what I had heard over those preceding few weeks that we are just in an unprecedented moment and in Salesforce\u2019s ability to execute for our customers' needs. And Bret, do you want to fill in the details? I'd love for you to talk about how you practice. Bret Taylor : Yeah. As Marc said, it's really transitioning from being about clouds to being around this Customer 360, the single source of truth. And it's really about not just selling a product to our customers, but really helping them digitally transform their business around their customers. And the single source of truth means that\u2019s easier than ever for our customers to go from being a sales customer to be in sales and service or being a service customer to be in service and commerce and marketing. And you're seeing this I think particularly in the Cyber Monday statistics, which we're really proud of. I also want to highlight though really our main differentiator, which is Einstein our AI capabilities are coming through stronger than ever. I heard that from every single customer that Marc and I talked to and Keith and I talked to on that road show before Dreamforce. There was 24 billion messages we sent over Cyber Week, there was 32 million orders. They're all being personalized. As Marc mentioned, over 10% of those orders are being driven by Einstein recommendation. We're doing over 10 billion predictions per day to personalize every single one of those email engagements that are personal to the person receiving them. And in the innovation that we highlighted in the keynote, really Einstein came through really strongly across this Customer 360 I think in a really differentiated way. With our Sales Cloud, we introduced Einstein Call Coaching to help telesales teams through the power of Einstein automatically coach every sales representative to become like the best sales representative. In marketing, we introduced interactive email. I think bringing one of the most tried to digital marketing mechanisms, really into the next century with some amazing new capabilities. Even in our industry's portfolio that consumer goods cloud that Keith talked about really proud of that. Einstein Vision is a key part of it enable every consumer goods company in the retail execution to use Einstein Vision to make sure their products are placed in the right place on the shelves with all the retail partners. So I really want to highlight I think we have transitioned Einstein from being this vision to every customer adopting it really being a key differentiated part of this Customer 360 vision. Marc Benioff : Now Bret before your narrative, I just have to ask you the same question that I got asked which was before Dreamforce, you were also on the road with me and you did even -- I think, you did even additional two or three major focus groups. So you've been in front of hundreds of customers as well. What was your biggest surprise talking to them and rolling all of this technology and vision out and demonstration over the last month? Bret Taylor : I think the biggest prize for me was just how much of this Customer 360 single source of truth resonated. In fact, that phrase single source of truth came from our customers. They were describing their challenges and their digital transformation, as breaking down the silos of their company. Their silos come in the form of technology, their data is siloed across a number of different systems. They're also organizational silos.  So different departments that previously operated with autonomy now need to come together to produce this single, seamless customer experience. It's why I think our strategy is really focused on that singular vision. We want to bring all that data together technically, with the power of MuleSoft, we want to enable people to see and understand that data with Tableau and we want to enable people to personalize every aspect of their customers experience with the Customer 360 we really feel like all these components are coming together to really match that appetite from our customers. Marc Benioff : Well, Bret, I haven't seen you work harder than you have in the last month. So I want to thank you for everything that you're doing. Operator : The next question is from Brent Thrill from Jefferies. Brent Thrill : Thanks for Mr. Hawkins. The renewals you mentioned came in earlier than planned. Can you just talk to how given that anomaly that was and to stay intact for that pull forward? Mark Hawkins : Yes, for sure. Thank you, Brent. And basically what happened is when we have an early renewal from a customer, that's a really good event, as you can imagine, but they were ahead of plan and you can see that when they happen, because our cRPO in Q3 was even higher and so it has an effect. It's kind of a timing effect between Q3 and Q4 for cRPO but we really like what happened.  It's a good customer sign when people come in there and they do early renewals and so that had a bearing on that and, but we're glad to see it, it shows up in our cash flow and it shows up in cRPO in one quarter and a little bit of time in between the two quarters. But, yes, that's how it works out there Brent. And thank you for the question. Operator : The next question is from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : Hi. Mark, why don't I just pick up on that question a little bit more? So, relative to the 22%, organic cRPO performance you put up in 3Q, which was terrific. The 16% to guide for 4Q feels a little bit light. So you just touched on perhaps one explanation, is it possible to quantify how big that impact was and if there are other factors may be driving your guidance for that 16% number and maybe being a little extra careful given macro or maybe there was some contract duration changes? Thank you. Mark Hawkins : Yes, sure. Let me just address a couple things here Karl for sure, glad to do it. I think the first thing I would say is the early renewals impacted the growth rate by let's say approximately a point or so, and that type of measurement in terms of quantification, number one. Number two, I want to call out that this is the first time we've actually ever guided cRPO for Q4, it's kind of a new event for us. And we're doing it for the first time by adding in Tableau and so our business compositions also evolving. And so when we looked at that, and we looked at the fact that when you look at what actually happened in Q3 and the guide in Q4, it works out it just you can see kind of the timing issue if at all we feel like it's a good and reasonable guidance. It's appropriately conservative given that this is the biggest quarter for both new business and renewals. We look forward to putting up the result and talking about the actuals in Q4, but we think that's appropriate. Operator : Next question is from Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : Okay, thank you. One question for Marc B, Marc, we've noticed over the past 18 months or so maybe a little longer a growing importance of customers\u2019 first party data versus third party data, that maybe in the past that you've been purchasing to augment gaps from platforms that are increasingly being regulated or commoditized.  So we believe customers are putting their most valuable data into CRM, and we'd like to know how you're going to help customers realize the value of their own first party data. Are we going to be able to track this with multi cloud adoption or Customer 360? And just sort of a little bit of a follow on with this data mosaic you've been building between MuleSoft, Einstein, Customer 360 and Tableau do you feel you have the right data mosaic in place today to help customers realize that value? Marc Benioff : All right, this is a great question and I'm going to address part of it, but I'm also going to have Bret who is right here address part of it and also Amy Weaver also speak to it, who's our President and our Chief Legal Officer, because she's so involved with so many customer conversations exactly like this. So, you're right, companies have more customer information than ever before. It's a critical part of their trusted relationship with their customers. Every company is building a one-on-one relationship with their consumer, it has moved from being anonymous to known. This is critical for them to then build a journey that then allows them to take those customers to understand their products or to buy those products or get their service from those products upgrade those products.  That could even include renewing the customer, retaining the customer or even getting the customer back. All of this is going to be driven much more effectively, much more efficiently and in a much more dynamic way by using a Customer 360 platform like Salesforce. This is why we built Customer 360 Truth because at that moment, those customers have to be able to rely on a single source of Truth to be able to maximize their relationship with their customers, where regardless of where the customer touch point is. This is a phenomenon that has occurred over the last, I would say, five years and Salesforce is really the company that companies are coming to and saying help us to provide that unique Customer 360. So Bret, give us your take on exactly where are we in terms of the move from third party to first party data? How customers are implementing this platform, I didn't address the Tableau part of her question. I think that's important. And then I think we'll have Amy address the components around we've seen here in California, the California Privacy Act, GDPR as well, because these are all related to the importance of having authenticated and basically, data that your customer is authorized to use. Go ahead Bret. Bret Taylor : Yes, it's a wonderful question. I really agree with the trend that you mentioned. And I would say, Salesforce started as being a system of record for sales. But not every single aspect of CRM has been served equally to help handle this first party customer data. And with the Customer 360 we really feel like we can bring it to every aspect of this Customer 360, from sales to service to commerce to marketing.  As an example with Customer 360 audiences, which we announced at Dreamforce we're bringing a single source of truth to marketers as well. Those customer data platform that so many marketers are clamoring for, we really recognize that every one of our constituents in every department of every company needs a single source of truth, to do their jobs. And we really feel like the power is unlocked when that known customer data is accessible across all those different departments. So you create a seamless experience instead of a fragmented experience. And we feel like what I'm hearing from our customers is that's really what differentiates Salesforce. We're not just doing this for one department we're doing this for an entire company. So you can have a single view of all of your known customer data. And I think one of the interesting things is, by bringing this together, it's enabling our customers to navigate all this amazingly complex regulatory landscape that Amy will speak to you about. But the first step to complying with CCPA, with GDPR is really having a map of where your customer data live. And we feel privileged to partner with our customers to help them navigate this landscape and we feel like one of the best ways to comply with the changing landscape of consumer privacy legislation is to be on the Salesforce Customer 360. And we really think that's one of the value propositions of our platform. And I'll pass it over to Amy to speak more about it. Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks, Bret. Thanks, Marc. I think it's a really interesting question; we're looking forward to all of this personalization, because consumers\u2019 expectations about privacy and how their data is used is at an all-time high. But same time, consumers have high expectations about personalization. They don't want to see information that's not relevant to them. And they want their experiences with companies that they trust to be seamless. And I think the key is that we really believe that the personalization and building and maintain trust are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they're part of the same virtuous cycle. The customer success platform is a good example it's designed with features to help our customers build trusted and personalized relationships with their customers and consumers. For example, its built in robust features that help our customers determine how they want their data used and will really had to partner with our customers on their compliance journey as well. Now, Marc, briefly mentioned, the CCPA, which is the California Consumer Privacy Act, and that's going into effect in January 1st, that is really important step forward in the U.S. privacy landscape. But as I said before, we really believe that all Americans and not just those in California, because there is strong privacy protections, and that is why we are continuing to advocate for comprehensive federal privacy law. Okay, thank you. Marc Benioff : Yes. And to add to Amy that's also why I've called for a U.S. national privacy law we do not want a patchwork of like what we've seen in California. This personally involved, I think it's extremely important. What has happened in California. I have worked with the team to get that done, as did Amy, but we don't want to patchwork across the United States. We badly need a national privacy law. That's why it's great that we have GDPR, it gives us the ability to help our customers comply. So anyway, thank you, Amy for your leadership. I really appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I wanted to touch a little bit on the European business, EMEA up 43% was a really impressive result, given the kind of macro uncertainty and you guys are closing the quarter in October, which you had a lot of Brexit uncertainty. Is it -- just a better environment than we're thinking about over in Europe? Or is the sort of the priority from the CIO just over -- sort of overtaking any uncertainty people have about that spending environment? Marc Benioff : Well, I think that there's a couple different ways that you have to look at it. Number one is that for all customers, we really believe that digital transformation is the last thing they would stop investing in. I mean, I look at all your own companies look at our company, digital transformation is number one on everybody's list and everybody wants a trusted digital advisor at the beginning and end of every digital transformation is the customer. So that's why we're especially well positioned and why you're seeing the strong results. On the macro side, I said this also at the Analyst Day, which is, we look strong with the macro environment. And you see what [indiscernible] said at the OECD that global growth is dropping from 4% to 3% this year. That's a 25% reduction year-over-year, of course, that's going to impact different geographic environments differently. And for us our job is to manage a full portfolio of countries across the world. We are in the major technology buying centers whether it is in the United States or in Asia or Japan, we have also implemented a new structure in Europe. We had our own Brexit, if you will, you know that we have hired Jayne-Anne Gadhia to be the Chief Executive Officer of Salesforce, UK and Ireland. I believe that's a very critical change for us. And we're continuing to invest aggressively in Europe and in the UK and Ireland through their own transition and transformation, so that we can align with our customers because they all need to invest to be able to take advantage of what's happening in the European environment. Let me turn it over to Mark he is going to have more detail. Mark Hawkins : No, thank you, Marc. And I agree with your comment that the digital transformation is mission one, and people are asking more and more from us Marc in terms of how we can help them obviously, as described by you and Bret. But the thing that I would say is, I was really pleased to put up the 42% growth rate in aggregate. But even if you're backing out\u2026 Marc Benioff : And did that surprise you, when you look at these numbers, I mean some of them are just incredible. Mark Hawkins : That number, it was a really big number, Marc. So I clicked in it, and I wanted to share with people even if you back out all the Tableau effect, it's up 31%. So that's the number that really hit me that, we're hitting strong across the different geos in the world, as you said, in Asia Pac and Americas and in Europe, with or without Tableau, and then also the cloud, our growth, what I really like is to see the sales cloud grew 15% is material for me, it catches my eye that when our foundational cloud is growing at that level, I was glad to see that. Marc Benioff : Incredible growth, especially by cloud, I just went through all the numbers. But let me ask you what is your biggest surprise; A, of the quarter, but the forum Dreamforce we've heard that question a couple of times. And I think you should have the ability to turn it on? Mark Hawkins : No, I get a chance as you know to spend a lot of time with customers in addition to investors. And I think the thing that I like, is just the constant focus on digital transformation they ask for us to do more is probably the biggest thing that surprised me is that people when they see progress, they want more progress. And Bret, I think your point on single source of truth. And when you spoke in a couple of times people pick up on that. And so I think we do more is the thing that really caught my attention. In terms of the quarter what I liked was the balance across clouds and across geos the most. Marc Benioff : Thank you. Operator : Your final question is from Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Kash Rangan : Congratulations yet again on a spectacular Dreamforce team. One for Benioff and one for Keith. Marc, when you look at Customer 360 the industry has tried to do this execute this concept going back to the days of Siebel 20 years back or so. How do we think of 360? Does that allow Salesforce to participate in bigger opportunities that can be executed faster or just allow you to stay in the game because it's something that customer sort of expects Salesforce you to proactive versus reactive is, I guess, the spectrum that I'm hoping for you to fill in. And for Keith, congratulations on MuleSoft, I mean, it's been accelerating in its growth under Salesforce. How would you apply this model to Tableau and what's right way to think about how Tableau could end up being as successful or maybe even more successful of an acquisition as MuleSoft? Thank you so much. Marc Benioff : So Mark, why don\u2019t you take the first part of that. Mark Hawkins : Well, I pursue you\u2019re 100% right, which is that for Customer 360, we really entered a unique position with our customers. Our customers today, they're looking to us as their provider of that platform that's really a critical and unique position. You mentioned Siebel, of course, there's been many companies have been in the CRM market, maybe in service, maybe in sales. I don't think there has ever been a vendor who has tried to execute this vision before and tie it all together with a single source of truth for their customers. And I was going to ask Keith to take this next. But you mentioned MuleSoft, you mentioned Tableau, this is critical for our customers to move forward. We needed MuleSoft as the next step to be able to help us bring all of this together. Tableau is critical as our customers want to be able to go wall-to-wall to understand all of this data and that has really shifted our position with our customers, and I love for Keith to talk about his experience as well, Keith? Keith Block : Yes, thanks, Marc. So -- and Kash for the question. I mean, a couple things, just some commentary and Marc\u2019s comment. And of course, I'll try to address the other question. So like in my entire career, the industry has been yearning for the 360 degree view of the of the customer. And as time has gone on, the companies have recognized the importance of this and the power of it. Few weeks back, I was with a CEO of one of the largest insurance companies in the world and we were having a conversation about how overtime that company has grown up in silos, and Bret alluded to this earlier. There are organizational silos, process silos, builds business model silos, data silos, and those companies grew up with a product out to the market view of the world instead of a customer in view of the world and so every company has to go through that huge digital transformation. And to be able to make that journey work, they have to embrace the platform, the notion, the promise of the 360 degree view of the customer. I mean, that is an imperative. So, people have been talking about this, it hasn't become a reality. That's why we're excited about it. Because for the very first time in this industry, a company that's us at Salesforce has been able to provide the technology to give the customers what they've been looking for, for so long. So it's very, very exciting. And when you think about how these companies grow up with data all over the place, and all the inconsistency and no single source of the truth, they just want the truth. Like we all want the truth. Our customers expect the truth, their customers expect the truth. So it is a very, very powerful thing that we're able to provide them with. As it relates to Tableau we're super excited about Tableau being part of the Salesforce family. And again, if you think about the evolution of where the technology is going, you think about the systems of record. Well, the systems of record are nothing without data. And the systems of engagement are nothing without data. And the systems of intelligence are nothing about data. And the power of visualization with analytics, and intelligence is an incredibly unique opportunity. And we've run a playbook in all of our acquisitions, which have been very, very successful. Certainly MuleSoft has been the most successful that we've run so far where customers are looking for that holistic view, they're looking for a solution, they're not looking for piece parts. And if you can bring together the best of breed solutions in an integrated way that is what customers want. So the playbook that we ran with Mule, we will run the exact same playbook. I would echo both Marc and Bret's comments earlier, the enthusiasm for Tableau alone was great. I mean, it was a great company, is a great company, great management team, great community. But when you combine that with all of the promise of the 360 degree view of the customer, and being able to serve that up in an intelligent way, in a visualized way so we can process it and digest it. It's just a very compelling offering. So -- and that's why the combination of Salesforce and Tableau, we think will be very, very successful. Marc Benioff : Well, thank you, Keith. I just wanted to thank you so much for that. And I completely agree. And I think that you could see it really from the lines at Dreamforce around the Tableau Booze and on analytics calls and other parts of Dreamforce. I know it surprised many of us and many of you to see the huge activity was not a surprise to me. Because of what was happening in the focus groups before Dreamforce. While we wrap up the call now, I just want to thank all of you for coming to Dreamforce. Today is Giving Tuesday we're coming into the holiday season. I want to especially thank all of our Ohana. Thank all of you for your support. Thank you for everything that you do for us every single day. I also especially want to thank our .org at this time of the year, who has run over 45,000 non-profit and higher education customers for free. We've now done over 4.5 million hours of volunteerism into our local communities and given away more than $310 million in direct grants. So thank you to all of you. Thank you to our Ohana and we'll look forward to seeing you on the 19th in the New York City World Tour in New York. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And without further delay, I would like to hand over the conference to your speaker, Mr. Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Evan Goldstein : Thanks, Ian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter results conference call. I am Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our results, press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today are Marc Benioff, Keith Block, Marker Harris, Co Founder and Yasir Anwar; Mark Hawkins, our CFO; Bret Taylor, our COO and Amy Weaver, our Chief Legal Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q. And with that, let me hand the call to Marc. Marc Benioff : All right. Well, thank you, Evan. And congratulations on your promotion, Evan. We are thrilled too. Evan Goldstein : Thank you. Marc Benioff : And thank you everybody for being on the call today. As you can see from our results we had an incredible fourth quarter, capping off another record year for Salesforce. Revenue in the quarter rose to nearly $4.9 billion, up 34% in the constant currency. Truly amazing for a company of our size and for the full year we delivered $17.1 billion in revenue, up 29% in constant currency. Now based on our exceptional fiscal year 2020 results, we're raising our fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance to $21.1 billion at the high end of our range, representing about 23% projected growth year-over-year. And no other company of our size is growing at this rate. We're also reiterating our long-term revenue target for fiscal year 2024 of $34 billion to $35 billion and that's doubling our revenue again in four years making us the fastest enterprise software company to reach this milestone. And as we continue to deliver a record revenue year in and year out, we're committed to balancing this growth with very strong cash flow and incremental operating margin improvement. Now before I continue, I want to say a few words about Keith. Now as you've read by now he's stepping down as Co-CEO. Keith is an incredible leader and close friend who has helped position us as a global leader and deeply strengthened our company. We're surely going to miss Keith around here. Keith joined almost seven years ago and together we've grown Salesforce into a company that is the envy of the industry. I am especially grateful to Keith for his service to Salesforce and I'm absolutely delighted that he will be staying on as an adviser to me. Now as we continue to build on our fourth quarter and our year. Our time together has been amazing. I'm his biggest supporter. I am his close friend. I am here to help him on his journey and as he begins this new journey, we are all with you, Keith. And we're all very excited for you. Now Keith, I know this goes without saying, but you will always be part of our ohana. I also want to express my gratitude to our entire ohana; people ask me all the time how is it possible to achieve our rate of growth and success. And to me it's quite simple. It's our core values of trust, of customer success, of innovation, of equality. And I'd like to thank all of our customers from around the world for their incredible commitment to our company and their belief in our vision for Customer 360. I'd also like to recognize an incredible executive in our Ohana, Gavin Patterson. Our friendship with Gavin has spanned more than a decade. During his time leading BT where he served as their Chief Executive Officer. And I'm delighted to announce that Gavin has accepted the position of President and CEO of Salesforce International based in London. Gavin is an incredible global leader. A member of many groups that we have been associated with for many years including the World Economic Forum. A very close friend and I could not be more pleased to welcome Gavin to Salesforce. We're in the midst of a huge wave of digital transformation and it's only getting bigger and every one of these digital transformation begins and ends with a customer. Every CEO we meet around the world is deeply committed to transforming their business around their customer. And the reliant on Salesforce is their trusted digital adviser. We're the number one CRM provider. We are leader in sales and service and marketing and commerce and platform and analytics and integration. So many more.  Our clouds are the key building blocks of Customer 360 along with the powerful platform services including security and mobility and AI and voice and blockchain and more. What makes Customer 360 so powerful? Is that it unifies and manages all the data not just within Salesforce, but from almost any data source to deliver a complete 360-degree view of your customer. It's a single source of truth that results in one-to-one journeys for customers across retail stores and commerce sites, email and messaging, call centers, field serve. In fact, across every customer interaction and every industry and Customer 360 is the only platform delivering this unique capability, enabling the single source of truth and with our recent acquisition of Tableau, we're turning Customer 360 data into actionable insights that are available to every user helping them to move from data to decisions. I'm especially excited by the success of Tableau and how well we're doing together. Adam Selipsky, the Tableau CEO and his team are doing an incredible job and it's clear that customers recognize tableaus value, see and understand all the data in Customer 360 throughout their whole enterprise. And MuleSoft has continued to perform beyond expectations. It's become incredibly strategic to so many of our customers and we're so thrilled with the progress of their team. We've been leading innovation around CRM for more than two decades. We started the company as a system of record. We've evolved into a system of engagement and then a system of intelligence and now we're pursuing a system that is a single source of truth. In fact, when you look at some of these incredible accomplishments like Einstein, well in Einstein in Q4 it powered more than 11 billion predictions per day, up 6 billion from just a year ago. No other company is delivering this level of intelligence and it's absolutely critical for us as we head to our own Holy Grail the single source of truth for all of our customers, the knowledge of their customers connecting with their customers in a whole new way. I'm also thrilled to share the news today that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Vlocity. Vlocity has been a phenomenal partner for the last six years delivering industry-specific clouds and mobile solutions for the world's top companies, all built natively in the Salesforce platform. And Vlocity and Salesforce have been closely connected with our values. The company is committed to customer success and giving back through pledge 1% right from the very beginning. The work we've already done together with our customers has been extraordinary and with this acquisition will be easier than ever for us to deliver powerful industry solutions to our customers by every vertical. And I'm absolutely looking forward to welcome in my old friend and the CEO of Vlocity, David Schmaier and the entire Vlocity team to ohana later this year. I'm proud of what our Ohana has accomplished in fiscal year 2020 and over the last 21 years. Salesforce is living proof that stakeholder capitalism works when we value all stakeholders. Yes, we've delivered phenomenal returns for our shareholders more than 4,000% since we went public in 2004. But we've also delivered fantastic returns for our stakeholders. $330 million in grants to worthy causes. Our employees have delivered 4.9 million hours of volunteerism, 46,000 nonprofits and NGOs use our software for free. And we're the number one contributor to our local San Francisco and Oakland public schools, as well as to the homelessness crisis right here in our native San Francisco. We have achieved net zero gas emissions globally. We've delivered a carbon neutral cloud to our customers and we're committing to reach 100% renewable energy for global operations by 2022. Because the planet is a stakeholder. This is how we've grown from a pioneering idea to a company headed towards $35 billion in fiscal 2024 known for our culture and committed to giving back a scale and executing on stakeholder capitalism. And it's why I so strongly believe that when we serve all stakeholders business is the greatest platform for change. Our commitment to all stakeholders is one of the reasons that Fortune is ranked Salesforce as one of its 100 companies, 100 best companies to work for the 12th year in a row. We're also very proud that Fortune has named Salesforce as one of the Top 10 most admired companies in the world. And one of the best workplaces for giving back. And just this week, Atmosphere named Salesforce one of the most ethical companies for the 11th year. And it's why together with our partners and customers we're creating millions of Salesforce related jobs around the world. According to IDC, the Salesforce economy will add 4.2 million new jobs by 2025 impacting global GDP by over $1.2 trillion. And this is what we mean when we say that business is the greatest platform for change. And that's why I've never been more excited about our opportunity ahead for Salesforce to deliver success to all of our stakeholders including our shareholders and I'm sitting here with Parker Harris, my Co-Founder and CTO. And on March 8th which is just two weeks from now, Salesforce will celebrate its 21st birthday, is that right Parker? Parker Harris : That's correct, Marc. Marc Benioff : When we first showed up at 1449, Telegraph, Hill Boulevard or was it Montgomery Street? On Telegraph Hill and started Salesforce and we're excited Parker to have you of the call today. Parker Harris : Thank you for having me, Marc. Marc Benioff : And with that we'll turn it over to Keith. Keith Block : Thanks Marc and thank you very much for those kind words. It's been my greatest honor to be part of Salesforce over the last seven years. When I first joined the company in 2013, we were generating $4 billion in revenue. Amazingly about the same amount that we just delivered in this last quarter. And now we are a global enterprise company guiding to more than $21 billion in FY21 with a focus on industries and speaking the language of the customer. We have the markets leading enterprise software ecosystem and we are now the trusted advisor for digital transformation for CEOs all over the world. It's a tremendous accomplishment but I am ready to start a new chapter. I'm very grateful to our employees, our customers, our partners and certainly this community, our investors. And working side by side with you Marc as well the rest of this great management team has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my career. I will be forever grateful for our friendship. So I appreciate that. And I'm very proud of the incredible growth trajectory the company is on. I'm excited that I'm going to be working together with Marc in my role as an advisor. So I'm grateful for that as well. This quarter and year have really been a capstone of my time at Salesforce and now I'd like to share some of the impressive highlights from the quarter. In Q4, we grew 32% in the Americas, 28% in APAC and 47% in EMEA in constant currency. Now that includes our recent acquisitions. And at the close of FY20, the number of Salesforce customers spending $20 million annually grew 34%. Let me share a few key examples of the strategic relationships that we been building with our customers in these markets and how we've become a trusted digital adviser across industries, geographies and segments. Volkswagen Group, the number one manufacturer of cars in the world is partnering with Salesforce to transform how they deliver personalized experiences to their dealers, employees and end consumers. Leveraging Salesforce, Volkswagen will have a 360-degree view across their 12 brands. It's pretty incredible. A single source of truth for customer engagement. Transformation is also one of 3M's top strategic business priorities and over the last several years we've been partnering to transform how they serve their customers. Part of that strategy 3M significantly invested in our Customer 360 solutions in the fourth quarter to increase productivity, drive business growth and enhance the customer experience. St. James's Place, the UK's largest wealth manager also expands its relationship with Salesforce significantly. SJP is going wall-to-wall with Salesforce leveraging financial services cloud, Einstein Analytics, MuleSoft and more, all to transform how their advisors engage with clients. And many of our existing relationships in Europe deepened as well including with Enel and adidas. Now APAC. We had an outstanding quarter driven by remarkable growth in Japan where we deepen our relationships with Toyota and Mizuho Financial Group. And we continue to strengthen our relationship with Telstra, Australia's largest telco. In the fourth quarter, our industry vertical solutions continue to deliver tremendous value to customers and as Marc said, Vlocity will be an incredible addition for building out the industry solution. So I think we're all very excited about that. In healthcare, Cerner chose health cloud to power their client 360 project and they're also partnering with us to sell Salesforce to their healthcare clients. Financial Services also showed strong momentum in the quarter, longtime customer Farmers Insurance added financial services cloud and Einstein Analytics to empower their agents to deliver even more responsive and personalized experiences to their 15 million policyholders across the United States. We began a new relationship with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, CIBC and expanded with many of the top banks in the US and around the world including Goldman Sachs, Banco Bradesco, Banco Santander and ANZ Bank. Deluxe went wall-to-wall with Salesforce to improve customer insight, ignite innovation and drive toward its goal of selling all products and services to all customers. Deluxe also partnering with Salesforce to offer Salesforce Essentials. The world's number one CRM product purpose-built for small businesses to its approximately 4.5 million customers. As we continue to highlight our partners play a critical role in our customers' transformations and are investing more in Salesforce to drive their own growth. In Q4, Deloitte expanded their use of service cloud in sales cloud and made new investments in Quip, Analytics Einstein and my Trailhead and our partner ecosystem continues to thrive.  In Q4, the number of new partners with apps on the Salesforce app exchange increased 44% year-over-year and app installs exceeded 7.5 million. As you know, in Q3, we concluded the largest acquisition in our history with Tableau. As Marc said, we're pleased with how well Tableau has performed over the year and certainly in Q4. Tableau had significant wins including three of the world's biggest brands in the internet and retail spaces two of which are at the top of the Fortune 100. And Toyota, Enel and Volkswagen all chose MuleSoft by the way in the quarter to unlock data and accelerate their digital transformations. So in closing, it's been an incredible privilege to work with an amazing group of people here at Salesforce. It's an extraordinary inspirational company that truly, truly lives its values. More important in this world today than I think ever. And I have no doubt that Marc and this amazing Salesforce team will continue to deliver customer success and serve as a beacon of light and a leader in the industry. So again, I want to thank our employees, our customers, our partners and certainly our investors for your support. So with that I'll turn the call over to Mark Hawkins. Mark Hawkins : Well, great. Thank you, Keith. And Keith, I can't thank you enough for your partnership, your leadership, your friendship and your support since I joined the company. Fiscal 2020 was another important and busy year for Salesforce. We launched one of the most significant product initiatives in the company's history with Customer 360. We acquired Tableau, the largest acquisition in our history which enables our customers to see and understand data. We welcome Salesforce.org expanding our vertical strategy. We unveiled and expanded several strategic partnerships including AWS, Microsoft and Alibaba to better serve our customer. And we accomplished all this while sustaining organic top line growth and producing another year of strong financial performance driven by our values, our discipline and our focus. Here are a few of the financial highlights for Q4 and fiscal 2020. Q4 revenue grew 35% in dollars and 34% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of Tableau and Salesforce.org, Q4 revenue grew 22%. For all of fiscal 2020, revenue grew 29% in dollars and 29% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of Tableau and Salesforce.org, fiscal 2020 revenue grew 23%. Q4 CRPO grew 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, and again, excluding the impact of Tableau and.org, Q4 CRPO grew 20%. Our portfolio of industry-leading products continues to deliver strong year-over-year subscription and support revenue growth in Q4. Sales Cloud grew 17% or approximately 14% excluding the contribution from Salesforce.org. This compares to a year-over-year growth rate of 11% in Q4 of last year. Service Cloud grew 26% or approximately 22%, excluding the contributions from ClickSoftware and Salesforce.org and this compares to a year-over-year growth rate of 22% in Q4 of last year. Platform and other grew 74% or approximately 30%, excluding the contribution from Tableau and Salesforce.org and this compares to a year-over-year growth rate of 54% in Q4. Keep in mind; last year's results included revenue from the acquisition of MuleSoft. And Marketing and Commerce Cloud grew 28% or approximately 24%, excluding the contributions from Salesforce.org. This compares to a year-over-year growth rate of 34% in Q4. Again, keep in mind the Marketing Cloud revenue benefited from the acquisition of Datorama. So while M&A benefited the growth rates for each of the clouds year-over-year, our organic growth rate by cloud remains very strong and have even accelerated year-over-year in some cases. Lower revenue attrition also continued to support our growth in Q4 and for the full fiscal year with dollar attrition continuing the downward trend we have seen for the last several quarters. And I'm very pleased to share that the revenue attrition for the year is now currently below 9%. This is a historic low for Salesforce. This continuous improvement reflects the ongoing shift of our business mix to enterprise and the international markets, which inherently have longer contractual relationships and lower attrition rates. Turning to operating margin. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 15.4%, down 110 basis points year-over-year. As discussed last year, our Q4 non-GAAP operating margin reflects the timing of Dreamforce in Q4 versus Q3 last year as well as the timing of integration and other investments in Tableau. For the full year we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 16.8% down 24 basis points year-over-year, but coming in higher than our expectation largely due to the overall revenue outperformance. Excluding the impact from M&A, our organic non-GAAP operating margin is consistent with our initial guide from last year of approximately 125 to 150 basis points. Q4 GAAP loss per share was $0.28 and this loss was unfavorable compared to our expectation due to the incremental tax cost associated with integration of acquired operations and assets. Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.66. Turning to cash flow. We had very strong cash collections in Q4 which drove operating cash flow of $1.6 billion, up 23% year-over-year. For fiscal 2020, we delivered $4.3 billion of operating cash flow, up 27% over last year. CapEx for this year was $643 million. We continue to see scale benefits from CapEx with CapEx as a percent of revenue now approximately 4% and that's down from 4.5% of revenue last year. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $1.5 billion in Q4, up 29% over last year. And for fiscal year 2020, free cash flow grew 32% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Remaining performance obligation representing all future revenues under contract ended Q4 at $30.8 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Current RPO which is our business that is billed and unbilled and expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12-months was $15 billion, up 26% year-over-year with Tableau and Salesforce.org contributing approximately six points of growth to this amount. Before I move on to guidance as Marc described, we're excited to be expanding our industry offering with the acquisition of Vlocity. We are acquiring Vlocity for approximately $1.33 billion in cash net of Salesforce's ownership in the company. The transaction is expected to close during the fiscal second quarter and we expect approximately $50 million in revenue contribution during fiscal 2021. Additional details in the transaction can be found in our recently filed 8-K. Now turning to guidance. As a result of our Q4 performance, we are pleased to raise our Q1 revenue guidance by $50 million to $4.875 billion to $4.885 billion or 30% to 31% growth year-over-year. We're also raising our fiscal 2021 revenue guidance by $200 million to $21 billion to $21.1 billion or approximately 23% growth year-over-year. With the advantage of our predictable and recurring revenue model along with our expanding product portfolio and an increasing traction in enterprise and in our geographies as Marc mentioned, we remain on track to deliver $34 billion to $35 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024.  This long-term target represents a four year CAGR of approximately 20% at the high end of the range and is consistent with the durable growth we've been delivering year after year. For Q1, our fiscal 2021, we expect to see CRPO growth of approximately 23% to 24% year-over-year. We expect to deliver fiscal 2021 non-GAAP operating margin of 18.1% which represents approximately a 125 basis points of expansion year-over-year driven by continued improvements in organic operating leverage which is partially offset by the margin headwinds and tailwind related to recent M&A. We expect fiscal 2021 operating cash flow growth of approximately 20% or better than $5.1 billion, which reflects continued strong cash generation, partially offset by the cash headwinds from the acquisition of Tableau. For fiscal 2021, we anticipate CapEx to remain at approximately 4% of revenue. We expect fiscal 2021 GAAP alluded EPS of $0.12 to $0.14 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.16 to $3.18. Now our GAAP and our non-GAAP EPS assumes that OIE is a net expense of approximately $5 million for fiscal 2021 and our non-GAAP tax rate of 22% which is down approximately 50 basis points primarily due to higher projected research and development credits. Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no contribution from mark-to-mark accounting as required by ASU 2016-01 and lastly as a reminder the full financial impact of velocity acquisition is factored into our guidance today. To close, we've delivered another year of strong financial performance highlighted by organic, durable, top line growth and excellent cash flow generation. Further in a year where we closed the largest acquisition in our history and further expanded our products and industry offerings, we are pleased with our ability to deliver a consistently reported non-GAAP operating margin percent. This level of sustained and balanced growth at our scale is unprecedented in enterprise software industry.  Closing, I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners and our community and our shareholders for their continued support. And with that let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. PhilWinslow: Hey. Thanks. How's your day? Congrats on the close of the year. And Keith, really enjoyed working with you, looking forward to see where your path takes you. Just want to focus in on the sales cloud. I mean you mentioned your acceleration in several clouds and that's the one that really jumped out to us, we've seen in the past couple quarters seeing a 17% this quarter. Could you double click on what's really driving it? I mean that's the highest growth rate we've seen in sales cloud for four quarters now. And also maybe talk about how Vlocity will figure into that too. Thanks. KeithBlock: Yes. Sure. A couple things that in terms of the sales cloud, the thing that I could tell you one is that of course the acquisition of .org added a few growth points. I think we said four growth points, but if you think about 13% growth without that it's a strong growth rate. We're very pleased about that. I think one of the things that you see is the balance of our offering. The continued innovation, CPQ, AI, I think a number of factors have just made this a very, very welcome and competitive product. I don't know, Bret, if you want to add some comments. BretTaylor: Yes. I also think it's really important to understand while sales cloud is the product that Parker and Marc created 21 years, we haven't stopped innovating. So at Dreamforce, we announced major new capabilities like Einstein Call Coaching which is leveraging the power of Einstein to enable inside sales teams to coach people to be as effective as the most effective account executives on the team. We've also continued to study a steady stream of new add-ons for customers of sales cloud things like Salesforce Maps which enables field sales CPQ which enables quote to cash; PRM which enables you to extend your sales process to your ecosystem of partners. And I would say perhaps most importantly Salesforce Essentials which is really packaging all this up and bringing it into really easy to digest, easy to deploy solution for small businesses as well. So I think that we're really focused on innovation and making sure we have a study news stream of innovation to bring to our customers in our flagship and namesake product. Operator : The next question is from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. HeatherBellini: Great. Thank you very much for the question. I was wondering, Keith, best wishes in your next endeavors. But I was wondering, Marc, if you could share with us a little bit of the initial feedback on Tableau from customers. Has there been anything that surprised you in terms of how customers are leveraging it? And I'm also wondering to the extent you are seeing people who are obviously running it on-premise to the extent you're starting to hear customers talk about being able to leverage that data that's on-premise and bring it into your various cloud offering. Thank you. MarcBenioff: Well, thanks Heather for that. I think there are probably three things that have really been the big surprises with Tableau. The first is just I think I've mentioned this before on public.tableau.com, if you haven't seen that site or been on there to see the incredible level of innovation and size and scale of their community that has been continues to be in a surprise. It's inspiring for us certainly when we built our own app exchange and our own community of trailblazers. I think they kind of got it beat a little bit in terms of what they've been able to do. Now they have it -- they -- I think there's another opportunity for them to monetize that in a more aggressive way to build ISVs there. I think maybe we have that part figured out. So I've been encouraging them there to take that next step. I just was up there and made amazing company. Two, the CEO is awesome and we're thrilled to have Adam as part of the team and he has fit right in kind of like our lost cousin from the Northwest that we have now reassembled into the family. So that's very exciting and to have him and three, I would say that from a customer perspective, I have never had so many customers come to me on an acquisition and immediately tell me that they want to go enterprise-wide with it. This was slowed down a little bit last year because as you know the integration was a little bumpy. But as we now get into our new fiscal year, the way that we have architected our distribution, organizations and compensation plans is to give as much throughput. And I was going to say Vlocity, but I have to take another words. I have and as much acceleration as possible because I think every customer already loves Tableau. We just had our company kickoff here last week, two weeks ago and we had a customer come from a large financial services firm to speak to our employees to inspire them and the customer spoke about how they've always loved Salesforce but they secretly never told us that they also loved Tableau so much. And that was very cool and something that we've heard a lot. So I hope that I hope that kind of informs you how excited we are about Tableau. Operator : The next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. KeithWeiss: Thank you guys for taking the question. Keith it has been a pleasure working with you and definitely leading on a high note after this Q4 which definitely seemed very strong. Two questions; one in terms of kind of strength in the overall business. Given kind of what we've been seeing over the past couple days in the stock market and with Coronavirus. Any indication that that's impacting demand at all for Salesforce heading into your guys FY21? Then a second question maybe for Mr. Benioff, with Keith leaving, is there any changes that you have to make to on the leadership structure or anything that you have to do in terms of bringing a new management to fill in for the functionality that Keith was bringing in the role? KeithBlock: So, Keith thanks for the kind words. I'll address the first part and obviously Marc can talk about the second one. Look, I think the numbers kind of speak for themselves. And I would say that the set up, the company is clearly executing and set up for success and scaling at a great pace. So I think the future is very, very bright as they say in Washington DC, the state of the union is strong. So I think we all feel very, very confident about that. With respect to the Coronavirus, I'm sure, Marc, will have some comments on that but it's not affecting us right now. Certainly, we're concerned; we're watching to see what happens here. And we're empathetic to those who it is affecting. But overall I think where we are -- the company is in a terrific spot. And I think we're all proud of the result here. MarcBenioff: Well, number one, I think all of our hearts go out to all of the families around the world who have been impacted by the Coronavirus and certainly the world governments and their impact to contain what is possibly going to be a serious pandemic. So we have been listening and paying attention closely to what's been happening around the world. Certainly, we've had a number of customers come to us just in our normal course of business and talk to us about how their businesses have been impacted. Those have been mostly limited to Airlines and hospitality companies who have their operations primarily in China or who have significant supply chains based in China. I think that when we've looked at architecting Salesforce over the last 21 years and as we've looked at navigating the economic crisis that we've been through before. We've been through two serious recessions. Now as we look at navigating a biological crisis. When we started Salesforce, Parker and I really built a business model that was designed to transcend these situations so that we would have durable growth over time regardless of the crises. I think that really played out in a surprising way with a level of strength in 2009, 2010 and 2011 the financial crisis. That if you look at our revenue curves, it looks like it never happened because whether our bookings are up or down one quarter or the next, the strength of our revenue model and the resulting cash flow and commitment we've had to incremental operating margin over 21 years has really paid out to have a level of durable capability for the company that I think is been unprecedented in the technology industry. And given our investors, the returns that have been so strong for them and something that we're very committed to continuing to do more than I think Mark will know 93%, 92%, what is it? MarkHawkins: It's 93%. MarcBenioff: 93% of our revenue is deferred. So that just gives us tremendous visibility into the future and this is a key architecture of our accounting and of our company corporation and how our relationships with our customers especially our deep contractual multi-year relationships with our customers. I think I mentioned how grateful I am to Keith and how delighted I am in his decision to move on and to a new chapter. And I will deeply partner with him and making that successful for Salesforce and for him and when I look around this management table here in this room, I'll tell you that I'm also very inspired by our team. Of course, Parker who has been by my side for 21 years could not have done it this without him. We also have our Chief Operating Officer, Bret Taylor who many of you know with his tremendous lineage at including Facebook and Google and his own private companies. Our Chief Legal Officer, Amy Weaver who is probably one of the finest executives who I've had the opportunity to work with. And our CFO, Mark Hawkins who just hit me on the side of my shoulder make sure I don't forget about him. But I also going to mention that there's two people who around the management table who are public company CEOs as well who aren't currently with us because they're traveling. One is Adam Selipsky, he is the CEO of Tableau, who is an incredible part of our management team and has provided an unbelievable value in the short time he's been here. And a new addition who's been with us as our Chairman of Europe but who has now become our President and CEO of International, could not be more excited to welcome Gavin Patterson who was the Chief Executive Officer of BT, headquartered in London and when you look at our total management team that Keith and I have built together that you have to be awfully proud of this group and I think it is the finest management team in the software technology industry maybe any industry but also our Board of Directors as part of that. I'll tell you they are phenomenal and our management team that doesn't include the people that I mentioned. We have so many amazing executives. I could go on and on. And they would love me to by the way. So I hope that answers the question. And I also want to just say [Foreign Language] Keith, which in Hawaii, we say to good friends because we know we will see them soon. Operator : The next question is from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. RaimoLenschow: Keith, all the best from me as well. I wanted to double click on the vertical and progress you made this year. Vlocity is obviously helping, and maybe you can double click on that a little bit as well. But like can you speak to what you saw in the verticals this quarter? Thank you. KeithBlock: Well, I think you know it's always been a passion of mine and certainly of Marc's that we had a huge focus on speaking the language of the customer and the importance of industries. Approximately three years ago, we launched some incredible innovation with Financial Services Cloud as well as our Health Cloud. And we had some amazing wins in the quarter associated with both of those. Now when you think about the capability of Vlocity and what Vlocity brings to the table, I mean this is an organization of people who've been in the industry for a long time. Marc mentioned David Schmaier. They have deep, deep, deep industry and domain expertise. So this will really strengthen and accelerate and broaden the capabilities that Salesforce has in the verticals. And when you really think about speaking the language of the customers and the importance of these verticals, this is where you start getting into running the mission-critical processes of a company. And as great as our strategic relationships have been, this will further deepen them. So I think it's an incredible acquisition. I think it's going to be a huge adds to the company. There's no question that our joint customers pre-acquisition view this as very, very close partners. So I'm very, very optimistic about the impact that Vlocity will have on the company. MarcBenioff: Yes. And let me I'll just double down on that by I don't double click because I use a phone, so I don't know what to say exactly or how am I supposed to touch or double touch or but I think Keith has really inspired us to be much more committed to verticals and vertical solutions than ever before. He's going to be a huge part of the legacy here. And of course, you know about our Financial Services Cloud and our Health Care Cloud, our focus on the government, our vertical solutions team, which is also, based in Seattle near our Tableau headquarters. And now with Vlocity, well, many of these executives we have worked with and worked together with for maybe 30 years or more, we know them extremely well. We were [Technical Difficulty] with us to create this company.  I'm especially excited that David Schmaier is coming into Salesforce. He's one of the finest executives who I've worked with, and I couldn't be more excited about amplifying the vertical strategy with them. And I'm sure we'll have many more things that we'll be ready to announce that have honestly been inspired by Keith's tremendous vision and passion toward taking our incredible platform but delivering it by industry and also, as Keith said so well, in the language of our customers, which is something he's just done a beautiful job executing in the company. Operator : The next question is from Kash Rangan from Bank of America. KashRangan: Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Keith, on a tremendous chapter in your journey at Salesforce. Marc, I have a question for you. This is obviously a really big step, and given that Keith's been running some critical functions in the company, go to market, sure, Keith was working on some $10-plus million, $100-plus million deals, and I'm curious to get your thoughts, Marc, on how you're going to be managing the transition risk with the quarterly execution going forward in the next couple of quarters, granted that Keith's staying on in an advisory capacity, but clearly, a lot has changed the last four years since he took over that critical function. And I would assume that you will be bringing onboard somebody and doing that part of the job yourself in the interim, but please help me out with those assumptions and much appreciate your response. Thank you so much. MarcBenioff: Well, I think that Keith would be the first to say that he has built a world-class distribution team that goes across the world. When we promoted Keith to Co-CEO, one of the things that he said to me is he wanted to get out of the business of running the Salesforce. That's been something that we've worked to do. Through that, we have built an incredible distribution management team with some of the best executives in the world who are go-to-market. And I don't think you're going to find a better team who can execute on that in the same way that we have a great technology team. The other half of any software company is the distribution team. I would give both teams A plus, and I couldn't be more excited about their capability to go forward and execute our business plan. KeithBlock: Yes, Marc, I would just add, Kash that we all work hard here but we all work hard as an executive team and a management team. And sitting around this table, one of the things that I think everybody would say is that we all care about our customers and everybody sells. It's not just one person. And I've been around a lot of go-to-market teams, as you know, and there's no question, this is the finest one in the industry. It's certainly the finest one I've ever seen. So I think what I believe is that we've got a team that is clearly executing in Q4 and ready to execute in Q1 and beyond. And it's enormously talented and motivated. So this is not about one person. This is about a machine and a culture that was launched by Marc and Parker nearly 21 years ago, and I'm very confident in their ability to continue this going. Operator : The next question is from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. BradZelnick: Great, thank you so much. And Keith, congrats on another phenomenal run. I truly wish you the best in the next chapter, and we look forward to learning more when you're ready to share that with us. But my question is for Marc Benioff. It's a bigger picture question. Marc, I believe Salesforce is 21 years old this month if I've got my math right. And to the notion that people overestimate what can be accomplished in the near term and underestimate the long term, what are your greatest surprises relative to what you set out to do 21 years ago? And as you look forward, what do you think Salesforce can accomplish in the next 20 years? [Indiscernible] I was just going to say as a platform for change, what's the greatest impact you can hope to achieve in the next couple of decades? MarcBenioff: Well, I'm going to turn that over to Parker Harris, my co-founder, because he's been a huge influence on our leadership, and I don't think he's been on an earnings call before and excited that he's in the room, and I feel like I need to ask him. Parker, what does the future hold? ParkerHarris: Well, I think one of the questions was what's the biggest surprise. I think one of the biggest surprises when Marc and I started Salesforce, there was one definition of CRM 21 years ago, and that definition has evolved over the past 2-plus decades. And it's been driven by the Fourth Industrial Revolution in terms of all these new technologies, and we continue to strive to stay ahead of that trend, both with our organic innovation as well as with the incredible acquisitions that we've done to create the Customer 360 and a single source of truth. It's been our mission our entire career so far and we will continue on going forward. I'll pass it back to Marc in terms of the impact that Salesforce as a company can have on changing the world. I'm so proud of Marc personally at Davos this year and watching the story of the Trillion Trees project and the impact that we can have on the globe and what a huge vision that is. And a lot of that is thanks to my co-founder, Marc. MarcBenioff: Well, Parker, I couldn't be more grateful to you. You've been a great co-founder and have been there every step of the way. I think that probably for both of us, we had three visions when we started the company : One was a new technology model, which the cloud that has become mainstream; One was new business model, which was selling software as a subscription; and the third was a new philanthropic model, which was our 1-1-1 model, which has evolved into our deep beliefs in stakeholder capitalism, our core values of trust and customer success and innovation and equality, our dream that the work that we do at Salesforce is repeated in values and ethics and other companies that we inspire other companies also to improve the state of the world. Those are all very important parts of Salesforce. You mentioned visions like one trillion trees, where we hope to sequester 208 gigatons of carbon over the next decade, where we've partnered with several governments, including the European governments, the U.S. government, Chinese government, Colombian government and others. These things are extremely important to us. We are in a planetary emergency. We need to be taking care of our environment. We all need to be focused on becoming net zero as companies and organizations, which Salesforce is. We all need to focus on sequestering the 280 gigatons of carbon that have been emitted into the atmosphere since 1750. We need to get all the plastic out of the ocean between before 2050, where there'll be more plastic than fish. These are important visions for the environment. We need to show how companies can unleash their good, like we talked about in the script, whether it's volunteerism or grants or working with schools or whether it's gender equality, where we're deeply committed to paying men and women equally for equal work that we believe in the equality of every human being and that we can be an example of a company at scale on how to bring our values to the world, and we can work with governments of all types. We can work with companies. And that's the mission that we have as a management team, as an executive team, that we want to build be a company that builds great products, which Parker has done, but also be ethical in our behavior and realize the power that has given us as a company as great and that we need to do that. I think that we have the opportunity to work with now so many chief executives all over the world. Keith mentioned a deal that we did this quarter, Volkswagen. And Brad and I met with Dr. Diess, the CEO of Volkswagen, as we're getting ready to close the deal at the World Economic Forum in Davos. These are important partnerships that we have to influence other companies, not just Volkswagen but the hundreds of other companies that we met, for example, in Davos, sort of that we'll meet this quarter all over the world. We hope to inspire them and influence them in these areas. This is an important part of Salesforce and what we're doing. So I would say that if I was to have the greatest surprise, it was that those three visions all came true, that we're a $21 billion in revenue this year. But for sure, we have a dream that's much greater than that. We've given guidance of $35 billion. The company can be bigger. But just building a company to do more revenue is not what we are about, nor is it what we've ever been about in this company. The deals are important. The revenue is very important. Improving the operating margin is very important. The cash flow is extremely important. The business metrics are important because it shows that you can do good and do well at the same time, that this is an important part of who we are as a company. That's at our very core. That's what stakeholder capitalism is, that we can serve our shareholders and our stakeholders. I think that that will become amplified in a world where things seem increasingly crazy. We all see what's going on in the world. There's no mystery. And Salesforce is an incredible company to take that forward. So we want to deliver outstanding business performance and shareholder return, and at the same time, we want to deliver world-class stakeholder return to inspire companies to do all of those things. Operator : Your last question is from Jennifer Lowe from UBS. JenniferLowe: Great, thank you. And I'll add to the course of best wishes for Keith in your next endeavors. I had two questions, but they're related, one, just a quick one for Mark Hawkins. You gave us the revenue impact for Vlocity, but I'd be curious what the margin impact from that transaction was. And then more broadly, the second part is at Analyst Day three months ago, there was discussion around taking time to digest between deals. Tableau officially, officially closed three months ago, where you got the go-ahead to integrate. Now we're seeing another acquisition. It's not as big as Tableau, but it's certainly not a small one either. I'm just curious to get an update on where the mindset is on M&A going forward from here. MarcBenioff: Well, I think I'd really like to address that because I think we so strongly believe that we actually do need an acquisition pause after Tableau. It was, by far, the biggest deal we've ever done, significant and far more exciting than we could have ever imagined. The partnership has been incredible. And I don't think we anticipated doing even a small deal like because Vlocity is a relatively small transaction. But in our relationship with Vlocity and the way that we originally invested in the company, it created a situation for acquisition that we needed to take advantage of and which is why we have acquired it at a very attractive price because we have been partners with them from the very beginning. And this was a moment in time, I think, that we don't see some huge opportunity to do a lot more acquisitions right now. It's not something that we're working on. We're very much working right now on the execution of our business and the execution of our fiscal year 2021 business plan. We have written what we call our V2MOM, which is our business plan for the year. We have, two weeks ago, brought our executive management team together, our top 600 officers. We have presented it to them, and they we have instructed them to execute it. And we feel very good about that plan, and we feel very good about where we are. We don't anticipate any major acquisitions in the short term. And maybe, Mark, you'd like to fill in some details. MarkHawkins: Sure. Yes, I think I totally agree with those comments. I think, also, Jennifer, in terms of the margin impact on Vlocity, without getting specific, it's obviously dilutive. When you do purchase accounting and the write-downs and such, you should think about it in that way, for sure, but we haven't elected to go specific on that one. End of Q&A Evan Goldstein : Great.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Mr. Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Evan Goldstein : Thanks, Josh. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2021 first quarter results conference call. I'm Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; Bret Taylor, President and COO; Gavin Patterson, President and CEO of International; Brian Millham, President, Customer Success Group and Amy Weaver, President and Chief Legal Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In particular our expectations are on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that of our customers and partners are uncertain and subject to change. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that, let me hand the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Okay. Thank you so much Evan and thank you everybody for being on the call today. I hope you and your families, and colleagues are all healthy and safe. We're in a moment in time, anything any of us well that we've ever experienced. And for instance, usually I'm speaking to you from the top of Salesforce tower, but today I'm speaking to you from my home, as I suspect many of you are in your home as well. It's another reminder of how the pandemic has dramatically affected all of us, our customers and our humanity in ways that we could have never imagined. And my heart is with everyone who has been affected by this virus, especially those who have lost loved ones. This pandemic is revealing the culture and the core values of every company. And those of you who have followed us closely know that Salesforce always been deeply committed to serving all of our stakeholders. While we have really lived this for two decades and especially over the last 90 days. The foundation of our company is our four core values; trust, customer success, innovation and equality. And first and foremost, among these is the trust that we have with all of our stakeholders. The story of our first quarter is very much the story of trust. Salesforce in Ohana, rapidly taking action to embrace and invest in all of our stakeholders. Indeed, our financial results for the first quarter reflect the unprecedented long-term investment that we've made in our employees and our customers, and also our communities. And as our fiscal year began, we were coming off an amazing fourth quarter. It capped off another record year for Salesforce, in February, the first month of our first quarter of fiscal year 2021 builds continued an amazing growth trajectory. By mid-March of course and all of you know, the virus emerged into this global, biological and economic crisis. The company could address three priorities in support of our stakeholders. Keeping our employees healthy and safe, guiding our customers to navigate this incredibly challenging situation and supporting our communities around the world. We view through this pandemic in three phases. The first 90 day phase has been about rapid response and investing in all of our stakeholders. We're now entering the second phase, reopening safely. And the third phase, which we believe will enter next year will be about a new normal. And I want to spend a few minutes on the actions we took during the first quarter and phase one. First we've invested in our employees, their health, their wellbeing, while this remains our highest priority. We closed 160 offices around the world in a moment's notice, guided all of our 52,000 employees to work from their homes. We settled in remote work situations and with our amazing sales force \u2013 extremely smooth \u2013 Salesforce, very effectively anywhere, even from our homes. And we found that the overall situation was taking its toll on many of our employees mental health as they sequestered into their own homes. As it has been for many people all over the world and so we invested in mental health and mindfulness programs to help them. Our core program B-Well Together, which was initially just designed for our employees, while we've had to open that up publicly to all of our customers of the whole world, because of public demand. We also invested in our employees financial stability. We committed to no significant layoffs for the first 90 days of the crisis and in late March, we also gave certainty to our sales team for the onetime guaranteed commission for the first quarter, which we knew would close at the height of the crisis, giving them tremendous confidence in our ability to take care of them. This was a critical investment in the long-term success of our amazing distribution organization. And we invested in our communities, in early March, we're asked by Sam Hawgood, the Chancellor of UCSF to help him acquire PPE. UCSF was already running low on PPE, Chancellor Hawgood was looking for ways to protect his doctors and nurses and other frontline workers, but the fact then I have to tell you, I didn't even know what PPE was. It turned into a much larger and more critical effort of almost overnight. And as we received many requests from hospitals, nursing homes, essential businesses, the CEOs of some of our largest customers calling us in dire need while in partnership with UCSF, we helped to acquire, distribute more than 50 million pieces of PPE to over 300 hospitals and first responders globally. And just one example, Salesforce sent a 767 loaded with PPE to New York city at the very height of the crisis, masks and gloves, and aprons that we acquired were they were immediately delivered to the state distribution hub at Javits Center. And I'm deeply grateful for our relationship with Daniel Zhang, the CEO of Alibaba, who helped get this started and make sure that we got the PPE that we so badly needed here. At the same time, we've donated funding employee volunteer time services to those most in need, focusing on access to care, loss livelihoods, food insecurity, and the digital divide. This pandemic has exposed deep structural inequalities across our society that we can't ignore. We can see that on TV right now. But at Salesforce, our core values include our commitment to the equality of every human being and this will be part of our work going forward as it has been for all of us. Well, we also invested in our customers actually quite dramatically. Even with our employees working from home, our culture of innovation continues to thrive cloying new products to help customers at this critical moment in time. I was especially inspired by the productivity of our incredible engineering organization and talking with CEOs all over the world, it became apparent very quickly that many were looking to Salesforce to help them guide through these unchartered waters. Companies were working from home, leaders have little visibility in their businesses, no way to easily connect with their remote employees, customers or partners and they turned to Salesforce. Some of our customers most severely affected by the unprecedented impact of COVID-19, we've even granted them a temporary financial flexibility, but we also created free rapid response Salesforce Care products that help companies work to sell the service to market from their homes. And we've already had more than 38,000 signups for Salesforce Care led by versions of Salesforce Essentials and Salesforce Quip, that's been amazing. Our Salesforce Care industry solutions for healthcare and manufacturing, what they\u2019ve provided proved to be crucial for many companies. They're scaling up services. They handle increased demand for patient management, pivoting to much needed PPE, ventilators in their factories. Tableau, they were amazing, they built this incredible free analytics platform, the Tableau Data Hub, tracking the virus and being used by dozens of URLs. You can see it at [indiscernible] and you know with Tableau Data Hub, New York state posted a set of dashboards that provide us testing and confirm case data and that data is also used by Governor Cuomo during his daily briefings. We're able to do all this because our Salesforce platform provides the agility, the flexibility, the speed, great solutions not in months or years, but in weeks, even days and when everyone's sheltered-in-place. We saw tremendous growth also in our Commerce Cloud's weekly order volume and our Einstein Bot sessions, both that were up more than a 100% in February 1. Einstein predictions increased five times over this time since last year. We also had an amazing job of captioning, pivoting from physical events to virtual events. We developed an online leadership program called Leading Through Change. It's had over 75 million views so far, incredible. Program highlights the work our customers have been doing during this crisis. It gives them inspiration and guidance and also shows some Salesforce solutions that are available to help them get their jobs done. It's included phenomenal speakers like the CEO of Starbucks, Kevin Johnson, and also the CEO of Accenture, Julie Sweet, many more. And as the virus continued to spread throughout March, Governor Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island, Gina's amazing. She needed a way to manage her critical contact tracing, which would enable her States help spread and isolate anyone exposed. So this became an opt-in manual process with a citizen can report that they've been tested for COVID-19 and I identify anyone else they contact and be notified of their potential exposure to the virus and isolate themselves. Governor Raimondo inspired us to build an app that managed this process in scale efficiently and reliably. We're on the phone with her many times and so we did it in just a few weeks on the Salesforce platform and in additional Rhode Island today, we're now helping more than 30 States reduce the spread of COVID-19 including Maryland and Massachusetts, Kentucky, Louisiana, California, and great cities in our country like New York city and other countries too. So this is incredibly important effort. We're developing the contact tracing apps for Rhode Island. We saw \u2013 we need to deliver several products now to mitigate the spread of the virus and we needed to do it rapidly, not only for our public sector clients, but for our commercial clients as well. Customers are asking for automation to facilitate the return to work safely, including the contact tracing, shift scheduling, workforce assessment, a command center for the crisis. And this was the genesis of our work.com platform, which has rapidly become a significant part of our public sector pipeline. And actually we've been hugely surprised. And while all of this was happening, we also delivered $4.87 billion in revenue. We delivered $1.86 billion in operating cash flow. Now that was down slightly over a year to many of the actions that I just reviewed in response to pandemic. And as I mentioned earlier, we also provided some customers temporary financial flexibility. We also incurred some incremental business expenses such as the onetime commission guarantee for our sales team that I mentioned. We expect these expenses to be largely, I would say wholly encapsulated in the first quarter. We have great confidence that our investments, we already see it in our employees, our customers, our communities in the first quarter, well they're benefiting us, they're benefiting us now in the short-term, the long-term with tremendous strength and tremendous growth. And for the fiscal year 2021 we're updating our guide to approximately $20 billion representing 17% projected growth year-over-year. And we believe this guide is very appropriate given the current biological and economic environment worldwide. Our ability to execute globally with speed to the adverse conditions of March and April, well, I'll tell you that gave us tremendous confidence. We can operate successfully in any environment at any time, it was incredible. We demonstrated that we have the ability to innovate and meet rapidly changing customer demands and needs under any circumstance. And the last few months affirm the strengths we have in our amazing customer relations \u2013 innovative scale and operate across different industries and geographies, companies of all sizes and with Customer 360, the most complete CRM product portfolio mission of any company I was excited to see in the quarter. And for the seventh year in a row, IDC has ranked Salesforce as the number one CRM. We gain more share in 2019 and we're now seeing continuous improvement in our pipeline month to-date. Well, we've been really surprised and our pipelines for the second quarter \u2013 I've been on more sales calls with more CEOs in the last two months than at any time my career. And there's universal agreement among them. Digital transformation, while this isn't a one app, it's a must have, company isn't organizations and governments around the world have a digital transformation imperative like never before. And many of them are accelerating their plans for digital first work from anywhere environment. For example, in Q1 we signed a incredible and extensive deal with AT&T with the vision of AT&T Communications, CEO Jeff McElfresh, a incredible executive, somebody who's just been completely inspiring to me, while AT&T is moving to a highly accelerated digital first world to deliver the most amazing 5G service with an incredible connected experience for their millions of customers and subscribers across every customer touch point. And this includes their media properties such as DIRECTV and HBO, and Turner Sports and more, but with Salesforce, AT&T will further extend this vision of a single view of their customer, single source of truth really, with every customer touch point federated on Customer 360 across retail sales and call centers on messaging and online and in home service and more, only Salesforce could do that. Every customer touchpoint, the AT&T truck pulls up to my office or my home that's going to be Salesforce and I walk into AT&T store and that's going to be Salesforce, and I'm getting an email from AT&T that's going to be Salesforce and I'm on the phone with the AT&T call center that's going to be Salesforce and we're going to make sure that they have that Customer 360 enhanced. And I'll tell you when we're integrating all that data with MuleSoft, it's going to connect AT&T\u2019s different backend systems. Tableau is giving them the ability to understand customer preferences. Einstein is going to help them serve more intelligent recommendations and route service cases. I was on the phone just yesterday with Jeff McElfresh reviewing the incredible progress of the project. And it was clear to me this is going to empower AT&T to drive more value and build stronger relationships with every customer. And we're going to begin deploying this with Jeff and his team, the AT&T\u2019s employees, very, very shortly. Our goal is by the end of July. And then to tens of thousands of users in the third quarter. We're thrilled to have also significantly expanded our 15 year partnership with Standard Bank group, the largest bank in Africa. It operates across 20 markets, it's an incredibly important banks to the African economy. Standard Bank is going to leverage the full power of our Customer 360 including the Financial Services Cloud, the Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud, MuleSoft and Einstein to provide that single view of the customer to build personalized customer journeys and deliver amazing client experiences in retail banking across all channels. And when the livelihoods of Zions Bank customers were threatened by COVID-19, well the Utah based bank turned to Salesforce and Customer 360 to virtually support a high volume of loan requests. They're using our customer communities and our service cloud to facilitate conversations with customers, automate applications processing, provide tracking and visibility to customers waiting for their loans. Zions Bank stood up this loan application portal in seven days, even though the 38th largest bank in the U.S., it became the ninth largest distributor of SBA Payroll Protection Program funds in round one using Salesforce\u2019s Customer 360 platform. One of our ISV partners nCino, well they built an end-to-end solution for federal SBA CARES Act loans for small businesses all on Salesforce and it processed more than $35 billion in loan applications for its banking customers, including KeyBank. IBERIABANK, the world's largest credit union, the Navy Federal Credit Union, all running on Salesforce Customer 360. And one of the unique aspects of COVID-19 crisis is the deepening our ties with the local and federal governments around the world. But public sector action has never been greater. I mean, I can't believe how many phone calls I've been on with Governors. In the public sector, a number of our government customers or agencies, if you will, they chose Salesforce in the quarter to begin helping them address COVID-19 related issues, including some of the very largest federal agencies. At the state level, we formed office of emergency services. They implemented Salesforce to create the public health ordering system, an application consumer helps the state leverage data that urgently needed public health resources across California improved customer service. It did it in days and the U.S. Census Bureau, they expanded their long time relationship with Tableau as the agency's data analysis with a visualization platform of choice. Tableau partners with the Census Bureau on mission critical data applications in support of the 2020 census and beyond, so important. Internationally, we also had an incredible deal with Commonwealth of Australia, where we partnered with the National Disability Insurance Authority to deliver and improved experience for more than 500,000 participants that are predicated to access disability support by 2025. Those are some of the highlights from Q1. Now looking ahead, if much of the world is beginning to move now into Phase 2, we like to call reopening safely. Our Work.com platform is going to become a \u2013 well, it's going to fill a huge unmet need, step-by-step we're seeing the economy is starting to come back to life. Salesforce is also beginning to reopen its offices first throughout Asia. It has to be done safely, got to be done responsibly and it's going to be a complex process and the new normal businesses are going to have a new lifestyle, a new lifestyle of man, life style of taking people's temperatures and enforcing social distances standards, a new lifestyle of testing and contact tracing and a new lifestyle of wellness assessments to mitigate interaction of the virus. You can see some of the photos on my Twitter feed of our employees\u2019 preventative just 90 days ago. We're going to need a command center to monitor return to work readiness. They're going to need shifts scheduling because businesses are not going to bring everyone back at once. They're not all coming back at once that you're going to need social distancing and you're going to need tools for emergency response management and you're going to need expert perspectives from renown experts because this is changing on a regular basis and from our incredible ecosystem and tools and workforce reskilling. We've bundled all that in to this Work.com suite. You can see at Work.com, you can see what we built, how we're starting to roll it out, who our partners are. It's a platform for enabling our customers to reopen safely. And it's because it's built on our customer 360 platform, we're able to spin up this entirely new generation of apps in a matter of weeks, amazing, and I just have to give credit where credit is due, the Governor, Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island. It was her call to us early on in the crisis that inspired us to build Work.com. She was the visionary that said, we need information technology to mitigate what's happening with the virus until we have a vaccine. Well, I'll tell you at times, even though we have nearly 52,000 people at Salesforce, creating Work.com felt like many of our early startup days with the speed and scrappiness, the laser focused execution of our management team. It was, this was the best I've ever seen Salesforce and we're already returning to work. We're starting to see the return on this investment now. It's amazing in a very short time, Work.com has generated an enormous interest from businesses and governments at every level from our partnerships and with Work.com, when we deep in those partnerships with the world's largest systems integrators, including Accenture, Deloitte, PwC and IBM and many of our partners are now building solutions on Work.com as well. It's incredible to see what they've done with risk management and compliance and business continuity and just yesterday workday announced that it's going to integrate its employee data directly into Work.com to make it easier for employers to centralize critical data and get their businesses up and running again. We've enabled and trained all of our sales people worldwide to be able to talk to our customers and how to reopen safely with Work.com. I've been thrilled and I'm so thrilled also, especially in my Workday partnership with [indiscernible]. That's just an amazing company and to make Work.com even more valuable, so many of our joint customers. So thank you Neil [ph] for that. In the months ahead, I expect Work.com ecosystem to rapidly become even more robust with even more relevant solutions. I've had so many of our customers contact us on how they can integrate their own products into Work.com that's so cool and as we move deeper into Phase 2, Work.com is going to become extremely important to all of our customers. We have learned from this crisis just as we have every time, we have been faced with major challenges as well. We saw once again how our values create value. We've seen how our agility and our beginner's mind has enabled us to quickly pivot and take action. And we made investments during Q1 to confront this once in a generation calamity, focusing on our employees, delivering relevant innovation for customers and supporting our communities with PPE, grants and technology. We could do all this because the proven strength and sustainability of our extraordinary business model and our extraordinary technology and our extraordinary Ohana. We know that when we invest in all of our stakeholders, we're building the trust, the relationships, the innovation, and our business for the long term. Pandemic has shown that digital is the lifeblood for every organization whether you're a public sector, state, country, or whether you're a commercial organization or a nonprofit or an NGO. The new normal Phase 3 is going to require organizations of all sizes, shapes, geographies. Well, everyone's going to have to adopt new ways of conducting themselves and especially their customer relationships, especially their sales and services, especially their marketing and commerce and especially new ways of collaborating and re-skilling workers, every company is going to have to digitally transform. Fortune's recent survey of Fortune 500 companies found three quarters CEOs, well, they believe this crisis is going to force their companies to accelerate their technological transformation. I mentioned Jeff McElfresh of AT&T. Well, he is the first one who said that to me. He was the first one that got on the phone with me and said, we're going to accelerate our digital transformation at AT&T. And I believe that Salesforce has never been more relevant or more mission critical. The more organizations, no one is better positioned than Salesforce to accelerate out of this crisis and bring customers into the new normal. Now before I turn it over to Mark, I want to make sure you've heard, Gavin Patterson, the former CEO of BT Group and our current President, CEO of International will be our new President and Chief Revenue Officer beginning August 1. And you've already heard of one of Gavin's amazing deals and I hope he'll talk about that later on the call, but I'm still thrilled to have Gavin as a member of the team. He's just an amazing executive. We've been friends for many years and he's already had a huge impact on our company and on our management team. And I'm could not be happier for Gavin, but I couldn't be happier for Salesforce and all of our Ohana. They were able to have his experience and his capability as part of our organization. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Mark. Mark Hawkins : Okay, well, thank you, Marc. And before I begin you guys, I want to express my thoughts and my best wishes for everyone's safety and wellbeing during this historic time. I'd like to focus my remarks on providing additional disclosures and commentary and the company's response to the COVID pandemic and our updated fiscal 2021 guidance. As Marc said, our actions in Q1 were focused on investing in our employees, our customers, our community and response to COVID 19 and preparing for post pandemic future. We continue to believe that values drive value and these Q1 investments and all of our stakeholders will result in long-term equity. We want to provide visibility into how our actions in response to COVID-19 affected our financials in Q1 as well as our updated guidance. I'll begin with a top line commentary. Revenue for Q1 was $4.865 billion, up 30% over last year. We saw good revenue performance by cloud. Our Sales Cloud grew 16% and approximately four points from significant M&A. Service Cloud grew 23% with two points from significant M&A, platform and other grew 62% with 35 points from significant M&A and marketing and commerce grew 27% with four points from significant M&A. Additionally, we had strong year-over year-revenue performance by region in constant currency. Americas grew 29% with 11 points from significant M&A. EMEA grew 41% with 12 points from significant M&A and Asia Pac grew 28%. Additionally, we were pleased to have maintained a revenue attrition rate of less than 9% at the end of the quarter. In fact, this is actually down year-over-year and in line sequentially. This speaks to the diversity of size, industry and geography within our customer base as well as how mission critical our products are to our customers. As always, we continue to monitor this metric closely to determine how the COVID pandemic may impact our customer base going forward. Our performance \u2013 our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenues under contract ended the first quarter at approximately $29.3 billion, up 18% over last year. And as a reminder, this metric includes both new business and renewal contracts. In Q1 these contracts were approximately three months shorter in duration on average compared to Q1 of last year. And we believe this is a result of the COVID pandemic and we expect this to normalize in the future. Please note that the contract we signed with AT&T entirely resides in non-current portion of RPO as our updated revenue guidance assuming there's no contribution from AT&T in FY 2021. Our current remaining performance obligation or CRPO which has all the future revenue that is under contract and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was approximately $14.5 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Turning to EPS and operating margin. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.11 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.70 and there are a few items I'd like to discuss as they pertain to the Q1 objective of investing in our employees, our customers, and our community in response to COVID-19 and preparing for the future, which we believe will lead to an even stronger business and company. First, the onetime partial commission guarantee, I discussed earlier was approximately $140 million. As a partial commission guarantee makes it not eligible for capitalization, this expense will reside in Q1 and not in the future periods, given how sudden and severe the pandemic arrival was in March. We chose to take powerful action to care for our employees through this crisis. Second, due to the cancellation of our physical events, this fiscal year in favor of virtual experiences, all event contracts that included cancellation fees for fiscal 2021 commitments were expensed in the quarter. This amounts to approximately $65 million. We are working with these vendors to renegotiate these contracts as we pivot to digital virtual experiences which means we could see some partial reversal later in the year. Thirdly, we incurred approximately $25 million in onetime lease impairments due to vacating and subleasing offices that will likely return below market rent due to the COVID pandemic. And finally, we prioritize caring for our community by donated approximately $20 million which came in the form of PP&E and cash grants. These unique and mostly one time variable items were partially offset by approximately $75 million in savings, largely PP&E due to shelter in place orders. But none of these items created an approximately 350 basis points of headwind to operating margin compared to our expectations in the quarter. Regarding our strategic investments, we recorded approximately $192 million in realized and unrealized gains. This was driven by significant realized gains on the sale of public securities, partially offset by unrealized losses within the investment portfolio. Turn into cash flow. Operating cash flow was $1.86 billion, which was largely impacted by delayed payments from customers while sheltering in place and some temporary financial flexibility that we granted to certain customers that were most affected by the COVID pandemic. We expect to collect the majority of the balance this year and do not expect us to have an impact on our full year cash flow. In addition, we previously described this partial commission guarantee also created a headwind to our operating cash flow. Should we not have incurred these items above, our Q1 growth rate would be consistent with historical rate. CapEx for the quarter was $323 million leading to free cash flow defined as operating cash flow, less CapEx of $1.54 billion down 15% year-over-year. Turn into guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2021. Revenue is now expected to be $4.89 billion to $4.90 billion in Q2 and approximately $20 billion for the fiscal year. The latter, which continues to include $50 million contribution from velocity, which is expected to close on June 1. There are two important assumptions reflected within the guidance that stem from our assumptions that the IT spending growth normalizes next year, which we believe to be appropriately conservative and consistent with our learnings as we successfully navigated through the great financial crisis. First, our guidance assumes our revenue attrition rises from less than 9% now to less than 10% temporarily for the rest of the fiscal year. Second, the guidance reflects the adjustment to incremental new business expectations that we made due to the COVID pandemic. Another important consideration when thinking about our FY 2021 guide is the magnitude of the above when applied for a term license products, As a reminder, the term license revenue product typically records approximately 50% of the contracts TCV [ph] immediately to revenue with a remaining balance recorded ratably over the contract term. This accounting treatment I can create uneven revenue trends between fiscal periods as you saw during half two of FY 2020 has helped drive the revenue out performance in those quarters. Additionally, we are pleased to have experienced improving trends within our pipeline and closed rates between March through today, which leaves us incrementally optimistic about the future. In fact, April was better than we anticipated would be when we started that month. We continue to see additional positive trends in May. For Q2, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be minus $0.02 to minus $0.01, while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $0.66 to $0.67. For fiscal 2021, we're expecting GAAP diluted EPS to be minus $0.06 to minus $0.04 while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $2.93 to $2.95. And why did the COVID depend on that and our actions in Q1 to support our customers, employees, and communities. We expect our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be roughly flat year-over-year on a percentage basis. As we prepare for the future, our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2021 includes incremental discipline and prudence, especially in regards to headcount, largely due to lower employee attrition rate than plan. As always, we continue to monitor our go-to-market capacity to ensure we allocate the appropriate investments to achieve our targets both this year and in the future. For the remainder of the year, we are focused on making ourselves even stronger upon exiting the pandemic. As a reminder, our EPS guidance assumes no future contribution for mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. For operating cash flow, we're reducing our fiscal 2021 operating cash flow guidance to 10% to 11% year-over-year growth to align with our updated revenue and margin guide. We do not expect to provide incremental temporary financial flexibility. We now expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal 2021 resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 13% to 14% for the fiscal year. We expect CRPO to be approximately 16% to 17% growth year-over-year and the second quarter, which we believe is appropriately conservative and consistent with our revenue guide. In light of uncertainty surrounding the COVID pandemic, we are reassessing our long-term revenue target for fiscal 2024 and we're planning on giving an update during the investor day. To close while the COVID pandemic was sudden and a once in a generation crisis, we are proud of the investments and relationships we have deepened with our customers, our community, and our employees. We are confident in our actions and these investments will lead to an even stronger business and company in the future. And as we move into Phase 2, we are strategically well poised with a strong balance sheet and a durable business model. We are well positioned to continue to leverage the secular tailwind to drive digital transformation. I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, our communities, and our shareholder \u2013 all our shareholders for the continued support. And I wish each of you and your families and your firms\u2019 safety and wellness. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question withdraw your question, please press the pound key. And you first question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Yes, thank you Mark. The second week of November should be an interesting one. I am wondering what Einstein might be telling you about a virtual Dreamforce 2020. Some of us on the call have attended every single one in person that Moscone center. And so just with it going virtual, curious how you're going to maximize the impact of Dreamforce so it provides the inspiration that it's known for and also that \u2013 so that it drives the pipeline for Q4 and beyond. Marc Benioff : Well, that's such a good question and I'll tell you that, of course Dreamforce has been such an incredible part of our culture that we're all going to miss Dreamforce this year, but you may see that we've already started some amazing things online and we're getting some phenomenal results. In fact, we have, I mentioned we've already had more than 75 million views and I think we're having almost soon a 100 million views of our leading through change program. And I don't know if you've had the opportunity to watch or participate in leading through change, but it's been incredible. And that type of virtual program I believe is very much going to be something that is going to be a permanent part of our culture. We've really been able to inspire our customers and our employees, all of our Ohana, including our account executives and enable them with these programs. And while we're certainly going to miss being together at Dreamforce this year, and that's not something that, any of us could have imagined just 90 days ago, I think that we now see a very clear path to be able to, have virtual events, build pipeline, build community, build brand, create, deliver new products. And I have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute without a physical Dreamforce this year. And not just Dreamforce by the way, we \u2013 as Mark mentioned, we cancelled all of our physical events for this year and we had to pay an extremely large amount of cancellation fees that all got tossed into that first quarter number. And so all those world tours and all these other amazing events, we do a thousand events a year. We're just moving as many of them to the virtual programs as well. And not just the big events, there's lots of small things happening. So we've got a whole new playbook that we're executing. It's a great question. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Terry Tillman with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Terry Tillman : Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess my question relates to, it's great seeing the AT&T win. It seems like great example of the digital transformation opportunities but with customer 360 and these larger transformational deals, Marc, maybe you could give us an update. You talked about strengthening pipeline. How does some of these larger transformational deals, how do you see that playing out the rest of the year? Or is that some of that business harder to come by just because it is more complex. Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, I'll give you the beginning of the answer and then, I've been very fortunate this quarter to have Brian Millham running our global distribution organization. He is also running it in the second quarter while we're bringing Gavin on board. And Brian's been with us for more than 20 years. Many of, Brian, he's really been the heart and soul of our distribution cultures has done a phenomenal job this quarter. And I think that this what we see reminds us a lot of \u2013 over a lot of different times in the last 20 years in Salesforce where you have to have a full portfolio of products and deals, small, medium and large that, there's an ebb and flow. You're never going to make your number on all large deals or all small deals. You have to have a portfolio of transactions and you have to have that across geographies, products, segments, verticals, and that's one thing I've been super proud of the distribution organization, their ability to deliver that and then to see that start to manifest in these really strong pipeline. So Brian, do you want to comment on that? Brian Millham : Yes Marc, I think we made the comment earlier that strengthening of our pipeline over the last couple of weeks here has been very encouraging for us. And that strength that pipeline comes in all forms, as you said, it comes from different segments of our market, different regions of our markets, our products. And so we're very encouraged by the future, both the large deals and the small deals that we're getting done across our incredible distribution organization. So very, very encouraged as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sarah Hindlian : Yes. Hi, thank you so much for taking my question and I hope everybody is well. I guess my first question is for you, Marc. You guys are talking about this nice pickup in the pipeline and I'd love a little bit more color about what you're seeing that is that across certain vertical markets, products, enterprise, commercial, and then I have a followup for Mark Hawkins. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks. So I'm going to have Bret Taylor comment on that, because he and I were just talking about that today and we've been so inspired by, kind of connecting the first question, a lot of our programs that we put in place, and I'll tell you the four dimensions that we've been really focusing on. Of course, we have a very large scale distribution organization. I would say it's more than half of our company. You think about that in terms of all the customer facing organization. Number one, the most important thing is to get everyone, especially when you move to an at-home environment is participating. Participation has been mission critical and that's really where we focus. What percentage of those sales and service professionals, managers, executives are out there and really working with customers. And this is an unusual environment that provides opportunity for lots of new training, new \u2013 kind of new ideas, new programs. And the second thing is to enable them with that, train them and also introduce them to these new technologies, these products. The third thing that was absolutely critical after participation and enabling, making sure that they have a relevant position. I'm sure for many of you as this crisis kind of unfolded, you didn't have something relevant to say, we didn't have a lot of time for you. And the reality is Salesforce became incredibly relevant to our customers, first in this core digital transformation and then next was really, how we could provide tremendous value in reopening safely. That became the third leg of our stool, the fourth leg, where it became, really critical all the tactical plays and critical aspects of building that pipeline up. So Bret, you've been the architect of all of these things. And can you talk to us about how you put that into place? Bret Taylor : Yes, Marc, thank you. I think that one of the things that you said in your opening script that I'm really seeing from our customers is that digital imperative and across the entire customer 360, we're really seeing that play out in some of both the pipeline numbers and the adoption numbers, some of which you mentioned on the call for customer service as an example. Our Einstein Bots functionality, which provides a digital self service, which is more relevant than ever before, is up 100% just in February, really reflects that overnight digital transformation of service. Here in marketing, Einstein is doing over 12 billion predictions per day really represents this mass scale digital personalization because digital is the one channel really remaining for a lot of our customers to engage with their employees. On our Commerce Cloud, GM view is up over 100% year-over-year as commerce digitized overnight. Even on industries, as Marc mentioned, the small business administration loans process really came out a lot of banks overnight. We helped one of our largest banking customers go live into 72 hours. This is all digital, it's fast. And we're really seeing that relevance point that you mentioned Marc on being extremely important. I mean, I think that every single CEO, every single CIO I talked to has the same method, which is whatever digital transformation they had left has just accelerated thanks to COVID-19. I think the digital aspects of our customer 360 platform have become more relevant than ever before. And you're seeing that in the pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Please go ahead. Derrick Wood : Thanks. Question for Mark Hawkins. Implied CRPO bookings growth for Q2 looks to be in the mid-single digit range. If I have a math, right, falling 20% in Q1 and obviously a lot of companies are expecting a tougher Q2, but can you just walk us through the assumptions here, whether there's any pressure points coming from contractions or turn or pushed out deals or any dynamic you'd call there. And then I know you don't guide CRPO beyond the quarter, but given the constructive commentary on the pipeline. Any color can you give on how we should think about potential recovery in CRPO bookings in the second half? Mark Hawkins : Sure. First of all, thank you Derrick for the question. Happy to do that. We \u2013 for CRPO when we look at that for the Q2, you should think about it is approximately 16% to 17% growth rate CRPO. So I think that aligns well, as we think about the revenue going forward in the current year and this temporary year of pandemic if you will. So we think it's appropriate line number one. I think in terms of the recovery, the way we have, and you've talked about attrition and things of that nature, I just want to be clear that we're actually very pleased in the sense that our attrition actually went down year-over-year in Q1 and so from that standpoint, I think it's good. I think what we've tried to do is to be appropriately conservative, having \u2013 going through this pandemic to assume that it would go up some and we call that out, it still would be we would expect that to be a temporary nature, but we said for the fiscal year, it would be less than 10% up some and that's partly based on the learning from the great financial crisis, heretofore we are very pleased to see what happened in Q1, but that's a little bit of color we had to make a call and kind of really make sure that we're dialing this in light of the uncertainty that's out there. So I think that would be something to think about in terms of the recovery itself from IT spending standpoint, we think that we\u2019re expecting a recovery in FY 2022, which begins for us in February, could it be sooner, we see companies that are doing that, that\u2019s just what we're trying to do and we think it's appropriately conservative. And so that informs us in terms of how we think about the demand environment. But one thing we learned for sure, in the great financial crisis is take a good look at what's going on to see the temporary situation. And then we remember how we navigated through it very successfully and on back to our future. And we really see that in this particular case, this is a point in time, a much bigger opportunity that we all know about including $170 billion[ph] plus TAM, that's one of the fastest growing parts of their market, but everything's being impacted temporarily with the pandemic. So that's what I would say and happy to have it if Marc wants to add anything to that. Hope that helps. Operator : Your next question... Marc Benioff : Well, I'd really like to open that up to Gavin Patterson, our new Chief Revenue Officer, he's been driving this incredibly strongly from his office in London, and he's going to be moving to San Francisco shortly. You heard about this incredible whim that he personally led at this amazing organization called the Standard Bank group, but Gavin, can you just fill in, how you see this market unfolding right now? Gavin Patterson : Well, thank you, Marc. And just to say, I'm very excited to be taking off on the role in the next few months. I've known cell sources, you know many years and I've known Marc personally for many years as well, as a customer at BT where I was the CEO and I started my career at Procter & Gamble in brand management. So I know the company reasonably well as a customer and over the last year or so, I've been more and more involved with the company initially building an advisory board in Europe, and then lastly picking up executive responsibilities for international. And that's where I helped steering the Standard Bank deal at the end of the quarter which was a big win for us. And I think pretty much a platform deal for us in Africa as we open up that market. So there are many things I hope I can bring to this Joe, customer viewpoints and international viewpoints to CEO viewpoint. But the one thing is very clear to me is the opportunities are there, very clearly and seeing how the organization has been able to adapt in the last couple of months[ph] of the virus and become even more relevant to customers. It gives me great confidence that the opportunities are there. And as Marc said, the majority of customers that were talking to are saying, how can I accelerate digital transformation? And there's no better partner to do that with. So I think certainly the growth potential not just domestically in the U.S., but internationally around the world, I think exists for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI, please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much. And Marc, thanks for all the work you and the team have done to help out in this crisis has done some great things. My question is for Marc B, if we think back to the great financial recession and you think about what eventually turned the tide from customers wanting to talk to you about digital transformation to customers actually spending on digital transformation. I mean, I think between you, Gavin and Brett, you all mentioned that there's a greater understanding of the imperative to spend on digital transformation today yet. You obviously have some prudent guidance out there for the second half of the year. So, when you talk to CEOs, what do you want to start hearing from them that gives you confidence that their interest is going to start translating into bookings, is it simply just business confidence, better understanding of sort of what's going to happen in the fall around COVID, just kind of curious, so we can keep an eye on some of the broader data points out there and try to triangulate your thinking on business momentum? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, I think it's such a good question because you know, of course when you are addressing a market with a set of products, capabilities you're going to have a set of strategies, as well as a set of tactics. You're going to have plays, as well as products, programs and you're going to do that differently by geography different by industry. I think we already know that, unlike the financial crisis, the way that this has discriminated against different industries is quite different than anything we've ever seen before and has been quite shocking, that will take some time for them to recover. In other industries and it causes them to grow faster than they anticipated, I mentioned with AT&T, that's obviously a company during this moment to become more digital, to become a strong position, they're going to accelerate into it. My personal belief is always that in a moment of crisis, you need to invest through it. Maybe not every company can do that, but a lot of companies surprisingly can, that's why you have to offer a full portfolio capability. I really saw that come together in the first quarter, I was really impressed with the bookings that we achieved in the first quarter, as it kind of started to get crazy in the middle of March. I was like, wow! what is going to happen at the end of March and then through April, well, this was the best of Salesforce. This was the best I've ever seen Salesforce perform. I mean, it was just incredible to see all of our Ohana, sales organization, service, engineering across the board. And then in the second quarter, well as I mentioned, I'm already really inspired by the bookings numbers that I've started to see and the pipeline numbers. So, we're quite optimistic about what the future that's going to look like for us. And Brian, do you want to fill in a couple of details for us? Brian Millham : I appreciate that Marc. And I appreciate the question. For us, it's about being very relevant to our customers. It's about chilling up and listening deeply to what they're going through and what we're finding is were more relevant than we've ever been to our customers and that's a great place to be. I couldn't be happier with the broad portfolio of products that we have to go address the problems our customers are facing today is a great product team, building incredible products, work.com is a perfect example of something that we've reacted to very, very quickly and are helping our customers address these core issues. And when you sit in that position, I think it's why we see our pipelines accelerating right now. So just very, very pleased with where we sit today. Operator : And your last question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks, Marc spec, it encouraged by the bookings going into Q2. Can you give me any color, what you saw from April into May, many tech companies have seen stablization in improvement or are you seeing similar trends through the month of May? And then maybe for Mark, just on the expense side, either a lot of questions that this environment may kind of permanently shifts some of the expenses across tech, do you think there's some permanent lasting effect that can inherently make you more profitable through this as we exit out? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, I'd really like to turn it back over to Gavin for a second to Brian and have them address the customer environment that we're seeing and then maybe Brett could fill in the details on the pipeline as well. Gavin? Gavin Patterson : Yes, sorry, sorry. Marc, we were saying competence is building almost week-by-week so clearly there was a shot that hit the system particularly in March, but as we go in through April and we moved through May, I would say bit-by-bit and it's not in the recovery market-by-market. It's not the same point in every market yet, but the broad building confidence we're getting to see get much better visibility for bookings not just in Q2 but into Q3 and Q4. And I can sense the confidence building in the sales organization. We're not getting carried away with ourselves. But going back to a point that's been made a couple of times on the call, the relevance of our product set and particularly the work.com is proving that actually more than ever our products are important to our customers and lead to a digital revolution and transformation that our customers are going to go through. So as I say \u2013 I'm pretty bullish about what I'm seeing at the moment and we'll continue to see it grow, I think from here. Marc Benioff : Brian, do you want to fill that in? Brian Millham : Yes, I would just second the comments, we're seeing tremendous confidence in our sales very, very good year-over-year, and those compares against a quarter when we didn't have a pandemic. And so we're feeling very confident about the pipeline growth as Gavin said appropriately, we're not getting overconfident. We need to go out and execute, but we feel very good about where we sit. And, and I hate to repeat myself, but in the \u2013 in a time when you need to be relevant, you can have products that fit the customer need. We feel like we're in a very good position right now. So I'm very, very happy with where we are in the early month of the quarter. Bret? Bret Taylor : Yes, I think anchoring both Gavin and Brian's comments and I've had three customer meetings already to there and every single one had one theme, which is everyone's looking past the pandemic towards the next normal and the new normal. And I think all of us have the humility to know that, we're not a 100% sure what that's going to look like, but it's a completely new experience for our customers, employees, and their customers. And they are looking at our solution as the most relevant platform available to really help their customer, help their company transition to that new normal. So that's really what we're seeing. I think there's still uncertainty out there, but I think people started this reopening process and you're seeing it in the momentum in the business. Marc Benioff : I'd love to have Amy Weaver, give us the closing words on her, because she's been involved in so many of our customer discussions and Amy, can you fill in exactly how do you see the situation moving forward? Amy Weaver : Well, I'm excited to see this moving forward a few months, but when I look at what we went through and where we're going, what really stands out to me is that everything we executed during this quarter and every plan that we're making for the future, we're doing it in line with our core values, with trust, with customer success, with innovation and with the equality. And I think that we found that these values serve the company so well, at least to a stronger company, stronger relationships with our customers, stronger relationships with our communities and really a great position for all of our stakeholders. So thrilled to be part of it and looking forward. Marc Benioff : Parker love for you to wrap it up. You've had the full perspective, you've done a phenomenal job developing and delivering work.com and Customer 360. Can you give us your words of wisdom? Parker Harris : Yes, I think I would just close by saying, we're all in our homes right now as everyone probably listening to this call as in their home. And yet as a management team, I think we've never been closer which is kind of odd that we've been sent to our homes and yet we're operating more closely than ever and faster than ever Marc and I said, it's kind of like, we're back to the startup days and we're a 50,000 plus employee company. And I've had the same experience as Bret was saying in working with our customers, we are no longer walking into our customer's offices and tubes and having that kind of separation where in their homes with them and to their homes as we're selling to them and supporting them and servicing them. And it's just a sign of the success that we've had and building that trust with our customers for 21 years. And I guess the reason why we're coming through this as we are. And so I hope all of you who out there are also having that same experience and just really proud of what we've done as a company during this crisis. Marc Benioff : Okay. Back to you, Evan. Mark Hawkins : Okay. Marc, do you want me to \u2013 maybe I should just tackle the last part of the Brent question there and then we'll go to Evan. One, Brent, we definitely are always looking for opportunities as the environment has shifted, it provides an opportunity for us to take a beginner's eye on everything and we're certainly doing that. You heard whether it's pipe gen, whether it's re-imagining everything we're doing, certainly travel or there's so many different examples, but we're constantly looking at focusing, obviously in delivering growth profitability and cash flow over the long-term. We're obviously very excited about the long-term opportunity to serve our customer and help them and we're very aligned. Parker's comment was really awesome about, we're very aligned around how to navigate through this and get beyond this point in time and really seize the opportunity for an unbelievably strategically positioned situation to serve our customers over the long-term. Marc and Evan back to you. Evan Goldstein : Thank you all for joining us for our call today. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Hope you were all safe and healthy.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker Mr. Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Evan Goldstein : Thanks, Josh. Hello everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2021 second quarter results conference call. I'm Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; Bret Taylor, President and COO; Gavin Patterson, President and Chief Revenue Officer; and Amy Weaver, President and Chief Legal Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In particular, our expectations are on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that of our customers and partners are uncertain and subject to change. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that, let me hand the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Okay. Thanks so much Evan and we're thrilled to be on the call with you today and this has been such a challenging time. Our hearts have been broken we've heard so many stories of pain and distress across the world and for us this is really this moment is actually quite humbling, quite bittersweet. It reminds us that at Salesforce this is a great platform for change that we're really here to be a great example of stakeholder capitalism to really show how we're able to deliver a phenomenal return for our shareholders as well as for our stakeholders. And in many ways this quarter really is a victory for stakeholder capitalism. It has been not only about our core values, but also about our core products. It is about showing how our Customer 360 has been a platform for change for so many of our customers and I'm going to talk about that briefly before I turn it over to Mark, but also our company has been a platform for change for the communities that have needed us most. And I am thrilled to deliver such a great return to our shareholders and also to our stakeholders. And certainly when we look at this quarter with more than $5.15 billion revenue and our highest operating margin ever that was 20% or when we look at simple aspects of our operational excellence like the 63% increase in seven figure deals from a year ago, well really indicates to us one thing which is that values really bring value. It reminds me of a story that we really started last quarter with AT&T. Now AT&T is an amazing company, a leader in the communications industry and they have a tremendous visionary with Jeff McElfresh who is the CEO of AT&T Wireless. And I'll tell you the thing that's interesting about AT&T is they have a huge vision and that vision is that every single customer touch point, whether it is at their stores, whether it is their e-commerce, their app, whether it is getting a message from them, well and each and single customer touch point, they want to know you as a customer. They want to single source the truth. And that's a deal that we signed obviously in February and I was thrilled that this quarter we've deployed now hundreds of stores and the first 35,000 users. But I'll tell you, at this moment in time there has never been a time when we've had to go faster. We've had to deliver customer success faster and we've had to be there for our customers. And I'm absolutely thrilled to deliver that success rate you can see. I also look at another incredible win in the quarter with PayPal. This is a tremendous organization that's really it is the right time at the right place because we really need contact with payments we all know that. So to see them have such great success of our Sales Cloud and our Service Cloud, see the SPO, they embrace us so deeply and our vision, we're having a one on one relationship. The journey is so powerful. Another incredible victory in the quarter has really been work.com. This is a product that I don\u2019t think there is a product that we've ever built faster, but never been more successful more rapidly. And you look at so many success stories, public sector organizations and enterprises that today in the middle of this pandemic everyone needs contact tracing, they need shift scheduling. Everybody needs workforce command center, try to bring everyone back safely. Well, work.com is delivery nice. Just look at the results that the University of Kentucky for example, it is a difficult situation for University to bring all these students back and work through and partner with them with work.com. I looked at so many other customers and so many other success stories during the quarter whether it was TWC or VF Corp or great public sector wins like the Veterans Administration or the State of Rhode Island. We look internationally at tremendous victories like Banco Bradesco, just had a great conversation with their CEO Octavio de Lazari, tremendous vision for the future of financial services and how customers are the most important thing today to go faster for their bank. And ultimately, I guess the most proud I was during the entire quarter was when we delivered an additional $20 million through our San Francisco and Oakland public schools bringing our total contributions to $118 million through our local public schools, but one thing is so important right now is their need to be able to enter into distant learning. So it is that idea that we've been able to do well and do great at the same time, that this has really been a victory for stakeholder capitalism to show that we can build a great company, but we not only have great core values, but we have great core products. So I just want to give my sincere thanks and gratitude to everyone who had such a great success during the quarter, our customers, our employees, our partners, all of our key stakeholders. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Hawkins : Well, great. Thanks Marc. And I hope everyone continues to be safe and well during this historic and challenging time. As Marc described this was an exceptional quarter for Salesforce. Both the company and our customers navigated the crisis better than our guidance assumes. While our performance in Q2 leaves us optimistic about the future, it is important to note that we remain mindful of how the pandemic may continue to impact our customers and our community. Let me take you through some of the results for Q2 and I'll begin with the topline commentary. Revenue was $5.15 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth. Q2 was the first time in which the company surpassed $5 billion in a single quarter. Our revenue performance by far continued to demonstrate strength across the portfolio. Sales Cloud grew 13%. Service Cloud grew 20%. Platform and Other grew 66% with Tableau contributing 41 points of that growth and marketing and commerce grew 21%. Additionally, we had a strong year-over-year performance by region in constant currency. America 28%, with Tableau contributing 10 points of that growth, EMEA grew 38% with Tableau contributing 13 points of that growth and Asia/Pac grew 23%. Before I detail the quarter's performance, please note that the following should be compared against the guidance assumptions we provided on the Q1 earnings call. Specifically, the outperformance in the quarter was driven five factors. One, better new business generation notably, we saw Q2 business consistent with historical trends. Two, higher license revenue driven by new business performance. Three, modestly better revenue attrition than expected and four, I see certain performance obligations within last quarter's large teleconference actions and five, creating [ph] foreign exchange. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q2 at approximately $30.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year. As a reminder this metric includes both new business and renewal contracts. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO, which is all the future revenues under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months with approximately $15.2 billion, up 26% year-over-year. CRPO benefited from new business outperformance, favorable foreign exchange, strong renewal performance and the inclusion of last quarter's large telecom transaction. Q2 GAAP EPS was $2.85 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.44. The outperformance in the quarter was driven by higher revenue as well as realized and unrealized gains under our strategic investment portfolio notably due to the nCino IPO. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.55 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.58. GAAP EPS was also benefited by $2.17 as the company changed its international corporate structure which included a consolidation of certain intangible properties resulting in a $2 billion net tax benefit related to foreign deferred taxes. Please note that this had no impact on non-GAAP EPS as the company utilizes a fixed long term projected non-GAAP tax rate which generally excludes the effects of discrete events. Turning to cash flow, our operating cash flow was $429 million in Q2 down 3% year-over-year. CapEx for the quarter was $114 million leading to a free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of $315 million up 22% year-over-year. Now turning to guidance for Q3 and fiscal 2021, coming off of a strong future result, we are pleased to be raising our full year fiscal 2021 revenue guidance to $20.7 billion to $20.8 billion representing approximately 21% to 22% growth. This guidance includes approximately $100 million of revenue from our acquisition of Vlocity. For Q3 we expect our revenue to be $5.24 billion to $5.25 billion representing approximately 16% growth. As a reminder, Q3 represents Tableau's third quarter in the company and therefore the year-over-year growth rate will be normalized. While the demand trends were strong in Q2, we remain mindful on how the pandemic may continue to impact our customers and community. Therefore, our guidance assumes that the revenue attrition remains consistent with Q2's after performance and assumes we deliver modest new business growth during the second half of fiscal 2021. We are taking this quarter-by-quarter as the pandemic is not over and we are only half way through the fiscal year. In that mind, from that perspective we will continue to evolve and re-imagine our business to enhance our relevance and deliver the highest level of customer success and innovation. As we look out over the next 12 to 24 months we realized it is important for us to make a strategic shift in investments today to better position our company for continued growth and customer success and this new all digital work from anywhere environment. As part of this, we'll be allocating resources to prepare the company for growth in strategic areas. This means we will be redirecting some of our resources to fuel growth in areas that are no longer as aligned with the business priority will be deemphasized. Furthermore, we intend to accelerate spend in go to market in product originally planned for next year and pull that into the second half of this year. These investments in growth are planned and they will increase our expenses in the second half. With that being said, after incorporating these and updating our revenue guidance, we are pleased to be able to raise our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to a year-over-year improvement of 75 basis points. As a result, we are updating our fiscal 2021 GAAP diluted EPS to be $3.12 to $3.14 while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $3.72 to $3.74. For Q3 GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.03 to $1.04 while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $0.73 to $0.74. As a reminder, our EPS guidance assumes no future contribution for mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. For operating cash flow we are raising the fiscal 2021 guidance to 12% to 13% year-over-year growth. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal 2021 in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 15% to 16% for the fiscal year. Operating cash flow is expected to be impacted by these incremental growth investments. We expect CRPO to grow approximately 19% year-over-year in the third quarter. And as a reminder Q3 represents Tableau fifth quarter at the company and therefore the year-over-year growth rate is now normalized. To close, we delivered a landmark Q2 in the face of adversity and have set ourselves up for strong second half of fiscal 2021 and beyond. We are proud of our ability to successfully lead through change and above all to continue to serve our stakeholders around the world. I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, our community and our shareholders for their continued support and which each of you, your families and your firm safety and wellness. And with that, I'll open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you so much gentlemen for taking the question. I appreciate it. I was just wondering Marc or Mark, if you could show us a little bit how the progression of the quarter unfolded and just kind of what you are hearing from customers now? Obviously you did much better than what your guidance expected, but if you were to put all this in the Einstein what did it shape up versus what you were versus what you thought again, just thinking how the slope [ph] in a quarter might have progressed? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks heather for that question. You know, we started this quarter 54,000 remote employees working at home. We know that we had to make a number of changes. We knew that it was going to be critical for us to reshape our company that this was a moment in time that you basically had to make a decision or you are going to keep things the way there were or you are going to change or are you going to shift. And we made a decision that we were going to change and we were going to shift. We shifted our operational values very aggressively and as we changes those operational values, we started to see momentum build. We called that out on the beginning of the call after Q1 where we saw pipelines started to increase with the second quarter and the third quarter. And it really was that as we piled in and doubled down on these core operational values we got much closer to our customers. We understood that if we were going to succeed at a moment like this, we were going to have to be closer to our customer than ever before, that we are going to have to change a lot of aspect of the company. And as we made those adjustments we saw the speed increase right up to the end of the quarter and it is just really powerful. I mean, as I said this moment is both humbling and bittersweet. This has been such a challenging time for us, for our families, and then to see these amazing results to stress incredible. I mean honestly, I just can't believe everything from just the delivery of all of our teams, the technology teams just did a fantastic job. The engineering teams, if you look at what happened with work.com, I mean it is incredible and it has been so improvement for so many businesses to get back to work safely, but now that we've brought to schools to help schools get back to work safely as well. We're doing that in a paid fashion. We're doing that and in a non profit fashion. So this is really a moment where I think values bring value. This is about us really paying attention as I said to our core products and our core values. And now that is really the accelerator. And when I look at some of the success stories that I went through and then there are so many, but one that's been very powerful for our whole company is, watching what in the third are so many but one that is very powerful for our whole company is watching what Gina Raimondo has done in the state of Rhode Island. She is going to address the entire company. You know this is an amazing governor of this incredible state. She came to us steady now, we're going to make our stage safe. There's things that we're going to have to do. Of course everybody is going to have to wear masks. So we're going to have to increase our testing, we're going to have to be doing crazy. We're going to have to do new shift scheduling. I need a command center. I need to do all these things and that our teams are able to deliver and help her and 35 other states and so many others that's very, very powerful for us because we all want to get back to how things were, but the reality is that's never going to happen. We are in the new world. We're in all digital world with the work digitally, we're living digitally, we're educated digitally, and that means we're going to have to make these adjustments. Bret, do you want to just talk about that and how the engineering organization how it kind of responded? Bret Taylor : Yes Marc. I mean, essentially you talked a lot about transformation and research in our company, we're just seeing that across our entire customer base. And you're seeing how our technologies are being acquired, just some incredible numbers. I think one is best exam, in the past six months the use of messaging channels like text and WhatsApp and Apple Chat has gone up 600%. We saw an 89% year-over-year growth in our Commerce Cloud. Probably a great example, a great customer story, I think that really illustrates this is Sonos. This is -- and the customers of Sonos use it to play music at my house. Like so many developers of products, they had to go direct-to-consumer. They deployed our Marketing Cloud and our Commerce Cloud and they saw an almost 300% year-over-year increase in direct-to-consumer revenue as a consequence. And I think that it\u2019s been an incredible trying time for all of our employees, all of our communities and all of our customers. But as you implied, there\u2019s also just incredible sustainable in terrain [ph] shifts in consumer behavior, like the digital commerce and this move to go direct-to-consumer. And so it\u2019s a great privilege to be able to help our customers navigate this crisis. And as you said, one of the key values we\u2019re trying to represent as a company is that agility. I listen deeply to our customers like Governor Raimondo, like Sonos and making sure that we\u2019re empowering all of them with the Customer 360 so they themselves can navigate this crisis successfully. Marc Benioff : Gavin, we just had a tremendous meeting with Banco Bradesco with Octavio De Lazari. We\u2019ve also met with so many other customers. I met with one of your customers late last night in France. It was morning for them, a huge CPG company. I mean, we\u2019re seeing so much transformation with the customers and desire for speed. And also, they\u2019re all paying attention to their ESGs well and aligning from a position of stakeholder capitalism. Gavin, can you give us some illumination about what you\u2019re seeing from a customer base? Gavin Patterson : Well, I\u2019d call out a couple of things, Marc. One is, and we did touch on this in the last call, we saw confidence builds we have to read as we went through the quarter. And the shock of closing down moving business so that it would be managed remotely, once the first couple of weeks had been passed, we saw companies begin to realize the digital transformation with imperatives, but they just couldn\u2019t afford to put off any longer. So I think what we saw with our sales leaders is - and the products that Bret and the team put together for us was we were relevant. That was the key word, I would say. We were able to pivot very quickly. It\u2019s a very agile performance from the company. And we were there to help our customers through these difficult periods where they have to make decisions that would typically take weeks and months, sometimes days, but I think it demonstrates what a powerful proposition we have for customers that we can spin things up quickly like work.com. We can deploy the core clouds very quickly and they deliver quickly for customers. That means they actually are relevant now is probably as high if not higher than it\u2019s ever been. And we had a great quarter, there is no question about that. I think it\u2019s tinged with the site sensors, the context in which it\u2019s been achieved in. But there\u2019s real, I\u2019d say real confidence in the business. We\u2019re not getting carried away. There\u2019s no question about that. There\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty as we look into the second half of the year. But undoubtedly what we offer is something that's increasingly our customers really want. Marc Benioff : Well, thank you, Gavin, and welcome by the way to the team officially. I know you\u2019ve been with us for about a year, but now you\u2019re officially in the role of running as our Chief Revenue Officer and we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled and we\u2019re absolutely delighted to have you as part of the team. Amy, we also saw a lot of action in public sector, I mentioned a few of them, but there were so many more stories. Could you highlight a little bit about what we saw in public sector during the quarter? You\u2019re on mute, Amy. Amy Weaver : It would not be a call if I did not forget to take myself up yet at some point. I think the public sector has been a great success in both the first quarter and the second quarter, and it\u2019s that type of trust and collaboration that just keeps building. I have to give a real shout out to Dave Ray, our financial [indiscernible] and his entire team. And some of the things that stood out to me were not just for Rhode Island, but really seeing the team mobilize in other states, where we have a reach out saying that they didn\u2019t know what to do. They were struggling and within hours, Dave would have pulled together a team of professionals from across Salesforce and said, despite a new situation to you, this isn\u2019t new to us. We know how to do this. We know how to deploy a team quickly, and we can get in there and partner with you. I believe it\u2019s terrific to say. And I thought it really showed just the values of Salesforce and our focus on collaborating and partnering with governments around the world. Marc Benioff : Very good. All right, thank you so much, Heather. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC. Please go ahead. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I hope you\u2019re all safe and well, and congratulations on an absolutely stunning quarter. Marc, I guess a lot of questions we get these days around the improvements in kind of week-by-week that Gavin just referenced around the confidence and the relevance is, what can you tell us about your pipeline and your confidence in converting that pipeline, particularly in selling in this new digital world where maybe a Virtual Dreamforce or some - how do you think about that? And then how does that set the stage? If you think about the 2008 recession, you guys accelerated pretty meaningfully coming out of it. And based on that pipeline question, is there a scenario in 2021 given that increased relevance? Is it possible to see a meaningful year of acceleration or are we just still too far from the end of this crisis? Marc Benioff : Well, this is such a great question. I, I really appreciate it. I guess just the third major crisis or maybe fourth that I've been through as the CEO of Salesforce. And in each crisis things are different. But one thing that isn't different is that each one has been an accelerator in the future, that each crisis tends to bring us to the future faster. And that appears to be what's happening here. Look, I'm speaking to you from my phone. Each of my executives are in their home. I'm looking at a screen that looks like The Brady Bunch with little video images of all of them, Gavin in London, and Amy, in San Francisco, and so forth and it's quite complicated that we're -- we see these continual advancements and acceleration. But you have to, as a CEO, take a moment and ask yourself, how are you going to change? I kind of alluded to that. And I think that your question about Dreamforce is so important because, I can't tell you how many people I get on the phone with. Well, where is Dreamforce? Were we ready for Dreamforce? But there is no Dreamforce in 2020. We know that. We're not all heading to San Francisco next month or Metallica is not playing. You know, we're not all going to be going in the keynote room. And yes, we're grieving that, you know, there is a grief. There's a sadness that we're not all together. We love being together as one Ohana, our employees, our customers, our investors. We have a big Investor Day. We're all in a big room at the St. Regis Hotel and Mark Hawkins is holding court with everyone and there is no such thing this year, so it's, sad. And will we all be back together again? I hope so. Am I sure? I don\u2019t really know. I mean, this is my first pandemic. I mean, we're in a global pandemic, where we're dealing with a virus that has a lot of unusual characteristics. So we've made changes in Salesforce that we now are advising our clients to make, how to get their employees to participate. We have 54,000 employees. For us to achieve these results everybody has to be on the field and playing the game. We have to also give them the incentive to play, to train them, to keep them motivated. I think I've mentioned this before, but you know, every week since the pandemic has started, we've had an all hands call where we have all 54,000 people on a telephone call, our zoom, and we're talking to them around the world and giving them like a play-by-play for the week. That hasn't happened since we were like a 10 person, company, a 100 person company. That's what little startups do. That's not what companies who are entering the Dow will do. This is like, whoa, this is like a moment. So, where we imagine in our business also, we've had to re-imagine our relevance. That\u2019s why we build work.com, because we realized that our customers need us to show up to be relevant to them. That's why we built Salesforce Anywhere, because we realized our customers have to sell and service and market anywhere. That's why we built the Leading Through Change Program. You may have noticed we put over 200 million people through Leading Through Change far bigger than anything we've ever done with reports. I just watched the one that just happened. It was amazing. And many other things. It is another level of enablement for example, like you know that third of our employees are reporting mental health challenges. I'm sure a number of people on this call are having mental health issues or know people who are having mental health issues in the pandemic. That's why every day we've been doing a Be Well Together call. If you go to YouTube, you'll find mental health resources. We've never had to publish mental health resources before at this velocity and this scale it is amazing or I think I mentioned you like we bought 60 million pieces of personal protective equipment, we didn't know what personal protective equipment was. It's amazing. We also retrained everyone with trailhead to become a ranger and we're doubling down on that making sure that every employee is trained. And, you know the Tableau which, by the way, I don't know if we mentioned it, I mean, who was such a genius CEO, Adam Phillips, he runs that. And I think it's going to be the best acquisition ever done in the history of the software industry, most successful certainly. And, they built this incredible data hub. If you haven't seen it you should go to Tableau data hub, which you can find on public.tableau.com which has amazing visualizations of everything that's -- and I just mentioned to you that I, just did a major management team presentation digitally in Europe. I mean, we're constantly talking to our customers in new ways at scales we could never have imagined. So it also gives us the ability to have accountability with our distribution organization, which is of scale. We're not a subscale organization. We are a scaled enterprise software company. We're able to compete effectively as evidenced by these numbers with any enterprise software company that's on the field today. And we're able to manage our distribution organization and go-to-market in ways that have a level of acuity that we did not have before. I mean, it's powerful when you add it all up, because the patient and enablement and relevance and the tactical plays and then the values that we apply, our core values, well we're a different company. This has changed us. The pandemic has changed us. We're not the same that we were. These aren't even the same players on the call that we're talking to you at the beginning of all of this. So that's really amazing. And I think that these results are evidence to that. Where we'll be a quarter from now or two quarters from now, or a year from now or two years from now, we don't know. But our intention is the same, which is, we're helping our customers to connect with their customers in new ways. We want to be the number one CRM. We're the number one in analytics. We're tightly focused. We're not all over the field, like a lot of our competitors by the way. A lot of our competitors are everywhere. They're in every market. But some of them are in enterprise and [indiscernible]. They're not just in PRM, they're in CRM, they're in ERP. They're in public clouds. I mean, we're not. We're singularly focused so that we can pick up a call, for example, like we mentioned, like from a Dan Schulman at PayPal, and he says, I need Sales Cloud, I need Service Cloud, I need to integrate everything together. We're going to do that for him. Or if we look at our success with CVS this quarter, we look at the tremendous, their leadership team was incredible. Just amazing executives and their, how they come together was -- so powerful, but their return ready product, and then the integration with work.com. That's an imagination I have never had. And the vision of John Roberts and how he's been able to show how this pharmacy can actually be a key player in the pandemic, they're doing 100,000 tests a day. This is awesome, but they have to have each one of those tests. There's an on ramp for customer success. So we have to be there with a vision on how to help that happen. And I guess another one that really is on my mind has been VF Corp. I mean, I love Vans. I wear the North Face almost every day, those jackets, [indiscernible] cold where I am. And I'll tell you, I think it's our largest Commerce Cloud deal ever. Maybe not customer, because we tend to talk about deals and then we forget about how big these other customers are getting, but it is a great company and they're doing amazing things. I also was especially impressed with how, Under Armour clipped on our Commerce Cloud and clipped off the old technology this quarter. That was really powerful. I mean, we have to act with a level of speed and capability with our customers that we've never been called on before. So look, it's continuing to unfold. We all know that. We're doing the best that we can. Our hearts are with those who are going through serious challenges. So very much this is a moment that is very much humbling and bittersweet. And we just continue to focus on businesses the greatest platform for change. Our products have to be that platform change. Our values need to be the platform for change. We know what role we play in our industry. We know that we are a light and that we have to continue to be that light, especially during these difficult times. Operator : Your next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Taylor McGinnis : Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the awesome quarter. So the raise in the full year operating margin improvement guide is 75 basis points. I thought it was really solid, considering one that you guys are pulling forward some expenses to fuel growth and guiding to revenue growth in the mid teens in the back half. So curious if you're able to break down the components driving that guide, like how much is coming from teeny savings perhaps you saw in 2Q or expect to see further down the line and wondering if you're able to quantify the pull forward of expenses? Mark Hawkins : Yes, thank you Taylor, for the question. I appreciate that. We were very pleased to be making the raise of 75 basis points and then that's the everything especially in the fact that we're you know, further investing to really perpetuate this long term success for our customer and serving all our stakeholder. So, I think, we're not prepared to quantify the specifics of that. But I think you've got it right. We're investing in growth areas, think about products, think about go-to-market in particular, in terms of the further acceleration and investment. I think is a good way to frame that. Of course, we're getting some teeny benefit as well, but again, our profit level is a choice and that's an amazing thing about our business model. We're making a choice in terms of where we want to strategically invest. We've shown in Q2, how we can deliver, what we deliver, which is a record operating margin, but we're also trying to balance, growth and profit over the long play. So that's our approach. I think you nailed it in terms of some of the things and we're really pleased to be able to raise and make the investments. I hope that helps Taylor. Operator : Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Phil Winslow : Hey, thanks. It was a good quarter and congrats on really strong results. I really want to drill down into some of the specific Clouds. Specifically, Service Cloud, that continues to deliver just really robust growth. And obviously, your last quarter became the biggest news material cloud and that that continues to stretch that gap. Can you talk about some of the dynamics that you're seeing in there in Service Cloud? And how do you think about the sustainability of this on a go forward basis? Marc Benioff : Well, sure, let me just touch on some of that at a very high level and then let me ask Bret to comment as well. But you're right, Service Cloud had a record due to, it continuously grow at, you know, 20%. I don't know, the numbers are huge. The revenues are huge. The growth rate is huge. It's now larger than Sales Cloud. It continues to grow on all fronts, including year-over-year revenue growth and saw that new innovations. The engineering team has done a fantastic job. The products, that amazing velocity has added a lot to Service Cloud. They have built a lot on Service Cloud is another layer of value on Service Cloud. And in the last six months the use of messaging channels on the platform grew more than 600%. I think that Bret really illuminated that in a powerful way. This idea of bots growing at 176% pace of log per day 33% quarter-over-quarter conversations at nearly 19 million per day during the quarter. And, it's a key part of every deal we do, because when you're building a Customer 360 and you're building a single source of truth for your customer, the Service Cloud has to be part of it. There's plenty of companies that have customer service or help desk or service desk or whatever, as stoke, isolated solution, but that's not our vision. Our vision is to be able to bring together a Customer 360, because look like Raytheon P [ph]. The salesperson in the store needs to be able to work with the field service professional at home has to work with the service professional in the call center it is all interrelated. And that's why PayPal for example, is able to get done because it's sales and service together, by the way, combined with marketing, combined with all their other systems through Hilltop [ph], combined with analytics through Tableau. So anyway, Bret, would you like to come in here and like illuminate your vision around that? Bret Taylor : Yes, Marc, I think you characterize it well. I mean, fundamentally, our customers are coming to us to build a Customer 360, that's single source of truth for their customers, so that in the face of unprecedented change for their customers, they can transform their business. They can go digital, they can integrate sales and service, it's really that single source of truth. And it's the anchor tenant of the Customer 360. And I think that's where the momentum is coming from. And, when you look at some of the deals Mark talks about, like PayPal, it is really the anchor tenant of the value proposition of that Customer 360. Another great example that Gavin mentioned in our last earnings call is Standard Bank. It's again, a complete solution for the largest bank in Africa. And, one of the things that I think is really powerful about that story is probably the most impactful calls I've done with Gavin in this past quarter was, we were talking to their executive team and the executive team all the way down is actually becoming Rangers on trailhead. They're using the Service Cloud and the Customer 360 as an opportunity to not just transform their technology, but transform their culture to become customer centric and really become a platform. They're rolling out trailers, all 50,000 employees with the goal of achieving 20,000 Rangers. And I really do think that this really illustrates the power of these stories around digital transformation, the power of customer service really being the centerpiece of that Customer 360 transformation. Operator : Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. I'm wondering a similar question in that being on Commerce Cloud. I know customers paid to some degree on GMV and they have to come back and re up as volumes show up. Can you help us understand how Commerce Cloud, just the impact of Commerce Cloud in the quarter and how that's driving product, sort of a holistic sale across the portfolio? Marc Benioff : Bret, can you can you take that for us? Bret Taylor : Yes, Marc we saw over 100% year-over-year GMV growth this past quarter, and I think it really reflects the broad digitization of commerce. And, I think when I looked at our Commerce Cloud and our differentiated value proposition, it's two things. One is we do both B2C Commerce and B2B Commerce. And I think that when I talk to customers, it's really about all of their channels. Now, it's a direct consumer channels, it's their warehousing, it's their partnerships. And we're really the one platform that can do that. The second thing is the integration of our Commerce Cloud, the rest of Customer 360. I think everyone on the call has experienced buy online curbside pickup, right? We've probably all experienced that, many of us for the first time. When you think about the technology that facilitates that, that's the integration of our Commerce Cloud, our order management solution, Service Cloud and really that end-to-end customer experience. So you're right that GMV is a good indicator of growth in the Commerce Cloud. But I also want to be clear that our Commerce Cloud is really a part of a broad solution that we're providing to customers to really digitize their commerce experience, all the way from making that order on through the end of that customer experience, whether you're picking it up on the curb or it's being delivered to your doorstep, and those transformations have never been more important in this all digital work from anywhere world. Operator : Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. It's absolutely spell bounding to see, finding to see organic growth rates this solid margin expansion, et cetera. And the leading indicators are few as well. My question for you, Marc, you sounded really excited about Tableau, you made a very profound statement. It could end up being the most impactful acquisition for certainly Salesforce, maybe in the software industry. As you look at digital transformation Customer 360 help us paint a picture of what a Tableau can do for Customer 360 and digital transformation for the industry looking into 2021 and 2022? Thank you so much. Marc Benioff : Well, I really appreciate that question because I'll tell you that we're so fortunate to be able to acquire Tableau last year. It is one of the world's leading enterprise software companies probably one of the most loved brands. The ability to see and understand data, the ability to build these compelling visualizations like you see in the public domain, like at public.tableau.com. But I think the parts that you don't really know or that when we talk to so many companies, they've gone wall-to-wall with Tableau and doing those types of deals. That's very exciting, because Tableau is analytics for the rest of us. We were always in the analytics business, of course, either through Sales Cloud, we've had dashboards and reports, which were great, but very much about kind of [indiscernible] 49 of the sales spot or with Einstein analytics, which is incredible. But it's super advanced AI, highly programmatic and very enterprise class. This is a, this is a capability that means that three companies can deploy analytics easily. It's a simple, easy to use, and easy to understand product. I'm sure a lot of you use it, plus you can build these amazing visualizations. Plus, it has this incredible culture, this brand, this community they call themselves the data sam. It's, it's awesome. And they are an incredible group. And they also delivered a great quarter, which impacts us market talks about how that impacts us. But let me tell you, how it impacts me. It's when I talk to somebody like Bob Moritz, the CEO of PwC, which was one of our largest deals of the quarter. But it's also what PwC says, that's going to be our new analytics platform. And so many conversations with so many companies who have made the decision that now that Tableau is part of Salesforce, they see how this has become part of our Customer 360. And there's a lot of new innovation, a lot of exciting stuff coming for Tableau. And you'll see that, with their incredible, announcements that are coming in. But Mark, can you just fill in, how does it impact us on a financial basis? Mark Hawkins : Yes, Marc. I'm happy to do so. And I also share the excitement about Tableau. It's just such a great company that to serve our customers. One of the things that was nice this quarter is Tableau in overperformed. With their offering and their particular term license offering, they had a number of really nice deals where the various customers who wanted to go even beyond one year, we call it multi year. And when that happens, so that, it further helps us in the sense of the revenue recognition. And but all-in-all, it's all driven by people liking the product, wanting to invest not in just a year, but in a couple of years in it. And the more years out Marc, the more we see that benefit in the top line. But what also is exciting for us is how it integrates into the digital transformation. So it's been very positive. It was a very nice performance for sure. Congrats to the Tableau team who's listening in today. Marc Benioff : And I'll also just say, well, and I think Mark, and I'll come in here for a second. We also, you know, we're two years MuleSoft. Here's another, this has been a game changer for us because it's the heart and soul of Customer 360. The ability to say to customers with authenticity, we're going to integrate everything for you and bring in all your legacy systems and put API's on top of them and give you this tremendous capability, these two companies together, this is a huge accelerator on our business that they're both working so well. Mark, can you extend that thought? Mark Hawkins : Yes, definitely Marc. In fact, again, MuleSoft also was a contributor to our overperformance. Again, people love the product Marc. I like the dialogue you mentioned with VF Corporation, where they're buying multiple products, including MuleSoft to, get that, that 360 progress, if you will, of the customer. And for MuleSoft, again, nice overperformance, so all of our MuleSoft, team members congrats to you as well. And your contribution to this result in Q2, and when they're again selling, more term licenses this, this again, has a favorable effect on us and, and most importantly, helps us solve problems that customers really need help with. And Marc, if I might just add, whether it's MuleSoft or Tableau, or even our core products. One of the things that, we certainly hear more and more is this whole notion. And Gavin talked about digital impairment imperative, it is very clear that our products are becoming more and more mission critical. MuleSoft market is adding to that. MuleSoft is adding to that 360 solution and we're becoming more mission critical. And one of the effects Marc that that had and this quarter is our attrition rate was better than we had expected. And that's in part because we're becoming more mission critical with MuleSoft with the integration of these 360 products, and just the sheer over performance of MuleSoft and Tableau contributing to our results. Operator : Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and congrats for me as well. And question for Marc and Gavin, in this new environment that we're living in can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of customer engagement in terms of deals size that you can have kind of maybe targeting? But then also, like, we talked earlier about Dreamforce, being kind of more online, like, Dreamforce was always was a big event for lead generation, et cetera. Like, how are you shifting that and, that maybe kind of bring in a little bit of the comments about the go-to-market investments? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Bret, would you like to take that? Bret Taylor : Yes, sure. So, one thing that I think Marc talked a lot about is, we're really focused on having a beginner's mind with our business. So as Marc mentioned, this is all of our first pandemic and the way we're doing business is completely transformed. All of our sales engagements happen via zoom rather than being in person. And, when I talked to a lot of customers about their own digital transformation I was always trying to guide them. Don't translate your analog behaviors into digital media. That's not a digital transformation. That's a digital translation. And when we think of things like Dreamforce, as Marc said, I more than anyone else, I'm totally bummed out. We're not going to be in San Francisco in October, November, because it's one of my favorite times of the year. But we really feel like we've demonstrated over this past quarter our ability to re-imagine the way we engage with our customers in completely new ways. I think Parker made a common last earnings call that stuck with me where he said, on one hand, we're all staring at the screens, and it feels so impersonal. On the other hand, I'm staring into all of my colleagues and customers living rooms, and it's oddly more personal at the same time. So broadly, what I'd say is, our ambitions to transform our customers with the success of our technologies, our customer success teams, our distribution teams, has not changed. And in fact, I think there's a broader imperative for digital transformation than there ever has been. The way we're going to change, engage with our customers has completely transformed, and I think as a company we really think we've developed over the past quarter, that mindset of constantly transforming and reshaping ourselves to be able to meet our customers where they need to be met. And I think we have the ability to continue executing on that with the humility that predicting the future right now is really hard. We're in the midst of an unprecedented environment. But I think we've developed a lot of confidence internally at our ability to transform ourselves. Operator : Your next question comes from Sarah Emily Hindlian Bowler with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Sarah Hindlian : Great, thank you so much for taking my questions and squeezing me in. Marc, how do you feel about M&A today and all of the back and forth going on around TikTok. Did you think M&A appetites are picking up or just the IPO market? And then a more specific question on the quarter, look the resilience here is really impressive with the merger delivery and I understand the balance of broken investments and the commentary made, but could these better margins be a bit of a new normal given work from home? And then just lastly, I wanted to say that it's really nice to see you being generous to your employees and still reward your other stakeholders, mainly shareholders. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks. I mean, certainly we're seeing a very interesting environment in the markets, in M&A and IPO. I think that for a company like Salesforce, we don't really see an M&A environment. It's -- these are not, it's we're not in a moment. I honestly feel like we're very lucky that we were able to pick up MuleSoft and Tableau when we did, because they were both public companies today, you can do the math. We would not have been able to buy them. There's no way, no how it wouldn't have worked for us financially. So we're not in a good M&A environment. I just don't see it. Maybe things could change, of course, things always are changing. But I think, this isn't part of our plan right now. We don't see that. We really see focusing on our business, focusing on these operational values, executing our business. Look, we always maintain a beginner's mind you know that. But the reality is, right now it is about our own execution. We've made these two major plays to extend and complement our Customer 360 and that's what we're focused on. Mark Hawkins : Let me take your second part of that question Marc, on the growth and investment and could be margins be the new normal? Thank you for the question. So, we always are mindful of, we want obviously, growth number one, we want to continue to expand our operating margins and deliver cash flow. We know how critical those three are financially speaking. And we're always trying to balance that. We're always making choices with the opportunities in front of us, and we are always reassessing that at the executive suite. So we are pleased to be raising. We're always trying to be better. We're always trying to keep an eye on that in going forward, but we think we have the right balance for this year, given the opportunity, given the total addressable market that we're, so well positioned for to serve our customer and the rest of our stakeholders. So we think it's the right balance today. I take your point, and we're always assessing and we're always trying to be better. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the call back to Evan Goldstein for closing remarks. Evan Goldstein : Thank you for joining us on the call today. If you have any follow-up question, please email us at investor@salesforce.com and I look forward to speaking with you on our Q3 results. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With that, let me hand the call to Marc. Marc Benioff : Alright. Well thank you so much Evan and just thanks to everyone for being on the call today. I hope you and your families and colleagues are all safe and healthy and preparing for the holiday season. It\u2019s nice and crisp and cold here in San Francisco, and we can feel Christmas approaching. It\u2019s all in the air and as the season approaches, I wish the very best to you. It\u2019s been such an unbelievable year in so many ways for so many of us, and you know we\u2019ve really had to re-imagine every part of our business and our lives and also work with so many of our customers, and really even our families to do the very same thing. The past has really gone, and we can all feel that. And the future is coming. We can see there\u2019s certainly a light at the end of the tunnel, especially with these incredible vaccine announcements, but here we are in this present moment, and wow there\u2019s so many things happening and so many exciting things to talk to you about on this call today, and we're reimagining our entire business, we're reimagining our industry, and we're even reimagining Dreamforce. So many of you have emailed me and called me and talked to me about your ideas for Dreamforce. But I'll tell you, when it really comes right down to it, Dreamforce is different this year, just is, you know, it's not the Dreamforce that we wanted, it's the Dreamforce that we got. The Dreamforce that we wanted is the Dreamforce with all of you. You know all of our trailblazers and all of our Ohana and all of our friends from all over the world, the best part of Dreamforce is being together in person. And there was a little bit like Thanksgiving all by ourselves last week, and here we are again, it's kind of Dreamforce by ourselves. So we've re-imagined Dreamforce. And the first thing we did is, we said, \u201cwell, you know what, we're going to have Dreamforce for each and every customer,\u201d and we've already reached out to thousands and thousands of our customers. We're creating custom Dreamforces exactly for them. We've already done almost 5,000 of those Dreamforces, which has been our prototype, and we hope to do over 100,000 Dreamforces before we're done, and these are unique presentations exactly for our most important customers in the world. And then we have a huge conference coming in a couple weeks which is our Dreamforce Trailblazer Conference, which gives ability for all our Trailblazers to come together; and then tomorrow, we've got a phenomenal event with myself, with many of our executives, Bret who\u2019s going to join me on stage as well, it\u2019s going to be live from San Francisco. It's going to be cold. We're going to be doing it outside. I think Bret's holding the camera for a while and I'm holding the camera for a while. It's basically, you know, we're following all these protocols, and we're trying to stay as safe as we can, you know, we've all been tested, and we're ready to go. And it's going to be very excited and we're going to have some very, very special guests tomorrow, some great customers and some really outstanding music, you're not going to want to miss that presentation. And by the way, if you'd like to have Dreamforce to you, please contact our Salesforce executives, and we will arrange Dreamforce for your company. You'll be shocked at the depth and incredible custom presentation that we're able to bring for you, and we've re-imagined how to do a conference. We're not doing it like everybody else. We have our own unique approach, of course, you would expect nothing less of Salesforce. And one thing that's really cool is how well Dreamforce to you is going. I want to thank my entire Dreamforce team. I've definitely got them working much harder than they should be working, especially during this holiday season. Well, look, we're going to have some exciting announcements, surprises, you're not going to want to miss it. All of you need to tune into that, but the keynote again is just one part of an amazing month of Dreamforce 2020, it's Dreamforce to you. We\u2019re powering every account executive in our company to do this, it's going to be amazing, and you're going to love it. Let's get right into it. Let's get into the numbers and get out of this opening. This was an unbelievable year, and that was an unbelievable quarter. Q3, wow, it was our strongest Q3 ever. You know, record revenues and margins and just deals and just unbelievable. And it follows the strongest Q2 in our history, and Salesforce has never been stronger. Look at our core organic growth. It's just incredible what the numbers say. Revenue has risen to 5.42 billion, up 19% year-over-year in constant currency. By the way, if you look at that sequential growth from the second quarter at 5.15 billion to 5.42 billion, incredible. And, you know, this is 19% year-over-year in constant currency, and we're raising our full year fiscal 2021 guidance. Now, as you remember in the first quarter, the pandemic was hitting and we didn't know what was going on. We were hiding like everyone else under our desks, then we realized, wait a minute, we can succeed through this. And here's our guidance. And Mark, I think it's our guidance is now higher than our original guidance for the year where we're actually delivering guidance at 21.11 billion at the high-end of the range representing 23% growth. So, not only did we come back, we came back stronger, and no other enterprise software company is growing at this rate, especially in our core and organically. We expect our revenue to continue expanding, growing from 21.1 billion this year, to now over 25.5 billion. And for those of you who are watching the enterprise software industry over the last, I don't know, four or five decades, I don't think there's been an enterprise software company in history that's gone from 21 billion, or 21.1 billion to 25.5 billion, and we're all modeling I'm sure right now, what the fiscal year 2023 number is, right. So, when you look at those numbers, wow, you just can't, you just can't find any other company like that. And with the strength of our core products across sales, across service, across marketing, commerce, we\u2019re growing year-over-year the size of entire companies. So, we have a lot of great companies in cloud computing, but you can see how we're kind of just stacked one of those right on top of us here. So, Salesforce has never been more relevant, more strategic to our customers. An example of this is what we've already seen this past week with the incredible scale, the reliability, the strength of our customer 360 platform this weekend. We were up all weekend running Cyber Week. It was incredible. From Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we processed more than 31 million orders. It was up 62% year-over-year, but not, you know, just thank you to our engineering team. Just absolutely world-class performance and execution by them. Huge, [high fives] Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud, well, you know that those were started as acquisitions. And now we've turned it into a multi-billion dollar business. And now with Tableau, well, our customers were able to leverage all the data coming in spotting the trends. It's been a phenomenal weekend with these holiday insights. You probably watch that online. You've probably seen some of our incredible Tableau dashboards we put together and on any given day now you can see our customers are delivering an average of 2.6 billion marketing messages, [4 million lease, logging] 19.7 customer service conversation. Einstein delivered more than 80 billion AI powered predictions every day across Customer 360, incredible.  And Salesforce then takes all of that in sales and service, in marketing, in platform, in analytics, in conversation, in channels, in collaboration, and we lock it into a single source of truth for our customers. Connecting customer data across systems, apps, and devices, and for our customers who have now seen this next generation architecture, and you're going to see our next generation platform tomorrow, but I don't want to give away too much of what Brett Taylor has built, but it's incredible, but let me say that that idea of the single source of truth, well no one else has ever tried to do such a thing. And it's why for the seventh year in a row we've now been ranked the world's number one CRM by IDC. That's why companies of every size and every industry are building amazing digital experiences for their customers with our scalable, flexible Customer 360 technology.  And you look at this quarter, great customers, great customers like Prudential, Accenture, NBC Universal, Telefonica, Zoom, Data California, I mean, American Family Insurance, [Timok]. I mean, so many great companies; so many great customers and it\u2019s why 43 states of the United States are working with us on the response now to the COVID-19 pandemic.  You probably saw us, we have even helped or fully eradicate COVID in some places in the world, including great State of Victoria in Australia, where they had a terrible situation and used Work.com and they have now announced that they\u2019ve eradicated the virus, and I wish that we could work more closely with more governments, more deeply to do exactly the same thing, because the combination of mask wearing and social distancing and religious contact tracing well, boom, you can eradicate the virus. Well very excited to see them and congratulations to the State of Victoria, I also this quarter was in Singapore visiting our 1,100 Ohana there, and I\u2019ll tell you, they\u2019ve eradicated the virus there, you can see the chart, unbelievable. Now our customers are benefiting from the fast time-to-value we deliver with Customer 360, which has been critical during this pandemic and it\u2019s going to remain so going forward. And with MuleSoft and Tableau every company can easily unlock any data from any source and see and understand in ways that are leading these faster, smarter decisions, and the customer reactions when they see these Customer 360s. The eyes are lighting up, because they\u2019ve never seen their business quite like this. All right, well, now let me just tell you what I\u2019m really excited about. Slack, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what Bret and Stuart have put together. Wow, I mean, when they came to me and brought me this idea that Salesforce and Slack to come together, my eyes lit up. I said this is the next generation of the Customer 360. This is our ultimate vision of having this incredible user interface on top of all of these services with all these channels and all the collaboration running on all of these devices and integration, interactions, and the ecosystem, and the industry that has been created around it and all the applications amazing. And let me just say also, I\u2019ve watched Stewart and Slack grow up over the last six years, it\u2019s been amazing, it\u2019s reminded me of another great company Salesforce. I have to be honest, and I get to look right out my window do you know what I see, Slack, Slack logo, because Slack building is right next to my building and I\u2019m looking into their building all the time. Stewart is waving at me, now I\u2019m waiving at him. Now, we\u2019re giving each other big hugs when the pandemic is over. With that idea that these two great companies are right next to each other in Salesforce Park is amazing. And Stewart and his team have built one of the most beloved platforms and brands, okay, and technologies in the software industry and it\u2019s a perfect match for both of us that\u2019s going to extend our companies, make us both stronger and look, we\u2019ve spent more than a decade focusing on this vision that we\u2019ve had for social enterprise, everyone probably remembers [indiscernible].  All of the social enterprise presentations that I\u2019ve delivered in my career, this makes it all real, this makes it all true, this brings the best of both worlds. The integration, it\u2019s a marriage made in heaven, it\u2019s amazing and we spent more than, God, I can\u2019t even think about how many conversations Parker and I have had on the vision and then to see Stewart come in with Bret and make it all real, well, that\u2019s just awesome. And we see in Slack a once-in-a-generation company and platform, it\u2019s the central nervous system of so many companies on this call and our company and so many of our great customers connecting everyone and everything and now we could go even bigger, better, more exciting and it brings all the companies, people, the data, the tools together and you can see all the CRM information, the sales, customer interactions, you probably saw Slack Connect, which extends the benefit of Slack\u2019s employees can securely work collaboratively with partners, suppliers, but especially important for us, customers. Wow, that\u2019s the game changer. And when I\u2019ve seen this incredible story line that what Bret and Stewart have put together, it is like, wow. This is bigger than I\u2019ve ever thought it could be. And when I looked at the companies from around the world we\u2019re implementing Slack from the fastest growing start-ups to Fortune 500 companies and Starbucks and Target and HP and what they\u2019re doing and then when we integrate that with the single source of truth, oh boy, it\u2019s a super charger. So, we already know more than 90% of Slack, enterprise customers are also Salesforce customers, but we also see how much farther they can go, because we just use ourselves as an example. Yes, we\u2019re a great Slack customer, but we could be doing so much more, but when it\u2019s integrated to a Salesforce, it\u2019s like wow, and that\u2019s what I plan to bring that message to all my friends, all these CEOs that I work with all over the world to help them transform their business and grow their businesses and helping them to survive and succeed during this pandemic. Well, we\u2019re going to make sure that they just have this incredible single source of truth experience as well. Look, we\u2019ve already shown with ExactTarget, with Demandware, with Mulesoft, with Tableau, how we acquired, how we can integrate, how we extend acquisitions, how we transform our own product line, how we can develop compelling models for our customers to get value and we\u2019ll expand Slack as well in the enterprise, not just among Salesforce customers, not just by lighting up our tens of thousands of salespeople that\u2019s not what this is all about. What this is all about is the value of the social enterprise and creating this incredible idea that you have this amazing hub of productivity of collaboration and integration and applications that now leverage all of this amazing data. And I mean you probably saw, if you watch the Tableau Conference-ish this year, the vision they\u2019ve had for Tableau integrated with Slack, you look at what Salesforce has done, I mean, it\u2019s absolutely incredible and by the way look at what Zoom is doing with Slack is absolutely incredible and you look at that product. I mean, i.e., you\u2019re talking about my productivity environment every day, Zoom and Slack and Tableau, oh yeah, and Salesforce and all the applications and dashboards and everything I use to run my business is all Salesforce now. Everything on my desktop here. I\u2019ve got my computer in front of me right now and everything is Salesforce. And I\u2019m like, wow, this is just absolutely incredible. So, congratulations Stewart, Bret, I just want to give you a huge call out, because awesome what you have done and I never thought it was even possible, never wasn\u2019t even in my consciousness that it could be possible and you did it. Now, before I turn this over to Mark Hawkins, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve now already seen that absolutely one of our very best CFOs we have ever had is retiring and it\u2019s just sad to see Mark go. I\u2019m going to try to keep him around in the company as long as I can. I think, I\u2019m going to have some good success, because let me just tell you, he is absolutely \u2013 I really think Mark you\u2019re absolutely \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t want to \u2013 we have especially Steve and Graham out there such great close friends of all of ours with mine and yours as well Mark, but Mark, wow, you\u2019ve really outdone yourself. What a career you had at Salesforce. And I\u2019m just so grateful for everything that you have done for the company and I am so grateful Mark for everything that you\u2019ve done for the industry and also your relationships with all the CFOs, when I look at your incredible CFO conference that you run at Dallas, when I look at your work that you have done as well with Prince Charles, with sustainable accounting. When I see the value that you\u2019ve added for the whole world not just at Salesforce, not just in the industry, but in the world what these new sustainable accounting standards, Mark, I am deeply grateful to you.  So, I want to tell you that Mark is going to remain our CFO through the end of our fiscal year, which is going to end January 31 and then Mark I believe you\u2019re going to stay on and as an advisor hopefully for quite some time. And then at that point, I am absolutely delighted to announce our new Chief Financial Officer, who has been on a few of our calls here, you all know her, she is an amazing person, a core part of our executive team, a core part of our entire company, core with our Board of Directors, my core [indiscernible], Amy Weaver. So Amy congratulations as our new Chief Financial Officer. I couldn\u2019t be happier for you and I know that Mark also joins me in sending you congratulations, we\u2019ll hear from him in a second. And Amy will become our President and our Chief Financial Officer effective February 1 next year. So congratulations Amy, you are now going to become our fifth CFO at Salesforce. So then probably the five best CFOs in the world. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019re joining this incredible group and you \u2013 Amy to have you as our fifth CFO, I mean, unbelievable and Mark, thank you again, because I will always be so grateful for your tenure and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have a smooth transition of power and looking forward to hearing your announcement of your new cabinet. Mark, when I look at how you have been such an important part of our success over the last six years with revenue growing five-times over 20 billion, actually 21.1 billion this year Mark. And our market cap reaching more than 200 billion, employees growing over 54,000 a day, and Mark you set the foundation and you know this is just the beginning and you\u2019re lighting up my $50 billion dream, so aggressively and we all know it takes a great CFO to help scale a company that, well, you know, I\u2019m very grateful for this. And Amy, you you\u2019ve been that trusted advisor, I mean, it\u2019s all one family, so I know this is going to be a seamless transition. But my heart is really filled with gratitude. And now let me turn this over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Hawkins. Mark Hawkins : Hi, Marc. First of all, I can\u2019t thank you enough and I\u2019m going to come back to those comments at the end, but to say there is gratitude is a huge understatement to me, to say that to you personally. You\u2019ve been amazing and for the entire Salesforce team and I\u2019ll talk a little bit more at the end and I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be working with Amy, who is \u2013 I\u2019m going to talk more about as well, just an amazing executive, an amazing friend and partner. So, I\u2019m going to come back to that, but I just have to say that Marc I\u2019m incredibly grateful deeply. I\u2019m going to come back to that. I want to say that I hope everyone had a safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving, despite these challenging times. And as Marc described, we delivered another record quarter in Q3 with durable topline revenue growth, as well as strong operating margin performance. And let me take you through some of the results for Q3 and I\u2019ll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the third quarter was 5.42 billion, up 20% year-over-year and up 19% in constant currency. Looking at the drivers of growth, we had strength across geographies and across clouds. Our subscription and support revenue growth by Cloud was as follows : sales grew 12%; service grew 21%; marketing and commerce grew 25%; platform and other grew 24%. I\u2019d say also that revenue attrition in Q3 remained between the 9% and 10% range and continues to remain modestly better than we were guiding during our Q1 earnings call. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenues under contract ended Q3 at approximately 30.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year. And as a reminder, this metric includes both new business and renewal contracts. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO is all the future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months and it was approximately 15.3 billion, up 19% in constant currency. Our Q3, GAAP EPS was $1.15 and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.74. The outperformance in the quarter was driven primarily by higher revenue, as well as realized and unrealized gains on the strategic investment portfolio notably, due to Snowflake and the IPO there. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.83 and non-GAAP by approximately $0.86. Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $339 million, up 14% year-over-year. CapEx for the quarter was a $124 million, leading to a free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of 215 million, up 68% year-over-year. Now turning to guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2021. Coming off a strong Q3 result, we are pleased to be raising our full-year fiscal 2021 revenue guidance to 21.1 billion to 21.11 billion, representing approximately 23% year-over-year growth. This guidance includes approximately 120 million of revenue from Velocity and 20 million, an increase from Velocity in the prior announcement. For Q4, we expect revenue to be 5.665 billion to 5.675 billion, representing approximately 17% growth. We are proud to be raising our revenue guide back to our pre-pandemic expectations, and Marc is absolutely right at the high end, it\u2019s slightly higher than we started the year with. We\u2019re thankful to all of our customers and our partners for the success. And now as we enter Q4, which is our largest quarter of the year we are going to build on the momentum for Q2 and Q3. The pandemic has also empowered us to re-imagine how we operate in this work from anywhere digital world. Earlier in the year, we shared with you our pandemic strategy of investing in our customers, our community and our employees. This included PPE donations, bonuses to our sales org, pivoting away from physical events, scaling our organization, while pulling forward growth hiring into this year. And in Q3, we continue to re-imagine our operations. After analyzing our global lease commitments, we now plan to consolidate in sublease select locations. While this acceleration of our personal digital transformation in the post pandemic world is happening, we do expect this to result in a one-time Q4 charge of approximately 80 million to 100 million. Please note that these charges represent an immaterial amount of our global portfolio and do not include our headquarter locations. After incorporating these and our updated revenue guidance, we are maintaining our fiscal our 2021 non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 17.6%, which is year-over-year improvement of 75 basis points. As you can see, this year\u2019s performance, margin is a choice. When we net these pandemic driven investments against T&E savings that the pandemic produced the result of slight operating margin headwind of approximately 50 basis points for the year.  However, in these times of crisis, it\u2019s more important than ever to invest and support our stakeholders, our customers, our community and our employees. Therefore, our fiscal 2021 GAAP EPS will be $4.14 to $4.15, while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $4.62 to $4.63. For Q4 GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $0.05 to $0.06, while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $0.73 to $0.74. And as a reminder, our EPS guidance assumes no future contribution for mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016/01. For operating cash flow, we\u2019re maintaining our fiscal 2021 guidance of 12% to 13% year-over-year and we continue to expect our CapEx to be approximately 3% in fiscal 2021 resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 15% to 16% for the fiscal year. We expect operating cash flow to continue to be impacted by the growth and investments that we described last quarter. We expect CRPO to grow approximately 16% year-over-year in Q4, which is consistent with our initial revenue projections for next year after excluding the acquisitions of Slack and Acumen Solutions. Additionally, the pandemic continues to result and modestly higher revenue attrition than our pre-COVID expectations assumed and therefore will be a very slight headwind to near-term growth. Regarding our fiscal 2022 revenue guidance, we project it to be 25.45 billion to 25.55 billion, representing 21% growth. This includes the contribution from Slack of 600 million net of purchase accounting and assumes a closing date in late Q2. Acumen Solutions, the assumption is 150 million net of purchase accounting, which assumes a closing date within Q2. Both of these acquisitions will be fantastic additions to our Ohana as they will greatly benefit our strategic priorities of Customer 360 and industries. I\u2019d also like to provide some additional insight into our revenue guidance for Q1 of fiscal 2022, which we expect to be 5.68 billion to 5.715 billion, up approximately 17% year-over-year. As a reminder, we\u2019re providing this guidance given that our term license revenue business that is MuleSoft and Tableau have a more seasonal revenue profile in the first quarter. To close, we delivered a strong Q3 despite the pandemic. We are proud of our ability to successfully partner with our customers through this adversity, while continuing to serve all of our stakeholders around the world. Additionally, I\u2019d like to encourage all of you and your firms to join us on December 8 for our Annual Investor Day. And now for some personal comments. As Marc mentioned, I made a decision to retire as an Operating Officer and from Salesforce. I\u2019m amazingly humbled, grateful, and proud of having the opportunity to be 40-years in technology. I\u2019m excited to begin my next journey, you know, spending time with my family; doing some voluntary and doing some incremental board work. But first, of course, there is a really important matter of Q4 and then also really strongly supporting this transition. But I just want to say that I am excited about the future for Salesforce and I\u2019m excited also about the next leg of the journey for myself. I really deeply believe we are in a great position of strength and we are getting stronger as a company with so many indicators to evidence that. I will be the company\u2019s strongest advocate once we go through this nearly year of a transition, which I\u2019m excited to be a part of. And I get to work hand-in-hand with a dear friend Amy Weaver, who I have the utmost respect for as an executive, as a partner and who is going to be an amazing CFO. Before I conclude my personal our remarks, I do want to say a special thank you to all the Salesforce Ohana, a special thank you to my boss Marc Benioff, who is a great friend and somebody I will always treasure the relationship with and who has been incredibly kind to me and to my team and to the broader company, and I want to thank our investors for all your support over a long period of time as a public CFO and some of the others to thank the ELT and the board, but I\u2019ll stop at that. And let me turn it over to Amy. Amy, I can\u2019t wait, I\u2019m just going to tell you the same, I can\u2019t wait to really begin this next leg of the journey with you and I\u2019ll give you a virtual hug if I can, but we\u2019re going to \u2013 it\u2019s going to be an exciting year ahead. So, Amy over to you. Amy Weaver : Thanks Mark. It has been an absolute joy to partner with you over the last [6 years] and I have to say that one of the best part of taking the role of the CFO is that I get to work even more closely with you throughout this transition. This week I\u2019ve been thinking back to when I joined Salesforce seven years ago, we had just under 13,000 employees and had not yet crossed $4 billion in revenue. Today, we now have more than 54,000 employees and guiding over $21 billion and what\u2019s attracting the most is that we still got so much growth ahead of us. My focus will be to support that momentum as we continue to grow, as well as the scale of the business efficiently. And I\u2019m very much looking forward to continuing to work closely with our entire executive team and our Board of Directors, as well as going to partner with our shareholders in the coming months. I am just incredibly grateful for this opportunity and the faith in me and taking an incredibly excited about the future of the company. And with that Evan, shall we open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. David Hynes : Hey, thanks very much for taking the questions and Mark Hawkins congrats on the well deserved retirement. You're certainly going out with a bang here. Maybe this question is for Marc Benioff. It sounds like maybe Bret, given, he was kind of the architect of the Slack deal, I'm curious, looks Slack\u2019s going to give you access to huge amounts of, you know rich conversational customer data. How do you see that kind of advancing your efforts around AI? And I guess maybe just related to that, I think we all know what Slack is today, but what\u2019s your vision for what it could be with Salesforce in, you know, three to five years from now? Marc Benioff : Well, let me give you two minutes, and then or a minute, and let me have Bret come in next to fill in the details. You know, when I look back at the dreams that we've had of what the social enterprise means over the last couple decades, it's a very rich user interface that kind of front ends all of our services and kind of in the way graphical user interfaces were a major moment in our computer industry. I think these collaborative interfaces and video-based interfaces are the next major moment in our industry. But underneath those services and you've kind of teed it up by asking the question this way, you have so many rich services, applications, integrations, artificial intelligence, and fundamentally big, you know, big data lakes. And the idea is, how can you take all of that and bring it to the user, to the power professional, to the worker, to the knowledge user, or even to the CEO and turn it into a powerful experience? And now this combination of Slack and Salesforce, exactly as I mentioned, you know, my whole world is on this platform, and we call it Customer 360, but the idea that gee, number one, there's never been a more important time for sales and B2B sales. I see that with our customers every day, I look at our salesforce, obviously, it's enormous, but our ability to call at every level, our ability to call into the CEO level easily, our ability to have much higher levels of productivity with our sales organization, how we had to move our call centers and customer service organizations on a moment's notice into their homes. Our ability to deliver record levels of marketing and marketing interactions like we did this weekend. The analytics that are needed, and you probably saw the analytics that we published around the holiday. Well, now all of that completely coupled with this incredible collaborative interface. And that is the magic. And that is what it's so exciting. That's been our dream. Now, it's our reality. And I want to introduce you to the person who put all of these things together, and that's Bret Taylor. So Bret, do you want to take this to another level? Bret Taylor : Yeah, thanks, Mark. I mean, I think you really contextualized it well. I mean, fundamentally, we really see the world as fundamentally having shifted this year. We're entering into this all-digital work anywhere world, and every executive that I talked to, and every industry is doing this not as something temporary, but really a moment that accelerated the digitization of the economy. Consumer goods have gone from, you know, retailers to direct consumer. Medical care has gone from doctor\u2019s offices to Telehealth. Retail has gone from brick-and-mortar to curbside pickup. Marketing, as Marc mentioned, this last weekend is a perfect indication of this. We saw mobile push mode notifications go up 131%. We saw SMS grow 171%. Behind all of this is fundamental shifts in the way we work, fundamental consumer behaviors and fundamental changes in behaviors and every interaction. And I think we really view Slack as really the system of engagement for every employee, for every partner, and for every customer interaction. And I think in this all-digital work anywhere world, when you think what does it mean to be successful in sales, what does it mean to be successful in customer service and marketing, e-commerce, it really is about facilitating this all-digital, work-from-anywhere world to enable team selling, to enable people in a contact center to swarm on a case digitally whether or not you're in the same building, to enable marketers to plan a campaign, to enable merchandisers to plan what goes on the front page of a commerce app or a commerce website. . And, you know, we've been using this phrase, really, this is the operating system for the new way to work. And you know, our customers are coming to us now recognizing that because the economy has shifted so dramatically so quickly, they're pivoting from saying, \u201chow do we respond to the crisis, how do we grow, and how do we thrive in this new normal?\u201d And we fundamentally think this combination is that operating system for growth for every company in the world. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Thanks. I wanted to touch on the operational plans for on-boarding Slack. Maybe, you know, could you compare and contrast the strategy to integrate Slack versus what you've done with Tableau or MuleSoft? And then Mark Hawkins, you know, thanks for the EPS guidance, but I know there's a lot of below the operating income line factors. So, can you give us any goalposts around how to think about how Slack impacts operating margins, and how to think about margins next year? Mark Hawkins : I'm happy to take the operating margin discussion, and perhaps Bret, you may want to talk about the operating plan integration. I'm happy to chip in there as well, if that\u2019s helpful. Derrick, first of all thank you for the question. We are going to be factoring in Slack\u2019s business profile into our overall business for next year for the operating margin. We'll give the operating margin and the cash flow growth for the entire company for normal tradition in Q4 call, for sure. You can see because it's a public company, it\u2019s profile is different than Salesforce. It'll be dilutive to our operating margin in aggregate. And there'll be the purchase accounting side of it, but we\u2019ll give you very specifics in Q4 there Derrick. Not only on the operating margin, but the cash flow, and then even the latest on the revenue growth in Q4. On the integration plan, Bret, I don't know if you want to touch on that? Bret Taylor : Yeah, I'm happy to take this Mark as you said. You know, I think our philosophy is very similar to our philosophy with MuleSoft and Tableau, which is number one, starting with our mutual customers and starting for, how can we, you know, help every one of our customers benefit from the combination of these two technologies, without really recognizing that Slack, you know, fundamentally, if you look at the happiest customers who use Slack, it is really the central nervous system for their company. And that's really connecting every single application at their company, not just applications from Salesforce. So that really means bounce in making sure you know, Slack has an independent brand and continues to serve every single company and integrates with every single system as your company, while also making sure that it really achieves the vision that Mark talked about, which is, it really becomes sort of the user interface to the Customer 360. It helps all of our customers be successful as they try to create a single source of truth for the customer data. I'm really happy with this strategy. It's really been effective with our integration with companies like MuleSoft and Tableau that have continued to thrive. And, you know, continue to be technology agnostic, while also becoming really integrated part of our value proposition to our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you so much for taking the question and congratulations, Mark Hawkins. It's been great working with you over the years. And for Marc Benioff, I mean, Salesforce and Slack together, it seems like this is going to become the hub that connects all of the different Salesforce applications together and offers even more value for your customers. How do you see \u2013 in the context of the 90% customer overlap you mentioned, how do you see this evolving the digital transformation messages to customers that you're already sharing? And I guess the other piece is, when you think about the pieces of the Salesforce puzzle, if you will, would you say despite your efforts with chatter that this was one of the biggest remaining pieces you were missing? Thanks so much. Marc Benioff : Well, I mean, I'll start with the end, which is, there's no doubt that Slack just has an incredible approach to collaboration in a way that we really could never have imagined, especially in regards to the integrations and applications in the ecosystem that are built on top of it. Certainly, like chatter to have the collaborative interface and we\u2019ll benefit from that because we've done such deep work in our own architecture around our Chatter API and some of the other key parts of our core system. But when you look at what happens when you put Slack and Salesforce together, you know the fundamental experience for the customer, it just changes. Of course, you're already doing wall-to-wall in the enterprise, which is very exciting for Salesforce is beyond just sales or service or marketing. It's into every department. We've already seen a lot of that with Tableau and the ability for Tableau to go wall-to-wall and you know Tableau is another product that users just love Tableau, users just love Slack, when we start to bring our Customer 360 into that, our ability to build applications with lightning, our ability to light up our own workflow, and build workflows to our customers and expose those through these channels, well that's where the fundamental expression of Salesforce and how it looks, whether it's on a phone or an iPad, or on your desktop, it's, you know, deeply modernizes it. And Brett, would you like to fill that in? Bret Taylor : Yeah, you know, you know, Marc, when I think about the opportunity for our customers, I just \u2013 every single customer engagement I've been involved with could benefit from this capability. You know this past quarter, one of the customers I had the privilege of working with is Ferguson, which is the largest wholesale distributor of commercial and residential plumbing suppliers. And this is a classic Customer 360 relationship where their CEO, Kevin Murphy and their CIO, Mike Sajor were really trying to connect everything from B2B and B2C commerce to customer service to their platform. And when I think about the vision of that, you know that company and I think about the opportunity to come into these, you know, these companies going through this digital transformation and trying to really say, how do we build the perfect digitally augmented experience and customers, this is the ultimate system of engagement. This is the ultimate way you can connect every employee, the ultimate way you can work with your B2B partners most of that way that you can transform your teams working on, you know B2C customer engagement.  And, you know, I think that's when we look at the opportunity for our customers. So, we look at the opportunity for Slack customers. We really think that bringing these things together gives us such a complete value proposition. I think it's really exciting. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. For Mark Hawkins, just on the billion for the quarter, there were some question marks just as it relates to the deceleration, and I'm curious if there was anything behind the scenes that we should be aware of? We know, you had a difficult comp and you're coming into a seasonally strong quarter, anything to call out there on the billings number? Thank you. Mark Hawkins : Sure, Brent, first of all, thank you for the question. And, you know, nothing, you know, first of all, we don't really \u2013 billings is not a metric that we focus a lot on. We think CRPO helps us a bit more in terms of actually managing the business and that\u2019s a metric that we track carefully. We feel like this just makes sense, it\u2019s consistent with the revenue guidance for next year. And obviously in prior quarter, we lapped Tableau, but where we feel really good about this number, we feel great about the demand environment. Obviously, that\u2019s why we raised again the revenue for the year and we initiated a \u2014 I think, a really appropriate guide for next year\u2019s revenue. Not very many companies do five quarters in advance, so we feel good about the demand environment, but we just think this is consistent with all of that and look forward to executing on that. Brent Thill : Thanks Mark. Mark Hawkins : You bet, Brent. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And Mark Hawkins it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. Congratulations on the retirement. I wanted to ask on the Slack acquisition, really a two-part question. On the front end, maybe for Bret, can you talk to us about what you guys can do with Slack by owning it versus partnering? Because I think one of the things that has Slack differentiates which is \u2013 they\u2019re open integration is the fact that they integrate with everybody. So why is it necessary to own the asset? And then on the back side, I wanted to ask just about the price tag. On the last conference call, Mr. Benioff, you talked about it being a tough environment for M&A for stuff being expensive and you\u2019re making hard to make these acquisitions financially work out for you guys. What is it about this one, like how do you garner the confidence at this $28 billion price tag? Is the right price tag and financially this is going to make sense for our Salesforce over time? Bret Taylor : Yes, thank you for your question. I\u2019ll start on the \u2013 just talking a little bit about why it\u2019s important and why it\u2019s valuable for our customers for this to be a part of our portfolio. The journey that we\u2019ve been on over the past decade is really going from a company with a single value proposition around sales automation, so really \u2013 it\u2019s vision for Customer 360. They can connect sales, service, marketing, e-commerce, analytics platform. And when you look at all of our largest deals, our happiest customers, our healthiest customers with lowest attrition, they\u2019re not just using one of our products, they are really using this entire platform to get the single source of truth for their customers. And we see this incredible vision as Marc said, it\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been working at and thinking about for a long time, well before I even joined this company about how do you connect all of these experiences? How do you actually create a seamless customer experience team, customer service and marketing, which every single retailer in the world was worried about this past weekend? How [do B2B] companies? So, I\u2019m really focused on not just selling, but customer success, which is really connecting the entire Customer 360. And when we talked about Slack really becoming and the user interface for the Customer 360, this is what we mean. I really think this is a way of delivering that vision to our customers and for them to deliver \u2013 our customers to deliver a vision to their partners and their customers through technologies like Slack Connect is really, really meaningful and really, really unique. And I think it captures candidly the new way that most of our customers think about their customer relationships. It\u2019s not siloed by department anymore. It\u2019s really end-to-end journey and to really achieve that we think that Slack is a tool that facilitates that in a really unique way and really help accelerate our customers, who are going through this transformation. And Marc I\u2019m not sure if you want to comment a bit on your comments from last earnings call just to offer my perspective. We\u2019ve been clear consistently that when we look at our M&A strategy and our inorganic acquisition strategy, it\u2019s fundamentally, we have to be opportunistic. We have to make sure that we respond to unique conditions from our customers in the market. And this year, if anything else, it\u2019s been hard to predict and this is an opportunity that we saw as we\u2019ve talked a lot about this shift in the economy, the relevance of Slack to our customer base that has obviously dramatically increased over the course of the year. So, I do think that we \u2013 the market is very unusual this year, but we have to make sure that we as a company a beginner\u2019s mind about where innovation can come from and recognize that we have to take timing what is available to us as we evaluate these inorganic opportunities. Marc Benioff : Yes, I would like to address that which is that, I think what\u2019s very exciting is, this vision that Stuart and Bret have put together. And I think that when I look back in the [indiscernible], I don\u2019t think I could have ever imagine any acquisitions happening this year or in this pandemic or in this all digital environment, we are just, kind of, grout forcing it right through where we\u2019re making as many sales calls as we can and we\u2019re collaborating very deeply as a company and all of a sudden Bret and Stuart coming together and say, yes, we can do this. And when we look at the result in vision, it\u2019s a wow. It\u2019s like something that we could have never imagined. And when we look at acquisitions today, we do have a little bit of a swagger, of course we\u2019ve done probably over 60 deals, small, medium, and very large. On the whole, our transactions have been extremely successful. And when we look at our very large transactions especially ExactTarget, Tableau we look at how or what we\u2019ve learned our ability to integrate companies to make one plus one equals three. We look at this and we say, wow, this is a game changer and we know how to pull it off. And we have a lot of our former executives for example at Slack already. So, we know a lot of those players. We work so deeply with the company both in a business development perspective, but just because they are our neighbor and we\u2019re like, oh boy, the value that we can bring to customers is much stronger as one company than is two. And when you look at the difference in partnering versus owning it really means that we\u2019re able to do things with our technology that we just could not do as partners and that\u2019s the demos, the visions that Bret and Stuart had put together and look, when they presented this to me, I was sold and I am sold and I can\u2019t wait to get out on the road and present it to customers because I know that they are going to be absolutely blown away about what this looks like for them. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. And mine, maybe just for Marc and for Gavin. I want to ask about the demand environment, particularly how it looks from a pipeline perspective for the fourth quarter. And Marc and Gavin, how are you seeing the priorities change through this pandemic. How do you think about that for next year as you look at the opportunity to solve these pain points. And Marc, I guess the other follow-up to Keith\u2019s question is why now on Slack, why not before and why not next year? Marc Benioff : Well, it\u2019s a good question. And let me kind of \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you in two stories, but the first story is, we started out this year. I think everyone remembers we went through a very dramatic transformation in our management team. Keith decided to retire, which I fully supported and we knew that we were going to go through a big shift in distribution strategy. Our team members themselves and what we didn\u2019t have written in the back was the global pandemic. So, all of a sudden in the first quarter, what was happening at Salesforce was distribution transformation and global pandemic and that shook our confidence. You might remember that, I also said pipelines appear to be really strong. So, even though in the middle of the quarter we went into global lock down in March and April, we think we\u2019re going to come out pretty strong and we were very fortunate starting in the second quarter with number one, on-boarding a fantastic new CRO, Gavin Patterson, former Chief Executive Officer, VP, who was working with us, who I\u2019ve known for so many years and coming in as our CRO and our President, taking his position, which he was doing so much with us already, but then really leading our global distribution operation and then we rebuilt our entire distribution management team as part of that, and we delivered the second quarter, which was our record quarter, we had phenomenal bookings, margins, revenues, cash flow across the board. And then the second quarter turned to third quarter, we are happy to talk about an unbelievable quarter. I mean, it was just remarkable, the performance of the company. I would never have imagined it \u2013 us in February and March when this started. Now, I\u2019m like, wow, it gave me a lot more confidence in where we\u2019re going, Now when we look at the fourth quarter, which pipelines, we have tremendous outlooks and we feel very good about our ability to succeed, you know, with [indiscernible] architect with Dreamforce. That\u2019s going incredibly well and we look at next year and we\u2019re like wow we\u2019ve never been more competitive. We\u2019ve never been able to succeed more aggressively with our customers. We have solutions that are not only horizontal, but vertical. We\u2019re strong in every one of our key categories from sales to service, to marketing, to commerce, to platform, to analytics, to integration, we\u2019re able to deliver tremendous value. When I look at what we\u2019ve done with key customers and I mentioned AT&T in the last call. So, when I look at what we\u2019ve done with their management team, with their competitiveness, with the results that they\u2019re getting, it just gives us a lot of, I would say, a gratitude in our ability to transform a company like that or any company and world \u2013 and we do it worldwide. And then when we bring in Slack, well, you know with these acquisitions, you never know exactly when they\u2019re going to happen and we couldn\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t know when Tableau was going to happen. Of course, we always loved Adam and Christian before that, we didn\u2019t know when ExactTarget was going to happen, we always loved Scott and we didn\u2019t know when Stewart and Slack would happen, and when the moment \u2013 and the opportunity arises you have to look and ask yourself, are you strong? Can you do something like this or are you weak, or is it a moment where you just don\u2019t have the swagger? And let\u2019s face it, look at these numbers, so we just delivered Salesforce has never been stronger, never been more capable, it\u2019s never had a more competitive position, it\u2019s never been able to execute more acuity. Look at the IDC numbers, I don\u2019t have to go through them in sales and service and marketing across the board. They\u2019re very, very impressive and when we\u2019ve gone up against tough competitors we have done just fine, and I think that we bring a lot of value to Slack right now at their size, as you know they\u2019re going basically entering from the $1 billion to $2 billion phase, which I know extremely well and this is a moment where we can offer a lot of value. We\u2019ve been there, we\u2019ve lived that life, and we\u2019re going to come in and we\u2019re going to help them not just be successful doing it, we\u2019re going to help them to just redefine the entire industry. And that dream and that vision that Bret and Stuart have is really unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen of any company or any product anywhere and when you see it all laid out you will just be blown away. I mean, I was and I have a lot of confidence that you will be as well. Gavin Patterson : And perhaps I should just add some comments as well, Marc. Marc Benioff : Please do Gavin. Gavin Patterson : Yes, what we saw in Q3 was a continuation of the strong demand that we saw in Q2 and it\u2019s a very well-rounded performance across all the clouds and both in the U.S. and internationally we\u2019ve seen strong demand around the world. And as we look into Q4 beyond, the pipeline continues to be very encouraging. So, I guess what I\u2019m saying and you\u2019ve heard it from Bret and Marc, as well is that I think the core of what we offer to be the trusted advisor for digital transformation. This is an imperative to every company and every organization in the U.S. and around the world and that conversation has become more urgent. And we\u2019re finding that we\u2019re getting very, very good access probably at least twice the access to decision makers, who want to have that conversation and want to get on and make that transformation and users in their departments. So the businesses I think are in really good shape. We\u2019re confident going into next year. And as Marc says, I think Slack really rounds out that proposition. And I think it\u2019s going to \u2013 and we feel very encouraged and very optimistic about maintaining this performance going forward. Marc Benioff : Gavin, I want to ask you a question, because I think it\u2019s appropriate. Look you\u2019ve been running this business now \u2013 so well now for several quarters, but just give us one more level of insight, what has been your greatest surprise, look you are \u2013 we\u2019ve been friends a long time, you are a customer, you\u2019ve been a partner, you\u2019ve known a lot of our executives, now you\u2019re deep inside the machine, what has been your biggest surprise working inside Salesforce and now working with our customers and doing these huge transactions that you\u2019ve been doing? Gavin Patterson : Well. As you said, I\u2019ve been a customer and I sure tell you what Salesforce could do for my business, and I thought we were reasonably excited about it, but it hasn\u2019t been until I came into the company. It wasn\u2019t until I came into the company and I realized that actually there\u2019s so much more you can get if you align your complete business behind the Salesforce CRM system and the wider set of clouds. That\u2019s probably the single most important thing I\u2019ve learnt. The share potential of getting to a single source of truth, operating the Customer 360 and I see so much more potential in customers, who really embrace that vision and some guess get it today and we\u2019ve got some great case studies demonstrate that, but others still have that opportunity. I think going forward. So, there\u2019s plenty of potential left in the business on all the clouds. And I\u2019d say the second thing I\u2019d call out is, actually how great very big company, how agile the business is, and how we\u2019ve been able to maintain the agility and grip of a small company, while managing to cut it to $24 billion or $21-plus billion in sales and 25% CAGR a year. It is quite remarkable. The decisions can be taken quickly.  We can respond to changing customer needs and that is being critical, because I think if I look back over these last six months, making sure that we remain relevant to our customers, and so that we can help them through these difficult times, make sure that we\u2019re there to guide them and help types of transformation, but demonstrate we\u2019re able to listen and respond in terms of the propositions we offer. I mean, it\u2019s been I think quite remarkable. So, it has been quite a ride and certainly been a privilege to be a part of it and I think there\u2019s a long way still to go and another few chapters for the next book in it. Marc Benioff : Well, I think that we can say now with delivering this guidance of [21.1] and looking at next year as well, Gavin, I just want to thank you, because I don\u2019t think there is a more successful sales executive in enterprise software certainly at the size and scale that we\u2019re operating in than you are and your leverage, your experience as a Chief Executive Officer is a very large 100,000 person company [BT]. I mean, you\u2019ve done a phenomenal job. So, thank you. Gavin Patterson : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions. I will turn the call back over to Evan for closing remarks. Evan Goldstein : Thank you for joining us on the call today. If you have any follow-up question, please email us at investor@salesforce.com and we look forward to speaking with you next week at our Investor Day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today Mr. Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may go ahead. Evan Goldstein : Thank you, Michelle. Hello, everyone and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and full year results conference call. I'm Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, President and CFO; Bret Taylor, President and COO; and Gavin Patterson, President and Chief Revenue Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business acquisitions, results of operations and financial condition and that of our customers and partners are uncertain and subject to change. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that let me hand the call to Marc. Marc Benioff : All right. Well, thank you very much Evan and thank you everybody for being on the call today. It's great to be here, and I hope everyone's families are safe and healthy. Through the magic of PCR testing made possible by Visby Medical here in the Bay Area, through masks, safe distancing, being outside, and gorgeous San Francisco Bay, I am here together sitting at the table with Amy Weaver, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bret Taylor, our Chief Operating Officer; Gavin Patterson, our Chief Revenue Officer; Evan and Mark Hawkins, our CFO Emeritus. So, it's great to be here with everybody. And we haven't really done an outside conference call before, but welcome to the new pandemic world that we are in, and we're going to make this work. So, this is a reminder. We are definitely in a new place and we can see the beginning of return to our offices. In fact, I was in Salesforce Tower yesterday and held our global all-hands call. We can see return to restaurants, maybe even the sports arenas and to the concerts one day, who knows? You know, we\u2019re getting closer with all of the advancements in technology, but the reality is that even with the vaccines we're not really back to the way it was, and I was the only one in the Ohana Floor at Salesforce Tower. And we can all, I think, agree that this pandemic has forever changed our world and how we are working and living and educating ourselves from anywhere. Our Salesforce futurist, Peter Schwartz who many of you know, probably said it recently to me best when he said \"We're just in a new pandemic world.\" And as this is going to evolve and shift, we don't know exactly but we're going to kind of make it work, and that's the idea of being outside here during our earnings call. It's an all-digital, it's work-from-anywhere world where every company and every earnings call. We have to be able to work, sell, service, market, collaborate, and analyze our data from anywhere. And Salesforce was somehow already built for this world before it existed. That's why over the last year, Salesforce has become I think significantly more strategic and more relevant to our customers than probably any time before. And today, 22 years after founding of Salesforce, we can see it right here that more and more companies around the globe are turning to Salesforce to deliver success from anywhere. And that's why even in the midst of the global pandemic, we had such an incredible year and an incredible quarter, and you can see it in these incredible numbers. And that by delivering success from anywhere, our revenue rose to more than $5.8 billion, up 20% year-over-year, truly amazing for a company of our size. And for the full fiscal year 2021, revenue was $21.25 billion, which was up 24% year-over-year. Based on this strong fiscal year 2021 results, we're raising our fiscal year 2022 guidance to $25.75 billion, which is now at the high end of our range, representing 21% projected growth year-over-year. There's never been a software company over $20 billion in revenue that is growing as fast as we are. And as we shared at our Investor Day last year, our long-term revenue target for the fiscal year 2026 is now $50 billion or basically we're going to double the company from where we are right now. That is doubling revenue in five years, and we'll reach that milestone faster than any other enterprise software company. That would make Salesforce the second largest independent software company in the world, amazing. This is all really a testament to our employees and our customers and the technology and really this amazing ecosystem of all of this together and the millions of trailblazers who are working from anywhere and pioneering success from anywhere. I'm often asked how is it that we're able to succeed in such a difficult time? And I'll tell you, Salesforce is accelerating at such a rapid speed because we are already in this work-from-anywhere world. We're achieving success from anywhere. For us, success starts with our core values, and for those of you who followed our company for a long time when these things happen, when the world changes, we always pivot hard back to our core values. And trust is our number one value. There's never been a more important time when trust in government and other institutions, well we can see it's been eroding, and customers are seeking direct customer digital relationships. And I think that as the world has evolved, especially, in last year, the acceleration of these direct B2B and B2C digital relationships for our customers, it's more important than ever before because we're in a world of all of this mistrust, so that is why this Customer 360 platform is more important than ever and that's why it's so important. And customer success well, we're helping our customers navigate the pandemic and achieve success from anywhere you can see that. I'm going to talk to you in a second about some tremendous innovations with our Vaccine Cloud and our contact tracing capability and innovation. Well, you can see it. We're innovating well faster than ever before developing these amazing new products. And all these incredible new technologies and a quality we're helping and executing philanthropy and working together across all of these communities, especially our schools, hospitals, small businesses, and the most vulnerable populations get through what have been some of these incredibly difficult times. Our values have guided us as we've pivoted to this new pandemic world. And like every year, we came into it with a business plan. But early on about a year ago, in fact we knew that business plan was not going to hold together. We devised a whole new business operating model for how we run Salesforce and how we would succeed from anywhere. We call that our pandemic operating model. We sharpened our relevance, increased our levels of participation, enabled our employees, created new types of sales plays, and I shared our model with many CEOs that I've talked to over the last several months and now they're applying it to their own organizations and getting incredible new levels of performance out of it as well. As we dialed into the model, we immediately saw our team's level of relevance, participation, and enabled skyrocket. For example, from Q2 to Q4 our own enterprise sales teams even though they were at home used our Sales Cloud to engage in more than six million conversations with customers asking how we can be the most relevant and useful to them in the time of crisis. I don't think we would have survived as a business without our Sales Cloud. It was critical to build those business-to-business relationships that are the essence of Salesforce, but that we had to do digitally. And Sales Cloud enabled us to sell from anywhere. And throughout the year, we helped other great companies that you've heard about like AT&T or Insperity or Align or 3M or so many others to do the same. And we all -- of course we all love getting on the airplanes and flying somewhere and being in person with the customer, but it just hasn't been possible. Now if you look at the magic of our Marketing Cloud, well we were able to create new digital experiences like Dreamforce and I hope all of you had the opportunity to experience Dreamforce. But we have the ability to use our Marketing Cloud to have those direct digital relationships at scale. And instead of having 170,000 people take over San Francisco, we had more than 140 million views of just Dreamforce. That's amazing. We also created hundreds of other leadership events throughout the year for customers, employees, partners, communities and that generated another 300 million -- 350 million views. In the year customers like Zoom, like Carrefour, Humana and so many others also chose the Marketing Cloud to fuel their digital business growth as well. And with Service Cloud, while we managed our own case load as our business continued to accelerate through the year as we moved our call centers and contact centers into our employees' homes with 4.8 billion interactions using our Service Cloud in the last quarter. Customers in the year like Gap and Sonos and even Uber Eats who use Service Cloud to power success from their customers from anywhere. Now as a customer Slack, I can tell you we're using Service Cloud with Slack to improve performance. We've seen a 26% improvement in case times and close rates and 19% improvement in same-day resolution. That's an example where our acquisition of Slack has made so much sense. We've seen the combination of products like Service Cloud and Slack together just make it so much better for us as a company or for our customers and we're looking forward to doing so much more of that. Slack can be the central nervous system for any company connecting its people and data across systems apps and devices from anywhere. It's really an enabler of success from anywhere. And once our merger is approved we're going to build Slack into more of these products that we have used today and conceptualize and make our customers even more productive. We're going to create the most open and interoperable ecosystem of apps and workflow and enterprise software. By achieving success from anywhere at Salesforce we're delivering success from anywhere to our customers. In many ways, we're becoming the success from anywhere company. Whether it's B2B or B2C our customers need to accelerate their efforts to go all digital to build direct customer relationships with their customers. And for so many companies it's a matter of their survival. With the flexibility scale and time to value of Customer 360, our customers are able to quickly adapt to this new world. And on any given day, our customers are generating three million Commerce Cloud transactions. Well that's up 100% from a year ago. That's not a surprise to anybody. We all know we're shopping from anywhere and creating four million sales opportunities working from anywhere their home, a coffee shop, the mountaintop or delivering an average of 2.9 billion marketing messages from anywhere across any digital channel logging nearly 5 billion case interactions servicing from anywhere. Now Salesforce Einstein which is our core artificial intelligence capability really built in the heart of Customer 360. Well that's now delivering more than 93 billion, 93 billion AI-powered predictions every single day, 93 billion AI-powered predictions every single day across our entire Customer 360, amazing. Customer 360 makes all of our customer interactions smarter than ever before and it's a great example why Salesforce has been ranked by IDC as the number 1 CRM for the seventh year in a row. It's just the fourth quarter so companies are turning to Salesforce to build trusted relationships with their customers and deliver success from anywhere. Companies like I mentioned like; Align, or Telstra, or Dixons, or Marriott, or RBC, or Cigna, or Sports United across so many industries across, so many geographies companies large companies or small and medium companies even brands like IQVIA and Deluxe well they turned to MuleSoft which is critical to every digital transformation to connect to all of their legacy systems and connect that data from anywhere. And of course right now delivering success from anywhere also is managing the pandemic from anywhere. By developing technology like Contact Tracing Work.com well you see in Salesforce.com is at the forefront of helping organizations and governments speed back the pandemic or in the case of the state of Victoria in Australia well basically eradicate it. And with Vaccine Cloud we're helping cities like New York or states like where I am right now in California or other entire countries scale of vaccine operations and get vaccine shots in arms. And I have to tell you I've just never seen a logistics and information technology challenge like this before. And our technology is working incredibly well. And you've seen some other implementations of technology in this area. Well did not work well for these vaccines. So now we can see that more than 50 federal state, local and private health organizations are using Salesforce to manage this incredible response to pandemic. Cities like Austin and Chicago, New York City, California, New Hampshire, Rhode Island I mean it really goes on and on. More than 245 million people in fact have used COVID-19 data through our Tableau dashboards, and thousands of organizations are relying on Tableau's COVID-19 data hub such as Verizon and UNC or UNICEF, or experience and you can check that out at public.tableau.com or just go to tableau.com and you'll see a whole tab just on their response to COVID-19. That's been incredible with what our team at Tableau has done. The pandemic has shifted us all into this work from anywhere world, but it's just the beginning of a whole new era. And that's why we're so excited about what we have done and how we have transformed our own organization and our technology with Hyperforce. Look, we've built an incredible new platform. You heard about it at Dreamforce for the first time. This Hyperforce platform, well, this is a fundamental new architecture for us. It lets us run on any hyperscaler. Hyperforce allows us to run anywhere. And that allows our customers to choose where they want to manage their data. That's allowed us to open incredible new data centers in India and Germany, and we're planning to support another 10 new additional countries this year, and all built on this incredible new architecture. And it's 100% compatible with all our previous implementations. It's another example of how well we're going to be able to help our customers achieve success from anywhere. Now finally, when we are successful, we have responsibility to others. It means we can be living examples of stakeholder capitalism in action. And it's why during the pandemic we've accelerated our efforts to serve all stakeholders, including our communities and the planet. We supported frontline workers in 300 hospitals around the world by delivering over 50 million pieces of PPE. We've provided millions of dollars and grants to schools to help with remote learning, to local small businesses to stay afloat, and to organizations focused on racial justice as that turned into a crisis here in our United States. And we've partnered with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance on equitable distribution of vaccines across 190 countries. I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to fight climate change and protect our planet. In fact, we are a net zero operations company today, and we've also reduced our carbon emissions by 40% in the last year. With our Sustainability Cloud, companies across the globe are tracking and reducing their carbon emissions and keeping track of their critical ESGs. We're supporting the global movement to conserve, to restore, and grow one trillion trees as the founders of the World Economic Forum 1t.org initiative and I'm very grateful for everyone who has done so much to help this critical part of climate change with sequestration. All of which shows why when we truly serve all stakeholders business is the greatest platform for change. Well, that's where Salesforce is today and where we're going. It's a new business operating model work from anywhere, direct trusted customer relationships. You can see this incredible product line all built on this Hyperforce architecture serving all stakeholders is how Salesforce is achieving success from anywhere, and it's how we're enabling our customers to achieve success from anywhere. I'm incredibly proud and grateful for what we've been able to accomplish in fiscal year 2021. And I'm very proud of us even though we're freezing out here in San Francisco, but we're outside and doing it safely. We've all been PCR tested. It's all totally fine. And now, I'm turning it over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Amy Weaver. Amy? Amy Weaver : Thanks, Marc, and I agree. It's a little surprising to be doing my first call outdoors. But at least, it's brisk, this is great. So I'm thrilled to be here today in this new role. I've really enjoyed the opportunity to meet with and learn from many of our shareholders during the transition period, and I'm looking forward to getting to know more of the investment community during fiscal 2022. So as Marc described, we closed out our fiscal 2021 with another quarter of outstanding growth at scale and solid bottom line execution. So let me take you through some of the results for Q4 and fiscal 2021. I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.82 billion, up 20% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency. For the full fiscal 2021, revenue was $21.25 billion up 24% year-over-year in both dollars and constant currency. This was a well-rounded performance across geographies and service product offerings. Revenue attrition in Q4 was between 9% and 9.5%, which was slightly favorable versus our Q3 guidance assumption. Our continued focus on customer success has resulted in attrition rates better than we had assumed each quarter since the onset of the pandemic. However, our Q4 attrition rate is still higher than where we finished a year ago. Our remaining performance obligation, representing all future revenue under contract ended Q4 at approximately $36.1 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was approximately $18 billion, up 20% or 18% in constant currency. Turning to operating margin. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 17.5%. This includes a $184 million real estate impairment charge. As a reminder, our guidance for Q4 had assumed $80 million to $100 million in real estate charges. During the quarter, we identified further opportunities to consolidate and sublease across our global portfolio, including in some of our hub locations. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 17.7%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. The upside from our guidance was largely driven by revenue outperformance and partially offset by the incremental real estate charges that I just referenced. Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.28 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.04. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue, as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.21 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.22. Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion, up 33% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered $4.8 billion of operating cash flow, up 11% over last year. This number was slightly lower than our guidance for the year, which was driven by the growth investments discussed in previous calls as well as by timing of collections at the end of the quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $149 million, leading to free cash flow of $2 billion up 35% year-over-year. Now turning to guidance for Q1 and fiscal 2022. As a result of our Q4 performance, we are raising our Q1 revenue guidance by $170 million to $5.875 billion to $5.885 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This includes a $40 million contribution from Acumen Solutions due to an earlier acquisition closing date of February 1st. Additionally please note that MuleSoft will contribute to higher sequential revenue than historical norms in Q1 due to certain contracts that closed in Q4 but have start dates beginning in Q1. We are also raising our fiscal 2022 revenue guidance by $200 million to $25.65 billion to $25.75 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This includes $190 million from Acumen and subject to closing $600 million from Slack. For Q1, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 19%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2022 of 17.7% or flat year-over-year. We're pleased to keep the margins flat despite an expected 160 basis points headwind from Slack and Acumen continued investments in our core business and the anticipated gradual increase of travel in the second half of fiscal 2022. I do want to call out that the real estate consolidation mentioned earlier will have a positive impact on the longer term P&L. But at this point we do not see a material benefit in fiscal 2022. We expect GAAP diluted EPS for fiscal 2022 of negative $0.44 to negative $0.42 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.39 to $3.41. We expect recent M&A will be a $0.53 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assume no contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. We expect fiscal 2022 operating cash flow growth of 10% to 11% year-over-year. Note that this includes the expected dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen, which we expect to represent a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately nine points. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 10% to 11% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A noted above, this rate would be 21% and 22%. To close, in a year far different from what we ever could have expected, Salesforce delivered durable topline growth, non-GAAP operating margin expansion and took important steps on our path to $50 billion, by reimagining our business and setting ourselves up for success from anywhere. I'm extremely proud of the way that our employees navigated the challenges of fiscal 2021 with grace, resilience and with an unwavering commitment to our values and to our customers. Finally, I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, our community, and especially our shareholders for their continued support. And with that, Michelle, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mark Murphy : Thank you. I have to say I love to do outdoor conference call. I think you all heard seagull or a crow in the background in [indiscernible] at some point, so loved that innovation. My question is where are you in the demand cycle for Einstein and the AI technologies? You've had such a long head start there with that vision and you've been embedding it into your cloud, but it seems like right now is the moment that most companies are finally really prioritizing AI as a top initiative [indiscernible] this year. And so, I'm wondering if you're sensing any kind of inflection there with companies being recharged and more ambitious goals for Einstein and the data layer. Marc Benioff : Well, I'm going to let Bret Taylor take this over, but before he does, I just want to say that I'm so excited with how Einstein has been received by our customers and also how we have deeply integrated it into all of our clouds. It's definitely a critical-enabling technology that has made everybody just a lot more productive, and I've been surprised while other companies have divested some aspects of artificial intelligence. We continue to see Einstein become the critical enabling capability and differentiation that we can offer key clouds, especially what we've seen with commerce. So, I hope that Bret can further illuminate that. Bret Taylor : Yes, it's a great question and I definitely view this year and this new pandemic world as an inflection point for the adoption of Einstein. Broadly, I think we're seeing just incredible secular trends towards digital. Yes, I've heard a lot of CEOs just talk about essentially we did in a year what might have taken a decade before in terms of adoption of digital technology, and when all of your customer and your partner and your employee interactions are digital, artificial intelligence and Einstein can make every single one of those engagements more personal. To put some numbers on it, I'll just take Service Cloud as an example. Our digital service capability has grown at unprecedented rates this year, and with the adoption of things like chatbots and -- powered by Einstein, we saw 91% quarter-over-quarter growth in chatbots alone. Our Marketing Cloud, which is just every single one of those interactions, is personalized. If you looked at Cyber Week this past quarter, mobile push notifications were up 131% year-over-year. SMS was up 171% year-over-year. You're seeing just unprecedented adoption of digital, and the thing Marc covered in his opening remarks I think is really important, and a big part of our thesis as a company is we're not going back. The people who have experienced all these digital trends whether it's buy online curbside pickup, that direct-to-consumer trend in the consumer-packaged goods industry, the move to telemedicine, one of the customers Marc mentioned Humana. One of the things they're doing with our platform is Humana Care Support, which is this digital interaction between its members and the care teams, its provider communities. All of these trends are here to stay. And when we think about Einstein, we think about our platform broadly. We really think that we're looking over the next five years, how can we help every single one of our customers across all these industries gain success from anywhere and Einstein is a huge part of that vision. Operator : And your next question will come from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thanks so much, and congrats on all the success. My question is for Marc and/or Gavin. How do you think about the potential for acceleration coming out of a recession? Does your current pipeline look like it can support it and are you properly staffed up to capture the opportunity ahead? Gavin Patterson : Sure. Thanks for the question. The pipeline is very strong, and we saw that through -- built throughout the year; and coming into Q4, we continue to see it build. And that's in spite of having no face-to-face events during the year. It's all been done digitally. And as Marc said in his opening remarks, Dreamforce to you where we delivered the whole thing digitally was a huge success giving us access to decision makers and allowing us to strengthen that pipeline. And let me reassure you, we are building the capability in terms of the sales force. You'd be delighted to hear that we're investing significantly in terms of our direct sales force to take advantage of that demand, and I'm very confident we'll be able to meet it. So, I think you're hearing today a message from us all that the business is strong, the pipeline is strong, and we've got confidence going into the year. Operator : And your next question will come from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Your line is open. Arjun Bhatia : Hi. Thank you. Marc, this one might be for you or maybe Gavin, but we've touched on how much the world has changed over the past year with the pandemic. I would love to hear how the complexity of your deals with your customers have changed over the past year, particularly as it relates to things like deal cycles, deal size, multi-product adoption, and perhaps customer focus on time to value, and how are you adjusting to address those changes? Marc Benioff : Well, I'm going to let Gavin take this, but I'm going to take it at the high-order bit on. I've been surprised how many sales calls we've been able to make this year, and if I could rewind history over the last 22 years, I would have enforced a much more significant digital discipline for our sales organization. I think that when we look back at all of the time and energy we spent physically getting on airplanes going -- getting in cars, going to people's offices, having a breakfast or a lunch or a dinner, waiting to try to get up and make a C-level sales call, when you look today at the level of access that you have in organizations to conduct B2B sales, I mean it's all the capability when you're digitally enabled, you can go anywhere just much, much faster, and that's a key reason why with Dreamforce not only did we have a very successful Dreamforce from our park, and you probably saw the video with Bret and I. But also we then told each of our sales executives all over the world that they were going to have to do that. Same presentation, but highly customized, with highly customized demonstrations for each and every one of our customers, which we then did. And customers warmly received that with large groups of their employees. So, it's really an example of you can do a lot more to build pipeline, have direct access, and deliver highly customized selling at a level of velocity that I don't think previously was possible. Gavin, do you want to comment on that as well? Gavin Patterson : Well, what I would say is the digital imperative is now a CEO priority. That's the overriding theme that we've seen over the last nine months. Previously, it might have been delegated down into the business, but it has become so important and so urgent that the CEO wants to take direct control over it. And that has been something we've been able to take advantage of. And coupled with the fact that video allows us to get to see and make us faster and more frequently, it means that the pipeline has been very strong. So you had a question about the deal complexity and changes. It's been strong across the board,so we've done big deals. But the run rate business, the volume side of the business continues to be strong as well. And it's important that both these muscles continue to operate within our business model. So, it's a very well-rounded performance in that respect. And you've rightly identified. Time-to-value is I think probably even more important now for decision-makers. And this is a theme that I know certainly Bret and I have been on calls and is right at the forefront of the CEO and the CTO's decision-making. So, the more we can ensure that standard Salesforce solutions are deployed and they're configured in a standard way to ensure that we can get fast deployment I think is really, really important. So, we're agile we're getting the right sort of conversations and the pipeline is strong across the Board. Operator : Your next question will come from Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks very much. Maybe this one's for Bret. Bret, you all named David Schmaier, Chief Product Officer and President this quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of what you're thinking in terms of going more vertical from a product sort of development perspective in terms of his appointment. And maybe Gavin, how does that match up with how you're thinking about trying to maybe double down on certain verticals where you can go deeper with customers and sort of from an industry perspective because that seems to be one of your strengths is being able to sort of go deep in certain industries. Just can you talk about that a little bit? Bret Taylor : Yes, it's a great question. I'm so grateful to have David at this company. I was joking with Marc the other day that David Schmaier has forgotten more about CRM than most people know. He's been in this industry for decades and is truly an expert. And our strength as a company is that we are experts in our lines of business. We want to help people sell from anywhere, service from anywhere, market from anywhere, do digital marketing from anywhere. But we are increasingly experts in industries. And now thanks to both our organic strategy and our acquisition of Vlocity, we're at 12 industries that we serve across so many strategic verticals for our customers. And you heard our focus which is really helping our customers in this all-digital work anywhere world find success, find success from anywhere. And so much of that is really industry-specific. Every industry is going through a very accelerated digital transformation. In consumer goods, as Marc said, it's about creating direct trusted customer relationships, which is a completely new digital motion that requires new expertise, new software new -- and candidly just a new business model. In areas like health care, you've seen the impact this year. Retail, obviously, Cyber Week has accelerated again by almost a decade worth of acceleration this year. And when I think about our ability to really provide success from anywhere, it's really building in those industry-specific processes so they work out of the box. As Gavin and I mentioned, we do a lot of calls together and that time-to-value discussion is the first thing that comes up. And our vertical solutions are a big part of it because it means we essentially are starting all of our customers on third base with the industry-specific processes that are important to them. So, really grateful for David's leadership and really grateful for the alignment between our product strategy and our distribution and sales strategy that this vertical effort gives us. Operator : Your next question will come from Tom Roderick from Stifel. Your line is open. Tom Roderick : Wonderful. Thank you for taking my question. Marc I guess, I'll direct this to you, but probably a good opportunity for Gavin to chime in as well from the field. It seems like every year, you get to the fourth quarter and the big deals the ELAs the big digital transformation. A lot of those do show up in the fourth quarter. I would imagine over the last several years the nature of those transformations have changed. Given this has been such a wild and unusual year would love to hear what you're hearing from the field like customers are talking about that's different in the way that they're going about their digital transformations. Perhaps it's more MuleSoft, more Tableau, or maybe even talking about messaging and engagement. I know it's an open-ended question, but some more anecdotal evidence from the field on big deals would be great. Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, I'm going to have Bret and also Gavin come in here and talk about this because they've really had the opportunity to work on so many transactions together. But I think one of the major transformations that's happened this year and I think you can really see it and it appears into the numbers is when we actually sell to our customers we're selling our Customer 360 platform. And we have Sales Cloud. You're right. We have Service Cloud. We have Marketing Cloud. We have Commerce Cloud. We have this amazing Tableau. It's incredible multibillion-dollar analytics cloud. And we have this amazing MuleSoft integration cloud billion-dollar integration cloud and a reskilling platform and our services business and our partnerships and the full ecosystem of solutions. But when customers are coming and working with us and if I'm working with a CEO a fellow CEO of maybe one of these very large companies, they're not as interested in some discrete cloud. I'm sure you could probably appreciate that they are really interested in deploying our platform. And we have a lot of different words to describe these different parts of our code. But the reality is that they really just want us to make them successful. And when we look at some of the very large implementations that we've done this year, we're quick to say \"Well we fully implemented all of these AT&T retail stores with our Sales Cloud\" but the reality is that when you talk to Jeff McElfresh who we featured at Dreamforce who's the CEO of AT&T Wireless, mostly he just wants to know that he's more productive, more competitive, more innovative and that he is able to have better customer relationships and that all of his employees are aligned. And that's what we're really starting to sell. And I think that that's a powerful transformation of our company. And I think it really started when we had the successful acquisition of Tableau. It started to get customers to be able to look at us just much more strategically. It wasn't that we onboarded this incredibly successful analytics business with what we did. But it was really that we all of a sudden have a truly strategic solution for customers that's quite broad and that gives them a platform for success. And then, when you look at the pandemic, it's transformed to the platform for success from anywhere. So yes, we're going to let them sell from anywhere, or service from anywhere, or market from anywhere, but we're going to let them be successful from anywhere and that is really our platform. We used to call it if you remember, the Customer Success platform. So now we really should just be calling it the Success from Anywhere platform. Anyway, I'm going to have Bret and Gavin chime in here, because I think that you're touching on probably one of the most powerful transformational moments for Salesforce. And it's also honestly it's one of the main reasons that we've entered into an agreement to acquire Slack, because it's an enablement of success from anywhere. Okay. Bret? Bret Taylor : Okay. Yes I'll add a couple anecdotes. So all the big customer names that Marc mentioned in the opening are all multi-cloud transformational deals that really are about the entire Customer 360. I mentioned, Align before. That's Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud and our platform. And so I was actually just having a conversation with their Chief Digital Officer, Sree Kolli just yesterday. And it's really inspiring because they're using... Marc Benioff : They are an incredible company. Bret Taylor : Just an incredible company. Marc Benioff : You have to mention by the way that one of the cool things about Align is that it's more important than ever because everybody wants to make sure their teeth look good on their Zoom calls. So they like have a huge upsurge because everyone's like \"Whoa everyone's looking at my teeth.\" Anyway go ahead. Bret Taylor : As funny as that is... Marc Benioff : An amazing CEO also by the way. Bret Taylor : As funny as that is it's also true, but the hard part is we're in this all-digital world. So how do you engage with patients in an all-digital world? So using our core platform, which you expect, but they're also building custom apps like My Invisalign which is built on Heroku, built on our platform to build this really direct trusted relationship with their patients. And I think it's a really wonderful example because when you think about as Marc said what they want it's not a sales capability it's not a marketing capability. They need a digital customer experience to find success from anywhere. And I think every single business is going through this in a unique way. And I think that's very representative of our larger engagements. Gavin Patterson : Yes. Look I think most of the points have been hit, but from my perspective CEOs C-suite conversations around solutions fundamentally, they're not about products anymore. They're looking for multi-cloud solutions based on a Customer 360, Single Source of Truth, single view of the customer. And to the earlier discussion increasingly [Technical Difficulty] a lot of the standard things for the industry are built in so that they can use it out of the box. So I think we're touching on all the key themes. I think there's one other thing I would mention is that we're getting into more conversations with customers around outcome-based initiatives. So where they want our services businesses to be involved as part of the design and there's a real focus on what are the outcomes and how we can underpin those. So I think we've touched on most of these things already today. But certainly the complexity of the conversation the sophistication of the conversation is increasing. Operator : And your next question will come from Frederick Havemeyer from Macquarie. Your line is open. Frederick Havemeyer : Thank you. Marc, I'd like to ask a bigger picture question. So your portfolio of Cloud Engage customers offer workspaces for employees and enable business introspection with Tableau and Einstein. Now with Slack you could potentially integrate third-party apps and automate API-driven work across this ecosystem. So if we bring all this together how do you think about the future of work and Salesforce's role in enabling humans to focus on more meaningful and value-add work? Marc Benioff : Well, I think, this is really where we're going. And I don't know if you watched my presentation from Singapore, but I went to Singapore with Bret and we did our company kickoff there and we were in person with customers there and we're in person with our employees there and really looking at the future work there. I think that they're really living where the rest of us are going to be, which is why we went there. The pandemic is very much something that in many ways is behind them. Their businesses and their offices and their hotels and -- are open. They're still wearing masks in meetings, but they have very low virus rates. And when you look at what's happening there and you look at how they've restructured you look at how often employees are coming into the office versus before this is what I think the world that we're about to get into. And anyway Bret what was your reaction? Bret Taylor : I think it's a really wonderful point. I think the future right now we're at this inflection point where every executive including Marc, including me has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to really transform the way their companies work. If you had told me 1.5 years ago that we would execute this entire year without being in an office, without getting on an airplane I would have said it was impossible. But we did do it and we did it without any notice. And every executive in every company including ours coming out of this is really asking the question what is the company we want to be on the other side of it? What sales meetings are we going to get on an airplane for? Is that contact center that used to be a building that is now something that exists in the cloud are we going to go back to the building or just embrace the cloud? And I think it really everywhere and when we were in Singapore and talking to a bunch of companies that had reopened what stood out to me and Marc was actually how many of the pandemic behaviors actually remained. And I think that's a really interesting glimpse of the future. And you're seeing it across our customer base. There's this concept called flexible work that every single sales meeting I'm in, it comes up which is when our employees going back to the office. And notably when employees aren't going back to the office. And I think it's a really interesting time for digital technology. But as you said I think it's a really interesting time to think about what the future work looks like. And it's part of what drew us to Slack and that company's vision for the future because it's not just the digital translation of the way we used to work. It's truly a vision for a new way to work. And I think there is really just incredible appetite for that from our customer base. Operator :   And your final question for today will come from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Terry Tillman : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And I guess Bret, maybe it's for you. I remember asking at the Analyst Day about CDP and your efforts there. I think you had said something about how you have some large strategic opportunities you were working on. But I'm kind of curious what kind of benefit did you see from the CDP product in 4Q and how much it drove Marketing Cloud? And how big could this business be in FY 2022? Thanks. Bret Taylor :   Yes. I'm extremely excited about our customer data platform. Our brand name for that we call Customer 360 Audiences. And I think there's a couple of details, I'll add. Marc mentioned Hyperforce. This is really the architecture that's enabling our customer data platform. And notably, actually not just in our Marketing Cloud and not just for marketers, but actually enabling B2C scale across our entire platform.  Because I really do think that -- CRM for a long time was for B2B sellers. Back when Marc and Parker started this company 21 years ago that's what people thought. Now every single company of any scale and every single department wants a single source of truth for their customer data. They want to create segments. They want to integrate all their data from legacy data sources and proprietary data sources. And then they want to activate that across every channel digital channels, in-person channels. And Customer 360 Audience is generally available. We saw a really strong performance in its first few quarters as being available to customers. And we really view it as foundational for our Marketing Cloud in the coming years. Operator :   And we will take one more question from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Okay. Kash, your line is open. Okay. That clears us. That brings us to the end of our Q&A session. We'll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Evan Goldstein :   Thank you all for joining us on our Q4 FY 2021 earnings call. If you have any questions please e-mail us at investor@salesforce.com and we look forward to seeing you at our Q1 call. Thank you. Operator :   Thank you everyone. That will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Evan Goldstein : Thank you, Chantal. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2022 first quarter conference call. I'm Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, President and CFO; Bret Taylor, President and COO; and Gavin Patterson, President and Chief Revenue Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, acquisitions, results of operations and financial condition and that of our customers and partners are uncertain and subject to change. Any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that, let me hand the call to Marc. Marc Benioff : Well, thank you so much, Evan, and thank you for everyone on - being on the call today. I mean, it's just going to be a great call. I'll tell you this is the best quarter Salesforce has ever had. It was just a phenomenal Q1. And everyone is so excited to do this call with you and to talk about it and also just to talk about so many of the things that are important to Salesforce because everyone knows business is the greatest platform for change. We do believe that you can do well and do good at the same time. And before we go into these incredible results, we just want to let everybody know that our hearts and prayers are with all of our Ohana and India. They're on our mind every day. And we're so sorry for everything that they are going through. So I am now here with Amy and Brett and Gavin and Evan as well. And I'll just tell you that we're all vaccinated. We're grateful that we can be together. We're grateful that we are in a moment where we've been able to do that. We just finished a two-day off-site with our top managers from around the world. We - this is our third off-site we've done. We've done about eight total management off-sites. And through the miracle testing and now through the miracle of vaccinations and ability to get back into business and be in person where we're just grateful for that. We definitely are missing each other. And it's been great to be able to run our business in person. And we opened our offices. Amy and I were in our offices on Monday in San Francisco together on our Ohana floor. And it just was an emotional moment to know that we're back and that our Ohana are back in the offices and that we're opening back up. This is just a critical time. So it's an amazing quarter. And it's juxtaposed against - the pandemic is not over everywhere, but it's starting to be over somewhere. And certainly in San Francisco, where we have 850,000 people, but we only had a couple dozen infections per day last week. So it's a great moment. So we are grateful. We're grateful for this incredible performance by our team. We're grateful for the phenomenal quarter, it far exceeded our expectations. And I've just never seen a quarter like this. I mean, Gavin will go into the details. Bret will go into the details. It was just incredible. It was beyond our expectation. It's not just the best first quarter we've ever had. I think it's the best quarter we've ever had. We delivered $5.96 billion in revenue. It was up 23% year-over-year. Just the customer velocity, the pipelines, the growth of the company, the ability for the teams to interact and have a huge impact, it was just awesome. We delivered $3.2 billion in operating cash flow. And as a percentage of our revenue, it's just amazing what Salesforce could do today. Salesforce as a company, I said, doing well and doing good. I mean, here's the doing well part, $3.2 billion in cash flow on $596 billion in revenue, and that's up 74% year-over-year, reflecting the strong performance we've had since the impact of the pandemic began last year. Operating margin, again, and a huge call out here to Amy, and I'm going to talk more about. Amy's amazing performance for the company and how she's rebuilt this incredible operating margin model and operating model and how she's really kind of almost redesigning the company from the bottom up, it's awesome what she's been doing. And you can see it here, operating margin in the quarter was a healthy 20.2%. You look at the last four quarters, now starting in Q2 of last year, Q3, Q4 and now Q1, our margin, our revenue, our cash flow is awesome. And to see these changes that Amy has brought to the company has just inspired me. Now for the fiscal 2022, I'm thrilled, we are raising our revenue, our guide by $250 million to $26 billion. This is really one of the most - this is one of the largest raises we've really ever had. It represents 22% projected growth year-over-year. And we're not just raising revenue. And again, thanks to Amy, we're raising our operating margin to 18%. So that is amazing - incredible. And in a few years, we're going to be doing $50 billion, and by fiscal year 2026. So that is an incredible thing. I mean, we're really seeing some momentum and some cadence that's very powerful for the company. And the quarter, once again, demonstrates the strength and durability of our business, the quality of our leadership team, you're going to hear that today on the call, the relevance of our products, the incredible demand for digital transformation, but ultimately, it's been about customer success. And what I can talk about some of these customers and their amazing success with our products, companies that we know, like Honeywell and 3M and Sonos. And I mean, the Sonos story is just awesome, where they've just had this 84% growth, when they went to consumer using our products. We're so grateful to them. But also, you're going to see into the core products like, I'm going to hit some of the key things like how eight out of the top 10 deals included Tableau, what a successful story, that acquisition has been. And MuleSoft and ExactTarget, now it's all worked out so well for us. This quarter is really just demonstrating that strength and durability of our business. And I'll tell you, we're the leader in the CRM market, we all know that. We all know we're number one CRM. Everyone's just saw the IDC again, ranked Salesforce number one by market share in CRM, everyone knows the strategic nature of CRM. And this is the eighth year in a row that we're number one in CRM, which is awesome. And last week, Salesforce also received one of the very highest ratings from Gartner as a vendor. We tracked that information. It's our customers talking to Gartner. We tracked it and saw this incredibly, what we call, strong overall vendor rating, that meant a lot to us. And I'll tell you with something else that means a lot to us. And this is kind of a moment. And I think we can say this, we have to kind of get our head around this. We're about to pass SAP as the largest enterprise applications company in the world. And all the analysts have their models, they - I know you all track SAP and Salesforce, you don't really talk so much about SAP since they mostly exited the CRM market so many years ago. But I'll tell you that it's awesome to see not just be number one in CRM, but we're going to be the number one enterprise software applications company in the world passing SAP. This is a moment. We can see it's imminent. And this pending acquisition of Slack also, I mean, we've never been better positioned for the future. This is all digital, it's an all work from anywhere world. It's made our company, Salesforce and Slack, well, more important to customers than ever. So bringing them together is so exciting. And once this merger is approved, we're going to be able to build Slack and all of our products will all become Slack first. It's going to make our customers more productive. We're going to work with software companies on building incredible new capabilities. Like we've seen these amazing examples of what Slack could do. I'll tell you, we're really excited about creating this number one enterprise applications company. And I can't wait for all of us to be back together and with you, and hopefully, we'll be together in person at our Investor Day coming up. So, of course, the real highlight of every quarter is the success of our customers. Customer success is one of our highest values, trust, customer success, innovation, the ease of use of our products, quality, and we just had amazing traction during the quarter across all parts of our business. We hit an all-time high and seven-figure-plus transactions. And I hope that Gavin will talk about that. It was really - this kind of first really quarter where a company history more than 120% growth year-over-year in these huge transactions. It really shows the whole world is going digital, and customers are connecting with their customers in a new way, and everyone needs CRM to do and they need the analytics and they need integration. And we are the leaders in that area. And we're able to partner with them to deliver this incredible capability. You know, on average, these seven figure transactions they included four or more of our clouds. That's awesome. It really goes to show the durability of the business built by so many amazing products Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, you know, Community Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Integration Cloud. The Analytics Cloud with Tableau its awesome. And our successful integrations of ExactTarget and Tableau and MuleSoft continue to drive this incredible results for our customers and gives us so much confidence in this pending Slack acquisition. You know, we're seeing more and more inclusion of Tableau and MuleSoft and our large deals, as customers accelerate their digital transformations. I mean, I'm sure it will shock everyone, that Tableau, Tableau was part of eight of our top 10 deals. That really is evidence and the integration we've had with Customer 360 of its success. And MuleSoft was included in five of these top 10 deals. It was awesome. Honeywell is a great example. And you know I love theories of Darius Adamczyk and credible CEO, a great example of a company investing in Salesforce across their business. Now they've been manufacturing innovative products for more than 100 years, creating connected customer experience, breaking down silos for their 100,000 employees globally. But with Sales Cloud, Honeywell is enabling its global sales team to manage thousands of customers and sellers from anywhere. And anyone who was with Bret, and I in Washington, DC or got to watch it online, we went there to be with our customers and employees in person. And we did this incredible world tour. And we had the Honeywell executives there talking about this incredible transformation of their global sales team and then [ph] it was really cool. And Tableau Dashboards at Honeywell are providing their sales teams with these key insights to improve their productivity. And with my trailhead, which is our re-skilling platform, you know, that's Honeywell rescaling their sales team right in their flow of work, increasing their performance. And Service Cloud, Service Cloud together with field service and Experience Cloud is enabling Honeywell to seamlessly dispatch technicians for on site product maintenance and proactive asset management and connected service partner experiences and customer experience for scheduling appointments and instantly troubleshooting problems. In fact, it was really that field service capability that helped us to amplify our relationship with Honeywell. And that's where Darius and I started to really collaborate and say, wow, we could bring this to the aviation business in Honeywell and transform how they're doing their amazing jobs. I'll tell you for a long time, we've had a trusted relationship with Dell Technologies and their incredible founder and tremendous friend of Salesforce, Michael Dell. You know, last year, Dell partnered with Salesforce Professional Services, implemented the world's largest deployment in Sales Cloud to support sales reps, go to market channel partners. I'll tell you I just finished Michael Dell's new book. It's called Play Nice but Win and it inspired me, and it really was exciting and that Salesforce and Dell have this partnership that helped them win, it was powerful. And with Service Cloud, Dell is also giving a service agents a 360-degree view of every customer, that was so awesome to see. And they're using Marketing Cloud for B2B customer journeys. They're transforming their seller experience, its incredible. Another amazing CEO that we work with Mike Roman at 3M and for those of you who watched Bret and I in Singapore, Bret and I flew to Singapore for the kickoff of the quarter. And we were there in Singapore and we're live with our customers and with our Ohana employees and everybody and government leaders and well we had the opportunity to talk to Mike Roman, the CEO of 3M, the iconic innovator, the center of efforts to combat COVID-19 and we were so happy to partner with them. And today 3M is using Customer 360 across 83 countries. And when Mike, you know, realized there were counterfeit masks that weren't providing the protection of 3M masks, they partnered with us to make sure we could immediately deliver fraud reporting center with Service Cloud, and we did it, it was an awesome story. And we had to do it instantly, immediately. There's been so many stories like that, especially in our governments, you know, you see them what happened, what just is going on right now in Australia in Melbourne. You know, they're again relying on Salesforce contact tracing system, to resolve this breakout. They're all locked down, I hope that they'll be able to identify everyone quickly and open back up quickly. And I know they've got the infrastructure to do it with salesforcework.com. It's incredible story that's going on down there. 3M is getting back to that, well, they're also piling Tableau to create a single dashboard for their entire business. Tableau continues to be a strategic part of so many of our customers business. And we're working with the pioneer in online mortgage lender Rocket Mortgage, to make complex transactions like buying a home or a car and evaluating personal loan. I mean, it's amazing what's going on with Rocket Mortgage. I'll tell you, I really enjoyed working with that company. And they're inspiring because they themselves are just such tremendous, tremendous innovators. And if you know their CEO, Jay Farner, well, you'll understand, how they're using our Financial Services Cloud and Marketing Cloud to deliver a source of truth for all their customers data and drive personalized engagement scale. You know, Jim is incredible. And during the quarter, they also selected MuleSoft to integrate across all their various systems. Of course, I mentioned Sonos before, it was incredible story. They went digital direct to their consumer, well, grew their business 84% year-over-year, and with Marketing Cloud, Sonos is connected with their customers through email, through mobile, through social channels. They built the Customer 360. They started pioneering a single source of truth. And it continues to scale its business. They've even invested very deeply in e-commerce with Salesforce, as well as Tableau, great story. And I'll tell you, those stories, and the story just mentioned, like what's happening in Melbourne, well, that's all about our public sector business, or the country of Japan with our vaccine cloud, in order so many places here in the United States like Clay County, it means it's been an unbelievable year, it's been an unbelievable quarter. I mean, it really has been a lot about doing well and doing good. It's been about really showing how Salesforce is, you know, the business, and you know, that business could be the greatest platform for change. Now, I'm telling you something that's really exciting and something new. And I couldn't be more excited to tell you this. And we're going to take another huge step forward here. Now, I've been telling you that we've been doing a number of off sites, you know, bringing our executives together, or both in our offices now, we have our employees back, and we're about to take another huge leap forward. We're taking a huge leap forward, because Dreamforce is coming back in person in 2021 to San Francisco, as well as simultaneously in New York, Paris, London, it's going to be a global Dreamforce. And we're going to have thousands of people at every venue. We're going to work closely with local officials. And we're going to do an amazing show. I hope all of you will be there, September 21 to 23rd. It's going to be the first global Dreamforce. And we're going to host groups with trailblazers in COVID-19 safe places, along with tens of millions online, it's going to be a hybrid event, physical and digital. Now we're going to follow these public health guidelines for every city. And I expect all of you to follow them as well. And in the US, we're going to require our attendees to be fully vaccinated to attempt, that's going to be a critical part. And it's how our core epidemiologists and medical teams and Salesforce have decided that we can do this amazing reopening, Dreamforce. We've worked with our long-time partner and customer Marriott. We've worked with leaders in this - in our local medical communities and university, including Dr. Larry Brilliant, he has been a great friend of our company, a tremendous epidemiologist, to follow these best practices, and to create this amazing new Dreamforce. So Dreamforce 2021 is going to be the most inclusive, the most accessible Dreamforce ever. It's going to bring the magic of Dreamforce to anyone, everywhere, anywhere. I mean, it's going to be great to be back together and be with all of you. It's going to be a family reunion, an incredible family reunion. And I'm also thrilled that earlier this month we opened Salesforce Tower. As I mentioned, Amy and I were together in San Francisco, was also opened it in London, I think it's great to be back to work and we want to do, we want to be the pioneers and back to work. We know that people are going to still be working at home, but they're going to be in the office too. And we're going to be doing these off sites in advance and get togethers and collaboration. And we're even going to have this incredible new training facility, a cultural-immersion facility, a place where we can bring large groups of our employees or even customers and their families together with Salesforce ranch [ph] And we couldn't be more excited about that. And we see those four things together in the office, at home, events, like off-sites and Dreamforce. And even this incredible new training facility. I mean, it's really inspired by General Electric, you know, I went to Crotonville when I worked so closely with GE and their digital transformation. I was wondering, wow, if we ever have something like this, I never saw the need, why would Salesforce need Crotonville but today we knew, because so many of our employees are at home, how are we going to immerse them in our values, how are we going to educate them on our products, how are we going to show them what Salesforce is really all about. And that's why this incredible facility will be so important to us. And we're looking forward to talking about that. You know, over the last 20 years we build an amazing culture, amazing company, to be the number one enterprise applications company in the world, already the number one. CRM in the world. Now, I'll tell you, when we started this business, we had three dreams. To create a new technology model, we call that the cloud, a new business model, subscription, we all understand that now. And a third model, a third model based on 1-1-1, 1% of our equity, 1% of our time, our products. And that becomes the businesses the greatest platform for change. We couldn't be more excited. And I'll tell you 6 million employee volunteer hours, well that's evidence that this is working, 450 million in grants so far, 51,000 non-profits running on our service for free, its more evidence. I'm happy to give this testimony that our culture has enabled us to create an amazing company, but also to attract and retain amazing talent. And I'm enormously proud that Fortune just ranked us as one of the best places to work in the world. Again, I think this year, we're number two. But it's that 13th year that we've been on this list. It's really evidence that, you know, we can all do more in business, we can do well and we can do good. And before I turn this over to Amy, and I want to make sure you know about two amazing reimagined events that are also coming up this month. We're going to have Connections on June 2, our digital marketing event of the year and on June 23 Trailhead DX., I hope you're going to be with us for both of those. I hope you'll be with us for Dreamforce. We're so grateful for your incredible partnership during this year. And we're delighted to deliver the best quarter we've ever delivered. And now a key part of that, Amy. Amy, go ahead. Amy Weaver : Thank you, Marc. And good afternoon everyone. Performance in q1 was professed - impressive across all financial metrics, with a record levels of Q1 new business performance and strength across all products, regions and customer sizes. Importantly, we were able to achieve growth, while also delivering profitability. So let me take you through some of the results for Q1 fiscal '22. I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the first quarter was $5.96 billion, up 23% year-over-year, or 20% in constant currency. The strong new business pipeline that we discussed last quarter enabled us to deliver these results. While we had a favorable comparison for Q1, our two-year new business CAGR also illustrates the continued strength in the business. A few areas to highlight. As Mark mentioned, we saw a record number of Q1 seven figure deal. Not only were these deals this, they were multi-cloud transformation, was on average more than four clouds included in each. Our vertical strategy continues to align our products to strategic industries. In particular, we saw strengths in the public sector, which continues to accelerate as governments around the world turned to Salesforce Solutions. Service Cloud demonstrated another quarter of incredible growth at scale, with Q1 revenue of $1.5 billion growing 20% year-over-year, and Tableau continues to perform well. We are pleased with the progress of the integration. For example, in Q1 Tableau was in eighth of our top 10 deals for the company, and in more than 60% of our seven-figure-plus deals. Revenue attrition in Q1 was between 9% and 9.5%. We were - we continued to be pleased with the progress made on attrition. Our remaining performance obligation, representing all future revenue under contract ended Q1 at approximately 35 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was approximately $17.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. Turning to operating margin. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%, largely driven by revenue outperformance and incremental expense efficiency. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.21. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue and expense efficiencies, as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.23 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.24. Turning to cash flow, operating cash flow in the first quarter was $3.2 billion, up 74% year-over-year. As a reminder, last year cash flow seasonality was impacted by our decision to provide temporary financial flexibility to some of our customers during the pandemic. And we continue to expect cash flows seasonality to skew higher in Q1 and Q4. CapEx for the quarter was $171 million, leading to free cash flow of $3.1 billion, up 99% year-over-year. Before moving on to guidance, I want to update you on the status of the Slack transaction. We remain on track to close in Q2. You know, as we've refined our Q2 and full year guidance, we have also refined our expectation on the Slack closing date, which we now expect to be near the very end of the quarter. So I want to emphasize that all guidance assumptions involve changes involving Slack are completely timing driven. So turning to guidance. We expect Q2 revenue of $6.22 billion to $6.23 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes no contribution from Slack. For Q2 we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 20%. This guidance assumes approximately three points of growth from Slack. As a reminder, Q2 fiscal '21 benefited from strong renewal performance. We expect Q2 GAAP loss per share of negative $0.10 to negative $0.09, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.92. Our assumptions include a $0.09 impact from Slack, primarily driven by OIE and transaction and integration costs. Now moving to fiscal '22 update. As a result of our Q1 performance, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by $250 million to $25.9 billion to $26 billion or approximately 22% growth year-over-year. Now this guidance incorporates an expected revenue contribution of $500 million from Slack, due to the changes I mentioned in our closed timing assumptions. Our guidance continues to include $190 million from Acumen. Net of the revised Slack contribution, this represents a $350 million raise on our core business. Our decision to raise fiscal '22 revenue is reflective of our Q1 performance and our confidence in our ability to execute for the rest of the year. We're also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin to 18%, an expansion of 30 basis points year-over-year. This continues to include an expected 160 basis points headwind from Slack and Acumen, continued investment in our core business and the moderate increase of travel in the second half of this year. We are raising fiscal '22 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.22 to $0.24 and non-GAAP diluted EPS to $3.79 to $3.81. We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.53 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assume no contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. We're also raising fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by two points, now expecting 12% to 13% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide is primarily driven by revenue performance, and by the refined timing expectations on M&A. The diluted cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately eight points. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 12% to 13% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A as previously noted, this rate would be 22% to 23%. To close, our impressive start to fiscal \u201822 positions us well for the rest of the year, and keeps us on track to achieve our goal of$ 50 billion by fiscal '26. It really was a terrific quarter, and I'm grateful to our employees for their focus on both growth and efficiency during the quarter. Finally, it has been a pleasure to meet many of our shareholders over the past few months, and I want to thank all of you for your continued support of Salesforce. And with that, Chantal, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. Congratulations to the team. My first question is for Amy. Amy, nice work on the margins, and clearly, Marc talked about how you're reimagining the company from a fundamental level. Can you just talk about what are the things that you're working on that would give you the right balance between growth, which is great, and the margin expansion? And if I could sneak in one for Marc, if you look at the future of work, what is the position for salesforce.com as you look at that future? How is Salesforce positioned to take advantage of what you believe to be the future of working and whatever that is, the way we work in the future? Thank you. Amy Weaver : Hi, Kash. Thanks for the question. So when I look at the balance between growth and profitability, I want to be clear that growth remains our #1 priority. Investing into growth, especially in this demand environment, is simply the best thing we can do for the company. That said, I am a big believer that a focus on discipline makes for a stronger and more durable company. So over the long-term, I believe we need to be able to deliver both. Marc Benioff : Well, Kash, I really appreciate your question. We have a tremendous vision for the future of work at Salesforce, future of our own business, like I mentioned, that home workers or in-office workers, the ability to meet and have off-sites and events and programs and large cultural facilities like we talked about. But we believe there is a fundamental technology platform that is needed to bring all this together. And we also believe that we also have to include all stakeholders, not just our company, but our customers and our partners, and even consumers. And I think that Bret has created an incredible vision for the future of work and an incredible platform. And when you think about as well what Slack is going to do in terms of transforming our company, when each one of our clouds become Slack first, well, that, I think, is a huge accelerator in all this. So, Bret, would you just kind of tell us what is the future of work? Bret Taylor : It's a great question. And more importantly, it's a question on the mind of every CEO in every single one of our customers. When you look at the trends of this past year, like that wonderful Honeywell story that Marc mentioned in his script, they shifted 7,000 salespeople from in-person to virtual customer meetings. Customer meetings aren't going back to conference rooms only. They're going to stay on Zoom as companies like ours just realize that we can execute, as well as ever before in this digital environment. The contact centers that move from being buildings to be in the cloud, thanks to the power of Service Cloud, they're not going back to buildings anymore. When you think about to move from doctors' offices to telemedicine, you look across our portfolio, the move to digital commerce and digital marketing, and incredible Cyber Week numbers we talked about last quarter, we really think that this digital Customer 360, this platform we've been building is an absolutely crucial part of the future of work for every single one of our customers, in particular, because things aren't going to snap back to the way they were. It's also, as Marc mentioned, I think, one of the reasons we're so excited about the prospect of closing this Slack transaction. When you think about what does it mean to succeed in the all-digital work-anywhere world, it's Customer 360, which enables you to digitize your entire customer experience and get back to growth in this incredible economy. And it's the digital HQ from Slack, which enables you to connect to all of your employees, all of your partners, and all of your customers together in this incredible new engagement platform. And we think the two together represent an incredible opportunity that I think is truly the operating system for growth for every company embracing this new way of working and getting back to growth in this new normal. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Brent Bracelin : Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first, great to hear this new concept of a regional in-person Dreamforce. Looking forward to an in-person reunion here. I guess for maybe Marc or Bret here, Salesforce has, by far, the broadest portfolio of different cloud applications today. I was hoping you could parse out what customers are asking for what cloud application could see the highest uptick in interest. As you look at the pipeline, you mentioned Tableau being a meaningful part of the large deal pipeline. But would love to just better understand what cloud applications specifically are ramping the most here in this kind of post-vaccine era that we're entering. Bret Taylor : Yeah. Thank you for the question. I think one of the things, if you see the numbers, the strength is really across the portfolio. When we talk about the fact that of those seven-figure deals, they, on average, included more than four of our clouds. We're not selling individual products. We're selling a Customer 360 solution to really transform the entire customer experience. That said, last quarter, I talked a lot about the amazing growth in marketing and e-commerce due to Cyber Week. It's really heartening to see just all aspects of the economy and our portfolio growing. One of the most fun for me this quarter in Sales Cloud, we're seeing over 5 million opportunities created every day. That is almost a 20% increase over last quarter. This is every B2B selling team in the world investing in growth again, recognizing the demand environment we see in the economy at every single part of our customer base. Another great example of this is that -- and I don't even know if you know this, Marc, but in April, Einstein started doing over 100 billion predictions per day. And it's a great example of these platform investments that we did multiple years ago that our customers, that the whole economy goes digital is really -- are really benefiting from. When you think about what does that mean, it means that every e-mail you get is more personalized. It means that every e-commerce you paid is suited to your interest and your needs, driving growth and success for our customers, but really represents, I think, the importance of these foundational technology investments. And another great example of this, Marc talked about Customer 360, Analytics, and Tableau, integration with MuleSoft. You're really seeing the importance of, I'll call it, that technology foundation as it relates to these Customer 360 multi-cloud deployments. MuleSoft is now doing 4.86 billion integration transactions every day. That is up 28% quarter-over-quarter. And it's sort of the boring, but important part of this Customer 360, integrating all of those legacy systems, so our customers can move faster in the face of an economy that's, I think, shifting more rapidly than ever before and really, I think, shows the importance of our acquisitions as it relates to our overall value proposition of Customer 360. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the questions, and a great start to the year. It looks like there's a ton of momentum at Salesforce right now. Maybe one question for Marc and one for Amy. For Marc, there has been some investor debate on sort of to what degree digital transformations are really accelerating. A lot of other companies had a more mixed or difficult Q1. You guys seem to have really hit it out of the park this Q1. Can you tell us kind of your view on sort of how your customers are changing their investment profiles? And when is that going to hit? Is that something that is really a 2021 event? Or because of the big strategic nature of these deals, this could take some time to flush out? I guess I'm asking, how is the pipeline looking for these big strategic deals? And then the question for Amy. We were impressed when you sort of stuck it with 17.5% operating margins with the initial FY 2022 guide. Now you're raising it another 50 basis points. Can you talk to us about does that come from sort of expenses being pushed out? Or is it just kind of - is there actual kind of more efficiencies that you're finding in the business that enable you to raise the operating margin guide here? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, I'm so excited that you're excited about Amy's new model. I mean, I, by the way, am also - I mean, she - I think Kash said it well. She has reimagined the business. She has rebalanced our ratios. She's figured out how to take this kind of changes that have occurred in the pandemic, which is less travel and less real estate and less events, and kind of rebuilt the company from the bottom up. And I think that's where we're really starting to see Amy's genius kind of take place, which is that -- when I look at the revenue, $5.96 billion, up 23%, 20% in constant currency. The cash flow, $3.23 billion. But then when I really get down into this operating margin at 20.2% but also the ability to raise for the year, it really gets down to this new model that she's really pioneered and has installed in the company. And it's given us a fresh look at how we run our business and what we're going to do in the future and how we think about the right balance between revenue and cash flow and margin. And the pandemic gave all of us the ability to reset our lives but also our businesses. And when we look at resetting our businesses, we also have to reset our financial models. And I think that this is the result of now four amazing quarters of this financial model emerging. And I think we're going to see that continue to pay out for the rest of the year and future years as well that we will benefit from this. And I don't think it's something that's getting pulled forward or pushed back or this or that. It's all zero-based from the bottom. So that's what's exciting, and it's a commitment that we have to a new model and a new approach. And also, this idea, though, it's a new way to work. Now, in regards to the customer focus, I think, well, we just have never seen customer demand like this, and there's certain applications that we've been asked not to profile on the call, for example, in regards to some things that the US government has done in terms of making sure that stimulus gets to the right place at the right time. And we were asked to do things in a matter of weeks. It's not just limited to our government. It's other governments. It's other businesses. I mean, I've never seen, and I said this in the last couple of calls, so many, what I would call, emergency deployments. Usually, they say, hey, we like to have this in six months, 12 months, the most 18 months. That's one of the reasons they come to Salesforce. Very fast time to value, this is critical. But for us, they want instant time to value. We're like, wait, we have to build this in the cloud. We don't go - we got to go. All right, we'll build. We'll build it. We'll deliver this. We'll make this happen for you. And I've been so fortunate to have Gavin really by my side during all of this. I mean, everybody knows Gavin's tremendous lineage. And Gavin and I worked together, have been friends for more than a decade. But of course, as the CEO of BT, I always admired his business process and business practice and his ability to bring discipline. But now watching him run our customer organization and what he's done now over the last year, that's just been a shock to me. But, Gavin, I think you should just kind of come in here because it's not just Amy, who's re-imagined the financial model. You've re-imagined the entire customer model and how we're going to market and the balance of sales and service, and you've re-imagined the level of management that we have and where we're putting that management level of capacity, the relevance, the participation, I mean, the enablement, these things that you've laid in. So would you just tell us - give us what's happening on the customer side? And how do you see the market today? Gavin Patterson : Well, thanks, Marc. As you say, it's been an absolutely stellar quarter, incredible quarter. And three words come to mind for me : relevance, investment, and execution. Relevance is, I think, really, really clear. What we offer at the moment is what organizations around the world, be those companies or governments, it's what they're looking for to manage their business, and we see that in the new business pipeline. It's extraordinarily strong. Yes, we have a favorable compare, but if you look at the two-year performance, it's really, really strong. And that's the key number to look at. We're not persuaded by just the year on year. It needs to be the two-year performance with an easy compare. So I think taking advantage of the economy, the strength of investment going into the economy in many places around the world. We're perfectly placed to take advantage of that. I think the second thing is about investment. So in the mid part of last year, when we were restructuring the business, we also put new investment back into the business, particularly with capacity, and we're seeing the benefit of that now as we come into the year really strong, ready to take advantage of the strong economies we're seeing around the world. So being able to invest when others won't, I think, is a significant factor. And then the final thing is around execution. We had a really strong, I think, quarter because of the execution and the grip that we've got on the sales and service organization. We had a digital launch this year, and that meant we got all the quotas deployed very, very quickly. We've got more selling days into the quarter. We've got a flatter organization now, so there's really clear accountability throughout the business. And we've seen that turn into great results, great results both in terms of the run-rate business but also particularly strong results in the big deals. And Marc talked about some of those numbers. So the business is really humming. The pipeline is super strong. It's across all clouds. It's across all geographies. There's a real strong focus on industries as well. The business is really, really pumping. Marc Benioff : All right. And I really want to ask a follow-up question, Gavin, because you mentioned this, but I think it's important to illuminate this, which is Q1 was very much frictionless. We decided we're going to do digital kickoffs. We're going to get all of the quotas and the territory assignments out as quickly as possible. You've really led this amazing program to do this and to make sure we have this fast start to the first quarter into the fiscal year. You brought a level of discipline into the sales org I've never seen before. So I never really understood how the British did it. So let me just -- if you just fill in the detail there in terms of the velocity of the distribution organization is just incredible. Gavin Patterson : Well, I think this is one of the silver clouds that's come out of the pandemic, is that we couldn't meet face to face. So we have to do everything digitally, but that meant we got out of the blocks really, really fast. It meant that we're able to compress the launch of the year into about a week. It gave us more seven days, made sure that everybody was clear what they had to achieve. Their goals were deployed earlier in the year, and that meant we're able to focus on our customers. And that's the most important thing we do. And when the demand is there, which is the case at the moment, there is undoubtedly demand for our products. The key is making sure that your turf, your customers, and you're there helping them solve their problems. It's been about execution. Marc Benioff : It's inspiring, Gavin. And I'll tell you, we've had a lot of great distribution leaders in our company and a lot of great people by my side over the last two decades, who have been running this distribution organization, but you've just done an incredible job. And I just want to congratulate you on not only a great year last year but now just this amazing first quarter and the execution you've done. Amy, do you want to just come in here now, go into details? Because this velocity that Gavin has given us, well, now you're really paying it out with this new model, aren't you? Amy Weaver : So it's terrific. And, Keith, thanks for the question. As you know, very, very pleased to raise from 17.7% up to 18%, so a 30-basis-point improvement for the year. This is not a push out. What it really is it's a combination of a few things. First, it's the great quarter that Gavin just described, and having such terrific revenue, this really gives us some additional room to operate this year. It's also a focus on what we've learned about how we're working. We learned a lot over the past year. Gavin pointed out, having a virtual PKO and kick-off led to different efficiencies and also led to savings. And then finally, it is a renewed focus on efficiencies and discipline around the company. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Maybe a question for Gavin. The Americas saw an acceleration, but Europe and APAC saw a slight deceleration. And I know that's reported revenue, but I'm just curious if you could talk to what you're seeing outside the US and recovering. Obviously, the lag would make sense there but what you're seeing in pipeline beyond the US? Gavin Patterson : Look, the recovery from the pandemic is not at the same stage in every market. I think that's fair to say. But our business is strong. The new business has been strong across the board. There might be one point or two difference region by region, but there are no, what I would call, weaknesses across our global organization. So we do see strength across the board, and we see a strong pipeline importantly across the board. So I wouldn't read into anything. I'll point difference here or there. I'm very confident that this growth in the US but also outside the US and around the world. Marc Benioff : And I'll give you a point of evidence on that, which is that Gavin and I brought our top distribution leaders together in person last week with Bret. And we can't bring them all in person. So some of them are just not allowed in the United States. We just can't get them here. But for the ones that can come in like Gavin, for example, or others, we even were able to bring in some of our European executives. Wow, I mean, it was really a position of confidence. It was feeling like there is a tremendous market that has built over last year that I think people realize that they must be digital, but they must be digital with their customers. It's not just digital transformation. It's digital customer transformation. That's where the power is, I believe, in the market, especially right now. And I love that Sonos story because it's point of evidence on that. Would you agree? Gavin Patterson : Yeah, absolutely. The Sonos story is a perfect case study in many ways. And I think it demonstrates the ability for us to help customers transform quickly. I mean, this was a pivot that Sonos needed to make right at the height of the pandemic, and we were able to help them transform their business and manage through the pandemic and come out a stronger business, closer to their customers and be extremely well placed to continue to grow in the next few quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex, your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey. Sorry, I was on mute, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe, Amy, first for you. You re-imagined the operating model and rebuilt it from the ground up, as Marc said, where have you found the lowest hanging fruit from an operational efficiency perspective that you're looking to leverage going forward? And for Marc, you've been through recoveries before you've been through downturns before. How strong is the demand right now versus the past recoveries you've seen and your best guess looking on a global basis, how long it lasts? Amy Weaver : So thanks for the question. I think the lowest-hanging fruit is -- clearly are different in how we are working right now. It's this all-digital work from anywhere. Probably the easiest part on that is the difference in T&E. That clearly has gone way down. We are assuming, for purposes of guidance, some modest return of travel in the second half of this year. But it will be nowhere near where we were pre-pandemic. We've simply learned how to work effectively and how to serve our customers effectively without being on a plane every day. Marc Benioff : Well, I'll tell you that you're right. I mean, this was the best quarter we've ever had, and I can tell you from bringing these distribution leaders in, I've never seen a pipeline like this or the ability in every market to execute with such robustness. And I think the CEOs -- I mean, I'll tell you from my own. Obviously, we invested last year. We didn't pull back. We knew we had to go for it. And we had to go all out. And it's counterintuitive. The world is ending, and you have to say, well, you got to go all out and realize that the world is not going to be ending in a year from now. And it's hard when you're in it because people start to panic. It's a normal human reaction. I mean, we even had executives in Salesforce who came in and said, \"Oh, we've got to cut. We got to do this. We have to do that.\" We reshaped. There's no question, we did some slight reshaping, but we didn't do any massive layoffs or anything like that of any consequence that I would say, oh, we really tried to cut dramatically in some area or whatever. It was like, no, we need to reshape to grow. We need to invest to grow. We need to do the things that we need to do as a company, and that's a year ago. So a year ago, it was a decision based on experience that is we have seen it, whether it was the recession of 2001 or the financial disasters of 2008. Those are just moments. They're moments in time, but in the history of the company, or if you look at the history of the equity from 2004 when we went public, you got to keep going. And that moment is the time to go because, in many cases, your competitors are pulling back because they're afraid. And when your competitors are afraid, that's when you need to invest, and that's where you really need to grow. And I'll tell you, I think that that's what Gavin did, that Gavin came in and he reshaped. He took out some cost. He advanced certain areas. He rebalanced his org and was able to provide greater market coverage and expanding his capacity, capability and I think at levels I haven't seen in a long time. So do you want to just fill in the details? Gavin Patterson : Well, anyways, I think you've made the point very well there, Marc. I mean, it was probably the most difficult point in the last 12 months, where everybody else was making cuts, we reshaped the business and created more capacity knowing that the demand would come back, and it takes a few months for new capacity to come online and become productive. But what that decision allowed us to do was enter the year with a really strong market coverage up significantly year on year. And I think it's helped us get off to a really strong start and take advantage of the demand that is undoubtedly there for the Customer 360. Marc Benioff : Well, I'll tell you, I think to add to that, I mean, you look at what Bret has done this year. I mean, Bret really led and executed this amazing reshaping plan. He rebuilt the kind of the company overall, really looking at where are we balancing our resource and also architecting our Slack acquisition. Bret was at the tip of the spear on both of those, making sure that we're prepared for the future with the business plan and the reshaping plan that we needed and the technology plan and the technology vision. Then Amy came in and she said, no, we're going to rebuild the fundamental financial plan as well, and we're going to couple that financial plan from the bottom up and build a new revenue plan and a new cash flow and margin plan. And you see that now. And then we had Gavin come in and say this is how we're going to rebuild the distribution organization. And I think these three tiers all coming together really are what you see today. And when you look at these numbers, when you look at a company that's going to do now over $26 billion in revenue this year, look, there's only been a couple of enterprise software companies in history have done that. You know that. And this is a big moment for us, $26 billion. But you know, because you have your models and you have your spreadsheets and you have your formulas and you see our growth rates, you can start to project out and see where we're going not only this year and next year but as we're projecting out to our $50 billion number, which obviously we're excited about and we're thrilled. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. I will turn the call back over to Evan Goldstein for closing remarks.

If a description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that, let me hand the call to Marc. Marc Benioff : Well, thank you, Evan appreciated. And thanks to everyone for being on the call today. I am actually here in Geneva, Switzerland, with Gavin Patterson, our Chief Revenue Officer, and I'm attending the World Economic Forum's IBC meeting and Board of Trustees meeting.  And it's been a great experience being here in Geneva very much. The world is open for business here. And it's great to be meeting with our customers face-to-face and in-person and discussing our business with them and talking about their businesses and how their businesses are doing in this new normal.  And we're learning quite a bit about how different the U.S. is from Europe right now. And also, how much has really changed, which is quite a bit. So, I'm actually excited to be here, but I'm also extremely excited to share our phenomenal Second Quarter results with you.  You can really see we had a phenomenal Second Quarter or we just had a phenomenal second half, you're about to hear. We're about to have a phenomenal first-half as well. And we're also going to have a good chat about what we're doing with Slack. A very exciting acquisition that's now closed and you are going to hear about number 1, CRM just got better. And it's incredible what's going on with Slack, and looking forward to addressing all that with the -- in the script with you. So, look, we are in a new world, there's no doubt about that. I'm sure that all of us realize that, and we are delivering success from anywhere as well. For Salesforce, we've gone through a tremendous transformation and we're now delivering this new world for our stakeholders.  And from a business perspective, well, I'd say it's been an absolutely extraordinary 18 months for Salesforce, I know for all of you, and certainly, for all the CEOs I met with today. We're navigating this global pandemic. We have been guided by our core values of trust, customer success, of innovation quality, but through all this and through our perseverance and through our, I think dedication to our customers; we've been able to deliver record financial results.  And with these results, we've now can say -- and looking over this, we've now had 5 outstanding quarters in a row. Really delivering the success from any [Indiscernible], pretty awesome.  So, let's take a look now in the second quarter because the numbers are incredible and you can see we delivered our first $6 billion quarter, about 6.3 billion, and continue to maintain our very strong growth rate, our profitability, our cash flow, our margin growth, continuing to execute our new operating margin model. And you can see right now revenue in the growth -- in the quarter, you can see 6.34 billion, up 23% year-over-year, pretty awesome. And above where we thought we were going to be, considerably above. And I guess as excited as I am about the revenue amount, I'm also very excited that as we're executing this new operating margin model, we can see the margin of the quarter.  It was also very healthy, 20.4% up 20 basis points year-over-year. And also delivered 386 million in operating cash flow. For fiscal year '22, we are raising again, our [Indiscernible] to 26.3 billion, which is now at the high end of our range.  It's a raise of 300 million and it's going to represent about 24% projected growth year-over-year, and just really reflects, I think, how well the Company is doing in its core, not just through the Slack acquisition, but you can see organically, especially when you look at the numbers over the last 5 quarters.  And we're raising our operating margin to 18.5% up 80 basis points year-over-year. Again, based on just the outstanding performance of the Company, we are able to do some amazing things here with the operating margin. I don't think Salesforce has really ever been -- had better execution, better management team, greater momentum. And as I have spoken to so many customers today, I don't think we've ever been more well-positioned for them. And I will tell you that in two areas. One is in our core products, our focus on customer success, the Customer 360. Now with the Slack user interface and everything being Slack first.  But also our core values, so many of our customers are attracted to us because in many cases they're going through an amazing values transformation and the areas of -- that we've pioneered, and now especially in regards to sustainability, which we'll talk about, because as you know, Salesforce has been a net-zero Company, but now we're fully renewable as well, and as we start to head towards the Fortune 100, I think that a lot of the companies that we've -- I met with today, were mostly Fortune 100 CEOs. They crave to have that same net-zero and renewable profile, which is very exciting to see the world has this kind of sustainability focused. So, I'm absolutely thrilled to see how the core business grew in the first half of the year. And I am excited about the outlook, I'm excited about our positioning with our customers, and I'll tell you, I'm very excited that 5 out of the last 5 quarters that we've had that 20% or greater revenue growth. And that 3 of the last 5 quarters, we're having greater than 20% operating margin.  I don't think we could have said either of those things 5 quarters ago. So, I have -- my hat is really off to the management team and to the employees for making this happen. And we're raising our guidance for the fourth time in a row as we see increased opportunities for additional revenue growth and additional operating margin capability this year.  And look, we're the fastest-growing enterprise software Company ever, you know that. You're tracking us. You see where the numbers are going. You can see what the trajectory is, the velocity of the Company, both in revenue and margin.  And now you can also see that no other software Company of our size and growth -- size and scale is really performing at this level. So, we are really quite confident and remain on our path to generate 50 billion in revenue by fiscal year '26, which doesn't seem very far away from right now. And when we first gave that number, it didn't seem as -- it seems like it was so far away. Now it seems, wow, this is going to happen. Operator : Excuse me, the line of Mr. Marc has just got disconnected. We're trying to disconnect his line. Thank you. Again, we're trying to reconnect the line for Mr. Marc. Bret Taylor : Well, I think we have a few technical difficulties with Marc there. This is Bret Taylor; I'll continue with the script. Thanks, Marc for that amazing introduction, and just a reflection on the momentum in the Company right now. It really was just an incredible quarter. Our products are more relevant than ever, and I have never seen this kind of momentum in the business.  And honestly, that's because CRM is more strategic now than it's ever been. Every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. And that's why around the world more and more companies are putting their trust in Salesforce to help them get back to growth.  That's the agenda on every CEO's mind in Switzerland and it's on the mind of every Board around the world. IDC just released their April 2021 SaaSPath vendor Radiance, which has surveyed more than 2000 companies worldwide.  And Salesforce is rated number one in trust, number one in the product, number one in industry specialization, and number one in value for the price. That is just amazing. It's a true measure of just how mission-critical we are to our customers. And you can just see it in the incredibly strong performance of all of our Cloud this quarter. Sales Cloud has been number one in its category for more than a decade. And this year, we've reimagined the product to be the growth platform for digital sales teams. We are already seeing the results as Sales Cloud accelerated to 15% growth year-over-year.  Our Service Cloud is also seeing amazing momentum. All aspects of customer service have gone digital from the contact center to field service, to self-service, and [Indiscernible]. The scale of Service Cloud is just incredible. This is a $6 billion business, whose growth has accelerated to 23% year-over-year.  Our marketing and commerce clouds also grew 28% year-over-year as every organization in the world is investing in direct, trusted relationships with their customers. And every one of these digital transformations is also a data transformation, which is driving the unprecedented success we're seeing in Tableau and MuleSoft.  Tableau is within 9 of our top 10 deals this quarter, and MuleSoft is within 8 of our top 10 deals. The real power Salesforce platform is bringing all of these capabilities together into a customer 360, a single source of truth for your customers. Our industry strategy is enabling our customers to get started with an end-to-end Customer 360 faster than ever before, tailored to the specific needs of every industry.  Our industry cloud saw 58% year-over-year growth in annual recurring revenue. We had an especially strong performance in the public sector in our Health Cloud Business and Financial Services. In fact, 4 of our top 10 deals in the second quarter came from the public sector. Our core organic business has never been stronger, just like Marc said.  And now with Slack, we're bringing a whole new dimension to Salesforce. There could not be a more relevant product at a more relevant time for every single one of our customers. If you talk to any CEO, read the headline of any paper, or even look around the home office most of you are sitting in it right now, you can see the depth of the transformation work has gone through this year.  Sales mediums have moved from conference rooms to Slack and to Zoom. Contact centers used to be buildings, and now they exist entirely in the cloud. My commute has moved from the highway to primarily my hallway. Slack is at the center of this. Slack is how organizations all around the worlds are finding success in this all-digital working anywhere world. It's your digital HQ. It connects your employees, your partners, your customers on a single platform, and a platform that people love to use. And the Slack-First Customer 360 makes every Salesforce product more powerful and more effective for our customers. Our engineering teams have really hit the ground running on this integration.  Just last week we announced our Slack-First sales, service, marketing analytics at our launch event, and we've got a ton of Slack innovation coming at Dreamforce. IBM is one of my favorite examples of a Slack first Customer 360 Company. Arvin Christian is a close friend of mine and in talking to him, he talked about how he believes that bringing Salesforce and Slack together is key for IBM to become even more connected, even more, productive and more innovative.  IBM has built their entire Customer 360 on Salesforce. Over 530,000 customers, 380,000 employees, and 50,000 partners using our platform. And all of these employees are working in Slack. They've connected their workflows across Sales Cloud across Service Cloud and enabled them to connect and take action from anywhere. Slack comes up in every single one of my customer conversations. And I could not be more thrilled with momentum in the business. Slack's revenue accelerated to 39% growth year-over-year on a standalone basis. And a great customer win at Target, Lowe's, Conde Nast, UNICEF, Norton Healthcare. And what's really fun about this is looking at the growth of Slack Connect. We've talked a lot about this. Slack Connect is the capability to enable you to connect not just with your fellow employees but to connect with your partners, your vendors, and your customers. Slack Connect grew 200% year-over-year.  This really illustrates the power of not just Slack for employee engagement, but the Slack-First Customer 360. Slack is a once-in-a-generation Company that is transforming the way we work, and it's transforming the vision we have for our Company over the next decade. I am so grateful to be able to work with Stuart and the Slack team every day.  And I'm really excited to bring this vision of this Slack-First Customer 360 to all of our customers. And if the technology gods will allow, I'd love to transfer it over to Gavin to talk about some of our customer's wins for the quarter. Gavin, are you around? Gavin Patterson : Hi, Matt. Hi, Brad. Can you hear me? Bret Taylor : Yes. Amy Weaver : [Indiscernible] Gavin, go ahead. Gavin Patterson : Thanks, Bret. Thanks that we see in the business. And you can see that really reflected in some of the remarkable customer wins, [Indiscernible] not just in the U.S. but around the world in the last quarter.  But starting in the U.S. we saw our largest ever deal [Indiscernible] new annual return revenue, which in the public sector, friends state, the public sector being a fantastic force in the second quarter. Other examples we expanded relationships with great companies like PayPal and Coinbase.  Well, in EMEA, we had significant wins behind. We have [Indiscernible] things like Safelight and [Indiscernible] Freshfields, Dicen, Vodafone, and a cracking business, Canyon bicycles, which is already a great case study. And then APAC, we continue to deepen our relationships with many businesses, including things Afterpay and FWD Thailand.  So, we're seeing strengths internationally, as well as in the U.S. Now a couple of examples I want to go into a little bit more detail on it, and one is a win with You might remember that more as Herman Miller, but it's a fantastic example of a Company pivoting with a great customer experience. So, after the start of the pandemic, Miller Knoll saw a huge spike in demand for their furniture. Well, surprise. Of course, they turned to Salesforce to transform their e-commerce experience in the quarter. And they're already seeing a significant improvement in conversion rates on the back of that. Since then, they've been providing an even better experience, tailored product recommendations, streamlined checkout experience, and next-generation video chat.  And now on top of that [Indiscernible] is a net-zero Company, and they're now using Salesforce's sustainability cloud to track their carbon footprint and other climate-related initiatives. So, you can see it's a great example of how we're building partnerships, building multi-cloud solutions around the Customer 360, and we go from strength to strength.  And I want to look at RBC Wealth Management, which is another great win in the quarter. They're using Customer 360 to streamline processes, integrate data from over 26 different systems to create a unified wealth management platform that provides advisors with a 360-degree view of every client.  And I think that's something that really brings the Customer 360 to life for more than 2100 RBC financial advisors. I think this example to me is very powerful. They've been using Salesforce workflow automation to transform the client on-boarding process, which was several weeks, more than 100 pages of physical documents, and it is now a digital task that takes just 24 minutes.  Then that is quite remarkable, I think. GEICO was a great win in the quarter, needs no introduction, of course. But in case you don't know GEICO, it is the second-largest auto insurer in the U.S. And they're really leaning into the power of the 360 -- the Customer 360 to create a single view of their customers across the heart of the entire business. And is now moving to 25,000 agents are going to be putting that trust in that Customer 360, which is now providing AI-powered analytics to improve those customer relationships. And 3M, now this is one we've talked about in the past. You had Marc talked about they've been using Customer 360 across 83 countries.  And for that relationship continues to expand. Now 3M are using Trailhead to train thousands of customer-facing employees as they join the Company. Salesforce Maps is now being used as part of that proposition. Tableau CRM is giving actual intelligence to better manage operations, engage with customers, boost productivity.  And then in Q2, 3M selected a philanthropy crowd to help empower nearly 100,000 employees to give back to their communities with the goal of achieving 2 million employee volunteer hours over the next 5 years.  I think a really, really powerful example. And then one more, just before I hand it over to Amy, and it's IKEA. So, IKEA, fantastic business over here in Europe. Another great example the Customer 360. We've already been helping them with marketing to be getting a great [Indiscernible] with Marketing Cloud across over 30 markets.  Now, as home improvements were soaring in the pandemic, they turned to us to use field service, to help [Indiscernible] planning visits, installations, after-service support across the U.S. So, another example of how we're building our relationships, adding Clouds to existing customers during increasingly into partnership type relationships. So, I think these are a few examples. There are many more, but they're all, I think examples of how we're helping customers deliver success from wherever they are from anywhere. So, net-net, my conversations with customers, I think it gives me great confidence, not just in the demands for our products and services, but I think in our ability to execute in the second half of the year.  So, it's both demand and execution. So, I continue to see this being maintained during [Indiscernible] really strong demand environment across Salesforce in the second half. And I think Slack is really going to enhance that.  So just before I hand it over to Amy, I'd just like to say a quick thank you to the amazing effort of the sales teams around the world. They've been able to adapt to a different way of work, a new normal. And in doing so, we've been able to continue to support our customers. And I'd like to thank them for that. Amy, over to you. Amy Weaver : Great. Thank you, Gavin. And good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of remarkable top and bottom-line performance. We exceeded our top-line expectations, achieving record levels of Q2 new business. We saw strong demand across all of our product\u2019s regions and customer sizes.  And we were able to execute with discipline to drive higher operating income. We also completed the acquisition of Slack technologies on July 21st, bringing yet another best-in-class asset into our customer 360. We believe that Slack will play a critical role in the digital transformation of our customers, as they re-imagine the future of work in a digital-first work-from-anywhere environment. And that process is already underway with Slack business accelerating into the close of the acquisition. In Q2, the last revenue grew 39% year-over-year on a standalone basis, which excludes any impact of purchase accounting. Slack also saw strong performance and customer acquisition, especially in the enterprise.  The number of paid customers spending greater than $100 thousand annually accelerated during the quarter, up 41%. For the short period between the closing and the deal and the end of our fiscal Q2, Slack's operating results were immaterial to our non-GAAP results, and they are included below the line in OIE. Slack is consequently excluded from our reported revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Where appropriate, we will call out Slack-specific impact on our Q2 results and our guidance. As part of the acquisition, this quarter, we issued $8 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.25% and weighted average maturity of 20 years.  We were very pleased by the terms we received on what we view as an inexpensive source of capital. In particular, I'd like to call attention to the strong reception of our $1 billion sustainability bond, which was our most oversubscribed note in the offering. And not only did we raise funds on favorable terms, the concurrent with our debt raise, S&P, upgraded our credit rating to A+.  Now, let me walk you through some of the results for Q2 fiscal '22, starting with top-line commentary. Total revenue for the second quarter was 6.34 billion, up 23% year-over-year, or 21% in constant currency. The strong new business pipeline that we've discussed the last few quarters, enabled us to deliver these results as new business momentum continued to exceed our expectations.  Achieved key highlights. We saw an acceleration in Sales Cloud with Q2 revenue of 1.5 billion or 15% year-over-year growth. Tableau and MuleSoft continued their momentum in enterprise deals, as both saw their share of the Company's top 10 deals increase. As Bret noted, Tableau was in 9 of the top 10, and MuleSoft in 8 of the top 10 deals this quarter.  This is an incredible accomplishment, and evidence of how strategic these acquisitions have become for our customers. The public sector continues to be an area of strength, accounting for 4 of the top 10 deals this quarter. And again, this quarter, our seven-figure deals on average, included more than 4.5 clouds.  The number of seven-figure deals, including 5 or more clouds, grew by 29% year-over-year, showing continued momentum in our enterprise deals. And we continue to see strength in our international businesses, which accelerated sequentially. Although we will note that EMEA and APAC growth benefited modestly from the integration of acquisitions into our billing practices.  We remain pleased with the progress on attrition, with revenue attrition in Q2 between 8 and 8.5 8%. An improvement from last quarter's 9 to 9.5%. Attrition has continued to perform better than anticipated. As a reminder, our attrition rate is calculated based on trailing 12 months' performance.  And we have now lapped the second quarter of Fiscal 21, which was impacted by the early days of the pandemic. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q2 at approximately $36.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year. The current remaining performance obligation or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under a contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18.7 billion, up 23% both year-over-year and in constant currency. Slack represents 4 points of growth ahead of the 3 points we got into last quarter due primarily to changes in our assumptions around purchase accounting.  Turning to operate margin. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 20.4%, benefiting from revenue outperformance, efficiencies from work from anywhere in the world, and a focus on disciplined spending. Salesforce recorded $45 million of transaction-related costs due to closing the Slack acquisition during the quarter. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.56 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.48. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue and expense efficiencies, as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment\u2019s portfolio.  These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.42 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.43. Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was 386 million, down 10% year-over-year. On a cash basis, Salesforce paid 43 million in transaction fees related to the Slack acquisition.  CapEx for the quarter was $213 million, leading to a free cash flow of $173 million, down 45% year-over-year. And as a reminder, we continue to expect cash flow seasonality to skew higher in Q1 and Q4. Slack's operating results had no impact on Q2 operating cash flow or CapEx. Now, turning to guidance. We expect Q3 revenue of 6.78 to $6.79 billion, or approximately 25% growth year-over-year.  This guidance assumes a $250 million contribution from Slack. For Q3, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 22%. This includes 4 points of growth from Slack. We expect Q3 GAAP, EPS of negative 0.06 to negative $0.05, and non-GAAP EPS of 0.91 to $0.92. Now, moving to fiscal 22 guidance updates.  As a result of our year-to-date performance and strong execution in the current demand environment, we are raising our fiscal 22 revenue guidance by $300 million to $26.2 billion to $26.3 billion, or approximately 24% growth year-over-year. This guidance incorporates an expected revenue contribution of $530 million from Slack in the second half of fiscal 22, an increase of $30 million over our previous guide.  This guidance also includes $200 million from Acumen, an increase of $10 million from our previous guide. Net of the revised Slack and Acumen contributions, this represents a $260 million raise on our core business. Our ability to execute and the demand environment both remain strong.  We are also raising our fiscal 22 non-GAAP operating margins to 18.5%, representing an expansion of 80 basis points year-over-year. This now includes an expected 150 basis point headwind from Slack and Acumen, or 10 basis points less headwind compared to our previous guidance.  Excluding this 10-basis point adjustment, our operating margin guidance represents a 40-basis point rise compared to our previous guidance. We're also raising fiscal '22 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.81 to $0.83, and raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS to $4.36 to $4.38. We expect recent M&A will be approximately $0.51 headwinds to non-GAAP diluted EPS.  Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. We are raising our fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 2 points.  Now expecting 14% to 15% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide is primarily driven by revenue performance and lower headwinds from M&A. The diluted cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 7 points.  Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, operating cash flow growth would be 21% to 22%. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal 22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 15% to 16% for the fiscal year, excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, as previously noted, this rate would be 22% to 23%.  To close, we remain excited by the strengths we see in the demand environment and we're seeing record levels of revenue and operating margin. Our flagship products in Sales Cloud saw acceleration this quarter. We closed our largest deal in customer history.  We had an impressive first half of fiscal 22, and we're excited to continue Slack's momentum with the power of our two companies now together. And the increased revenue guidance reflects the confidence we have in the fundamentals of our business, and we remain well on our way to achieving our goal of 50 billion in fiscal 26. We are committed to being disciplined along the way while challenging ourselves to find additional areas of operational improvement.  I want to say thank you to all of our employees for being able to focus on disciplined, efficient growth during the quarter, and we're looking forward to further strengthening the durability of our operating model going forward. And finally, I look forward to engaging with many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on September 23. Now I'll turn the call back to Marc for some final comments. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks, Amy. Hopefully, I'm back here. Amy Weaver : You are. Marc Benioff : And I'm actually now talking through Amy's cellphone connected to our speakerphone at our conference in San Francisco. So, turns out the cell phone technology is a big winner so anyway, thanks, Amy.  That was a great job on earnings and congratulations on another great quarter of your organization, everything you're doing. I couldn't be more excited about the strength of our core business, our revenue growth, our margin growth, our cash flow growth, as well as the addition of Slack.  Now to our team of unicorns, if you will, it's absolutely true the best CRM just got better with Slack and I -- if you listen to what Bret has to say about the integration of incredible things like Slack Connect, these are becoming extensions to our CRM capabilities, so it\u2019s a very exciting moment for our entire product line and our technology team. And I think, with that our leadership team has really shown through this amazing perseverance and execution over the last several quarters these amazing results. Now we're going to have our digital Dreamforce coming out from San Francisco in less than a month, from September 21 through September 23rd. We'll have tens of millions of customers from all over the world tuning in with us, and we'll have hundreds of customers with us live in San Francisco as well.  So, it's going to be extremely exciting. We want you to all have a front-row seat, and please talk to Evan so you're all connected to this program. And we will also be redeploying our Dreamforce 2 U program as well, delivering custom Dreamforce capability for all of our customers. So, I hope that you're all going to join us. Okay.  So as Amy mentioned, we're also looking forward to having you then at Investor Day, that will also be amazing. And we're expecting some awesome conversations with all of you. So that, I'll open it up to questions. So, everybody is online right now and we can take all your questions. So go ahead, Evan. Evan Goldstein : Operator, you go ahead and open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. The first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much. Bret, maybe I wanted to ask you one about Slack in particular. Now that the deal is closed, and I know you're very excited about the whole team is, what are you measuring to judge success with Slack, maybe beyond just revenue growth in terms of a number of customers that -- the number of multi-cloud deals that include Slack, I guess, what should we be looking for to see that the deal is progressing as planned and it is that sort of 1 plus 1 equal 7 combinations that you guys are betting on? Bret Taylor : Thanks, Kirk. I think, first and foremost, we're excited about this vision for the Slack-First Customer 360, and that's really building not only an integrated division between Slack and our Customer 360 platform but also integrating our products.  And actually, I think we've made a faster start integrating our technologies than any acquisition in our history. We did an event last week on this idea of a digital HQ, where we announced Slack-First sales, things like deal rooms inside of Slack Connect integrated with Sales Cloud, Slack-First Service, which are things like Case Swarming for digital customer service teams.  Slack-First marketing Slack-First analytics. So those capabilities are going to be in the hands of our customers soon and we have a lot more innovation coming at Dreamforce as well. And with that [Indiscernible] what we're measuring it's, as you said, it's going to show up in things like multi-cloud deals that include Slack.  It's also going to show up in a lot more departments, at a lot more companies who are perhaps using these new digital collaboration technologies for the first time. In the context of doing their job, in the context of customer service, in the context of sales, in the context of marketing, and really realizing this vision of the digital HQ. I think Marc has talked a lot about how we're in this new pandemic world, that this isn't going away.  We've opened half of our offices. But as you can imagine, not as many people are signing up as we had hoped to at this point because of this pandemic. I've started two companies and it all started by planning my office space. And now if you're starting a Company, you start by planning your digital HQ. And that's really what we want to bring to every Company in the world.  Help them build the digital infrastructure, help them succeed in this new normal. And one thing that I think we're really excited about that Marc also mentioned is Slack Connect, which is really bringing these digital tools outside of the walls of our customer's buildings and bringing them to partners and customers as well. And you're seeing that in a lot of the product integrations we announced. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Mark Murphy : Yes. Thank you very much. Congrats on a fantastic quarter. Gavin, we have heard that you're selling Slack by actually using it with customers in the selling process itself. Was wondering if you could help us visualize that. And is that something that's transforming the buying experience in a pretty profound way? And then -- just a quick one for Amy. It's fantastic to see the operating margins, 20% plus again, consecutive quarters. Where are you identifying new efficiencies to try to create this trajectory on margins? Because it seems like it goes beyond the temporary COVID savings. Gavin Patterson : Well, great question and I just like [Indiscernible] I share Bret and Amy's excitement about the potential that Slack is going to bring to Customer 360. Since we announced the deal 6 months ago, 9 months ago. Obviously, we've been having conversations with customers about what we're planning to do. Recognize the meeting to go to the DOJ furnaces. And I have to say, [Indiscernible] come across the product that has the crowds, the excitement, the customer advocacy that Slack does. It really is quite remarkable. So, there's I think huge interest out there amongst customers.  Many of our customers are both Salesforce customers and now Slack customers. There's good overlap between the two and they can see that -- they can see the synergy that we're going to have from a product perspective. We are beginning to sell through Slack. The most powerful presentations sales teams give are often Salesforce on Salesforce. And so Slack on Slack is a very compelling way to explain how we use the product, and so we're beginning to see more and more of that.  And where we are closing deals, we're leaning in to close deals through, you closing the deal itself, on Slack creating channels between us and the customer, and ensuring that everybody who's working on the deal can have real-time access to those channels, and it is leading it -- it means that deals close much more quickly. So, in fact, the Slack deal itself was closed on Slack. So that is the perfect example of Slack on Slack, I think. Amy? Amy Weaver : Great, thanks, Gavin. And you're right, we use Slack to negotiate to do -- we conducted our due diligence, our negotiation, and integration for Slack. So, I do think that that's the ultimate example of a terrific sale, all conducted with Slack and Slack Connect. Marc, turning to your other question about operating margin, where we've really seen this growth this year. First, we are getting the benefit of very strong business performance in Q1 and Q2.  And that does it while it's brewing to provide profitability and that's while still investing in growth and absorbing the impact of M&A. Second, we are continuing to build on what we learned during the pandemic, about how we can work effectively in a digital-first to a hybrid environment.  Some examples of that, virtual go-to-market motions, sales enablement, which is largely virtual at this [Indiscernible] were digital. And also, a renewed emphasis on financial automation, which I believe will pay off in the long run. And then finally, it's simply an approach of disciplined decision-making. And when we're seeing those investment opportunities, we're taking a very hard look. We are challenging ourselves and we're finding ways to shift our operating model where necessary. Operator : Thank you. We have the next question that comes from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Brad Sills : Great. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a real nice Q2 result here. I wanted to ask another one on Slack, but more focused on Slack plus Tableau. With the combined offerings, you really have a powerful solution to not only see the data but act on the data. You highlighted this last week at the marketing event where you launched a number of these scenarios and activated notifications and watch lists were included. I'm just curious about that concept of Slack plus Tableau combined. What are you hearing from customers and the reception there, and could that actually accelerate these cross-cloud Customer 360 deals? Thank you. Bret Taylor : Yeah, thanks for the question. We're really excited about the combination of Slack and Tableau. And it sounds like you watch the event, but for other folks on the call who didn't, we showed, I think, a really wonderful integration between Tableau and Slack. So, your data can talk to you. Automated notifications so that when you need to take action on data, you're getting notified in Slack, you can collaborate with their colleagues to diagnose a business issue. Just an incredible combination.  But I think it really shows just our philosophy on our M&A and why I think we've had really unprecedented success in the marketplace and integrating our acquisition successfully. We really tried to integrate our platform, and with Tableau, with MuleSoft, with Slack, this all amplifies our vision for Customer 360.  I mean at the center of all these digital transformations our customers are going through his data. You need to integrate that data with MuleSoft. You need to see an understanding with Tableau and you need to act on that. And that's all going to happen with Slack, which is the system of engagement for the Customer 360, but also the system of engagement for every application at your Company.  So, I think it's an incredibly powerful combination and I actually think Slack has the potential to really accelerate every single product in the Customer 360 Tableau included and Tableau especially, but really, I think it has potential across the board.  And then, it really goes to just this fundamental shift in the workplace we're all experiencing. All of you are probably working from home right now, or most of you are. This digital HQ is at the center of every single one of the transformations we're bringing to our customers. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Kash Rangan : Kash Rangan. Congratulations. My question is for Amy and maybe a little bit from Gavin. Amy, how are you able to fund growth initiatives at the same time drive operating efficiencies, and Gavin maybe you could shed some color on that as it pertains to the distribution side of the equation. How are you able to accomplish growth and efficiencies in terms of margin? Thank you so much and congratulations on a fantastic quarter. Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks, Kash. On the operating margin, as I said, I think we have to be able to drive growth and increasing profitability at the same time. As I mentioned, we've been doing that this year through terrific business performance, through efficiencies, through the work from anywhere, and as well as through discipline. And Marc talked about the new operating model. I actually like to think of it more as a new operating mindset.  And it's a real focus on discipline, and looking at what is going to make us a Company that not just only gets us at 50 billion, but makes us a strong, durable Company when we get there and positions us to sales through that. So, these are multiple changes around the Company, but I've been really gratified to see everyone jumping in. This has been really an effort from the entire executive leadership team. Gavin Patterson : The second question Kash. So, we've just come off our half-year review in Laulima, in Hawaii where we got our top 100 executives together in person, and reviewed the last 6 months and looked ahead into the future, and I was really happy and I was able to share two fantastic quarters to start the year.  And really strong demand, and really strong execution, and as I look into the second half of the year and I see that continuing, the pipeline's really strong, the conversations we're having with costumers are accelerating if anything. And so, we chose to make a decision 3 months ago because we could see this demand in the marketplace, we chose to increase our investments in a direct sales course, to get better coverage, with customers.  And that is the sound of our confidence in the business. So, I feel very confident that we can continue to grow top-line while delivering on expectations around an operating margin. It is a trade-off. I think that the balance that we can get between the 2 is making sure we seize the opportunities in the marketplace.  We're able to serve that demand. We can see from customers, there are multi-cloud deals that I was talking about earlier. While at the same time ensuring that we benefit from [Indiscernible] and we see that in the operating margin. Marc Benioff : And could you also add, what do you see on the selling motion versus the U.S versus hear in Europe? Gavin Patterson : Well, I think what's common, Marc, is there is -- this is a conversation that's happening with the CEO now. So digital customer transformation is no longer something that is going to get to down the organization. It's a conversation that's going on in the boardroom, CEO priority.  And that means we're getting, I think bigger deals, more multi-track deals, multi-year deals, and it's increasing the conversation about the Customer 360. The real focus is on time-to-value, which is good for us. We want as much -- we want our customers to be on a standard product as much as possible. Configuring, yes.  Customizing, not so much, because there's so much innovation coming through, and it's easier to do through staying on the standard path. So, it's -- be it in the U.S. or in Europe, we're seeing our business grow across the board both in terms of small customers on our end [Indiscernible] all the way up to multinationals. We're seeing increasingly bigger deals.  And we highlighted our [Indiscernible] in terms of recurring revenue in this quarter. In the public [Indiscernible] to do, but we're seeing more and more, not just million dollars plus deals, but $10 million deals coming through the business. And that's a sign of, I think the increase in [Indiscernible] the Salesforce offers what it needs to businesses. Operator : From the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent [Indiscernible] question and really nice quarter and really a nice first half of the year. And Amy, I don't recall seeing this type of [Indiscernible] in terms of top-line revenues [Indiscernible] definitely not this type of raise to the operating margin guide, especially in the first half of the year. Marc, you could talk too, what're you guys seeing in the pipeline that's giving you the confidence to increase guidance in the first half of the year.  [Indiscernible] For the second half of the year already. And maybe to Amy. When we see this operating margin expansion, is this durable, if you will, on a go-forward basis? And then pick reflation of that OpEx line because of Delta variant or in future years or is this margin expansion going to be more durable? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Let me take a swing at that. They're having the -- let me -- Number one, because of the Greenland deal that's happening here in Europe, and they realize that for them to continue to be successful in this environment and this economy, they're having to make a net 0 transformation and that's been very important to us.  We've merry made that transformation and now we're fully renewable as well as I mentioned. The second thing is, I think every CEO that I mentioned and talked to today and yesterday and probably in conversations that I've had in the last several months, I'm sure you're hearing that in your own sha -- with your [Indiscernible], but that's been very surprising to me. And I would say that's the second CEO priority.  And then I'd say that the third CEO priority is exactly what we've been talking about it here, which is size their employee is not coming back exactly as they wanted. I have some stories about when we first started talking about success from anywhere and those employees would have a choice between office, home, maybe working in an environment like we had last week in Hawaii with our leadman program.  Or as you know, we're building this new ranch. CEOs would call me and say, Marc, you don't understand, and I think now those calls have stopped, and people realize things have really changed. This pandemic has changed things, and work has changed, and when we talk about digital HQ, we might've been talking about a digital HQ before the pandemic, but after the pandemic, it means something very different.  And I think that what Bret said kind of on the fly there, which was very powerful, that he's obviously been an incredible entrepreneur as well as an operating executive in several companies, but because he was starting a new Company, he's not planning his physical office space, he's planning his digital office space. And we're running this call now on a cellphone and on Zoom. And it's very much an example of success from anywhere. But every Company estimates this transformation. And that is what is driving our success going forward. This is not -- that the world has changed. But the past has gone. That we are in a new world. And yet we made, I don't think the Delta variant will be material to our business. If anything [Indiscernible] one of these things that we're going to see, we see [Indiscernible] seeing a constant now a parade of these variants going by. So, we know that in fact here in Europe if you haven't [Indiscernible] you probably should.  We're looking to [Indiscernible] life has to go on, and it is, and if you were here with me today, you'd say, well, there's probably some risk to what's going on. There probably is. But I'm vaccinated. Gavin is vaccinated. And we were running our business going on and I think that this is what we all have to kind of get our head around. And I think consumers how it is right here in Geneva, Switzerland, let me tell you. It's very, very different.  Today, my -- there's nobody at my office building right now, and also people are not wearing masks and all in-office buildings here. Everybody is supposed to wear a mask legally in San Francisco right now. So, this is what is amplifying us. So, we're in a tremendous [Indiscernible] never been more positioned [Indiscernible] or well, I would say Salesforce has never been better positioned for an economy and for a world. The first thing that I'd heard from [Indiscernible] business and this is where we're [Indiscernible] Gavin Patterson : I want to talk a little bit about the pipe and margin of confidence [Indiscernible] excellence if you like it and grip on the operating metrics around the pipe going forward. I have great confidence in what I can see. We spent a lot of time in those organizations contributing through participation and through enablement, through productivity, and really driving performance across each of the OUs. We've flattened the structure so that we can move in a more agile manner and give more accountability to operating [Indiscernible] focus on -- in a [Indiscernible] metrics around the sales operation.  That means that I can have confidence as I look forward to what we're going to deliver over the next fiscal as well. I think it's about the spike. So, the strength across the board [Indiscernible] the numbers that we've released today [Indiscernible] I see that going forwards, all Clouds are contributing. There isn't any weakness across. Marc Benioff : That's amazing, isn't it? Gavin Patterson : Yes. Marc Benioff : And I think it also speaks to what Bret said as well in terms of -- we've had a real focus with our acquisitions to make sure they are integrated, that we're selling a platform. We don't use the word suite that sells hard to say it hasn't been part of our nomenclature. But we have a very nice, integrated platform and we have a [Indiscernible] world. It's kind of amazing, isn't it? Gavin Patterson : Geographically, just to finish with, the gains trends across the board. You know the U.S. consistently growing 20% plus in revenue. A mere 32% this quarter. APAC 26%. So, we're growing across the board and growth internationally is not coming at expense of growth in the U.S. and that's why we're posting these really strong numbers. And that strength... cool cloud is something that we've really -- Marc Benioff : And you've been able to -- and I think you even hit this point Bret did as well, but this new operating margin model that we're executing, I think several of the -- several of our friends who have been asking questions [Indiscernible] I picked up that we are operating at a different type of model here.  We've had now 3 out of the last 5 quarters greater than 20%, and we have a lot of swaggers when it comes to our operating margin. The pandemic let us re -- kind of have a beginner's mind in regards to our entire business.  And we made decisions, but we also made decisions that are the core way that we're operating our business, and you can see that with these operating margin results. And also, I'm sure it was subtle to everybody, but after doing one of the biggest acquisitions in our history, we also just raised our operating margin again. Very exciting. Amy, do you want to just add to that? Amy Weaver : Yeah, sure. Keith, to follow up the end of your question, [Indiscernible] and you said very powerfully [Indiscernible] this is a new world. We are not going back to the pre-pandemic way of working and we learned a lot during this period.  We learned how we can work effectively from anywhere, how we can sell virtually. And when you look at what is durable, I would say discipline is durable, and we need to [Indiscernible] forward, and just show you quarter-after-quarter that we can execute. Marc Benioff : [Indiscernible] Switched to several very powerful values, operating value. Since the pandemic started, the management team understands very well Salesforce, but we wanted to make sure that we're relevant to our customers, and that they understood our relevance. I don't think we've ever been more relevant. We also realized we had a lot of people who are really scared during the pandemic and we need to get down, to be confident, and that they could participate.  And I think that's definitely an asset. We need to make sure that we were able to execute tactically and strategically and to fully enable what you can see as an extremely large workforce heading towards to make sure those people are enabled and rolling and focused. And we've done that. I think in all of those things that the management team has executed.  I'm very grateful to the management team and how well they've done. We've also gone through a lot of management transformations. I'm sitting here looking also at Mark Pockets (ph.), who is our CFO in [Indiscernible] test. So, Mark, thank you for everything you've done for the Company as well. And he is on the call here helping us and coaching us through.  And Evan and -- you need to know that I look out at all over Ohana and all of our employees for everything that everyone has been through. We have a lot of these amazing moments. And this is not our last amazing moment. There are some more amazing moments coming. I'm very excited about the future. So, with that, I will turn it back over to you Evan. Evan Goldstein : Thank you very much. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. [Indiscernible] With some technical [Indiscernible]. But thank you guys for joining the call today. If you have any questions, you can contact us on investor [Indiscernible] And we look forward to Dreamforce and Investor Day. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Now this year, I'm grateful for many things. But I'll have to tell you, I'm very grateful for my good friends who I'm sitting here with, Bret Taylor. And Bret, congratulations on becoming the co-CEO of Salesforce. Bret Taylor : Thank you, Marc. It's really an honor of a lifetime. Thank you and thanks to the Board. And most importantly, thank you to our customers and Trailblazers. I'm honored to be a part of you in this next chapter of Salesforce. Marc Benioff : Well, Bret, when I first met you, you were at Google. You did an amazing job with Google Maps. And you started your own company, then it was acquired by Facebook. You became the CTO of Facebook. And then you let Facebook and started another company. And Salesforce was very lucky to buy that company quick. And then you've had an amazing run here over the last 5, 5.5 years at Salesforce and most recently as our Chief Operating Officer and now as Co-CEO. We couldn't be more grateful for you and your leadership, and congratulations, and it's just amazing to watch you grow. Bret Taylor : Well, Marc, I don't know if you know this, you were the first person I called when I started that second company because I wanted your mentorship and advice. So for me, this partnership is really the culmination of a decade-long friendship. And I'm just grateful and excited for this next chapter. Marc Benioff : Well, it's super exciting. And I'll tell you, we're going to get into this, Bret. But you've had a lot of great experiences with customers this quarter and also with all of our Ohana. And just give us one insight out of the quarter. Tell us about the world? And what's one thing you learned this quarter that really has surprised you or enlightened that you can share with all of us? Bret Taylor : Well, actually Gavin Patterson and I, we took a trip to Europe together. We flew to London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt. And there's -- the pandemic's a roller coaster. But what I heard from the more than 60 customers we talked to on that trip is a sense of really moving forward, that we'll have to take into account health and safety. We have to really think about this pandemic as an endemic. But in part, settling down, people are moving forward. They're focused on growth, and they're focused on this new normal. And I have a very optimistic view of the future despite this roller coaster of a pandemic. Marc Benioff : It is a rollercoaster of a pandemic. You're absolutely right. Well, it's been an amazing 6 quarters. And I'll tell you, the last 6 quarters, well, that's -- they have been unlike anything Salesforce has ever been through, that I've ever been through. And we -- I would say this is -- things are still changing and transforming. We're almost in a pandemic age, and we're kind of getting used to what it means to be inside of a pandemic. And yet at the same time, Salesforce has never been more successful. And I think Bret, when you look at the financial results, I'm sure you'd agree, this was an amazing third quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $6.86 billion, up 27% year-over-year. And it's really driven by all these amazing products, but really by this incredible customer success. And we can see it where we're #1 again for the eighth year in a row in CRM according to IDC. It's really exciting. Were you surprised to see that? Bret Taylor : Not surprised at all, but it's something I look forward to every year every time those numbers come out. Marc Benioff : Wasn't it awesome? And our sales and service clouds, well, they've become massive individual businesses at this point and generating more than $6 billion each. I mean that's bigger than a lot of cloud companies that I know by themselves and they're continuing to grow in the double-digits. It's amazing. I mean Sales Cloud is amazing this quarter. And operating margin in the quarter was also very good at 19.8%, and that exceeded my expectations. And we delivered $404 million in operating cash flow, up 19% year-over-year. And now for fiscal year '22, we're raising our revenue guide again. Just raised it at Investor Day a couple of weeks ago and now we're raising it again to $26.4 billion, at the high end of the range, representing 24% projected growth year-over-year. That's a $100 million raise since Q2 when we initiated guidance for revenue in December of last year. We've now raised guidance, since that initiation, $850 million, pretty awesome. And we're delighted to raise our full year operating margin once again to 18.6%. We have obviously a new team. We have a new structure now. We're in a new world. We're talking about that. But we have an incredible new model, and it's really reflected in this incredible operating margin performance really for this year and also the operating margin guide for next year as well. And this is really an incredible reflection of this new way that we have, the new way we're thinking and how we're driving a leading Salesforce.  And as we shared at our Investor Day in September, we're expecting fiscal year '23 revenue guidance of $31.8 billion, that's the high end of our range, and operating margin of 20%. Now as everyone knows, no other software company of our size and scale is really performing at this level, we know that because we're talking to other cloud CEOs every day. And I'll tell you, I couldn't be more proud of our Ohana. And then Salesforce is soon going to enter the Fortune 100. We -- really if you think about it, we only spent 2 years to the $20 billion. To think about how long I was waiting to get into the $20 billion in revenue for Salesforce, and we're done with it. It's kind of like now we're talking about being in the $30 billion. And I am kind of like, I wonder, wow, this is amazing. How long are we going to end up in the $30 billion? So you got to enjoy every moment because it goes fast. And you look at the growth, and I really think it's all about this customer success. It's been awesome. I know we're going to tell some great stories here on the call, LVMH and VMware and ADT and so many of our customers. And we're hearing some great stories from Slack customers too. I'm looking forward to Bret telling you a couple of great stories. I even had a great story yesterday from a friend of mine who was at a check-in counter for an airline. And they were using Slack entirely to make the reservation and book the tickets. It's an incredible story with this company. So well, I guess all of this is just an overnight success story for Salesforce, doing it now almost a quarter of a century, and it's been a great quarter. All right. Well, Bret, congratulations. And why don't you take it from here? Bret Taylor : Thank you, Marc. As Marc said, we had another phenomenal quarter driven by our new operating model, our new management team, and a product portfolio that's just increasingly relevant to every company looking to thrive in this new world. Through this pandemic, our customer success has fueled our success. We have hired more than 30,000 people remotely. We've launched more products than we ever have before. And we've connected with more customers than we ever have before. We've also proven that we can come together safely in person. We just did Dreamforce in San Francisco a couple of months ago. We're doing Dreamforce in New York. Marc Benioff : That's amazing, right? Bret Taylor : It's amazing. Marc Benioff : Might as well have another Dreamforce next week. Why not? Bret Taylor : All year long, Marc. And we also have opened 65 of our offices. And as I mentioned, Gavin and I took that trip to Europe, talked to over 60 customers. And really interesting to see a wide range of industries going through different issues, whether it's the supply chain or the Great Resignation. But there's one theme in all those conversations. Every customer reinforced that work is not somewhere you go, but something you do. Every single company I spoke with is building their digital headquarters because they know their teams need to be successful from their home or from this office in this new era of hybrid work. And Customer 360 and Slack are powering this transformation for companies in every industry in every region of the world, and you can really see it in our results. In the quarter, we saw strong growth across regions : 23% in the Americas, 38% in EMEA, and 26% in APAC. And what really stands out to me, Marc, is the strength of our core organic CRM business. Marc Benioff : Sales Cloud, that is amazing, right, especially sales and service cloud together. Bret Taylor : Well, Sales Cloud is accelerating to 17% year-over-year growth, as Marc mentioned, now exceeding a $6 billion business just like Service Cloud. And Service Cloud, which is actually continuing to grow above 20% year-over-year. Marc Benioff : Yes, that's just awesome. Congratulations. That was just beyond my expectation. Bret Taylor : Yes, it really shows the strength in our core organic business, and it's just phenomenal to see this kind of growth at that kind of scale. And there's nothing like the start of the holiday shopping season. We started last week, to make me appreciate just how mission-critical our commerce and marketing clouds are on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Cyber Week runs on Salesforce for the world's greatest retailers. What we saw was just incredible. So Commerce Cloud processed more than 100 million orders in November powering the shopping experiences for brands like Ralph Lauren, Puma, Crocs, LVMH. And get this, Marc, this year we have sent over 1 trillion messages from our Marketing Cloud. And in Cyber Week alone, we delivered 40 billion messages, up 34% year-over-year. Marc Benioff : Incredible. Bret Taylor : And we were lapping the pandemic. Last year digital was the only way people were shopping, and we're growing 34% on top of that. Our message platform... Marc Benioff : Also, you have to give a call out here in reliability. Because both of us went through some very difficult moments in the weekend, getting calls from customers who are not using our Marketing Cloud but are good customers of ours. Because products that they chose from other vendors were not working on Black Friday and Cyber Monday and we're like, wow, we were just so grateful to all of our Ohana for the tremendous, tremendous performance they delivered over the weekend. Bret Taylor : Well, I just want to give a special thank you to every member of Salesforce, particularly the engineering team to get that kind of reliability when so much of our customers' business is happening over a day or a weekend, it's just crucial that these systems stay up. And I'm so proud of the team. And hopefully, some of those customers will become customers of Marketing Cloud next year. Marc Benioff : I hope so. I hope so. Bret Taylor : And one thing I really want to comment is this move towards mobile commerce continued. Mobile push notifications sent for our Marketing Cloud grew over 94% year-over-year. Now we're just seeing the smartphone continue to transform commerce. All in, our Commerce and Marketing Clouds grew 25% year-over-year in our third quarter, continuing an amazing 20-month run as the global economy continues to digitize. I also want to talk about Slack. So Slack outperformed our expectations in the first full quarter as a part of the Salesforce family. The number of customers on Slack who spent over $100,000 was up 44% year-over-year. And adoption of Slack Connect was up an astonishing 176% year-over-year. Slack is not just a product, Slack is a network, and it's just incredible to see that growth. Slack also continues to innovate at an unbelievable pace. Slack Huddles, which is Slack's new real-time audio capability, is already used weekly by over 1/3 of Slack users. And Slack Clips, the new asynchronous video capability, are being played nearly 1 million times a week. And this month at Slack Frontiers, which I hope all of you have watched; and if you haven't, you can watch it online. Stewart and the team are now the next generation of Slack\u2019s platform, and it's going to truly transform the way companies think about workflows and automation. Marc Benioff : Well, I think that, that is definitely what I saw firsthand where I was like, how could it be that an airline is basically front-ending their entire system with Slack? That's a shock to me. Bret Taylor : Slack is the system of engagement for every workflow, every application, every person on your enterprise. It's really an amazing platform vision. And absolutely watch Slack Frontiers. If you haven't seen it, I think it will blow your mind. Marc Benioff : Well, it's pretty cool. What an incredible new part of our portfolio. Bret Taylor : Well Slack has already transformed the way we work at Salesforce. Since we have deployed Slack internally, we sent 46% fewer e-mails. And in the last 30 days alone, our employees have sent nearly 60 million Slack messages and conducted 500,000 Slack Huddles. We run Salesforce on Slack. And every CEO and every Board I talk to is focused on how they can succeed in this era of flexible work. According to Slack's research, 93% of workers are looking for flexibility when they work, and 76% are looking for flexibility where they work. Companies need to connect their employees, their partners, their customers from anywhere because we all know we're not going to be in the office 5 days a week. Marc Benioff : Right. It really flies in the face of all of these kind of -- you hear companies like a CEO say, \"Oh, everyone has to come back in the office now. This is a mandate.\" Bret Taylor : Marc, you know what happens when they say that? Their employees leave and go to the company next door. Marc Benioff : Well, I have to be very careful because when I say like on a broadcast television or at a conference, \"Hey, employees are going to have flexibility in how they work. And they're going to have a digital headquarters. They're going to have physical headquarters. They're going to mix and match. They're going to move around a little bit,\" I get phone calls. And it's just so contrary to what we see in our own business. Bret Taylor : Well, our offices aren't going away. It's just that your digital headquarters is going to be more important because it's truly the infrastructure that connects all of it, and especially in this new normal. And Slack and Customer 360 together are really powering this transformation. You can see in the results of the third quarter for Slack. Slack hit $280 million of revenue, $30 million ahead of guidance. Retailers like Saks and innovative companies like the Southeast Asian ridesharing and food delivery app, Grab, they're relying on Slack every day to collaborate to automate workflows and to connect with their partners. And what's exciting to me, Marc, is the deep product innovations we're building between Slack and Customer 360 while already driving success for our customers. I had a great time working with VMware's new CEO, Raghu Raghuram, this quarter. And he's spun VMware out of Dell. And Raghu's team is already using Slack and Service Cloud for case forming to decrease the time to resolution for their customers. I could not be more excited for the momentum we see in the Slack business and in particular, Slack's integration in the Salesforce. As Marc said, we're in a new world. We have a new operating model that's driving durable growth. And our team continues to deliver incredible success for our customers during these unprecedented times. Our core business is stronger than ever and is experiencing incredible growth at scale. Slack and Customer 360 have never been more relevant, and we're playing a pivotal role in supporting our customers' next phase of growth. And I'm excited to hand it over to Gavin to bring this to life and talk about what he's seeing with our customers around the globe. Gavin? Gavin Patterson : Thanks, Bret, and I'd like to add my congratulations on your promotion. Bret Taylor : Thank you, Gavin. Gavin Patterson : So as Marc and Bret said, we are in a new world. And I've seen it through the eyes of our customers, which I've recently been visiting in New York, San Francisco, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich, Middle East and of course, London. I am very excited by the early results of how our new operating model is playing out. The strength of our core business is incredible. And the power of Salesforce Customer 360 and Slack together is creating the Digital HQ that is enabling our customers to get back to growth. And as Bret said, Salesforce has never been more relevant. In the quarter, we saw strong growth in every region, especially in the Americas. We grew relationships with Amazon, Builders FirstSource, IQVIA, Sunbelt Rentals, Tapestry and so many more. In EMEA, we deepened relationships with incredible brands like Fennia, Primark and Puma. And in APAC, we had significant wins with FOXTEL, Fujitsu, Hitachi and the New Zealand Ministry of Health. Now we all know the incredible security company, ADT. They're using Salesforce Customer 360 to unify their entire customer experience, empowering 4,000 customer service agents and 7,000 field service agents with a complete view of their customers, which is driving operational efficiencies as well as growth. And as Bret said, we expanded our partnership with VMware, which has been a Salesforce customer since 2008. This quarter, they kicked off a pilot of Slack plus Service Cloud to accelerate customer support. They also partnered with Tableau to extend data and analytics across their entire business, enabling the presentation of deep analytics to help innovate even faster. LVMH continues to expand with Salesforce to deliver luxury goods from anywhere. Globally, 40,000 retail associates and customer service agents use Salesforce to deliver personalized retail journeys for their customers. And our win with the Boohoo Group, which is a leading UK-based online fashion retailer, uses our technology to deliver their incredible online shopping experience. With Commerce Cloud, Boohoo is now expanding shopping by social media, marketplaces as they look to build for the future. And the State of Nevada's Department of Motor Vehicles is another great story in the quarter. They selected Salesforce as the platform to power its digital transformation across its entire business. This will mean a whole new experience for residents renewing drivers\u2019 licenses, credentialing, titling and registering vehicles and so much more. And this is another great example of digital transformation powered by Salesforce, of course, another great reason to move to Las Vegas. These are all great organizations that have pivoted their business to navigate this new world and deliver customer success from anywhere. They're relying on us more than ever and inspiring us to leverage the power of our Salesforce Customer 360, Slack and so much more to continue to fuel that business. And finally, a word on Q4. I'm really encouraged about how we started the quarter. Demand and pipe looks strong, and we're looking forward to a great finish to what has been an exceptional year. I want to thank our incredible team for continuing to do such a great job in the massive global change. The work they do and the technology they deliver powers our customers' success, and we couldn't be more grateful.  Amy, over to you to share the financial details of our quarter. Amy Weaver : Great. Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. As we discussed 2 months ago at our Analyst Day, we are in a new world. And we showed our ability to execute on this new world once again in Q3. We delivered on key metrics, strong top and bottom line and cash flows. And our focus remains on disciplined and profitable growth. Q3 was also a milestone quarter as it was our first full quarter with Slack. Building on their strong performance over the last several quarters, Slack's early results reinforce our confidence in the strategic importance of this best-in-class asset. Now let me walk you through some of the results for Q3 fiscal '22 beginning with top line commentary. Total revenue for the third quarter was $6.86 billion, which includes $280 million from Slack. This is up 27% year-over-year, or 26% in constant currency. The strong demand environment and new business pipeline that we've highlighted on the last few earnings calls continued, allowing us to outperform top line expectations again.  A few key highlights from the quarter : First launched 22 years ago, Sales Cloud became a $6 billion run rate business this quarter and grew revenue 17%. Sales Cloud now joins Service Cloud, which became a $6 billion business just 2 quarters ago. And Service Cloud continues to grow over 20% at scale. These are 2 massive businesses growing in the double-digits, and their success is a testament to the strength of our core. Our Americas business is performing extremely well, and we see a healthy demand environment in front of us. New business in North America was especially strong, our largest market that we've been operating in for over 20 years. And as you heard from Bret, Slack continues to outperform our expectations. Slack has strong customer acquisition with notable strength in the enterprise. The number of paid customers spending greater than $100,000 annually accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 44% year-over-year. Slack Connect adoption remains strong, with the number of connected end points reaching a record level, up 176% year-over-year. And we've been able to introduce Slack to new customers. Already, 4 of our top 10 deals this quarter included a new Slack win. Once again, we saw strong growth in our multi-cloud deals as our customers continue to ask for more than point solutions. In Q3, we recorded 33% year-over-year growth in the number of deals containing 5 or more clouds. We did see some headwinds this quarter to our MuleSoft business. When a business is growing as quickly as MuleSoft is, there are scaling challenges you can face, and we experienced some of these challenges this quarter. We are confident in the changes that we have made going forward. As a reminder, a large portion of our MuleSoft revenue is recognized in period, which has an outsized impact to our second half revenue. MuleSoft remains a critical part our Customer 360, allowing our customers to integrate all of their data and systems. Beginning this quarter with the incorporation of Slack into our financial results, we are providing investors with updated revenue by service offering disclosures. Going forward, Slack will be reported in Platform and Other. We are also creating a new revenue category, Data, which will incorporate MuleSoft and Tableau including Tableau CRM, all of which were previously included in Platform and Other. We believe this will provide greater transparency into our results. A historical reclass using our new revenue breakdown is available in the earnings deck that we have published alongside our press release. And we continue to make great progress on attrition. For the first time in company history, revenue attrition was below 8%. Q3 attrition was between 7.5% to 8%, an improvement versus last quarter's 8% to 8.5%. Our remaining performance obligation, representing all future revenue under contract, ended Q3 at approximately $36.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year and in constant currency. Slack represents 4 points of growth, in line with our guidance. Turning to operating margin. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, which continues to benefit from revenue outperformance, efficiencies from a work-from-anywhere world and a focus on disciplined spending. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.47, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.27. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to stronger revenue and expense efficiencies as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.27 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.28. Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $404 million, up 19% year-over-year. CapEx for the quarter was $166 million, resulting in free cash flow of $238 million, up 11% year-over-year. Now turning to guidance. We expect Q4 revenue of $7.224 billion to $7.234 billion or approximately 24% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes a $285 million contribution from Slack in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by another $50 million to $26.3 billion to $26.4 billion. This equates to a total $100 million raise to our revenue guidance since Q2. Our guidance now includes $565 million contribution from Slack for the fiscal year. The fiscal year revenue contribution from Slack represents a $35 million increase from our previous guidance. Our full year guidance continues to include $200 million from Acumen. For Q4, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 19%. This includes 4 points of growth from Slack. One thing I will call attention to is that we remain mindful of the strengthening U.S. dollar in our foreign operations, which may impact our financials. We continue to monitor foreign exchange as we execute on what is typically the largest quarter in our fiscal year. We expect Q4 GAAP EPS of negative $0.24 to negative $0.23, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 to $0.73. For the full year, this translates to GAAP EPS guidance of $1.28 to $1.29, and non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.68 to $4.69. We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.49 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further contribution from loss to market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 18.6%, representing an expansion of 90 basis points year-over-year. The raise in our operating margin guidance is due to refined assumptions around Slack and Acumen. We now expect a 140 basis point headwind, or 10 basis points less headwind than our previous guidance. I'd like to call out that our guidance continues to incorporate expense seasonality that is weighted to Q4, including investments in both our workforce and growth opportunities and T&E expectations. We are raising fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 4 points, now expecting 18% to 19% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide is primarily driven by strong revenue performance and lower headwinds from M&A. The dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 5 points. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, operating cash flow growth would be 23% to 24%. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, thus resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 19% to 20% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A as previously noted, this rate would be 25% to 26%. As I shared with you 2 months ago, it is incredibly important to drive this conscious decision-making in every aspect of the company. This new mindset will enable a more durable company as we approach $50 billion, and fiscal '22 represents how we can deliver profitable growth in this new world. Turning to fiscal '23, we are pleased -- we were pleased to provide our initial revenue and non-GAAP operating margin guidance during our Investor Day. Today we are initiating Q1 fiscal '23 revenue guidance of $7.215 billion to $7.25 billion, or approximately 21% to 22% growth year-over-year. As Gavin mentioned, we're off to a strong start in Q4, and we'll provide you with our complete fiscal '23 guidance as part of our Q4 earnings in February. So to close, our business is performing well, and we continue to see record levels of revenue and operating margin. Our flagship product and in Sales Cloud saw its third consecutive quarter of acceleration. And we now have two $6 billion businesses in sales and service. Slack is outperforming our expectations, and the integration continues to progress well. And we remain incredibly well positioned with our broad product portfolio and global reach to be able to serve all of our customers. Our products are more relevant than ever. Finally, on a personal note, I want to congratulate both Marc and Bret in their new Co-CEO partnership. I have been privileged to work closely with both of them for many years, and I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am for both of them and even more for Salesforce. So Jeff, why don't I kick it back to you and we can open it up for questions? Jeff, operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Congrats on a good quarter and to Bret on being named Co-CEO. I actually have 2 questions, maybe one for Marc and for Amy. And for Marc, on the Co-CEO structure, how do you envision breaking down CEO responsibilities amongst yourselves? And maybe what did you learn in the past about having co-CEOs that will make this structure even better than it was last time around? And then perhaps for Amy, Amy, the guidance that you've given us for CRPO in Q4 seems to imply a meaningful deceleration. What factors contribute to this? Is there anything anomalous to call out perhaps in addition to FX? And is there anything at all that impacts the confidence level that you have in your forecast? Marc Benioff : Well first of all, congratulations again, Bret. It's super exciting. And you're right. Salesforce has had an evolving leadership structure several times, and we have also had tremendous success previously with the co-CEO structure. And of course, probably those folks who've benefited the most were really our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. As we've seen as we've changed these structures, it's actually been an acceleration on the company. So I'm very excited about the Co-CEO structure. These jobs are big jobs, and being able to have a partner that you can share with makes it a lot easier. And when Keith decided to retire, I was back in this job. It was very lonely. And now to have a partner with Bret, I couldn't be more excited. So I want to congratulate him again. Amy Weaver : Great. On CRPO, business is strong. We've raised FY '22 revenue by $300 million 3 months ago, another $60 million just 2 months ago, and now another $50 million today. And this is even with some of the headwinds I described from Mule; and as you noted, some uncertainty on FX. So overall, I believe our CRPO guidance is in line with our guided revenue growth rate for the quarter and for the year we believe is appropriate. And of course as we said, Q4 is our largest new business quarter. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Congrats, Bret, to the expanded role. And congrats on a great quarter from me as well. Can I ask around Slack? One of the main exciting points around Slack with the shared channel. And especially if you think about it on the sales side, that should be kind of really interesting. Can you talk to that, what you're seeing there in the market and the feedback you get from customers? And a follow-up question for Amy. If I look, you beat the operating margins this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about the linearity of spending in Q4? Because like this sort of was so much better, so you must be spending or hiring quite a bit in Q4. Bret Taylor : Yes, thank you for your question about Slack. And you're right, the shared channels, which the brand name is called Slack Connect, is just one of the most differentiated and exciting parts of Slack as a platform, particularly if you think about the opportunity to integrate Slack with Customer 360. Because as I said, Slack is not just a platform for communicating with fellow employees, it's a platform to engage with your partners, with your customers and integrate with every single application at your company. I think the best measure of it in this quarter, I mentioned it in my script, was Slack Connect was up an astonishing 176% year-over-year in the quarter. And I think behind that it was really exciting and Stewart articulated so well, There's a really strong network effect when multiple companies and multiple partners are using this service, it makes the service more valuable. We use Slack Connect with our customers now. And I think probably the best example of this past week was Cyber Week. So many of the retailers that I worked with use Slack as their command center for Cyber Week. They would have Salesforce in there. They would have the agencies running their campaigns, their merchandisers. All of these folks are coordinated to drive as much GMV growth as they can in a short period of time. Slack was really at the center of that, and as you said, really about a shared channel with multiple stakeholders. So it's a big part of our product strategy, and it's a big part of the strategy for Slack to continue to grow. Candidly, I don't think there's an enterprise product like this in the marketplace. It really has network effects from company to company, and we're really excited about it. Amy Weaver : Great. I'll take the second part of your question on operating margins. So you -- overall this year, so pleased with our FY '22 operating margin trajectory. As a reminder, we started off the year at 17.7% guidance, and we've raised consistently, now up to 18.6% for the full year. And we really focus on delivering operating margin for the year and not for any particular quarter. That said, we're coming off a very third -- a great op margin quarter in a row. And there is some seasonality to our margins. So in Q4, we are expecting to see additional investments in our work and our growth and also some modest increased T&E expectations. And that's going to cause the quarter-over-quarter decline in operating margin. But again, we're really excited about the full year proud to be guiding to 18.6. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : Just given Gavin's comments on Q4 demand and pipeline strength, many are asking given the bookings growth was 23%, the 19% guide for Q4, why such a sharp decel? Anything that we should consider as it relates to the guidance and what you're seeing going into the fourth quarter? Marc Benioff : I think Amy should directly address that, and then Gavin can come in as well. Amy? Amy Weaver : Brent, coming into Q4, we actually feel very, very good about this. As Gavin said, and he can tell you more, we feel very strongly about the demand environment. When I look at revenue for the year, again, I want to emphasize that we've raised $100 million since Q2. We raised $50 million at Investor Day, which is about halfway through Q3. And we could see a very strong quarter coming as well as an additional 50 right now. So I do believe that those are guides for CRPO and for revenue are supportive and reflects what we're seeing in the market. So Gavin, why don't I give this to you for a little bit more color on what you're seeing? Gavin Patterson : Sure. Well in a word, we started the fourth quarter really strong. And as I said in my comments, demand is strong across the piece. The pipe looks very good. Americas is particularly strong. And parts of Europe I think are performing equally well. There's a good performance across the verticals. And so it's a balanced performance across the piece. So look, we're feeling confident about the fourth quarter. There's no question about it. So we don't give you any specifics, of course, at this stage. But as I say, I'm very pleased with the way we started in the first few weeks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Very nice quarter, and my congratulations to Bret as well. Two questions for Amy, one in terms of the Q4 guide that\u2019s getting a lot of attention. FX is kind of working against us on a go-forward basis. Can you talk to us to the degree that there's any FX impacts already incorporated into that Q4 guide? And to what extent have you incorporated the strong U.S. dollar into the margin commentary and FY '23 guide? And then the second question is a little bit broader. You guys have been working on this new philosophy of a better balance between growth and profitability for a couple of quarters now. How is that progressing? Can you give us kind of a status update in terms of are you finding this to be an easier, harder job than you originally anticipated in terms of pivoting the company with -- to more of an efficiency focus? Amy Weaver : So let me start with foreign exchange. As you know that I think that any global CFO who you speak to this week is watching foreign exchange very, very closely. And it has had a modest impact to our guidance, and we're going to be monitoring that going forward. Just to give you an idea of the volatility just since Investor Day, we've seen the euro devalue nearly I think it's between 4% and 5% right now. And the Great British pound is down about 2%. And they do have modest impacts on us. Now we don't give detailed information about our currency split. But I can tell you, our international revenue is chiefly driven by 4 currencies : it being the euro, the British pound, the yen; and then to a lesser extent, the Australian dollar. And so as you know, we don't explicitly guide the FX, but we certainly do factor that into our planning processes and build out our guide based on those projections. Second question? second -- sorry, go Ahead. Marc Benioff : He wants to talk about our kind of march towards greater efficiencies. I mean I think this has been really the highlight of the last 6 quarters, which is we took advantage of the pandemic to reset our model. We've talked about that we have a new model. We're taking that extremely seriously, not only just in how we budgeted fiscal year '22, which is what we're finishing right now, but also we're finishing up our budget for fiscal year '23. That obviously also takes into consideration these changes in foreign exchange, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is something that I'm sure all of you are watching, and we watch as well. We're a global company. These things matter to us. How our numbers shake out always depend on currencies. And there can be variation quarter to quarter based on that. So when we look at efficiency, we saw an opportunity when the pandemic hit to really look at how are we spending money overall. And we were really taken by changes in the pandemic cycle : T&E, the use of our real estate, our marketing spend. And we started to rebalance, to reshape, to rethink about how do we look at our model, our overall model, not just our revenue model, but our expense model. Since we started the company, I would say we never really had an opportunity to look at it. You're on a train. The train is going. The train is working. Why would you make changes to the train? Unless there's a pandemic. That you say, well, I guess we're going to get rid of this to this. So the reality is we have the opportunity to start to make changes that we didn't have that opportunity before. And now we've been able to really learn. And I mean we've kind of gone over it a couple of times, but we\u2019ve seen in the year when we acquired this incredible company, the 18.6% is pretty awesome. And we've also given really strong guidance for next year with 20%. And you can see the tremendous operating margin that we've delivered in each of the last 6 quarters. So we have tremendous feeling of optimism to the future as we look to having this incredible new model. And is efficiency part of that model? Absolutely. But really, the best part of the model is really optimizing the company in ways that only the pandemic let us do that. And I'd love for Amy and Bret to both come in, maybe Gavin too. Because this has been a very important part of the management team's work in the last several quarters as we've realized there are some knobs that we can turn, that we were just never really allowed to do before, and now we can. So do you want to comment on that, Bret? Bret Taylor : Yes, I mean I'll just start. First, I just want to give a special thank you to Amy. I think we talked a lot about top line revenue performance, the pandemic and a number of other factors leading to the operating margin delivery that we've delivered. But I think the most important part of it is discipline. And fundamentally as a company, we are a growth company, we'll always be a growth company, but we're one of a few who don't need to choose between growth and operational efficiency. And you're seeing in both the top line growth and the bottom line growth. And I think a lot of that is due to Amy's leadership and really, the work of the entire management team to transform the way we operate. I think as Marc alluded to, the train with one theoretical -- this as you put it, I think it set up to grow even faster coming out of the end of this pandemic. Amy Weaver : That's good. So Bret and Marc, I think you both said it very, very well. Cases we look at this, we continue to benefit from the revenue outperformance, from everything we've learned at the pandemic, from a new way to work, and really from, I think a heightened sense of discipline. But what I would emphasize most of all is that this is really a commitment by the entire management team. And what has really impressed me as we've been putting in place new policies, tightening up budgets is the fact that every team has really stepped up and shared in the commitment and shared in changes. Marc Benioff : Before we go on to the next question, we have a tremendous executive, Gavin Patterson, who's our Chief Revenue Officer, who is formerly a public company CEO of British Telephone. And Gavin has been the Chief Revenue Officer, as all of you know, through the pandemic. And he also brought tremendous insights into managing this new model of efficiency and optimization. Gavin, I'd love it if you could give us a few words as well on your vision on how this new model is working for you. And maybe you could touch on what the new sales model is as part of this. Gavin Patterson : Thanks, Marc. Well, this is something I touched on at Investor Day. I truly believe that we can continue to drive growth, and that will continue to be our #1 priority. But we could do so at the same time as driving efficiencies through the business through disciplined decision-making. You heard it from Amy, and it's a mantra that we're using throughout the business. And some of the things I talked about then are really to do with providing a tighter grip across the business, deploying best practice across our operating units. When we've got a successful model, how do we replicate it across operating units around the world. I've put a lot more focus on things like participation and driving productivity, so ensuring that we're getting the most value out of our 10,000-person sales force, which is one of our sources of competitive advantage. But how do we make sure everybody is contributing every quarter and that we're looking to eke out both small deals and big deals throughout the year. And then finally how do we open up new channels. So the direct model continues to be our strongest muscle, there's no question about that. But we're finding that customers, and not just small customers, are keen to use more and more -- who purchase more and more through digital and online. And that's an area that we're revamping, and it's going to be a bigger part of our overall delivery of new bookings going forward. So the focus for me has been about driving best practice across the Salesforce ecosystem and having a flatter organization that allows for faster decision-making and stronger leadership within the units themselves. Marc Benioff : Yes, thank you so much, Gavin. And I from Gavin, Amy and Bret should indicate to you how fortunate I am to have this great management team running Salesforce during this pandemic. And then this ability to have not only this great team, but to put in the new model during this and now this new structure as well. Look, we're in a new world. We all know that. And we've all seen all the things that are supposedly happening this week, who knows how much of it is actually true? So we have the ability to adjust and to run the company dynamically. And I think that's why you see such incredibly strong quarter here in Q3. And I believe we're going to have a world-class quarter in the fourth quarter and a great fiscal year next year as well. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Kasthuri Rangan : Congratulations to Bret on becoming Co-CEO. One for the Co-CEOs and one for the CFO. When you look at the operating model of the company, it is working quite well. You're pretty close to 20% organic growth rate, give or take. Your margins are pretty close to 20%. In fact, you absorbed Slack and did margins that were on par with your best margins before. So everything is going well. Do you feel the need to make any acquisitions? Or even if you do, do you feel like you can contain all this with the current margin structure? And one for Amy, when you look at the tremendous operating efficiencies you've been able to experience in a very short period of time, does that increase your confidence in the longer-term outlook? Granted that you don't have a specific margin target for the longer term. How should we think about the sustainability of the improvement of margins in the longer term as we watch the incredible success you've had in a very short span of time? Marc Benioff : Well, I think you're right, Kash. We're doing a very good job of absorbing Slack and integrating it deeply into the company, not only into the distribution organization with Gavin and not just with its financial characteristics with Amy but you can see the tremendous vision. Especially if you watch the Dreamforce keynote that Bret brought to Slack and Salesforce together with Slack-First. And I'd love for him to talk about that. Because I think when we get to Dreamforce New York City, which is going to happen on December 8 at Javits Center, and I hope all of you will join us there. We'll have 2,000 customers there with us, and we'll be broadcasting that all over the world as well. Well, I think that you'll see that this has fundamentally changed the tone and tempo and future of Salesforce, that we're really a very different kind of company because of this amazing acquisition. That said, this is a large acquisition. It is taking a lot of work time from the management team to absorb it. And it still will take several more quarters before we can tell you that we're really running deeply integrated with Slack And Bret, you've done so much of the leadership here with Slack and with Stewart. So maybe you could just address where we are and how you see the future acquisition environment. Bret Taylor : Yes. Well, I'll start with really what Marc said, which is right now our focus is integrating Slack. And not on any near-term M&A, as Marc said, it's really important. What sets Salesforce apart is how successful we've been able to integrate and grow our acquisitions. My favorite slide at Investor Day with Amy is which we talked about the growth of exact target of MuleSoft or Tableau and now seeing an early return from Slack I think is what superpowers is an organization, and it really requires a lot of focus on the management team. Slack is really special though, as Marc said. It's just a moment in time where the way we've worked, which has sort of been as Marc said, it's not what we all planned. We just showed up at work one day, and that's the way work was done. And the whole world is reimagined at the same time. And we have this incredible opportunity to partner with our customers help them with this transformation. And no one knows where the world is going. We know we're not going back to the office 5 days a week. And Slack has become such a strategic part of every single customer conversation. As Marc said, I encourage everyone to either come in person to Java Center on December 8 or watch online on Salesforce Plus and really see the power of Salesforce Customer 360 and Slack together. And I think you can see why we're so excited about it and see -- as you can see some of the early returns this quarter as we beat guidance. Marc Benioff : Yes, I'll really add to that, that you've seen us, Kash, do so many incredible acquisitions, starting with ExactTarget, moving on to MuleSoft, to Tableau, Slack. But let me tell you, there is no finish line on these acquisitions. There it's a lot of work. It's a lot -- it's skill, it's art. It's luck also to keep them all going. Because look, we're innovating organically and also we have innovated inorganically. And then we're deeply integrating these acquisitions into Customer 360, our ultimate vision of where all of that is going. Well, that's still something that we're continuing to reveal and is being revealed to us. So it's a dynamic process, and it requires all of our attention. And we're very excited about Slack and how far we've been able to come in such a short period of time. Amy Weaver : Kash, following up on your second question about operating margin, we've had a great year on this. I'm really delighted to predict that we're going to end the year around 18.6. And as you know, at Investor Day, I was thrilled to announce a guide to 20% next year, which I think symbolically is a key number for us. And we're doing that despite it being a full year of Slack and what I'm hoping will be some moderately increasing T&E expenditure. But we're very much committed to doing that. Now we have not given long-term guidance beyond FY '23. But I will say we are committed to continuing to improve operating margin. As Bret said, there's a reimagination going on. We're having a chance to reimagine everything about how we operate. And I want to be able to make sure that we're using that to look at operating margin and look at how we're running a company with fresh eyes and continue to improve. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of DJ Hynes from Canaccord Genuity. David Hynes : Bret, I was hoping you could touch on some of the growing pains that were alluded to with MuleSoft. I think you also mentioned that there were some changes made in that business that you feel pretty good about. So maybe just unpack that a little bit. And Amy, maybe as a follow-up to that question, how should we think about the seasonality and modeling of the data cloud business, just given it's the first time that you're breaking that out? Bret Taylor : I appreciate the question. As Marc said, there's really no finish line with integrating acquisitions. And we've made some changes that we think are right for the long term and what it's been. I think maybe perhaps, Marc, our fastest-growing acquisition today that you saw in Amy's slide at Investor Day. So we feel very confident in the decisions we've made and have to get through a bit of this change management, we are seeing in the short-term results. But we feel very confident in the future of MuleSoft and certainly no change the demand environment. Actually, Gavin and I were just talking about this, just before the earnings call, just how important MuleSoft is a lot in our Q4 deals, particularly the Customer 360 deals where our customers are connecting multiple clouds to multiple back-end systems. And how much integration is such an important part of our customer conversation. So we feel confident in the long term of the business and recognize we have some short-term growing pains as we integrate our acquisitions. Marc Benioff : Yes. Gavin, could you come in here and kind of address that directly? And just tell us about the demand environment for the fourth quarter and next year, and what kind of pipeline and capabilities you're seeing with customers today. Gavin Patterson : Well, I'm not going to give specific numbers. But you can hopefully tell from my tone and conviction the demand environment is strong. The pipe is strong, and we're feeling confident about Q4 and looking into Q1 as well. I think Bret said it very, very eloquently. We've gone through a little bit of, I would say, growing pains this quarter with Mule. There are operational challenges, but the actions that need to be taken are very clear. But it does not change in any way our belief that MuleSoft is fundamental to our ability to deliver our Customer 360. So I see its role in solving customer problems and creating value for customers is absolutely fundamental. And I'm confident we'll be able to work through these over the next quarter. So across the board, Marc, the business and demand environment looks strong. And as we cycle through another wave of COVID, I don't see that changing fundamentally. Operator : We have reached the end of the allotted time for questions. Bret Taylor : We would like to answer the second part of that question, please? Amy Weaver : Yes, so let me just quickly respond to that. You asked about the seasonality of data in our new reporting metrics. So one of the advantages of breaking up the revenue this way is I think it really provides greater transparency to all of our investors. And what this will do is it will put Tableau and MuleSoft, which are 2 primarily licensed-based offerings, together in the same line. So I don't think it's so much a question of seasonality, but it's a question actually of lumping out. Because of the way that we recognize the revenue in period, you were simply going to see more variability in those -- in that line than you would in other areas. I really think it's an advantage to everyone to be able to have that be isolated going forward. Evan Goldstein : All right. Thank you for joining us on the call today. If you have any other follow-up questions, please e-mail us at investor@salesforce.com. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Salesforce's Fiscal 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  Now I'd like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Evan Goldstein : Thank you, Bob. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results conference Call. I'm Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Bret Taylor, Vice Chair and Co-CEO; Amy Weaver, Chief Financial Officer; and Gavin Patterson, Chief Revenue Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, in particular, our expectations around the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, acquisition, results of operation and financial condition, and that of our customers and partners are uncertain and subject to change. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that, let me hand the call to Marc. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks, Evan. This is probably one of those calls that the most difficult type of call that we can do, and the reason why it is the most difficult call that we can do is all of the grim things that are happening in the world. And of course, all of us are witnesses to tragedies that we cannot believe our eyes. And at the same time, we're here on the call to tell you that Salesforce had perhaps the best quarter it's ever had in its history, and we are trying to measure our response. And this is actually very personal for me. I'm sure many of you know that my great grandfather actually immigrated from Kiev from -- growing up, it was Kiev in our household. And -- but my great grandfather, Isaac Benioff came to the United States from Kiev, and my grandfather was born here in the United States and then came to San Francisco and met to my grandmother who was the second generation San Franciscan. And that's why I'm here now, I'm a fourth generation San Franciscan, but looking back and looking at my family now and Ukraine, my heart is really breaking for them, and the senseless pain, the suffering, the -- it's just unbelievably difficult to see what is going on in the world. And while we really don't have employees or do business in the Ukraine or Russia of any consequence, I would say that we do have employees and families like mine, and with loved ones there and deep connections to the region in this part of the world, and our heart is continuing to break. And we've provided ways that we provide humanitarian care. I just provided some response through World Central Kitchen, which I highly endorse, Jose Andres, and someone who I've worked with for many years. And as we find more ways to provide humanitarian care, we will. This is very important to us and who we are in our core values at Salesforce. So, as I said, this is a difficult moment for us because we are not blind to what's happening in the world, and yet we did have probably, I would say, the best quarter we've ever had in the history of the company. And I'm here on the 61st floor of Salesforce Tower. We've got significant numbers of our employees back here in the office. I was just with them. And I also just spent a tremendous amount of time surveying the city and how things are coming back to life here kind of in our post-pandemic reality that we're now entering, and it's powerful. This energy around here is amazing. We're really turning the corner in our battle with the virus. And I believe, in many ways, COVID is behind us. And certainly, I know that Omicron and BA.2 are very serious viruses, but we are in a very different position in the world today fighting these things than we were a couple of years ago, and I want to thank everyone who has done so much for getting us through the last two years. It really became very clear to us -- a couple of weeks ago, we had our fiscal year kick-off in New York City. We had 5,000 employees attending in person at the Javits Center. It was amazing to be with 5,000 employees again. We had -- we have 75,000 employees now in the company. 35,000 of our 75,000 employees have started since the pandemic, so we've had quite a bit of growth here at Salesforce. And I would also say that when we asked -- we're in the room -- and how many of you have not attended a Salesforce kick-off, stand up and be welcomed, I would say 75% of the room stood up. And Bret and I are conducting this kick-off together as a team, and I think we are both in shock. And wouldn\u2019t you say that that was\u2026 Bret Taylor : It was amazing. Marc Benioff : It was, right? Bret Taylor : Being in person again after so long. Marc Benioff : Being back at the Javits Center with 5,000 employees, doing a kickoff, and with tens and tens of thousands of employees online. And I'll tell you that we were able to get together safely, thanks to our safety cloud. We were interconnected with a number of COVID tests that wesre dynamically updating how we were doing and trying to keep the virus at bear. There\u2019s still some virus there, but not a lot. And we did our best to have a very safe program, and we've been doing this now. We've had two Dreamforces with this program, with our safety cloud we\u2019ve had the kick-offs. We\u2019ve had all kinds of events and programs all over the world using this technology. And it's very powerful, Mayor de Blasio came, and he was talking about how we had built the contact tracing system for New York, which we did, and the vaccine management system for New York, which we did, and many apps and talking about how we landed a 787 during the height of the pandemic in New York, which we did, and providing millions of pieces of PPE and so forth. But the emotional part for me, and I don't know, Bret if you were, but when he said everywhere where our employees were sitting was a FEMA Field hospital just a short time ago. And we were sitting in a hospital and having a kick-off, and we realized, wow, we've somehow gotten through this. And wasn\u2019t that a moment? Bret Taylor : Yes. You could feel the impact and just the poignancy of the moment as everyone looked down at their seats and tried to imagine a cot and really captured just as hard and as long as it's been how far we've come. Marc Benioff : I'll tell you, I added up how many CEOs I've been with in the last 90 days and it has been about 46. And as I've talked to all these CEOs all over the world and travelled and so forth, it's been a powerful couple of years and difficult. And I mean I'm grateful for what all of our Ohana have done and all of our employees have done, and also our customers and the first responders and scientists and everybody to get through this because it does feel like -- and I think as evidenced by what we just went through in New York, we're kind of coming to the end of this. And it's not that this isn't still raging. I just read some horrible articles about what's going on right now in Hong Kong with BA.2. But we are kind of coming to another stage here, and I hope that we're about to get back to a more normal world. And we're doing that, unfortunately, a war in a pandemic, this is not an uncommon story and very sad to see what's going on here. So with that, I have to tell you, though, that I'm speaking now to our investors and analysts directly and I'm speaking directly about the performance of the company, we had a phenomenal quarter. We capped off, which was just a phenomenal fiscal year '22 with just incredible numbers. And we continue to see just tremendous, tremendous demand from customers across every industry, every geography and every product category. And I think that like many of the portfolio managers who are on the call and will ask questions later, we're managing a full portfolio. We see that with products and geographies and industries. And across the whole portfolio, I would say there's a remarkable strength. And every company that I speak to and these CEOs that I'm speaking to, they're all going through major digital transformations. And those customers, they all -- are all beginning and ending with the customer. And our job remains to help these companies grow and achieve this transformation. And that's why we've had such an incredible year, and I'm confident that, that will continue. And you can see that in kind of these incredible numbers, but also our very deep commitment to this kind of very disciplined, very profitable and very cash flow positive, as you can see, the $6 billion number and the $7-plus billion number scheduled for next year and going up in the years to come. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose to more than $7.3 billion, up 26% year-over-year. That's pretty awesome for a company of our size that we did a 26% growth quarter at $7.3 billion. I don't think there were too many $7.3 billion quarters at 26% growth in the world this year. And for the full fiscal '22, revenue was $26.5 billion, again, up 25% year-over-year. Again, a $26 billion company growing 30% to 25%. And of course, that's why we're coming in on this $32.1 billion year. So we're continuing to be the fastest-growing top 5 enterprise software company in history. Salesforce is on track to becoming the world's #1 enterprise cloud, software applications company. This operating margin for the quarter was 15%; and for the full year, 18.7%. And we've just continued to deliver this disciplined approach to margin expansion. And you can see that in the forecast for the quarter now at over 20% operating margin with the $32.1 billion year. So with our unique business model, we continue to grow revenue at scale, drive operating margin expansion, leading to strong cash generation, I mean you can see that in all 3 aspects of this quarter. And we closed fiscal year '22 with really incredible cash flow, reaching a milestone of $6 billion in the year, and that's really up 25% year-over-year. That's really amazing, and I would say, far exceeded our goals. I'll tell you that based on our strong fiscal year '22 results, we're excited to raise our fiscal year '23 revenue guidance to $32.1 billion, something I've been excited to talk about at the high end of the range, representing 21% growth year-over-year. Amy, I hope that, that is just the beginning of the [revs-in] for the year. And we are committed to delivering a fiscal year '23 operating margin of 20%. And customer success is just continuing to just drive this financial success. And our product innovation is providing customers with the resilience they need to navigate these, I would say, grim and uncertain times. And that's why Salesforce has been ranked by IDC as the number one CRM for 8 years in a row. We have a tremendous focus here, being the number one CRM. Our entire Customer 360 portfolio, that is the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud and the Marketing Cloud and the Commerce Cloud and Slack and Tableau and MuleSoft. And by the way, other great clouds, too, that aren't even listed when we talk about these things like our Financial Services Cloud or our Safety Cloud or Sustainability Cloud. Putting them all together for our customers, well, it becomes the single source of truth, virtually, the entire Fortune 500. And all of this customer success is being led by an incredible management team, which I think everyone on the call will agree and I certainly believe never has been stronger or more aligned. Now I want to talk about a couple of customers real quickly and then wrap this up. Ford -- well, you're going to hear more from Bret and Gavin. We're helping major companies like this around the world transform their business. And you know I love this company, I think it's one of the great companies, very transformational, tremendous new CEO, Jim Farley, he has got a great vision for the world. You've seen that, if you haven't been inside this Lightning 150 truck. It's going to be the electric vehicle for everyone. It's the e-transit van. It's amazing. And I have 2 of these MACH-Es, a yellow one and a white one. And if you haven't tried it, you should go to the Ford dealer because it's just worth it to test drive the car because it drives very different than other electric cars, and I've had probably every single one because I love these things. And a few weeks ago, I was with Jim Farley, and we launched the Ford Pro business unit. And it -- they're doing a B2B business unit at Ford to complement their B2C unit, not so unlike a lot of our other customers like Home Depot. But I'll tell you that Ford Pro, they're really looking at targeting professionals, targeting productivity. They're really looking at giving the motivation for the professional.  And I'll tell you, I live in a rural area, and I even have a Ford 550 truck, which is configured as a fire truck. That is when things go wrong, I have to be ready for that. And they have telematics, but I am excited to be able to build all these Customer 360 services around this Ford 550 truck because I'm trying to turn that Ford 550 into a Ford 360. That's how I look at this world. And I'll tell you that Jim Farley and I were up [indiscernible], not so far away from here a few weeks ago, and it was awesome to see their product line, but also how their customers and their partners are all really connecting with this, these new products in incredible new ways. And when you look at Ford and kind of they're driven towards, well, sustainability, it -- I find it to be very much aligned with what's happening in the world because we all know we're in a climate emergency. We need everyone to get to net 0 as fast as possible. Salesforce now coming into the Fortune 100 this year. We are a net zero company already, fully renewable across our entire value chain. We've achieved 100% renewable energy for our global operations. We're reducing emissions further. We're very sensitive to what we're doing with all of our products with sustainability, and we know we can't stop. There's no finish line on sustainability. It's really one of our very core values now. And we're operationalizing sustainability in every part of our business. It's an area I\u2019d spend a lot of time on in the last, I would say, 6 months, even looking at new investments. Bret and I just looked at a very cool company together. When you say we were surprised the type of companies that we're looking at in carbon relationship management that before we were not, it's the new CRM, carbon relationship management. Because there's a lot we can do in analytics, in information management, and in helping our customers get the carbon that they need to be successful. And every business can be a platform for addressing climate change. The first step is for each and one of us to commit to being net zero ourselves. I have a lot of friends who are venture capitalists who are saying they're going to move into the sustainability world. And I said to them, the first thing they need to do in their portfolios, get their portfolios to be net zero. All of our work around sustainability might be the most important rewarding work of our lives. Well, it's one of the things we celebrate.  Salesforce is going to be 23 years old, amazing, on March 8, just a few days from now, a quarter versus century. It's getting there. Just partner is not with us today. He's traveling. So I want to just say happy birthday to Parker, and thank you for starting this great company with me so many years ago, and we look at all the evolutions of the company and the management team and the products and its -- employees and all of our Ohanas, and all of our stakeholders, thank you. When we started this in 1999, I never dreamed we would have become this amazing company and entering the Fortune 100 in 2022. So this is awesome. And our values have created so much value when we look at $0.5 billion in grants now to our communities, $6.7 million in employee volunteer hours, more than $100 million here to our San Francisco and Oakland public schools who so badly need it, especially right now, running 55,000 nonprofits and NGOs on our product for free and so many other things that we've been able to do here, the children's hospitals here in San Francisco or so many other things around the world. So thank you to all of you for making that happen. And we're also delighted -- and thank you to our trailblazers, especially who believes so much in our products. They've lifted us up. And again, Parker and I are just so very grateful. And now over to you, Bret. Bret Taylor : Thank you, Marc. I really appreciate it. As Marc said, we had a phenomenal quarter to finish another phenomenal year of innovation and customer success. And you can see it in our performance. Our operating model and our discipline are generating profitable growth at incredible scale. I've had the privilege of meeting hundreds of customers over the past few months. And the thing I've come away with after those conversations is that Salesforce is more strategic to their success than ever before. Every company is going through a digital transformation. And that transformation starts and ends with their customers. That's what drove our incredible performance in every region this quarter, 23% in the Americas, 38% in EMEA and 20% in APAC. We continue to see tremendous demand from our customers across the entire Customer 360 portfolio. Companies like KPMG and Scotiabank are using Sales Cloud to build digitally native sales teams with brand-new products like revenue intelligence and our new Slack integrations. Sales Cloud growth accelerated again this quarter to 17% year-over-year, and it's now a $6 billion revenue business. Companies like State Farm and U.S. Bank expanded their use of sales -- Service Cloud this quarter, helping it grow at 18% year-over-year to nearly $6.5 billion in revenue. These sales and service businesses are just incredible. Independently, each is larger than any other cloud Software-as-a-Service company, and they're more relevant to more customers than they've ever been in our 23-year history. Our Marketing Cloud also continued to show strong growth with customers like Humana and Sunrun. Marketing Cloud delivered over 40 billion messages in Cyber Week alone and delivered 4.1 billion messages per day throughout Q4, up 37% year-over-year. Just Eat Takeaway, which Gavin and I recently visited in Amsterdam is a great Marketing Cloud success story from the quarter. Just Eat is a leading online food delivery marketplace. And like all digitally native companies, they've adopted Slack as their digital headquarters with 11,000 monthly active users. This quarter, they expanded with Marketing Cloud to engage with their customers, their restaurant partners and their delivery carriers. We also saw Commerce Cloud wins at Ralph Lauren, Bose, Sonos, continuing this trend towards digital commerce that accelerated so rapidly in the pandemic. Together, Marketing and Commerce grew 20% year-over-year in the quarter. Both Tableau and MuleSoft continue to be the data foundation for our multi-cloud Customer 360 deployments. Tableau had strong wins in the quarter with Southwest Airlines, IBM and Sunrun. MuleSoft was also a part of some of our largest deals in the quarter, including Bose, Deloitte and Ford. Together, our Tableau and MuleSoft data business accelerated to 23.5% year-over-year growth in the quarter. And I'm happy to say that Slack continues to exceed our expectations in every way as every company in the world build the digital headquarters for this next generation of work that Marc was just talking about. With key wins at companies like Carvana and Netflix, the number of customers spending $100,000 annually with Slack increased by 46% year-over-year. Marc and I could not be more pleased with how the Slack integration is going, and that remains our top priority as a management team. That's why, as we said at our Investor Day, we don't have any plans for material M&A in the near term. Slack is our focus. It's been so great to hear Slack come up in almost every one of those hundreds of customer conversations I had this quarter. PayPal is a great example from the quarter. We've had a long relationship with Dan Schulman in the PayPal team. He use Customer 360 across both their B2B and their B2C businesses. This quarter, PayPal expanded their use of Slack, using new capabilities like Slack Huddles where thousands of real-time audio calls every week, and Slack Chatbots to respond to employee questions, log IT tickets and more. This digital transformation acceleration is happening in every industry, and you can see it in the momentum of our industry clouds. These are our purpose-built solutions for financial services, health care, consumer goods, energy and 8 other industries. We saw unprecedented growth across our industry solutions, and our most strategic multi-cloud deals were driven by our industry-specific products. GEICO is a great example. GEICO is the second largest auto insurer in the U.S. with over 25,000 agents, led by an incredible CEO in Todd Combs. Our professional services team is working with GEICO to deliver a digital-first customer experience with our Financial Services Cloud. And it's improving their customer experience and saving the company millions in costs at the same time. We saw strong growth in all segments, including meaningful acceleration in our largest transformational deals as well as our lower end transactional deals and Slack self-service business. These transactional businesses are the closest thing we have to a real-time economic barometer. And right now, all the indicators are positive. And perhaps most importantly, this quarter, we saw the lowest customer attrition in our company's history despite all the disruption in the economy. Overall, it was an extraordinary quarter, and we're seeing incredible momentum in the business. As Marc said, as a leadership team, we've never been more aligned, and we're executing better than we've ever have. I'm enormously proud of our entire team. I'm grateful to the support of our customers, our partners and all of our stakeholders as we continue to deliver incredible growth at scale quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.  And over to you, Gavin. Gavin Patterson : Thanks, Bret. I would echo Marc and Bret on just how many remarkable customer success stories we saw in the quarter across all our full portfolio of products, industries and geographies. The dynamics we're seeing in customer engagement are absolutely fantastic. Just over the past few months, I've done more than 75 meetings with C-Suite executives, and the accessibility, that sense of urgency and interest from the highest levels of companies is incredible and shows no signs of slowing down. What's clear is there is a tremendous appetite for digital transformation, and we fully expect that to continue. In the Americas, we grew relationships with Accenture, Banco C6, Scotiabank State Farm, the State of Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Bank, Zoom and so many more. In EMEA, we continue to deepen our relationships with Airbus, CloudFactory and AlphaSights. And in APAC, we had significant wins with incredible organizations like Bank of Philippines, Panasonic Corporation and Hitachi. Health care also stood out with wins like Humana, IQVIA, Cecelia Health and Teladoc Health. Moderna is another one in that category. Their intent on becoming the first fully digital biotech company, embedding analytics, AI and automation across every step of their value chain. We are a key partner on that journey. With Health Cloud, Moderna will gain a more complete view of its customers. And with Einstein and Tableau CRM, they will be able to analyze data across all departments and use predictive analytics to make better decisions. And we continue to build our relationship with Sanofi where the CEO, Paul Hudson, and his team are already using Health Cloud and Service Cloud. In Q4, they added Consumer Goods Cloud Tableau CRM and Salesforce B2B Commerce, which will let them better engage with health care providers, patients and pharmacies around the world. This is another great example of our complete Customer 360 portfolio at work. We also grew our partnership with Mercedes-Benz in the quarter. They're using Salesforce to transform the way they engage with their customers. And as Mercedes becomes even more sustainable and reimagines their fleet for the electric future, they're relying on Customer 360 to unite their sales, service and marketing teams around a single shared view of each customer. Ralph Lauren is another great expansion. And I'm not just saying that because the CEO of Patrice Louvet, was my former boss at P&G. We're helping Ralph Lauren deepen its connection with its customers in both digital and physical setting, particularly as they expand into new regions. In fact, Commerce Cloud is helping grow their North American online sales by over 30% in the December quarter. And throughout the pandemic, Ralph Lauren has relied on Slack to keep their geographically distributed teams working together seamlessly from anywhere. 18 months ago, Australia's state of Victoria Department of Health selected Salesforce to deploy a COVID-19 contact tracing system. In Q4, Victoria tapped Salesforce to provide a technology foundation for managing the state's COVID response efforts. For example, Victoria is using MuleSoft to integrate information from various systems, detecting COVID cases as the virus moves between outbreaks and steady-state living, and has also deployed Marketing Cloud to enhance communications with citizens affected by the pandemic. These are just some of the highlights from an amazing quarter of customer success from anywhere. We are proud to have supported these and so many other companies and are grateful to all our customers for their continued trust. And as Marc and Bret said, our customers' success drives our financial success. I'm really grateful to be part of this management team, which I think has never been stronger or more aligned or even more committed to generating disciplined profitable growth at scale. Also, I want to thank our team for their outstanding execution for continuing to do such a great job in the midst of a massive global change. Amy, over to you to share the financial details of our quarter. Amy Weaver : Thank you, Gavin, and hello to everyone on the line. Fiscal '22 was a remarkable year for Salesforce. Our focus on disciplined and profitable growth drove record levels of revenue, margin and cash flow. So let me take you through some of the results for Q4 and full year fiscal '22, beginning with the top line commentary. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.33 billion, which includes $312 million from Slack. This is up 26% year-over-year or 27% in constant currency. We continue to execute upon the robust demand environment that we highlighted throughout fiscal '22. For the full year, total revenue was $26.5 billion, which is up 25% year-over-year or 24% in constant currency. Full year revenue includes $592 million from the 2 quarters of Slack. Our portfolio of relevant products serving a broad set of customers and customer needs continues to drive our business performance. A few key highlights from the quarter. As you've heard from Marc and Bret and Gavin, our core business continues to perform very, very well. Sales Cloud and Service Cloud are both $6 billion businesses. And in Q4, they grew 17% and 18% year-over-year, respectively. Our progress in the enterprise continues with our largest deals getting even larger. The number of 7-figure deals signed in Q4 grew 34% year-over-year. And in Q4, the number of 8-figure deals more than doubled. Our industry products also continued to perform very well. In fact, our largest deal ever, as measured by incremental ARR, was a financial services win that we signed during the quarter, and 8 of our top 10 deals included in industries product. I also want to provide an update on MuleSoft, which grew 24% year-over-year during Q4. We continue to realize the benefits of the go-to-market organizational changes we implemented last year. We're happy with the progress. However, we do not anticipate seeing the full benefit of these changes until the back half of fiscal '23. Last quarter, during Q3, we drove attrition -- our attrition rate to below 8% for the first time in company history. Now for the second quarter in a row, our attrition is again at an all-time low. Ending Q4 revenue attrition was between 7% to 7.5%. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q4 at approximately $43.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $22 billion, up 22% year-over-year and 24% in constant currency. The outperformance was driven by new business outperformance and strong renewals. Slack represents approximately 4.5 points of CRPO growth, slightly ahead of the 4 points provided during last quarter's guidance. Turning to operating margin. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 18.7%, which represents approximately 100 basis points of improvement year-over-year. As a reminder, this includes 140 basis points of headwind from M&A. I'm very proud that our team drove strong margin expansion while also absorbing our largest acquisition ever. Q4 GAAP EPS was negative $0.03, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.84. Realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio benefited both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.03. For the full fiscal year, GAAP EPS was $1.48 and non-GAAP EPS was $4.78. Realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.93 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.98. Turning to cash flow. I was particularly pleased with how we closed the year, completing a milestone year of cash generation. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow was $6 billion, up 25% year-over-year. CapEx was $717 million, resulting in free cash flow of $5.3 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Recent M&A represented a 2-point headwind to both our operating and free cash flows. Excluding the impact of M&A, our full year operating cash flow growth rate was 27%, and our free cash flow growth rate was 31%. Now on to guidance. We are raising our Q1 revenue guidance by $130 million to $7.37 billion to $7.38 billion or approximately 24% growth year-over-year, and that is coming off a historically strong Q1 last year. This guidance assumes a $330 million contribution from Slack. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '23 revenue guidance by $300 million to $32 billion to $32.1 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. Our guidance assumes a $1.5 billion contribution from Slack. In addition, last week, we announced our acquisition of Traction on Demand, a professional services business. Our revenue guidance assumes a $75 million contribution in [fiscal '23] from Traction on Demand, which we anticipate will close by the end of this fiscal quarter. Please note that the deals remain subject to customary closing conditions. Foreign currency has continued to be highly, highly volatile. To give you a sense of the impact on our business, our fiscal '23 revenue guidance reflects a year-over-year headwind of approximately $300 million from FX. For Q1, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 21%. This includes roughly 5 points of growth from Slack. We expect Q1 GAAP EPS of negative $0.05 to negative $0.04 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.93 to $0.94. For the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.48 and non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.62 to $4.64. As a reminder, please keep in mind that our other income and expense, or OEI guidance incorporates the impact from debt raised for Slack. Please also recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no contribution from mark-to-market accounting. We are also reiterating our fiscal '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 20%, representing an expansion of 130 basis points year-over-year. We expect 100 to 125 basis points of headwind from M&A. This disciplined approach will drive another year of strong cash flow generation. We are initiating fiscal '23 operating cash flow guidance of approximately 21% to 22% year-over-year. We do not expect an OCF headwind from Slack for the full year. In addition, our guidance currently assumes a 3-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs. As we continue to scale our operations, I am particularly pleased with our CapEx guide for this year. We expect CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue in fiscal '23, which is an all-time low for the business. This results in anticipated free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 26% for the fiscal year. To close, we believe that our portfolio of differentiated and relevant technology is well positioned in a large and rapidly growing market. Fiscal '22 was an extraordinary year for the company as we drove record levels of revenue and operating margin and cash flow. This demonstrates that with discipline, we can achieve profitable growth at scale. I am very thankful for the opportunity over my first year to meet so many members of our shareholder community, both in person and virtually, and I look forward to meeting many more of you over the coming years. Now Evan, shall we open up the call for questions? And Bo, you can go ahead and open up the line. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We go first this afternoon to Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Congratulations on a great quarter and also really heartfelt beginning remarks. Maybe just to start, if you think about the environment that you're in right now, you had a bigger beat on CRPO, you guided more even better than people, I think, anticipated for Q1. You raised the full year by more. Are you seeing -- or can you comment there were some reports of pull forwards of demand for front office applications? Can you just set the stage and maybe just gives us some context around what you saw in Q4 and kind of as you come out of the pandemic, the strength of pipeline, the demand environment, and your ability to execute on that demand? Marc Benioff : I really appreciate the question, and it's a question that I've heard quite a bit in the last quarter, especially because the numbers that we're putting up are really unprecedented. In many cases, I've never seen them in the software industry. For 40 years, I've never seen numbers like this, put up like this, at rates like this, and I think because of that, these questions are actually quite reasonable. But the reality is, over the last 2 years, what we have seen has been incredible demand. And really, that demand is really linked to the digital transformations that our clients are going through. Our customers -- it doesn't really matter by geography or by industry -- are very deeply committed to their digital transformations of their businesses. I think that if the pandemic put a light on anything for them, it was that their businesses were not going to have a future if they did not go through a digital transformation, and that these digital transformations, as I said in my comments, were going to begin and end with the customer. I mean I think that the Ralph Lauren story is a great story because it's a digital transformation like we've seen with many retailers, okay? But of course, they have to go through this and not just stop what they've done. There's -- we're just at the beginning with that client, and with so many clients and our product line has not become more narrow, it's become more broad. And I think our acquisition strategy that has been executed, I believe, really well in the past few years really has expanded our total addressable market so significantly that when you look into these clients, these Chief Information Officers and really the Chief Executive Officers who I primarily work with every day, they see us so strategic to the future of their fundamental businesses. That is why our relationships with them have become just paramount for our company. You can't compare it to where we were 10 years ago or 15 years ago or, of course, when we started.  But today, this relationship is that these CEOs are very much the transformational -- digital transformation officers. I'm not telling you anything you don't know. This is the most important thing that they can do every day. And this is really very much to the core of who we have become in our company that we can show up with our products and services and say to a great company -- and we've told the stories this year of the AT&Ts, for example, or the Sonos\u2019, we were talking about, on this call, so many amazing customers. But without us, they would not have the growth rates that they have had. And it's -- our growth rates are just a reflection on theirs, but by no means in any of these customers, have we completed our work. In many cases, we're in the 10% or 20% or 30% growth areas where we're just at beginning of what we can do with these customers. So that's what I'm very excited about, and we've really cracked the code on building a relationship, an emotion with them. And I'd really like Bret to come in because I think, especially with the extension with Slack. Again, Tableau also really transformed. I was with a -- recently, I was actually in the White House with a Fortune 100 CEO and turned to me and said, \u201cI start every day with Slack.\u201d And this is not a customer that we have even a big Salesforce footprint. And I just said to myself, these acquisitions, they've just opened so many doors for us and transformed who we are and the conversation that we can have.  All right, Bret, can you just continue this narrative? Bret Taylor : Yes. I mean, as Marc said, I think what really characterized this quarter, particularly in Q4, as you know, we have -- it's our largest quarter, a lot of really big transformational deals. We call them multi-cloud deals. That's exactly as Marc characterized it. It's a real trusted digital advisor relationship where we're helping solve the problems most fundamental to the executive teams of our customers, and it's not something that's related to the pandemic. It's related to the systemic digitization of the economy. And that's something that we think is a secular trend and that is absolutely enduring, and we see it in the demand environment. As Marc said, Slack continues to exceed our expectations, and I think it is benefiting not only from the trend towards this new way of working that we're all figuring out right here in Salesforce Tower, it's also benefiting being a part of our Customer 360 portfolio. And you heard it in the customer stories, and it's why Slack's Q4 revenue was $312 million, well ahead of our guidance of $285 million. We're really seeing the synergies both in our value proposition from our product, but also our distribution environment as well. And to answer one of your other questions, we're seeing strong pipeline going into Q1. And we feel that, as I mentioned, across both our transactional business and large deals, pipelines remain very strong, and we don't see any demand pull forward. Marc Benioff : And this quarter, especially, we were really shocked with adjusted cap accelerating through the quarter. And I really think we don't talk about create and close and -- but this idea that we're creating and closing these opportunities in the quarter themselves, very much the momentum aspect of the total market, I mean how do you see the current rate of growth in the market itself as reflected by our total product and geographic or vertical portfolio? Bret Taylor : Well, I think the thing that's been the most, I'll say, pleasant surprise was despite inflation, the crisis in the supply chain, the conflict in Europe. Our customers, this is the problems that we solve for our customers are as urgent as ever. And as you mentioned, our Customer 360 portfolio, which since you and Parker started this company 23 years ago, it's not just sales opportunity management anymore. It's really every aspect of the customer experience. And it means that we're starting conversations in every department of every single one of our customers and have the opportunity to expand really \u2013 Marc Benioff : If they don't digitize, they're not going to grow. Bret Taylor : Exactly. Marc Benioff : If they don't implement these products, they're not going to grow. I think that I\u2019ve also had a debate with so many of these CEOs, well, everybody is coming back. No, they're not. Well, everything is going back to the way it was. No, it's not. And I think now, even some of those the CEOs took these really hard positions. They're like, okay, we're going to have a flexible work environment. And Slack is obviously right there in the middle of that motion. Bret Taylor : And it's in the middle of it for every single one of our customer conversations, which is why it's, I think, 1 of the most exciting acquisitions we've ever done. Marc Benioff : And it was critical that we did that at that time because it's kind of setting up the future of work combined with the #1 CRM. Bret Taylor : Absolutely. Marc Benioff : Okay. All right. Thank you for the question. Operator : We go next now to Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Congratulations on a really nice end to FY '22, and really given us a lot of confidence on the durability of growth with that FY '23 guide. I had a question for Amy on the margin side of the equation. Bret talked to us about sort of the near-term pause on M&A as you guys focus on integrating Slack. But at some point, Salesforce is going to come back to doing larger M&A as you should. It should be a strategic tool that you guys use on a go-forward basis. With Slack, you guys have been able to still grow operating margins despite digesting a big acquisition. Is this something you think you could do going forward when you do additional large M&A? Is Salesforce now at the scale and you guys have the efficiency muscle toned enough to be able to do large M&A and still get this 125, 150 basis point margin expansion year after year? Amy Weaver : Great. Keith, thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So I appreciate the questions and the focus on operating margin. I'm really proud of what the company has done over last year and looking into this year. As you know, last year, we were able to expand 100 basis points even in the face of what was significantly -- by significant measure, our largest acquisition. And this year, we intend to raise another 130 basis points while continuing to have some headwinds. In terms of the future, as Bret said, large strategic M&A is just something we are not focused on in the near term. We're really focused on Slack and making Slack as successful as possible for all of our shareholders and for this company. In terms of what we can do in the future, I certainly think that we have learned a lot about how we integrate companies and what we can do in terms of the op margin pressures on that. And certainly, it would be a goal to learn -- to get us to the point where we would not have to take on any sort of degradation of our margin through M&A. Operator : We take our next question now from Phil Winslow at Credit Suisse. PhilWinslow: Congrats on a great end to the year. Bret, you said that Salesforce is becoming more strategic to the C-Suite just for their broadening footprint. So my question is -- and Marc, too, and even Gavin, when you talk to customers, what are they saying to you about, call it, not only the breadth of the CRM portfolio, but also now the depth of the vertical tech stack when choosing Salesforce versus, let's say, point vendors, especially kind of considering the upside we saw in Slack this quarter? Bret Taylor : Well, I'll start and maybe pass it over to you, Gavin, to talk to some of the conversations you're having with customers. Fundamentally, we talk about our strategy at Customer 360, and that's really the end-to-end customer experience across sales, customer service, digital marketing, digital commerce and the foundations and the platforms you need to power that, in MuleSoft and Tableau and Slack.  And I think when we talk to the C-Suite, I think when we talk about customer wins like Ford and GEICO and Mercedes-Benz and PayPal, they're really trying to solve for that end-to-end digital customer experience. And point solutions don't get them there. Point solutions mean, essentially, their IT department becomes software development shops. What they want is to digitize their customer experience. They want to do it quickly, and they want to do it fast time to value and high return on investment.  And I think because of the completeness of our portfolio, we're really the only software company that can provide that experience to our customers. And I think that, that's really our differentiation is that we come with the complete Customer 360 portfolio rather than just a point solution. And I think that's led to not only our ability to compete in new accounts, which was a meaningful part of our growth this past year, but also, as Marc mentioned, as we're expanding our relationships with our customers, they know that they can trust us to really truly build a single source of truth and actually achieve the business objectives and the growth formula that you need in this new economy. Gavin, do you want to provide some color on that? Gavin Patterson : Well, I' probably say 2 or 3 points, Bret. I mean, first and foremost, digital transformation has become a CEO priority. I mean this is one of the changes over the last 2 or 3 years. It's no longer delegated into the IT Department. It's a top 3 priority for the CEO, because they realize and we've talked about it already in the call, without a digital strategy, they don't have a strategy at all. So they have to own it. So it is a conversation that we tried is at the top of the house. I think when it comes to the Customer 360 and building on Bret's comment, what we often find is what they like about our Customer 360 is they'll start maybe with Sales Cloud and then at Service, at Analytics, at Commerce. And so they're building it as they go along. So they might not necessarily buy all of it to start with, but they know we've got a solution for them as they expand and want to get more of a complete view of their customers. And the example I gave at Sanofi is a great example of this. We started with Health Cloud and Service Cloud and then added Consumer Goods Cloud, Tableau CRM, B2B Commerce and filled out the cloud as they went through the last 12, 18 months. And then I think the final thing I'd say is industries is -- and the verticalization of our business is a theme that's been growing over the last few years. I mean it started a few years ago now, but -- and nothing we started with financial services, we've added Health Cloud, consumer goods, as I mentioned earlier, retail. The list goes on. And why do customers and why do CEOs like this? Well, they buy a product that has a lot of the standard functionality that you need within an industry already built in. And what that means is they pay a little bit more for that. It's a little bit more expensive. But in return, they get a product that's got faster time to value, and that is the key thing that CEOs are looking for. How do I get a return quickly? I want to return in months, not years. And that's what many of our industry cloud provide out of the box. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question this afternoon. We'll take that question now from Tyler Radke at Citi. Tyler Radke : Marc, I wanted to get your take on the valuation out there in the software market, obviously come in quite a bit since the last call. Just how are you thinking about that as you approach M&A? And obviously, with valuations having come down so much, does that change kind of your philosophy or framework on how you're approaching M&A given higher IRR and kind of the math? Marc Benioff : Well, we've certainly seen the software industry contract, and I think it's probably best reflected by that ETF. I watch it very closely, IGV. And I think that when you look at it overall, kind of that precipitous fall, which we've seen happen over many times in the last 20 or 30 years, it's not unprecedented, but it does happen, and that's where we are right now. In regards to the change in the M&A environment for us, we continue to look at tactical M&A. But really, since we made a major decision now more than a year ago to acquire Slack, it became our most strategic initiative in the company. And it's going to take us quite a long time to be able to digest this acquisition. We also obviously still have other parts of our portfolio that we have our eye on and that are requiring a lot of our focus and making sure that our entire portfolio is working for our investors. So I don't really see us doing any kind of strategic acquisition for some time until we can get our hands fully around Slack and say that we've done a great job.  Bret, what is your perspective on that? Bret Taylor : Yes. And I think you articulate it well, Marc. We -- right now, we -- our focus was on integrating Slack and executing with the portfolio that we have. And I don't see any material M&A in the near term. Marc Benioff : I think that really, the key point for us on how we're looking at managing our business and providing value back to you, our investors, is we are delivering a portfolio of product. We're not an ETF by any means, but we are a selection of some of the most important products in the software industry. Even our service product, if you look at it as an absolute business, is probably the largest service product in the industry. It has a tremendous growth rate. It has a tremendous leadership position. Analysts rank it and look at it uniquely. We pay a lot of attention to it. So as we manage our portfolio here at Salesforce, we look at service as a part of that. And we're focused on making sure that that is the most innovative, highest level of customer success it can have. And also, it's transformed many times since we've introduced it, not so unlike our Sales product, not so unlike what we've done with our Commerce product where we've completely written it and now operates as a platform, as a kind of what we call a headless commerce or an API architecture. Slack now is part of our portfolio. Tableau is part of our portfolio. MuleSoft is part of our portfolio.  And many of our -- these exciting new vertical opportunities. We saw a lot of excitement and interest around our sustainability cloud this quarter. A lot of customers realizing they need to go net zero now, and they're going to have to do carbon accounting. They're going to have to do -- their kind of carbon reporting and certification. And we're looking at net zero cloud or safety cloud as well as growth capabilities for us. And each one of these components in our portfolio, Brett and I go through piece by piece to make sure it's working. And of course, the geographies, each geography is an important part of the portfolio. I'll tell you kind of a part of on the side, one of the areas where I've spent a lot of time in making sure we're highly competitive and successful was Japan, but I haven't been able to go to Japan in a couple of years. So now it's kind of -- the pandemic is kind of coming to a close. I'm looking forward to getting back over there. It's very important to me to get over there. I haven't really been able to work on many parts of the -- our Japanese business, our CEO over there has done a fantastic job Koide-San. He's amazing. He has a brand-new office. My close friend Yoshiki was at our office. I was very jealous. I haven't even been to our new office, which is on the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Japan, the largest office building there given to an American software company. We're very proud of that fact. And I don't know, Brad, how do you look at this part of our business today? Bret Taylor : I think it's a great way to wrap up the call, Marc. I think the strength of the portfolio is really the theme. I think one of the things that stood out to me in the performance is the strength of our core businesses. As you said, our core sales and service business, I think it's appropriate coming up on our 23rd birthday that Sales Cloud 23 years later continues to grow at 17% and is over $6 billion in -- Marc Benioff : It's kind of amazing. It's -- really, it's unprecedented in the software industry that you'd see something after 2 decades deliver such kind of a growth rate. Bret Taylor : It is. And I bet there's a few analysts on the call who's been covering you and this company ever since, and I doubt any of them imagining -- Marc Benioff : We've all got the TAM wrong. Bret Taylor : We all got the -- Marc Benioff : Not just them. I'm right in there. I couldn't -- I can't I believe it. It's doing -- it's $6 billion on its way to -- I don't know, 10. I have no idea what it's going to. It's unbelievable. Bret Taylor : And I think the strength of our portfolio is the reason why we're committed to this path, why we're not pursuing material M&A in the near term. And I think it really reflects the execution of Gavin's team and really the whole company -- Marc Benioff : And we have such a rich and deep portfolio in so many -- Bret Taylor : Exactly. Marc Benioff : I agree. Amy, anything you want to say before we wrap this up? Amy Weaver : No, I think this was terrific. Again, what I was most pleased about, about last year and where we're driving this year is just top performance on top line, bottom line and cash flow and being able to show that we can do all 3 and continue this with a discipline, just sets up -- sets us up for the rest of the year. Marc Benioff : Gavin, anything you'd like to comment on before we wrap the call up today? Gavin Patterson : Just to say, look, it was an outstanding year, and we kept it off with an outstanding quarter, but there is no sign of it slowing down as we enter this fiscal. We're very confident to the year ahead. The pipeline is really strong across all geographies, across all products, and that's why we're raising our guidance. So we're entering this year with a very high degree of conviction. Marc Benioff : Well, I think that, that's well said. And I'll tell you, we spend a lot of time with our investors. I know that I do, and I know we spent a lot -- a lot of them are portfolio managers. They're running a full portfolio, which is how they're trying to get a return on their investment. And the more time I've spent with them, I think they've influenced me and how I run our business here. And I think we're very much at that same perspective, and we want to deliver an outstanding return to our investors as well. Thank you so much for everything. And our hearts and our thoughts and prayers are with all those right now who are going through these troubled times. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That will conclude today's Salesforce's Fiscal 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. Thank you all for joining, and wish you all a great remainder of your day. Goodbye.",

    "content": "\ufeff Evan Goldstein : Thank you, Emma. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2023 first quarter results conference call. I'm Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor.

Before I hand the call over to Marc, I'm excited to welcome Mike Spencer to Salesforce. As many of you know, I will be taking on a new role here at Salesforce, supporting strategic planning in our product organization, and Mike has joined Salesforce to lead Investor Relations. Mike is familiar to many of you as he previously led Investor Relations at Microsoft. Thank you, Marc, Bret, Amy, Gavin for allowing meaningful rotations that enable career development. It is one of the many benefits of working at Salesforce. And thank you to the investment community for welcoming me over 2 years ago. Leading IR has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my career. And with that, let me hand the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Well, hey. Thanks so much, Evan, and congratulations on your promotion. It's so well deserved. You've done a phenomenal job in the last 2 years, and we're also thrilled for you. And thank you for agreeing to take on this incredible new role at Salesforce and leading these teams, and we could not be more excited for you. And we cannot be more excited to welcome Mike Spencer to Salesforce. I know that many of the folks on this call have worked with Mike before, should be a familiar voice and friend and I'm looking forward to working closely with Mike. And Mike is going to be based out of our Atlanta headquarters, and really excited about that because our new Chief Information Officer is there, as well as a number of other incredible new executives from Salesforce, including our new Chief Accounting Officer and our Chief Commercial Officer. So really a cool thing to see Atlanta in our kind of post-pandemic reality become such a center of gravity for Salesforce. In fact, we just had our Q1 operations review there, and it was exciting to welcome Mike to the team. So with that, let me just tell you, it's been a whirlwind for our management team, as you're about to hear on this call. We have been on the road. I personally was just in Sydney, Australia. I was in Tokyo. We were in Atlanta. We were in New York. And last week, we were in Davos, Switzerland. All that was in, I think, the last 4 or 5 weeks. And we've really been all over the world. It's been pretty awesome. We've met with hundreds and hundreds of customers. And I can tell you that our business -- you can see this in the Q1 numbers, can't you, is incredibly healthy. And we also -- you can see we had a great quarter. We're carefully watching the economic data. I know all of you are doing that as well. And so far, we're just not seeing any material impact from the broader economic world that all of you are in. Our demand environment where demand is very strong, and if you look over the last 23 years, Salesforce has proven to be incredibly resilient based on this incredible business model. We have an incredible technology model that we have, where we've been through all kinds of dot-com crashes and recessions and financial crises and global pandemics and all of you have watched us go through every possible storm, but we continue to weather these storms through the power and strength of our model. In 2001, I think it really impacted us. We almost lost our business because we were -- on monthly contracts, we didn't have the right cash flow structure, investors just wouldn't give us any money, and so we made a lot of changes then, and it's really strengthened our business and made us more durable over time. There's now no better measure of our durability of the business model, the momentum of the business, the strength of the technology model, than our remaining performance obligation, the future revenue that we have in our contract. In Q1, we had $42 billion in RPO, up 20% year-over-year, pretty amazing. And in every crisis we've experienced over nearly 1/4 of a century, well, I'll just tell you, I think that Salesforce -- and I'm sure you all agree, always emerges stronger than ever. We became more strategic and more relevant to our customers because we focus on their success and that continues today. And that's why we've been able to grow our revenue for 72 consecutive quarters through every cycle, a focus on customer success, and it's why Salesforce remains the #1 in CRM now for the 9th year in a row, growing in share in all CRM segments yet again according to the IDC\u2019s Software Tracker. When it comes to our financial results, we had, as you can see, a very strong quarter. And you can also know that the dollar, well, I think the dollar might have even had a stronger quarter than we did, which is kind of amazing. And I certainly saw that in my travels over the last month. And although these kind of fluctuations in foreign currency markets and an unexpected impact in the quarter, we still delivered $7.4 billion in revenue, up 24% year-over-year. Foreign exchange movements have resulted in a revenue headwind of about $109 million year-over-year, something we could not have anticipated. Operating cash flow though, in the quarter, well, here it is, $3.7 billion up 14% year-over-year, reflecting very strong performance across the core business and operating margin in the quarter, well that was 17.6%. Turning to our revenue guidance. Well, as I mentioned, the presented foreign exchange volatility. It increased the year-over-year headwinds by an additional $300 million for a total of $600 million for the year since we first gave you guidance in our Investor Day. To give you an example, I was in Japan for the first time since the dynamic a couple of weeks ago, I mean it was 2 weeks ago. And I couldn't believe the decline in the value of the end. It was a very good time to be a tourist in Japan. But I called our team, I said, -- this is great to be a tourist in Japan, but it's going to have implications as we roll this revenue up from the Japanese market to our U.S. dollars. And in fact, our Japan revenue in the fourth quarter faced a 12% headwind year-over-year, just the end historic fall, something I've just never seen. So as a result of these headwinds, we're lowering our fiscal '23 revenue guidance by $300 million to $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion or about 20% growth year-over-year. For operating margin, we're raising our fiscal '23 non-GAAP guidance by 40 basis points to 20.4%, an expansion of 170 basis points year-over-year. As all of you know, we're quite committed to consistent margin and cash flow growth as part of this long-term plan and model that we have to drive both top and bottom line performance. And as I said, this demand environment for our Customer 360 platform, as you're about to hear from Bret and from Gavin and from Amy and from others as well, it remains incredibly healthy.  Our customer relationships are amazingly strong, as evidenced by these hundreds of customers that we've met with just in the last couple of weeks. And I'll tell you, as you hear some of these incredible stories from the quarter, companies like State Farm and F1 and Goodyear and even the Department of Commerce, well, I'll tell you, these customers, they're very excited to be able to get not only incredible productivity from our product but also growth as well. So let me say that this is a time when every company, every industry, every government is investing in digital transformation, no company is better positioned than we are to help companies transform for the digital future. That was something we fully experienced in Davos last week, and I could not be more grateful to our 77,000 ohana, millions of trailblazers who are making a difference for our customers and the world.  And now over to Bret. Bret Taylor : Thanks, Marc. As Marc said, we had a great quarter, and we see strong demand across our clouds, our industries and our regions despite the unprecedented foreign exchange headwinds, and our results really demonstrate the power of our strategy. Our products are more relevant than ever before, as companies invest in our Customer 360 platform to connect with their customers and to drive cost savings in this new digital economy. Our technology is deeply differentiated, with our Hyperforce infrastructure and Einstein artificial intelligence, enabling our customers to reach global scale with levels of trust that are unmatched in the industry. Einstein is now doing 164 billion predictions per day, which is just incredible. Our ecosystem is unparalleled. We have over 15 million trailblazers, creating what IDC estimates will be $1.6 trillion in economic impact for our customers and for our partners. And our business model, as Marc said, is durable. It's diversified across industries, regions, lines of business, ensuring we're resilient in the face of any economic cycle.  And finally, our leadership team continues to focus on disciplined execution, which is driving both top line performance and sustained operating margin cash flow expansion.  As Marc said, we've all been on the road, and we've been reconnecting with our customers, our trailblazers and our partners. And the common theme from the customers I have met with, from Singapore to New York to the 30 CEOs I met one-on-one at Davos last week, is this digital transformation trend that dramatically accelerated during the pandemic, they continue full steam ahead, despite all the volatility in the global economy. One great example is ADT, the leader in home alarm systems. ADT used our Service Cloud to execute over 200,000 virtual service visits in its first quarter. As a result, the company avoided sending out technicians and trucks in 80% of its service cases. They lowered their costs and they lowered their carbon footprint, all while achieving higher customer satisfaction. This is the promise of technology, to drive productivity. And our Customer 360 platform is relevant whether you're trying to scale growth, increase productivity and profitability or meet your sustainability goals. And all 3 are increasingly relevant to our customers across the globe. We had strong year-over-year growth across every region in the quarter, 21% in the Americas, 33% in EMEA and 24% in APAC. We saw strong momentum across every cloud in our Customer 360 platform as well. Sales Cloud continues to accelerate, surpassing $1.6 billion in the quarter, growing 18% year-over-year with great wins like DoorDash and Stellantis. Stellantis, which was formed last year from the merger between Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, decided to standardize the entire company on Salesforce. They replaced more than 2,500 apps with Customer 360. And with Sales Cloud, they now have a single source of truth for all their customer engagement to drive growth, while delivering best-in-class personalized service. Our Service Cloud grew at 17% year-over-year to $1.76 billion in revenue in the quarter. State Farm, a long time Salesforce customer, was a great Service Cloud success story this quarter. They're now combining our Field Service platform with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Financial Services Cloud to enhance their entire end-to-end customer support experience, especially during catastrophic events. We also continue to see strong momentum with our Marketing Cloud with customers like Bose and Colgate Palmolive. Our Marketing Cloud has become even more relevant to CMOs as they navigate the significant changes in mobile operating systems and new privacy regulations around the globe. This is the new cookie-less world, and it's made growing and measuring consumer engagement harder than ever before, and it's driving investment in our Customer Data Platform, which has become one of the fastest-growing products we've ever released. Bose is using our CDP to unify their customer information from hundreds of different sources to drive hyper personalized marketing, multichannel campaign management and real-time engagement, all with compliance and trust built in natively. We also saw Commerce Cloud wins at YETI, L'Occitane and Goodyear, continuing the digital commerce trend that accelerated so rapidly in the pandemic. Together, Marketing and Commerce stood 22% year-over-year in the quarter. Our data clouds, including MuleSoft and Tableau, grew 15% year-over-year in the quarter. Data is the fuel for every digital interaction, and MuleSoft and Tableau continue to be foundational for every multi-cloud Customer 360 deal. Tableau wins in the quarter included ADT, Bose and Lookers Motor Group, a top auto retailer in the UK MuleSoft was also part of some of our largest deals in the quarter, including NTT and continues to deepen our relationships with existing customers like Rocket Mortgage. As you know, we've been working through some issues on MuleSoft's go-to-market motion over the past couple of quarters. Amy will get into specifics, but I'm encouraged by the progress we're making, and we have a strong pipeline for the back half of the year. I'm also excited to say that Slack continues to exceed our revenue expectations, with wins of the self-driving car company, Cruise and the UK Ministry of Justice. This was the fourth consecutive quarter we see more than 40% growth in customers spending more than $100,000 with Slack annually. We also continue to see strong momentum across our 12 industry verticals, including financial services, health care, consumer goods and manufacturing. Our industry-specific clouds were part of 7 of our top 10 deals this quarter. I'm so grateful for our 15 million trailblazers, all of our partners and our 77,000 employees for helping provide our customers with the innovation, agility and resilience they need to navigate these uncertain times. Our customer success drives our financial success, and this unrivaled community is why our customers choose Salesforce as their trusted digital advisor.  Now over to Gavin to talk about some of the customer success stories from the quarter. Gavin Patterson : Thanks, Bret, and thank you, everyone, for being on the call today. I want to start by talking about the strong demand environment we're in. As Bret and Marc said, even in this volatile environment, companies are continuing to invest in their digital transformations, and we're seeing that in our strong pipeline and momentum in the business. I've been on the road this quarter across the U.S., Europe, Asia and most recently in Davos. And in all my conversations, there is a real sense of urgency with our customers. In this new or digital work-from-anywhere world, our customers need to create incredible customer experiences across every interaction to stay competitive. And at the same time, they need to realize productivity gains, efficiencies and resilience from their technology investments. That's why they're turning to Salesforce as their trusted digital advisors and to the Customer 360 as their digital platform. We're seeing this play out in the growth of transformational deals, customers making longer-term multi-cloud investments in Salesforce. These Customer 360 transformation deals with 5 or more clouds grew 21% year-over-year in the quarter. We again saw strong growth in every region. In the Americas, we grew relationships with Brightspeed, Blue Shield of California, [SHA Hotels], Workday, Covered California and Ferguson, a $23 billion distributor of plumbing and heating products. Looking at Ferguson a little more detail, Ferguson has been able to grow its sales during the heart of the supply chain challenges using Customer 360 to give them a single view of their supplier, associate and customer relationships. And in the quarter, Ferguson significantly expanded its relationship with our professional services organization. In EMEA, we had significant wins with Lookers Motor Group, Esprit and one of the largest telecom and media companies in France. They're standardizing on Salesforce to not only speed their time to market and reduce IT costs but also to deliver an amazing digital first, front-end experience for their 45 million subscribers. As I mentioned, we had a great win in the UK with Lookers Motor Group. With the Customer 360, Lookers has a single unified platform, driving efficiency within their dealerships and contact centers and improving the overall car buying experience for their customers. Turning to APAC. We continue to deepen our relationships with amazing brands like Kotak Mahindra Bank, LG and NTT, which is also a great Tableau and MuleSoft win. In LatAm, we had a significant win with Serasa Experian. They chose Salesforce Marketing Cloud to improve engagement with our current and prospective customers and to increase marketing efficiency. Formula 1 is watched by 1.5 billion viewers. And today, they're using Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud and Sales Cloud to attract new fans, increase fan engagement and convert that fan engagement into brand value and revenue. Salesforce will help Formula 1 leverage customer insights across every channel, both physical and nonphysical and create an end-to-end fan experience strategy powered by an integrated platform, and our professional services team will help to manage their technology and implementation. In the quarter, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration within the U.S. Department of Commerce selected Salesforce to support the administration of the $48 billion from broadband grants to state territories, tribal entities and other eligible applicants to create more low-cost broadband service options and to address digital quality and inclusion needs across U.S. communities. And to wrap it up, DoorDash has grown tremendously since the pandemic. They fulfilled more than 400 million orders in the last quarter alone and as a mobile-first business growing at an incredible rate, DoorDash turned to Salesforce to improve the customer experience and to respond to issues in real time for its hundreds of thousands of merchants, customers and dashes. They also selected Sales Cloud and MuleSoft to enable them to bring in new merchants on faster and more efficiently. These are just a few examples from our strong quarter, and we're grateful for customers' continued partnership and trust. Amy, over to you to discuss the financial details of the quarter. Amy Weaver : Great. Thank you, Gavin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Marc and Bret said, we had strong financial results this quarter, and our pipeline remains robust. We are well positioned to serve our customers in this uncertain macroenvironment. Let's go through some of our results for Q1 of fiscal '23, beginning with top line commentary. Total revenue for the first quarter was $7.41 billion. This is up 24% year-over-year or 26% in constant currency.  A few key highlights from the quarter. The momentum in Sales Cloud continued in Q1, with revenue accelerating to 18% growth year-over-year, 20% in constant currency. Slack again outperformed our revenue expectations with $348 million in Q1 compared to our guide of $330 million. The number of customers spending more than $100,000 annually, grew 45% year-over-year. Our industry's products remain in high demand and are providing out-of-the-box solutions to customers with specific needs. We saw an industry's product included in 7 out of our top 10 deals this quarter. And from a geographic perspective, EMEA performance was strong with particular strength in both the UK and France. Now to provide an update on MuleSoft. Total revenue increased 9% year-over-year against a strong prior year comparison, driven by lower-than-expected new business as we work through the go-to-market organizational changes we discussed on the last call. As a reminder, on average, 50% of MuleSoft's total contract value is recognized in period, resulting in more quarterly volatility than our core products. And as Bret mentioned, MuleSoft's pipeline remains strong, and we still anticipate seeing the benefits from these changes in the back half of fiscal '23. Total company revenue attrition remains at record lows and in Q1, again, between 7% to 7.5%. And as Marc mentioned, our remaining performance obligation, representing all future revenue under contract ended Q1 at approximately $42 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, was approximately $21.5 billion, up 21% year-over-year and 24% in constant currency. Slack represented approximately 5% -- or 5 points of that growth, in line with our guidance. This strong RPO performance at our scale reflects the relevance of our product portfolio and strategic relationships with our customers. Turning to operating margin for the quarter. For Q1, non-GAAP operating margin was 17.6%. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.03 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.98. Mark-to-market accounting as the company's strategic investments benefited both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.01. Moving to cash flow. For Q1, operating cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year. CapEx was $179 million, resulting in free cash flow of $3.5 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Now before turning to our guidance, I'd like to call attention to the impact that foreign exchange is having on our financials. As a reminder, our primary currency exposures are to the euro, the Great British pound, the Japanese yen and to a lesser extent, to the Australian dollar. Since we last provided our outlook for fiscal year '23, the dollar has continued to strengthen against all of these currencies. And as such, we are providing increased transparency this quarter into the impact of FX on our guidance. Now let's get to that guidance. For the full year, the change in currencies represents an incremental $300 million year-over-year headwind on top of the $300 million we provided last quarter, bringing the total year-over-year FX headwind to $600 million. As such, we are now guiding to fiscal '23 revenue of $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion or approximately 20% growth year-over-year. Our guidance continues to assume a $1.5 billion contribution from Slack. We expect Q2 revenue of $7.69 billion to $7.7 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. Our Q2 revenue guidance includes a $200 million year-over-year headwind from FX and a $360 million contribution from Slack. For Q2, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. This includes a 3-point headwind from FX. And as a reminder, Q2 represents Slack\u2019s fifth quarter of contribution to CRPO and therefore, the year-on-year growth rate is now normalized. We expect GAAP loss per share of negative $0.03 to negative $0.02 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 to $1.02. For the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.74 to $4.76. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance both assume no further mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investment portfolio. Turning to operating margin, I am very pleased to announce that we are raising our fiscal '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance by 40 basis points to 20.4%. This includes 100 basis points to 125 basis points of headwind from M&A. This guidance increase represents an expansion of 170 basis points year-over-year and 270 basis points over 2 years, all driven by a continued focus on disciplined decision-making across the organization. And as a company, we are committed to continuing to improve profitability over the long term. With respect to FX, because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same currencies, there tends to be a natural hedge in our operating margin. As such, although we've seen FX headwinds to revenue, we don't currently anticipate a material impact to our operating margin for the full fiscal year. Moving to cash flow, we remain well on our way to drive another year of record cash flow generation, and we are reiterating our fiscal '23 operating cash flow guidance of approximately 21% to 22% growth year-over-year. In addition, our guidance continues to assume a 3-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs. We continue to expect CapEx of approximately 2% of revenue in fiscal '23, resulting in free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 27% for the fiscal year. To close, while there is uncertainty in the macroenvironment, our customers are continuing to come to Salesforce to transform their businesses. The demand we are seeing from our customers is a testament to the strength of these strategic relationships and the relevance of our product portfolio. This gives us confidence in the durability of our business model, and we're excited to help our customers navigate in this changing economy. Now before we wrap up, I do want to thank specifically Evan for his incredible leadership with the IR team over the last 2 years, his partnership and friendship and wish them all the best in his new role. And let me say officially welcome to Mike Spencer, who I'm delighted to have joining us.  And with that, Emma, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Yes. Mark [indiscernible] Amy Weaver : Hi, Mark, this is Amy. We're having a lot of trouble hearing you. Mark Murphy : Apologies [indiscernible] Bret Taylor : Operator, we may need to move on to the next question. Amy Weaver : Yes. Let's move on. Let's see if we can come back to Mark. Operator : Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Really nice quarter in Q1. Two questions. One on Sales Cloud. This is probably the part of the portfolio that investors have been most worried about maturation and sort of the high market share that Salesforce has. You guys have been able to see accelerating growth. Can you dig in a little bit on kind of what's driving it? Is it the vertical solutions or something in particular that has really reinvigorated that line item? And then one for Amy on the operating margins. I don't think anyone was expecting operating margins going up after this quarter. Can you talk to us a little bit about those initiatives that are enabling better operating margins? There's some speculation in the press about maybe slower headcount growth or some calling of expenses. Is there something programmatic that's enabling you guys to drive that better operating margin on a go-forward basis? Bret Taylor : Yes. We're really excited about Sales Cloud growth. Not only did it grow 18% year-over-year in the quarter, but in constant currency grew 20%, which I think is symbolic threshold or as you said, the product that Marc and Parker built 23 years ago, it is still as relevant today as it ever has been. I think, first and foremost, it speaks to our innovation strategy and the organic innovation coming from our engineering teams at the company. This is an example, late last year, we introduced Revenue Intelligence, which is a deep integration between Tableau and our Sales Cloud that enables sales teams to enable every rep to be more efficient to collect cash faster, to boost growth and really bringing together this entire Customer 360 portfolio to give our customers not only a chance to reimagine their Sales Cloud implementations, but make sales that are relevant to an even broader range of customers. So we're really excited about our innovation strategy. When you look at some of the wins that we've talked about in this quarter like ADT or DoorDash, you think about this next generation of selling in this era of flexible work, there's always an opportunity for our customers to reimagine their approach to sales and Sales Cloud continues to be the most innovative platform for opportunity management and lead management. So we are excited about our market-leading position. And also, I just want to say congratulations to the engineering teams, who are continuing to teach an old dog new tricks, and continue to innovate on what is, I think, really the world's leading CRM platform. Amy, talk about operating margin. Amy Weaver : Sure. I'd love to. So, hi, Keith, thanks for the question. As you noted, I really am very, very pleased about the raise on our operating margin up to 20.4% for this fiscal year. This is not the result of any single change. It's really driven by disciplined decision-making and trying to really unlock incremental efficiencies across the entire business. We've asked each leader to step up to really look across their business and to strategically prioritize their investments. And this is really to make sure that we're getting the highest return for every dollar that we invest. You asked about hiring, again, as a result, we're going to continue to hire, we are hiring. But we're doing it in a much more measured pace, and we're focusing the majority of our new hires on roles that will support customer success and the execution of our top priorities. This focus on margin, this is really over the long term, and we are all committed that this is going to make us a stronger company. But I do want to reiterate, this is not just a finance-led initiative. This focus on discipline is being applied across our entire organization. This is supported by Marc, by Bret, by Gavin and truly by our entire leadership team. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne : I don't know who wants to take this, Marc or Bret, but you mentioned Salesforce well to sort of performed through economic cycles. I was wondering if there's any change to the go-to-market playbook in a tougher economic environment, if at all, in terms of which products might be better to lead with when you start getting in these periods? And then second question would be for Amy. Amy, you basically kept your fiscal year guidance -- revenue guidance unchanged when adjusting for FX. I think everybody is wondering if that guidance probably now reflects a little bit more conservatism, given the more uneven macro backdrop. Could you just comment on that a little bit, maybe versus where we were 90 days ago? Marc Benioff : Well, I think you're right that in an environment like this, our selling strategy will change, our narrative will change. And Bret, I think, said it really well. We're going to focus more on how we can deliver productivity for the customer and lower their costs. And at a robust time, we talk about the top line advancement. Of course, it's different for every customer, you know that. To the last point that we just heard from the previous question, which was a good question, why has Sales Cloud remained so strong, and you can see more than 18% growth and Service Cloud more than 17% growth. I mean it's incredible to see the growth of these core products. Today, I was in a retailer that I like. I have a personal relationship with Brunello Cucinelli and going to have dinner with him this week and I was just kind of preparing for that and walked in the store. And I realized that the retail agent in the store is using Sales Cloud and the platform and asking them, hey, how do you like it? And what do you think about the solution. And they have it all said in Italian and it's like a serve in Salesforce, search in Salesforce. And I'm like, wow, the product, I don't think we ever could have imagined all the different uses that it has today 2 4 years ago when we invented it. And I think that, that kind of flexibility is really what is -- continues to drive its growth. We've talked about that retail use case at AT&T as well has been so important for them. And again, we never really thought at that point-of-sale environment would be so dramatic for that incredible product. But when you're working with customers in an environment like this, it really gets down to really understanding what they're trying to do. Every customer has a slightly different solution. Gavin, do you want to come in here and give an example of some of you recently put together? Gavin Patterson : Well, I think in this type of environment, the key word is relevance. Listening to your customers, understanding what the challenge -- the specific challenges they are facing and making sure that you tailor the approach to that. So in many cases, Sales Cloud is the right lead, particularly with new business and new customers. Other customers is right to go with -- to lead with Service Cloud and use that as a way of taking cost out of the business and we've used both. And then we have customers who -- as I said in my comments earlier, who were taking the Customer 360, our multi-cloud take up this quarter is very strong, up 21% with customers taking 5 or more clouds. So I think it's about listening to the customer, it's about being relevant, understanding that actually we're going through a period now where productivity and transformation is more important than the last few quarters and making sure that we tailor our messages accordingly. Marc Benioff : Yes. And I would add also kind of the relationships matter and that talked about F1 and Gavin was in Monaco over the weekend and Stefano Domenicali, who is the CEO of F1 was our customer at Lamborghini. And of course, we work closely with him and the whole Volkswagen management team. And when they're looking at this current environment, when F1 is looking at the environment, everybody is going to have a slightly different take. So it's nice to have those high-quality relationships at times like this. Amy Weaver : Great. Kirk, I'll take the second part of your question here on the guide. Look, we feel good about what we're seeing. And you've heard that from Marc, from Gavin, from Bret, to put about our pipeline. But we're mindful of the uncertain macroenvironment, and that includes continuing FX volatility. And so I believe that our guidance is appropriately conservative under the circumstances. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Bret, our survey work has shown potential for Slack to be adopted by 1/4 of all employees in the next several years. It looks like a huge number above Google Workspaces and it looks like it could be rivaling Zoom. What do you see as the best use of this $4 billion R&D budget you have to try to accelerate the Slack innovations and achieve that level of ubiquity? And I'm wondering if you would see any opportunity to potentially do more with native video conferencing? Bret Taylor : Well, it's a great question. As I think about our innovation, it's really that all of our clouds work together in a complementary way. Sales and service complement each other, sales, service, digital market and e-commerce, complement each other because it really represents the entire front office. And when I think about our acquisitions like MuleSoft, Tableau and Slack, they really amplify our value proposition for Customer 360. Tableau helps all of our customers see and understand their data, which is more relevant than ever before as every interaction becomes digital. MuleSoft enables our customers to integrate all of their legacy and back office systems to Salesforce and really create a strategic platform that accelerates our digital transformation. And Slack, as Gavin and Marc and I heard in Davos last week, is relevant in every single conversation because every single one of our customers is deciding how do they succeed in this new era of flexible work, because every single, particularly office worker, isn't coming back to the office 5 days a week. But it's really not an either-or question because Slack makes the entire Customer 360 more relevant. In fact, one of the things I'm most excited about from this past quarter is we shift a lot of the integrations between Customer 360 and Slack, whether it's team selling and account management in our Sales Cloud or case warming in our Service Cloud, it's actually one of the solutions that DoorDash uses with their Service Cloud deployment, really using our Slack to amplify their investment in our Service Cloud and they succeed in this new era, where their workforce is working from anywhere. So really excited to not only invest in Slack as a standalone platform, which is just incredible. But I'm just excited with how much more relevant our Customer 360 value proposition is now that Slack is in the building. I think it's going to be one of the best acquisitions we ever did, and it really makes every customer conversation more relevant in this new era of flexible work. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Congrats on the strong start to the year. Andy, the business generated a ton of free cash flow. You have almost $14 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and your stock is trading at a really attractive multiple. What would need to happen for you and the Board to consider buying back your stock? Amy Weaver : Brad, thanks for the question. As you know, historically, we've not done buybacks, but I will tell you that, as a company, we are always looking at our capital allocation strategy. Our Board consistently looks at this on a quarterly basis, and it's really to assess the best use of cash. Right now, our overall focus is on strengthening our balance sheet to really capitalize on all of the opportunities in front of us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Brent Bracelin : I guess one of the themes we're starting to hear more from customers is this idea of vendor consolidation, particularly given the tightening business cycle. Have you seen any shift in the pipeline relative to the mix of multi-cloud deals? Any sort of color around the customer appetite to consolidate the number of vendors would be super helpful. Gavin Patterson : I'll take that one. Look, what you've seen is a very strong quarter across the board, sales service marketing cloud, all posted great numbers. Every region posted great numbers, 21% up in the U.S., 33% in EMEA, 24% in APAC. So we had a strong quarter, we've got good momentum. And as I look forward, the pipeline looks really strong for the rest of the year. So we are cognizant of the environment we're operating in. But at the moment, we don't see that impacting our numbers. But we're vigilant at all times. If there is a consolidation of vendors with our customers, I think we're extremely well placed. We are the only ones with the Customer 360. There's nobody else in the market who is able to offer the full suite of clouds. And if that is the case, and customers choose to continue to move more of their business to it, we'll welcome it with both arms. And I think you saw some great examples of it in the quarter. The Formula 1 example we've been talking about is a great example of that, taking multiple clouds from us across sales, service and marketing. I love the ADT example as well. [Maria Black] there is doing an incredible job at driving the business and creating much more intimate customer relationships. And that's all around the Customer 360 and a consolidation of business from other vendors towards Salesforce is part of that story. So whether it's a single cloud sale, whether it's the Customer 360, we're very well placed, I think, to take full advantage of that. Marc Benioff - Chairman of the Board : Yes. I would add, I think that one of the highlights in the quarter was Goodyear. Rich Kramer, someone who we've built a really great relationship with over a number of years, they deployed a number of our different products. Now they're deploying our Commerce Cloud. And it's a great example by having a full suite of products and also by augmenting those products with our acquisition strategy over the last few years, we really have just a tremendous opportunity with every single customer to extend and expand and land and go and -- this is just a moment where I think that there will be some consolidation with vendors, and they'll rely on the vendors that they have the most trusted relationships with. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Marc, many are asking on the M&A strategy, given the pullback in valuations. Do you change your philosophy and be more aggressive here? Or you're sticking with the playbook in digesting Slack and some many of the other past acquisitions? Marc Benioff : Well, it's a great question. I know we're all watching the markets very closely and that we can see a rightsizing on a number of valuations. I think that we are all quite suspect out for quite a long time. But for us, we've kind of laid our acquisition strategy down, and we're done for a while. You can see that with many of these amazing companies that we acquired with MuleSoft, with Tableau, with Slack or even what I just mentioned with Commerce Cloud with Demandware, and the reality is there's no finish line when it comes to these acquisitions. There are lot of work. They're hard to integrate. They -- when you think you're done, you're not done, if they can surprise you and you have to take your time with them. We've realized that right from the beginning with our first ExactTarget acquisition to today. So I would say that for right now, we're not really looking at doing any major acquisitions. It's just not a part of our playbook right now. We're really focused on integrating the ones that we have. We have a lot of work to do still. And that's our primary focus. Amy, do you want to add to that? Amy Weaver : No, I think you've got it, Marc. Right now, large-scale M&A is not part of our current plans. Obviously, we're opportunistic as all strategic tech companies are, and I never say never, but that is just not something that's on our current radar screen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Congratulations on a terrific quarter. And Marc and others who have been through multiple cycles on the call here, I'm wondering why are you so confident with this economic cycle? I mean, what is so different about this cycle? Certainly, we -- you talk to CEOs, you meet with them on a daily basis. What is top of their mind? And what do you feel differently about Salesforce's positioning in this economic cycle? And then one for Amy. I just wanted to understand what gives you confidence? I think you've said something faster cash flow growth and margin growth in the press release, just very assuring, just a little bit more detail on for you plan to get there would be great. Marc Benioff : Well, Kash, I think I'm going to let each one of our executives speak on this because I'll tell you that we have been having a lot of customer interaction right now and an incredible amount. And I'll tell you when I was down in Sydney, Australia, about 3 weeks ago or 4 weeks ago, and I was just very impressed with the level of economic activity with all of these customers. They're focused on growth. They're focused on market share, they're focused on expansion, they're focused on digital transformation. And then I went off to Japan, and I was in Tokyo and well, it was the same thing. I was with one of our very large customers, Sompo, one of the largest and now the largest insurance company in Japan with their CEO, Sakurada-san. And very impressed with how they're investing and excited about expanding and going into new areas and looking at a number of our new products. They've been with us for quite a long time. And all of the customers that I met with were growing. It was just an exciting moment. And then we went off to New York, same thing, same story. Everyone is very motivated. These are customers without a lot of debt on their balance sheet. They have flexibility, they're nimble. They know what their product strategies are. They're ready to go. And then when we went down to Atlanta and we reviewed our entire operation, we heard this consistently from our management team. And when we went to Davos last week, again, across industry, across geography, while everyone is looking at rising inflation or supply chain issues or interest rate changes or stock market gyrations or foreign exchange shifts. At the end of the day, we all have our -- we all, I think, are in a very different place than we've really ever been before. And I think a lot of it has to do with the pandemic. I think the pandemic gave everybody the ability to kind of do a reset and think about, okay, now where am I going over the next decade. And so in the last 2 years, I think every company rebuilt their strategy, look at us. We acquired Slack, our largest acquisition ever, we retooled, we built our CDP. We augmented our professional services strategy. We changed our management team. We transformed who's running the company and how it's being run. So were an example of, okay, we're ready for the next decade. And I think that, that example is probably true for all the customers that we're meeting with. And Bret, do you want to come in and talk about some of your experiences in Davos? Bret Taylor : Well, you put it well. I had a privilege of having about 30 one-on-one CEO conversations in Davos, CEOs from different regions around the world, different industries. And it was really pleasantly surprised to just hear how much customers are leaning into their digital investments. Some like the consumer goods companies have been really impacted by both the supply chain and inflation, and we're really focused on how to invest in digital technologies to take down some of their costs to absorb some of that and avoid price increases. And then some other businesses, I talked to the CEO of a beauty company has seen increased demand as we all leave the house for the first time in the past couple of years and was really focused on growth. But the theme in all of them was whether you're investing in digital technology to connect with your customers or investing in digital technology to drive productivity, we continue to be one of the most strategic vendors and the trusted digital advisor all of these CEOs across every industry. So I read the same headlines as everyone else, and I'm cognizant of the volatility in the economy. And as Gavin said, we're just focused on being relevant being the most trusted digital advisor to each of our customers. And as Marc said, we believe that if we form those trusted relationships, especially in times where our customers need that resilience, and need that from us, we will come out of these gaining market share and gaining trust with our customers. Marc Benioff : Well, I think Bret said it really well, connecting with our customers, connecting with employees through Slack, connecting with our data with Tableau, connecting with our partners and these are major themes that we're hearing. Amy, what did you hear in your discussions? Amy Weaver : Davos is something. It's -- there's no other opportunity to connect with hundreds of customers across there. One of the things I really heard was a focus on efficiency. And companies are looking for partnerships and looking for companies like Salesforce that can help them both grow and become more efficient as they do it. So it was an incredible week and a great opportunity. Bret Taylor : Gavin, do you want to fill this? Gavin Patterson : Yes. I mean what I heard from customers last week and more generally, I think we're just more important to our customers than we were in previous cycles. We've got a more strategic relationship that is more of a trusted advisor. And I think that's because we have a full suite of cloud and a full Customer 360 solution that can solve multiple problems for them. So if their issue is growth, we've got a solution that will allow them to drive growth. If it's about productivity and cost transformation and efficiency, we've got the right combination for that as well. So it's about relevance, and we heard this time and time again that increasingly the digital transformation agenda that the narrative around it is not running out of steam in spite of concerns about the environment. It's becoming more -- I think even more important, and we're better placed than any other company to help our customers through that. Marc Benioff : Yes. One of the customers I met with in Davos, State Farm, I think about the huge journey that we've made with them. Michael Tipsord, the CEO and of course, Keith Block, our good friend is on their Board now. But I'm excited because they're expanding with our field service product. And that product didn't even exist when we first signed our agreement with them. But Customer 360 continues to expand for them. They're able to take their single source of truth and bring it to new use cases. And I think that that's something that I'm really excited about as we expand with all of these customers. Thank you very much for this great question. Amy Weaver : Kash, to follow up on your question on cash flow. For cash flow, our philosophy is that our OCF and FCF should increase faster than revenue as we're increasing our operating margin, which we are. In terms of confidence levels, both on the cash and the operating margin, much of this comes back to the focus on disciplined growth. This is not a passing fad. I'm a huge believer that constraints make for a stronger and more innovative company. And this is the focus across every part of the company. So when my confidence comes from is really seeing all of our leaders at Salesforce stepping up to this challenge in meeting us. Operator : Your last question today comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow : You've touched on sales, marketing and commerce clouds. I wanted to focus in on service because you've been pretty vocal about just the transformational changes that are going in on customer service. What are customers telling you right now in terms of where they are in their journeys there in terms of transformation? And also, we've obviously seen some big contracts signed from contact center vendors kind of along the team, too. So I wonder if you could just talk us through what you're seeing from customers and what your kind of conviction level is in Service Cloud going forward. Bret Taylor : Thank you. That's a great question. Service continues to be the anchor tenant of our Customer 360 for our largest customers, particularly our long-standing customers like State Farm. And what I've heard from our customers, I think, is really reflected in our product strategy, which is really the completeness of our service portfolio. Customers like State Farm, the reason they expanded in Q1 is because they expanded with Field Service. And we do field service, we do ticketing, we do contact centers, we do digital service, self-service and chat box. And when you think about your customer interactions and you particularly think about this volatile economic environment, that portfolio not only helps you increase customer satisfaction, but do so in a way that reduces costs. I love that ADT example I gave in the script because it was an example when ADT managed to do 200,000 virtual service visits and avoid sending out trucks 80% of the time, their customers were happier and they reduce costs. And the reason we can do that is because we have the most complete service portfolio in the market. So we're really excited about that. I'm excited again, it goes back to our strategy of organic innovation. And as Gavin said, the completeness of our product portfolio, in particular, as our customers look to consolidate vendors, the fact that we can really be the entire front office for our customers is incredibly differentiated. And our Customer 360 portfolio continues to be one of the main reasons why our customers choose our product offerings. Operator : This concludes our Q&A for today. Mr. Evan Goldstein, I turn the call back over to you. Evan Goldstein : Thank you for joining us on the call today. Marc Benioff : Evan, I want to congratulate you on 2 great years in IR. And we couldn't be more excited for you. So let's end this the way we started it with some big props and congratulations for you. Evan Goldstein : Thanks, Marc and the leadership team. Really appreciate it. And if you have any questions for us, feel free to reach out at investor@salesforce.com, and we look forward to talking next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Salesforce Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to hand over the conference to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Michael Spencer : Thank you, Emma, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our fiscal 2023 second quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor.  With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and Co-CEO; Bret Taylor, Vice Chair and Co-CEO; and Amy Weaver, Chief Financial Officer. We'll also be joined by Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.  As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions, which could change.  Should any of these risks materialize or should assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks and uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. And with that, let me hand the call to Marc. Marc Benioff : Well, hey, thanks, Mike. And thank you, everyone, for being on the call today. As you saw in the results for the quarter, we've delivered really strong revenue growth, profitability and cash flow, showing yet again the resilience and durability of our business model in this economic environment.  Revenue in the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year or 26% growth in constant currency. We had a great quarter, but yet again, the dollar had an even stronger quarter, and we continue to see the impact on foreign exchange and currency fluctuation on our financials. For Q2, we saw approximately $250 million of headwind to revenue, which is roughly $50 million more than we assumed in our guide last quarter, and we now expect a total of $800 million foreign exchange headwind year-over-year for the full fiscal year. Operating margin in the quarter was 19.9%, and we delivered $334 million in operating cash flow. Our remaining performance obligation or the total undelivered contract value that we have with our customers is really an incredible $41.6 billion, and this is revenue signed. It's not yet recognized.  Now turning to guidance. Over the last few months, I've met with hundreds of CEOs, with economists, business leaders, political leaders and other experts about their business and where they see this global economy heading. And I don't think it's going to surprise anyone, everyone has got a slightly different answer. And it doesn't matter who you speak to, could be a different geography, a different position, everybody sees things at a slightly different way right now. But what we do know and what I think everyone will agree on is that digital transformation remains the #1 priority for CEOs and that every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer.  That's what continues to drive our business forward, and it's why Salesforce is the #1 CRM by market share globally, according to the IDC Software Tracker. Now for those of you who have been on these calls with us, we've all been through a number of these economic cycles. And we've especially seen that over our last 23 years. And once like this come around, we see customers becoming more measured in the way they buy. Sales cycles can get stretched. Deals are inspected by higher levels of management, and all of this, we began to start to see in July. Nearly everyone I've talked to is taking a more measured approach to their business. We expect these trends to continue in the near term, and we reflected this in our guidance. Given the significant impact of foreign exchange and buyers being more measured, we're revising our fiscal '23 revenue guidance to $30.9 billion to $31 billion or about 17% growth year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. At the same time, we're maintaining our fiscal year '23 operating margin guide of 20.4%, an expansion of 170 basis points year-over-year. This is further evidence that we remain deeply committed to consistent, disciplined margin, cash flow and revenue growth as part of our long-term plan to drive both top and bottom line performance. We have the right team, the right products, the right playbook for getting to $50 billion in revenue in fiscal year '26.  We always get questions about our M&A strategy and what company we're going to acquire next and what we're going to do next from an acquisition cycle. I think we get this question every single earnings call that we do like this. And it's always one of my favorite parts of the call. And I'm excited to tell you we have found a great cloud company, growing revenue for 73 consecutive quarters through every economic cycle. It's got great cash flow, #1 market share, an incredible brand, one of the most admired companies in the world, great values, fantastic community of 17 million Trailblazers, fantastic commitment to its community, runs across 90 countries. And that company is Salesforce.  We're thrilled that our Board of Directors has authorized up to $10 billion in our first-ever share repurchase. This reflects the confidence we have in our business and in our approach to generating shareholder value. Brian Millham is going to expand in more detail about the broader capital allocation strategy in a moment. And you'll also hear about some amazing customer wins in the quarter. I'm especially proud of a major deal we closed in the quarter with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and it's one of our most meaningful partnerships. The VA is a relationship that we've been building for over 6 years, and now Salesforce is becoming the digital front door for our veterans and their families. We can't be more proud to do our part in helping those who have made sacrifices in serving the nation. It's been an incredible year so far being able to connect with our customers in person again, has been just amazing. We've done 63 marketing events so far this year, hosting over 250,000 Trailblazers and counting. But none is more exciting on every level than Dreamforce. And we're hoping to see all of you as we celebrate our 20th Dreamforce, September 20th through the 22nd right here in San Francisco. It's a celebration of our Trailblazers, and we're going to expect 150,000 people to be here and registered to attend. And we'll also be streaming the entire 3 days on Salesforce+ and expect millions more to tune in. We have an amazing line of product announcements and innovations and speakers and giving back. It's going to be a big Dreamforce. It's going to be really the biggest Dreamforce ever, our 20th ever Dreamforce.  And we're also going to be celebrating the impact Salesforce has had through our 1-1-1 philanthropic model as we've now surpassed over $0.5 billion in grants, 7 million hours of volunteerism, and more than 50,000 nonprofits using Salesforce for free. At Dreamforce, the amazing Red Hot Chili Peppers, that's Anthony and his entire band, playing to everyone. They're going to be performing at our annual benefit concert with 100% of the proceeds going to our children's hospitals right here in San Francisco and in Oakland. So please tell your friends, tell your firms, tell your vendors, tell everybody to get sponsorships to Dreamfest because it's going to be incredible. And of course, you're all invited to our Investor Day during Dreamforce on September 21. Amy, are they invested even if they don't do the Dreamfest sponsorship? Amy Weaver : Yes, Marc, they are invited. Marc Benioff : All right. Look, you're not going to want to miss it. Look, before handing off to Bret, I'd like to congratulate Brian Millham, our new Chief Operating Officer. Brian is employee #13 and has been helping us to build this company from its earlier days.  As Chief Operating Officer, Brian is going to continue to lead our customer success organization and now adds global sales to his responsibilities. Bringing our incredible customer success ecosystem, Sales Cloud sales even closer under Brian will help us to deliver the full power of Salesforce to every one of our customers in the new economy. And we're so fortunate that Gavin Patterson has taken on this important new role as Chief Strategy Officer, helping us to guide our strategic direction. And thank you and congratulations to Gavin. I'm so grateful to Gavin who for the last 2 years during the pandemic has overseen one of Salesforce's most rapid growth periods in Salesforce's history.  When I look back at the last 3 years, I saw it was really only 2 years ago, in fiscal year '21, when we did, proud, I think it was about $5.1 million -- is that -- $5.1 billion. Is that right, Mike, something like that? And then last year, I think for Q2, we did something like $6.3 billion, and now we're doing $7.7 billion, if I get the numbers right. I mean it's an incredible trajectory of growth from over the last 24 months. And I couldn't be more proud of Gavin to help us during that period and now, Brian, in your COO role. Congratulations to Brian and Gavin.  And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Bret. Bret Taylor : Thanks, Marc. And congratulations, Brian and Gavin. As Marc said, we had another strong quarter delivering strong top and bottom line performance. Our results demonstrate the durability of our business model and the strength of our strategy. Our Customer 360 product portfolio is the industry standard and the market leader, a leader in 12 current Gartner Magic Quadrant reports. And the platform is helping hundreds of thousands of companies in every industry digitally transform.  Our technology is also deeply differentiated. Einstein Artificial Intelligence platform is now doing over 175 billion predictions every day. Just incredible. Our go-to-market capability is also unmatched in the industry. The diversity of the industries, regions and lines of business we serve has driven the durability and resilience Marc talked about and you've seen in our business over the past 23 years. And finally, our ecosystem is unparalleled in enterprise software. As 150,000 Trailblazers joined us for Dreamforce next month, they represent a global community of developers, administrators and ISVs, 17 million strong that are driving what IDC estimates to be $1.6 trillion in new business revenues by 2026.  As you heard from Marc, we're in a more measured buying environment. Executive teams are scrutinizing all purchasing decisions, and we are seeing some deals take longer to close. I personally met with over 100 CEOs this quarter in my travels across Latin America, Europe and North America, and digital transformation remains their top priority. But the focus of the conversation has shifted meaningfully towards productivity, efficiency and time to value.  In this environment, our Customer 360 portfolio is uniquely positioned to enable our customers to deliver both growth and cost savings. And you can see it in this quarter's results. Sales Cloud revenue grew 15% year-over-year, a healthy 19% in constant currency, including customer wins at CDW, Zscaler and Schneider Electric. Using our Sales Cloud and CRM analytics, Schneider reduced their close time by 30%. And with MuleSoft, they saved 40,000 hours of employees' time and saved $2.7 million in IT costs.  Service Cloud grew 14% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency, including customer wins at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Workday and Uber. Our digital service product line, in particular, accelerated as customers pivoted their spend to digital technologies that reduce customer service costs. Uber Eats is a great example. Uber Eats saw a 20% improvement in productivity across e-mail, chat and phone support channels with our Service Cloud, and more importantly, with their investment in our Einstein AI chat bots, they improved their call deflection by 30%. Our Marketing and Commerce Cloud grew together 17% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency, including significant expansion of our relationships with Live Nation, L'Oreal and Tapestry.  In our Commerce Cloud, we are seeing GMV growth decelerate in line with the rest of the e-commerce industry as consumers settle back down to pre-pandemic norms. Platform, including Slack, grew 53% or 56% in constant currency, including great Slack expansions at organizations like the National Weather Service, Coursera and Mercado Libre. The National Weather Service selected Slack as its platform to connect over 4,300 employees with emergency managers, public safety decision-makers and local media partners nationwide. I'm also excited to say that we will have over 12 Slack product integrations with our Customer 360 platform live and generally available by Dreamforce, where we have an incredible opportunity to help every one of our customers build their digital HQ and Slack in this new era of flexible work.  Data, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau, grew 12% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency with wins at brands like Atlassian, Siemens Energy, CBRE Group and King Power, which is Thailand's leading travel retailer. I'm heartened by the progress we're seeing in our go-to-market transformation of MuleSoft. We are on track to have MuleSoft return to be in a tailwind for revenue growth in the back half of the year. And finally, our 12 industry clouds were another bright spot in the quarter, growing faster than our line of business cloud as our customers are increasingly focused on time to value and reducing their implementation costs. The out-of-the-box industry processes we've built into our industry clouds are a compelling value proposition in this more measured buying environment, and I'm excited about the new processes we brought to market in the first half of the year, including trade promotion management for consumer goods and our virtual assistant for our Financial Services Cloud.  As we head towards Dreamforce, our pace of organic innovation has never been stronger. In our summer release alone, we delivered key innovation like revenue intelligence for predictive forecasting, the ability to talk to your data through Tableau, MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation and a new lakehouse architecture for our customer data platform. And just this week, we launched Salesforce Easy, a new all-in-one self-service suite for sales, marketing, service and commerce that is going to transform how small businesses engage with Salesforce. As you'll hear more from Amy, we're committed to durable growth at scale. We're committed to our 20.4% operating margin this year, and I'm excited that we're announcing our first-ever $10 billion share repurchase program today. Our capital allocation strategy is simple. We will continue to expand our free cash flow margin as we scale. We will invest in our organic innovation. We will reduce the impact of dilution, both by offsetting stock-based compensation and by maintaining a healthy balance sheet to fund any future M&A. I'm so grateful to our 17 million Trailblazers, all of our partners and most importantly, our employees for helping provide our customers with the innovation, agility and resilience they need to navigate these uncertain times.  Now over to Amy to discuss the financial details of the quarter. Amy Weaver : Great. Thank you, Bret, and congratulations, Brian. I'm pleased to report strong top and bottom line financial results for Q4 -- Q2. That is pleased to report strong top and bottom line financial results in Q2. As you've heard from Marc and Bret, our diversified portfolio remains well positioned to help our customers both grow and drive efficiencies in their business. Our customers are relying on us more than ever to be their trusted adviser, partnering with them on their digital road map.  Now let me walk through our results for Q2 of fiscal '23, beginning with top line commentary. Total revenue for the second quarter was $7.72 billion, up 22% year-over-year or 26% in constant currency. FX continued to represent a headwind as the dollar continued to strengthen throughout the quarter. In Q2, the headwind from FX was about $50 million more than we had guided.  A few highlights from the quarter. Sales Cloud continues to be a critical piece of our customers' success, helping companies drive more productive growth. In Q2, Sales Cloud grew 15% year-over-year and 19% in constant currency. Service Cloud grew 14% year-over-year and 18% in constant currency as we help our customers realize efficiencies and cost savings. As customers focus on their digital strategy and transformation, we continue to see growing multi-cloud adoption due to the number of customers who have purchased 5 or more clouds, again grew in double digits. And Slack continued to outperform our revenue expectations with revenue of $381 million. Slack continues to gain traction with customers. And in Q2, 7 of our top 10 deals included Slack. And for the fifth consecutive quarter, the number of customers spending greater than $100,000 with Slack, grew by more than 40% year-over-year.  Now for a quick update on data. I'm pleased to say that data passed $1 billion of revenue this quarter. And with that, all of our 5 clouds are now generating more than $1 billion in revenue a quarter. Data growth of 12% or 13% in constant currency was driven by MuleSoft total revenue growth of 15% and Tableau growth of 9%. As a reminder, approximately half of MuleSoft and Tableau's total contract value is recognized in period, resulting in more quarterly volatility than our other core products.  Turning to revenue attrition. Rates remain at record lows, ending Q2 at approximately 7.5%. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.9%, driven by our continued focus on disciplined decision-making and prioritization. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.07 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19. Mark-to-market accounting of the company's strategic investments benefited GAAP EPS by $0.03 and non-GAAP EPS by $0.04. Operating cash flow was $334 million in Q2, down 13% year-over-year. CapEx was $203 million, resulting in free cash flow of $131 million, down 24% year-over-year.  Now before getting to our RPO performance and guidance, I'd like to address the current economic environment. As both Marc and Bret mentioned, we started to see more measured buying behavior from our customers, which began in the last month of the quarter. This resulted in stretched sales cycles, additional deal approval layers and deal compression. In addition, we saw slowing in our create and close, Slack self-serve and SMB businesses, which tend to be leading macro indicators. Geographically, this behavior was most pronounced in North America and major European markets, while Japan was relatively more resilient. From an industry perspective, retail, consumer goods and communications and media were the most impacted, while high tech, energy and financial services stayed more consistent during the quarter. And from a product perspective, commerce and marketing saw more pronounced decelerations, while sales and service remains strong.  Turning to remaining performance obligation, or RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract. It ended Q2 at approximately $41.6 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, was approximately $21.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year and 19% in constant currency. This includes 1 point of incremental FX headwind beyond our Q2 guidance. Moving to Q3 guidance. We expect revenue of $7.82 billion to $7.83 billion, or approximately 14% growth year-over-year and 18% in constant currency. This reflects a $250 million FX headwind. We also expect the $380 million contribution from Slack. As a reminder, Q3 represents the fifth quarter of Slack contributions to revenue. Therefore, the year-over-year growth rates will be normalized. CRPO growth is expected to be approximately 12% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency. And we expect GAAP EPS of $0.09 to $0.10 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.20 to $1.21.  Now turning to our full year fiscal '23 guidance. We are now guiding to fiscal '23 revenue of $30.9 billion to $31.0 billion or approximately 17% growth year-over-year, 20% in constant currency. This incorporates the trends in customer behavior that we saw beginning in July. The total year-over-year FX headwind is now $800 million, an incremental $200 million year-over-year since our previous guidance. As a reminder, the currencies most impacting our revenue are the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, the Australian dollar.  Our guidance continues to assume a $1.5 billion contribution from Slack. As a company, we remain committed to profitability over the long term. And while we see a more deliberate customer buying behavior, I am pleased to hold our fiscal '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance at 20.4%, an increase of 170 basis points year-over-year. This margin guidance includes roughly 100 basis points of headwind from Slack. As a reminder, because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same currencies, there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin. For the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 to $4.73. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investment portfolio. We are updating our fiscal '23 operating cash flow guidance to approximately 16% to 17% growth year-over-year. Our guidance continues to assume a 3-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs. We expect CapEx to be slightly above 2% of revenue in fiscal '23, a nominal increase over last quarter's guide, reflecting the revised full year revenue guidance. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 18% to 19% for the fiscal year.  So to close, as our customers and their executive teams, including the CEO, CIO and CFO, focus on their digital investment strategy, we are well positioned with our diversified product portfolio to help drive efficiencies and growth. And we are laser-focused on disciplined decision-making with a commitment to achieving our operating margin guidance. Lastly, let me echo Bret and Marc. We are very, very pleased to be announcing our new share repurchase program today. This step is a reflection of the confidence that we have in the future of Salesforce. And I look forward to seeing everyone at Investor Day on September 21, where we will go into even more detail on our capital allocation strategy. Now Emma, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : I think what's really on top of everybody's mind right now is the takedown in the full year revenue guide and what's causing that. You talked a lot about the macro side of the equation, and we definitely see that all around us. We definitely see that in our checks as well. But I think what people want to understand, is there anything more to this? Is there anything more execution-related, perhaps the go-to-market? And is the change in sales leadership from Gavin to Brian, is this in any way meant to address any shortcoming on the distribution strategy? So that's part one.  Part two, on the expense side equation. Very impressive to be able to sustain 20.4% operating margin target even with the revenues coming down. I guess, for Amy, is there another level of what kind of expense reductions or sort of another gear that you had to sort of go in to be able to sustain that operating margin expansion? And does that impact your ability to sort of invest in the business to sustain those operating margins? Marc Benioff : Yes. I'm so happy to talk to you, Keith, and I'll tell you that you're right. We took the guide down really around 2 points. One is the foreign exchange environment is obviously just unprecedented. And we talked about that last quarter as well. I think maybe we were one of the first to really see what was going on. Somehow just being on the ground in some of these countries that have been so dramatically hit. But to look at where we are right now with the yen, to look where we are right now with the euro, I think the euro maybe just broke parity yesterday. I mean it's -- we're really in an unprecedented moment in foreign exchange.  And on the other side, as I said and I think as the team has really emphasized, really starting in July, we started to see some metrics where we're like, where do we exactly want to be for the year? And what is appropriate for us? And how do we correctly characterize where the business is? And that is really how we kind of put together this guide, which we think is the appropriate way to communicate the status of the business because we want to be in a place where we're communicating exactly where we are. So I'm sure Amy is going to amplify that as well. Amy Weaver : Sure, Marc. I think you nailed it on that. When we look at the guide, I believe the guide is appropriate under the circumstances we're seeing right now. And as you know that there's 2 key drivers. The first part is FX, the key currencies, the euro, the pound, the yen, they've all weakened to near historic levels, and we're seeing that impact on our top line as we look forward to the rest of the year. For the remaining part, as we called out, there was a distinct shift in customer buying behavior that we saw near the end of the quarter. And for purposes of the guide, we're assuming that those conditions endured through about the half of the year.  Now turning to your second part of your question, which I think was on op margin. As you know, I was very happy that we are committed to 20.4% and holding that despite bringing down the top line. This is largely coming from a more disciplined approach. It is not a result of one single change. We are continuing to unlock incremental efficiencies across the business. We're asking each leader to step up and look at their businesses and prioritize. I do believe that we are continuing to invest into growth, which still remains our #1 priority.  In terms of the specific drivers, definitely continuing to take a measured approach and a very deliberate approach on hiring. T&E, we are prioritizing for customer-facing travel. And again, we are continuing to benefit from some of the decisions we've made over the last few years on real estate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Marc, I'm curious if you could talk about Brian's new role. And I think there's a lot of concern, as new head of the sales comes in, that there's some transition period. And can you just address this transition period? And I know he's been with the company for over 20 years and highly regarded, but there's a lot of investors that would love to hear your perspective on this. Marc Benioff : Well, that would be my pleasure. I mean I think a lot of you know Brian, he's been a trusted part of our management team for over 20 years. And look, the last time he was the head of sales was only 2 years ago when we went into the pandemic and went through the transition with Keith. You may remember, I put Brian in for, I think, 1 or 2 quarters to run global sales, did a fantastic job. He didn't want to continue with it. So we asked Gavin to step up from his role of -- I think it was International Chairman or European Chairman, I can't remember, honestly. And really proud of Gavin for the last now 2 years. And then Brian is right here. And I asked Brian if he would come in and take this forward and he agreed. And I couldn't be more grateful to that. I know we have just a trusted hand.  In terms of the transition period, I couldn't imagine anybody who will operate the organization so seamlessly and transparently and with ease. And everybody has such a good relationship already with Brian. And he already runs our forecast calls. He's already been a key part of our sales program. I don't expect any transition period at all, and I'm holding him to that actually. Bret Taylor : The other thing I just want to add is Brian has been running our customer success, professional services and partnership organization for a long time. And I think the story to the pandemic has been our historically low attrition rates and our focus on customer outcomes. And I'm really excited about the opportunity of bringing our global sales organization together with our customer success organization. And it's a really important part of our philosophy. And I think this move... Marc Benioff : Well, we definitely surprised both of us, right, how low attrition Brian has been able to get. And how great a job he's done. Bret Taylor : And deeply connecting that success motion to our sales motion, I think, reflects a philosophical view from Marc and me about really our philosophy. Marc Benioff : Brian, can you just step out of the room while we finish answering this? Do you want to just comment on this? Brian Millham : Yes. First of all, I'm humbled by the opportunity and, Marc, to your comments. I've been very close to this business for the past 2.5 years, working side-by-side with Gavin. I actually was operating in a COO role for him running this business. And I think it's critical as we look at sort of the second half of this year and beyond, this motion of customer success and sales together will drive the outcomes that we're looking for and our customers are looking for. And so I'm thrilled with the results we've seen on the attrition side, thrilled with the results that the customers are getting from the investment they're making in our technology and just so excited to lead the sales. Marc Benioff : Can you just address Brent's direct question on transition time, how hard of a transition is this going to be for... Brian Millham : I think it was measured in hours, actually, Marc. I've been running forecast calls already. I'm in the business travel industry customers. I met with 4 customers yesterday, there will be no transition time. There are no big changes that we're going to be making in our go-to-market other than getting closer to our customers and ensuring that we're delivering value to them in every single transaction that we're working on with them. So very excited to take this on with 0 transition time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Can you -- obviously, the slowdown that we're seeing or the lengthening of sales cycles, there's nothing that is kind of unique to you guys. We heard from other vendors as well. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of client prioritization, in terms of certain projects? Because I do remember from the old times that the front offers always had higher priority because it's revenue generating, et cetera. Are you seeing that now happening as well? And can you speak to that? Bret Taylor : Yes. Thanks for the question. First, I'll tell you, I think that trend continues. Digital transformation remains our customers' top priority, and digital transformation starts and ends with the customer. And fundamentally, all of our customers are really investing into the secular trend of the digitization of their customer experience, their employee experience and with our portfolio, we're at the top of that list.  I think what you're seeing is an increased focus on, I say, 3 things. One is time to value. The other is ensuring that these projects drive cost savings in addition to customer satisfaction and top line growth. And then the third is reducing complexity and vendor consolidation. Some of the stories I mentioned like Uber Eats, I think, are great examples because it's really about how do you put up things like digital service technology, whether it's chatbots or self-service, to really take out cost and make these projects pay for themselves as opposed to having protracted multiyear implementations.  I think vendor consolidation is also a trend that we're seeing. And if you look at some of the innovation we're bringing out like our Sales Cloud Unlimited edition, or Salesforce Easy, which I mentioned earlier in my script, they are really efforts to enable our customers to do more with less, to enable them to use Salesforce as their sole vendor, take out some point solutions that perhaps aren't getting the return on investments our customers are looking for, and sort of taking advantage of this opportunity to be the most strategic vendor for our customers right now as they look to really hold their technology to high standards, which is to drive top line and bottom line performance.  Brian, is there anything you want to add? Brian Millham : Great question, Raimo. And I agree with you that front office is the priority you heard both Marc and Bret, and I'm feeling to when we're out talking to CEOs, digital transformation remains our #1 priority, and we need to make sure that we're delivering for them. We're also seeing it in the demand environment. We are still seeing very good generation of pipeline in our business right now. And while we are facing some longer sales cycles and additional layers of deal approvals and potentially some deal compression, the demand environment is solid. And so you're spot on that we are seeing the front office as a priority for every CEO out there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Bradley Sills : Thanks for all the color on where you saw the macro impact. It sounds like SMB marketing commerce, but the core sales and service looks to have held in nicely you didn't call out enterprise. So any specific color on how the core business and the large enterprise, those bigger expansion deals in the core track this quarter? Bret Taylor : I'll start and then Brian, I'd love your commentary as well. As you said, I think the story, actually, the past number of quarters have been the strength of our core CRM business. Sales Cloud growing at 19% in constant currency is remarkable. This is the product that Marc and Parker built 23 years ago doing -- so much revenue growing at 19% is incredible. And you're seeing it just in, I think, the continued strength in our core business.  And the other thing I want to call out is our attrition rate being at historical lows as well. And I think it really reflects the strength of our business. And so as Amy articulated, as it relates to SMB, GMV deceleration, we're seeing things settle down to pre-pandemic norms. But I still see incredible strength in our core CRM business, in the enterprise. And as I said, I think the durability of our business really rests on the durability and diversity of our portfolio, the diversity of the industries that we serve and the diversity of the segments that we serve.  Brian, is there any color you want to add? Brian Millham : Yes. Well said. On the Sales and Service Cloud are sort of the centerpiece of our digital transformation for our customers. And you saw the growth in the quarter, and we expect that to continue. We are seeing some compression in some of the larger transactions in our enterprise business, and it's not a surprise. I've lived through 3 of these cycles before, and you can see that maybe people take a more measured approach to their digital transformation, maybe starting with a smaller piece, but a land-and-expand strategy is something we've used for many, many years, we can grow as the strategy we've used.  And so despite the fact that maybe some of these engagements are a bit smaller, we do see acceleration in these customers in quarters to come. So yes, there was compression out there in some of the business, but we are very confident that we can go execute against the opportunity in front of us in these large enterprise accounts going forward with digital transformation being a top priority. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kasthuri Rangan : Lots of exciting news for Salesforce. Congrats on all the changes. My question maybe, Brian, congrats to you as well in your new position. What would you do to turn around the data cloud? I know, clearly, it has had some very significant momentum. But I can, in some sense, look at the new guidance versus the old and say a lot of that delta is basically the slowdown on the growth rate in the data cloud that is the Tableau and MuleSoft business. Brian, want to get your opinion on that.  And just the management team, as you talk to customers, Marc, you've been through these cycles before, what are customers saying as to when they might reengage at the same level of enthusiasm at Salesforce, be deal size or close rate. What are the things that they're looking for from a macro perspective or leading indicators in their business so it could be back to reengaging the way they used to reengage with Salesforce. Brian Millham : First of all, Kash, thanks for the question and I appreciate the kind comments. On the data business, it's a unique business for us because some of it is license based. And you can tend to see some of the headwinds we saw in July show up more immediately there. We feel very good about where both those businesses are right now, particularly in MuleSoft that as you heard Bret say is on a great trajectory and will be a tailwind to our revenue growth in the second half of this year. We feel great about that.  Tab is a critical component of our digital transformation with every customer wanting to leverage data to have better insights to the way they operate their business. So clearly, a lot of focus on these businesses because it is such a critical component of every digital transformation. We feel great about that, both those integration and analytics as a category for accelerated growth in the second half. So no big concerns there at all.  I would say on your second question, we are not economists, and so we're not going to guide on where -- when people are going to feel like they're coming out of this. We think we're being appropriate with our guide for the second half of the year based on what we saw transpire in July. Marc and Bret? Marc Benioff : Well, I think the main piece that I would really focus on is really going to be spending as much time as I can with customers at Dreamforce. This is our opportunity to really understand deeply across a wide spectrum of our customers, geographies, verticals, what it is that they are seeing in their own businesses. But I think when you look at these customers, we mentioned one is L'Oreal, this has just been an incredible success story for us. We see the B2C story. They're using Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud and Service Cloud. The Commerce Cloud story is incredible where they have almost 200 sites globally now for all of their brands. They've got highly customized experiences on the web and mobile and in-store for -- I'm sure a lot of you use the Kiehl's brand. It's a great product. They have a whole new skin hub. They've been with us. They've really reimagine their business using Customer 360. It's a company that we're going to feature and focus and talk about and inspire others at Dreamforce.  I think when you see stories like that, when you look at all the stories that we've seen, especially during this pandemic surge over the last 2 years, it's incredible what folks have done with their businesses. When we get to this moment, I don't think it's a huge surprise that customers are more measured. Everybody is like wondering exactly where the economy is going and how things are moving forward. So this is a point where people are taking a little bit of a breath and then they will reassess. And then when they get their confidence and kind of a full vision for the next stage of their company, they come in. And until then, it's a lot of the transactional business that we would normally see and move forward with. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Karl Keirstead : Maybe I'll direct this to Marc and Amy and it's about the $10 billion share repurchase. So maybe a 2-parter. Marc, maybe for you, why do you think this is the right time in the company's development to move forward with your first large repurchase? And then secondly, should everybody on the line interpret this as a signal that perhaps large M&A may be off the table for now? Marc Benioff : Well, it's a great question. And I'll tell you this was kind of -- I looked at this quarter very much as kind of a milestone. I'm a big fan of SAP and I have a lot of respect for their business and what they've done in the market over the last 40 -- almost 50 years. And to see our business in July do more than they reported in June in terms of revenue, that was very meaningful to me and I'm very grateful and proud of our team for kind of hitting this tremendous level of scale. But at that same moment, I kind of also can say, okay, what are some changes that we can make. And one of the things, we have such massive cash flow that I think it's completely appropriate for us to look at how we're handling our dilution, for example. I think that's been on the table for a while, and a lot of my conversations with investors they bring it up. We've waited for that moment. I think now is the right moment where we can say we're going to directly address this with our kind of first-ever share repurchase, $10 billion. I'm very excited about it.  At the same time, I don't think that, that takes M&A off the table. I think that we continue to look for opportunities. We want to be able to use our cash constructively. This is important for us. It doesn't mean that we're not going to have different kind of guardrails for M&A.  And Bret, do you want to just address that point? Bret Taylor : Yes. I think, Marc, you articulated it well. I mean when I mentioned this before, but the pillars of our capital allocation strategy are : number one, that we're going to continue to become more profitable to generate expanded free cash flow over time. That's what Marc was saying. Marc Benioff : Yes. Thank you for saying that. Bret Taylor : You created a great business model in Software as a Service, Marc, and I think... Marc Benioff : No. I think that committing to this -- committing to the margin for the year is so critical as well for investors. Bret Taylor : It is. And number two, we're going to invest in organic innovation. And we talked a bit on -- there's a question Amy earlier on investment. I'm so proud of our investment in organic innovation. You'll see a lot more of it at Dreamforce, but I think we have a better pace of organic innovation that we've had in our history. But -- and then finally, we want to reduce the impact of dilution, which is feedback I've gotten from all of you. And we're focused on offsetting our stock-based compensation. And we're also focused on maintaining a healthy balance sheet because we understand that's an incredible piece of leverage we have for future M&A. So I think this is a way to -- that we can continue to acquire in the future. It's been a big part of our company's history. It will be a big part of our future, but do so in a way that minimizes the impact of dilution and does it in a more shareholder-friendly way. Marc Benioff : And you can see like we've picked up some great companies, whether it was ExactTarget, which was kind of the beginning of really augmenting Customer 360 with our Marketing Cloud and then moving on to MuleSoft was amazing. It's really provided all the integration and the connectivity, and then on to Tableau and giving this extension of analytics. So important to so many of our largest customers.  And then Slack, I just mentioned L'Oreal, it's an incredible Slack story. They've streamlined their communication. They've got -- they have that awesome Brandstorm event. Have you seen that, Bret? It's that worldwide innovation competition that they do. They've got more than 83,000 student participants, 65 countries. They use Slack to drive that thing forward. You look at that, we're a different company because we had an acquisition strategy over the last decade. I don't think we necessarily need to break that. But at the same time, we need to be paying attention to dilution and the overall, making sure we have the correct capital allocation strategy as well. Amy Weaver : Yes, Marc, I think that's really it. When we look at this, I think this is very much a natural evolution of our capital allocation strategy. And what it really comes down to is that we believe Salesforce is positioned for success over the long term. And this announcement reflects the confidence that we have in our business that as we look forward and our approach to generating shareholder value. Marc Benioff : Yes. And I really think that when we get to Dreamforce and you see how we brought all of these platforms together, integrated them, you're going to see some really powerful integration capabilities. You already saw some of it at the World Tour in New York with kind of the first level of the customer data platform. You're going to see a whole another extension of that kind of capability when we get to Dreamforce. And it's -- I think, as Bret said, it's in a very exciting moment in time when it comes to innovation with the company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. S. Kirk Materne : I think this one is sort of for Bret. Bret, I was just wondering if you could go into the industry cloud strategy a little bit and what you're seeing going on there. And can you just talk a little bit about how important that strategy is as budgets come under more stress and the ability for you all to go deeper with your customers on an industry basis? I was just kind of curious if you can give us an update on that and then how that strategy maybe plays out in a more choppy macro backdrop. Bret Taylor : Yes. Thanks, Kirk. We have 12 industry clouds spanning a wide range of industries where I think CRM is particularly strategic from financial services to health care, to consumer goods and manufacturing. And you can think of our industry cloud is essentially taking the Customer 360 : sales, service, marketing, e-commerce, Tableau, MuleSoft, Slack, and building industry-specific processes and workflows that work out of the box. And as you're sort of alluding to, there's a lot of value for our customers.  Number one is they don't need to pay us or a professional services firm to implement the table stakes for their digital transformation. It works out of the box. That means they can focus their investment resources in the areas of their business that are differentiated. It means they get faster time to value. And it means that these processes are stickier, which is why our industry clouds have lower attrition rates than our line of business clouds.  It's been a huge area of growth for us and actually a lot of credit to our Chief Product Officer, David Schmaier, who actually -- his company, which we acquired a couple of years ago. Velocity was actually independent software vendor that built industry solutions on top of our platform and has been a strong advocate for this strategy internally.  It's a huge part of our go-forward strategy. If you have an option to buy one of our industry clouds, why wouldn't you? More works out of the box, you'll get faster time to value. So it's a huge area of investment for us.  I think the thing that we do really uniquely though, Marc alluded to it, is it's really all-in-one integrated platform. If you buy our Financial Services Cloud, you get all the capabilities of our Salesforce Cloud, of our Service Cloud or our customer data platform, all in one integrated technology platform. It's very unique in the industry. And I think in this more measured buying environment, it will become even more important, though, actually, it was important prior to this as well. And I think it reflects our alignment with our industry's go-to-market motion and vertical go-to-market motion and really focus on delivering faster time to value to our customers. Operator : You last question today comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : I wanted to focus in on Slack. Slack again outperformed revenue expectations. Obviously, the large deal metrics are impressive, too. What's driving the continued advance for Slack, let's say, relative to some of those other vendors that are heavier in the telephony or the video segments of UCaaS that have frankly have been delivering weaker results? And are you seeing strong, call it, stand-alone demand for Slack as a horizontal messaging platform or the Salesforce integrations that you highlighted driving more attach as a collaboration hub of Slack in the context of multi-cloud deployments? Bret Taylor : Yes, I'll take that one. This is Bret. We are really happy with the performance of Slack. I think it's interesting, we acquired Slack in the midst of this pandemic. And now we're coming out of the pandemic into this new era of flexible work. Office occupancy rates are at historic lows. If you look at the lines of business that we serve like customer service, I've met tens or maybe even hundreds of executive teams whose contact centers are no longer buildings. They're literally just in the cloud now and people are wearing headsets in their kitchens and basements to answer your phone calls.  And if you think about what it means to build an employee experience, to build a customer experience in this new area of flexible work, Slack is really at the center of those conversations. And that's why it was such a strategic acquisition for us because 1 plus 1 is truly equal to much more than 2.  When I talked about the innovation we're to deliver at Dreamforce, it's across every single one of our cloud. We've been saying, how do we help our customers whose headquarters is now digital transition their CRM, transition their employee experience to this new era of flexible work? So we've seen great wall-to-wall engagements like Mercado Libre, one of the customers I mentioned in my script. But it's also really important that we've invested in integrating Slack with Customer 360 so that when we have a conversation, say, with a retailer preparing for Cyber Week, we're coming not just with our Marketing Cloud or in our Commerce Cloud and our Service Cloud but with a Slack Connect channel that they can use as a command center for Cyber Week.  That's key to our go-to-market motion. But -- and I don't think it's at the expense of what you called stand-alone. When we land a deal, say, for a department -- marketing department, Slack has such wonderful organic viral adoption that a year or 2 later, we're selling to the whole company. And I really think that's key to our go-to-market motion. And Slack is a relevant driver for every single one of the cloud and our Customer 360. Marc Benioff : And I think a lot of the reasons that we bought the company that they really could benefit from our credibility with customers and our distribution capacity have really paid out. It's such a great product. And in June, you probably know that Bret and I did the World Tour in New York. Many of you were there, but the day before was the Frontiers Conference for Slack. And if you haven't looked at the demo, you really should because the product has come a long way since we bought the company. It's an incredible piece of technology... Bret Taylor : Voice, video. I mean it's incredible, yes. Marc Benioff : You have to see it to believe it. I mean don't you agree like it's something that's like really -- and for a lot of you are coming to Dreamforce, I think you're going to see how a lot of our products have become Slack first. And also the number of integrations that we're going to be able to kind of bring forth, how many integrations now do you have with these core clouds that you've been able to put together? Bret Taylor : We have 12 integrations with -- and the reason there's so many is because it includes our industry clouds, not just sales, service, marketing and commerce. But Marc, you're going into something remarkable huddles, which is the name of the new audio and video introduced, now accounts for 34% of all communication inside of Salesforce. It's completely transformed the way we work, and I'm pretty confident we'll transform all of our customers... Marc Benioff : We've integrated Slack with Tableau, which is really cool, right? Because you can do collaborative analytics. Bret Taylor : And with the capabilities we launched to allow you to talk to your data, this is happening inside of Slack. It's just an incredible capability and, as I said, a relevant driver for all of our customer engagements and a wonderful way to, I think, drive and accelerate flag adoption that they would have had independently. Marc Benioff : But a lot of our customers still haven't seen this. And I think that's why I'm so excited about Dreamforce because when you come to Dreamforce, and you see the keynote, obviously, this will be highlighted. And I think customers will see in real time. What we saw, for example, in Frontiers, even we didn't really have the opportunity because COVID was so freshly integrated into our World Tour keynote, which Bret and I have lamented many times. But I think that when you start to see the incredible innovation that have happened in the Salesforce core clouds like sales, like service, marketing, commerce, even Tableau, you combine that with Slack. You bring that into the Customer 360 with MuleSoft, the single source of truth.  The way it's all being integrated with this customer data platform, I don't think anyone else has this vision or is trying to even to execute it. And I've made this kind of L'Oreal -- I told you the L'Oreal story, I said quite a few times, you're going to see that in Dreamforce in real time. You can see many other stories, because I think for us, just trying to communicate our vision, this is like probably the most exciting thing going on here. We just brought 500 of our top executives together for kind of second half kickoff and showed them what we're so excited about, and I don't think anybody walked away not thinking that we've not only got a world-class product that's highly differentiated, but we're really where a lot of our customers are trying to get to in the next level of their customer experience. And Bret's made the point, Amy's made the point, Brian's made the point that digital transformation is underway, but we all know that every digital transformation is beginning and ending with the customer. And you've got to have this beginning. You have to kind of begin with the end of mine when that's all about building this Customer 360, and you're going to see this at scale when we all get to Dreamforce, and I'll look forward to your feedback then. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Phil, and we want to thank everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing everyone over the next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speaker's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now at this time, I'll turn the call over to your speaker, Mr. Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mike Spencer : Thank you, Bo.

Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. And with that, let me hand the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Okay. Well, thank you so much, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for being on the call. I just want to come back to how great it was to see so many of you at Dreamforce in September. It was really a wonderful experience for me personally. It was our most successful, but I really think it was our most important Dreamforce ever, because we were able to come together for what we called our great reunion. And being with you all of you, especially at our IR day, that was a joy for me. Now let's get on to the quarter results. We delivered solid revenue growth and profitability in an increasingly challenging environment. You've seen how we're driving customer success, the strength of our organic innovation and this incredible Trailblazer community and how it manifested at the Dreamforce. And everywhere we turn, we saw customers learning how to connect with their customers in entirely new ways and the depth of our Customer 360 platform. We're also thrilled to introduce Genie, which is our Customer Data Cloud, and it's one of the most transformational technologies we have ever delivered. And when you hear some of the metrics already coming out of customer adoption with Genie, I think that you'll be incredibly impressed, and I can't wait for Bret to talk about that. The best part of Dreamforce was being together. That was what it was all about for me, and I'm sure it was for you as well, and the 40,000 folks that all came to San Francisco to have this incredible experience and all the additional folks that joined us online. Now let's get to our results. Revenue in the quarter, well, it was $7.84 billion. That's up 14% year-over-year. I think that's a record for us. And also, it was 19% in constant currency. And we're going to talk about that foreign exchange situation in just a second. We closed some amazing deals in the quarter with great companies like Bank of America, RBC Wealth Management and Dell and other great stories, and I'm also going to get that into a moment as well. And even with purchase decisions receiving greater scrutiny, we continue to gain market share and close marquee transactions. IDC recently ranked Salesforce as the number one in CRM. And now we've done that for nine years in a row. And I'm proud that we've delivered revenue growth in this environment, but especially proud of the team for our continued focus on delivering record operating margins. And here, you can see now, up 22.7% non-GAAP operating margin we delivered for the quarter. And I think when I look back at various financial crisis, as we think back even, I think, to 2008, 2009, I think it was like somewhere down to 10%. So we've come a long way in a short period of time. So this quarter has been further proof of our commitment to profitable growth, continuing our operating margin growth, continued focus on our revenue growth, continued focus on our market share growth. And a great evidence of that is our remaining performance obligation. Our RPO is now an incredible $40 billion. Now, as I've said in the last few quarters, the dollar had a strong quarter, maybe even a stronger quarter than we had. I think that when we first said that, in the second quarter, folks didn't really understand what we were talking about, or maybe it wasn't the first quarter we said that. I remember, it was a trip to Japan when I called Amy, and I was asking her what the expectations were for revenue. But when I told her what my guidance was for what and how I was looking at revenue, including foreign exchange, I don't think either one of us could believe what was really happening, and now we've really seen that start to play out. We continue to see the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. And of course, that is our biggest surprise of the year. In the quarter, we saw $300 million year-over-year headwinds to revenue, and we've expected a total of $900 million for the full year. Now that is something we just could not have expected a year ago, and that is when we initiated our revenue guidance. At Dreamforce and in my travels around the world, our customers have been asking how to best navigate this economic situation with the high level of market volatility and uncertainty. A lot of CEOs have never been through these types of crisis before. They haven't seen these kind of variations in the market or in foreign exchange or even in market demand. Well, we've got a lot to say about that, because this is not our first financial crisis. And I'm seeing a lot of buying behavior that really reflects a lot of what we've seen during other crisis, whether it's 2008, 2009 or even 2001. And obviously, the current economic situation is nowhere near as severe as what happened beginning in 2008, but there are some patterns that we've seen repeat themselves. And in early 2008, we saw customers who are reluctant to expand distribution capacity, they weren't adding service people, they froze their hiring, they initiated headcount reductions. We saw those occur in that year. We saw that in [2011] (ph) as well. I think that, maybe when things start to get a little tough or when the stock market shifts that's when CEOs say, hold on, should we be expanding distribution capacity right now? Should we be expanding service capacity? What do we stop -- let's stop our advertising, let's stop our marketing spend, things that they can immediately take actions on. Well, you couple that with foreign exchange headwinds have become an issue and everyone was shifting their focus to finding efficiencies, reducing their costs, increasing productivity, and again, we're feeling all of this once again. And that led us to the shift of the company. It took us a lot to how we operate and where we are investing our dollars. We've actually developed our own playbook. We really wrote it all down. We talked about what was happening we knew would happen again. And we had to dust off some of those plans and numbers from 12, 13 years ago from 22 years ago. And we've turned that playbook in gaining market share and focusing on operational discipline and operational excellence, especially in the face of economic headwinds. And as the economy has started to recover, whether it's in 2010, or even in 2002, we were able to radically accelerate our growth. I have to tell you, when we went back as a team and we looked at the numbers, even I was really shocked to see kind of how things change some of the decisions that we made, but then how we all of a sudden were able to navigate so well, and use that as an opportunity to adjust the company in all -- in a number of really critical and strategic areas. Now I've always believed since that point, especially, that an economic crisis creates these opportunities, and we're squarely in that moment, and we've acted. Starting in July of this year, the buying environment became more measured and foreign exchange headwinds were becoming increasingly complex. We told you then we didn't believe this challenging macro environment was going to be a short-term problem. And you know we're not economists. You know that we don't know exactly what is happening or when the recovery will happen, et cetera, but we do see a lot, and I think we understand a lot about what's going on, because we have such strong global data. And we're not assuming that this economy gets any better anytime soon. We're just reporting what we see with our customers, the kind of changes they make, when they start to feel these headwinds. We're following our playbook to make sure we\u2019re well positioned to gain market share, to increase our profitability, to focus on our operating margin, to focus on the growth of our revenue and be able to continue to invest, especially when the economy recovers. Now for this fiscal year, we're maintaining our revenue guidance of $30.9 billion to $31 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. And you saw that, that also included that incremental foreign exchange headwind, and it's even an expected incremental $100 million of foreign exchange headwind just since last quarter. We're raising our fiscal year 2023 non-GAAP operating margin guidance from 20.4% to 20.7%, an expansion of 200 basis points year-over-year, and I expect a lot more, especially with this increased focus we have on expanding our operating margin. Salesforce is mission-critical to nearly every Fortune 1000 company, because every company is becoming a customer company. And everyone knows that this is the time during a crisis like this that you need to focus on your customers. If you need to do one thing, if there's one critical thing that every company has to do to get through this, is to make sure they maintain their relationships with their customers. It's a critical part of navigating through this time, and you're not going to be successful if you don\u2019t stay connected with your customers. We're signing transformational deals with major brands, as every industry continues to digitally transform and that continues to be perhaps the most important initiative of every company, regardless of the economic situation. When you look at this by industry, it's slightly different for each industry. In telecom, we're working with almost every major players. They transform how they connect with their customers. All telcos must deliver faster, better service to customers, keeping their costs down, focusing on their NPS score, becoming more competitive. We all know that. It's a highly competitive industry. We all understand the dynamics well. It's one of the reasons why we've done so well in all these global telecom companies. But I really want to talk to you about a great example, and this deal that we signed with T-Mobile in the quarter. Now we've done a lot of work with Mike and with T-Mobile over the years, and that's been very exciting to see how they built their company and especially how they've executed the merger and now they have a treeing amazing transformational opportunity on how they work with businesses, and we're working with them to develop a vision for the next-generation user experience for T-Mobile for Business and our professional services team is leading that charge. Financial Services, well, that's another industry that's been going through one of the most incredible digital transformations, but it's an incredible moment for them actually. It's why we're working with all the major financial service companies to drive stronger client relationships and to unite their teams to be more effective, especially in this environment. It's a golden time for financial services in many ways. A great example is Bank of America, who I think has been a customer for more than 20 years, and we've been with them through many different financial crisis. But in a short amount of time, they've increased productivity and reduce their technical debt. They're saving time and money, they're connecting with their customers in new base. It's a tremendous relationship with BofA to become their CRM standard. We're delighted to have such great success with them over many decades and to expand this relationship to the business bank, to the corporate bank and the investment bank, it's really an expansion. And I just want to thank Brian for his tremendous loyalty, but also his partnership over so many decades, and it's just a great organization to work with every single day. Well, before I go on, first of all, I want to give you an invitation. I hope that, you'll all plan to join us in New York City next week, where we're going to host our Salesforce world tour on December 8. Join us in person or online, where we're going to announce some new innovations. And you're going to hear from our incredible customers and so much more. Now before I end, I have to say something, and it's something that I did not want to say ever, and I'm extremely sad to tell you that, Bret Taylor is going to be leaving the company. Bret and I are like brothers. I love him very deeply. He's an incredible person. And one of the great joys of my company has been having him here. And I'll tell you, for me, this has been a feeling of tremendous loss. I'm experiencing that right now. You can probably hear it in my voice. It makes me think of all the great people that we have actually lost in the company over the time as well, so many great leaders of our industry, but especially now with Bret. This is just really hard for me, and I'm extremely sad to see him go. I know he has created two great companies. I know he wants to go create a third great company. And you can't keep a wild tiger in a cage. And we got to let them be free and let him go, and I understand, but I don't like it. And Bret, you know that you're always going to be our brother. You know that you -- we love you very deeply, that you have a home here. We're going to try to get you back somehow. So don't think that you're going to somehow get out of this alive, because you're not. And you're always going to be part of our Ohana. And we are really upset about this, and it's going to be a difficult moment for us. But I know that you're going to be with us through the end of the year, and I know you're going to continue to work with us even after this point. But Bret, we love you, and we're so sorry to see you leave the company at the end of this year. Bret Taylor : Thank you, Marc. It's hard to follow that and trying to keep my composure as well. I just want to start, Marc, by just expressing how deeply grateful I am to you. And just as importantly, the entire Salesforce team. For the past six-plus years, I just couldn't have imagined it when I joined the company, I could not be more proud of the trust, innovation and customer success we've delivered in my time here, particularly over the past few years, I think this amazing community has helped every organization in the world to remain connected to their customers amidst a public health crisis, the economic turmoil, this global pandemic. It's just incredible, and I'm incredibly grateful. And Marc, you personally, you've been my mentor long before I joined this company. And in the past six years, your relationship has definitely become the most significant in my professional career. I would not be the leader, I am today without you, and I cannot thank you enough for our friendship and our partnership. The past few years have been tumultuous for all of us, and I've recently been reflecting what's been truly important to me. And while there is absolutely no easy time for a transition like this, I really do feel that now is the right time for me to return to my entrepreneurial roots, particularly given the technology landscape and the economy going through such tectonic shifts. Salesforce has never been stronger, and I've never been more confident in the future of the company. And as Marc said, I will remain as co-CEO through the end of the fiscal year, not only to ensure a smooth transition, but most importantly, to ensure that we have a strong close to the quarter and a strong close to the fiscal year. And as Marc said, even after this transition, I will always, always be a part of this company and always be a part of this community. As Marc said, we had a solid quarter, top -- double-digit top and bottom line performance, demonstrating the strength of our business model and our commitment to operating with discipline and delivering profitable growth at scale. We continue to deliver on organic innovation, and our product portfolio is strategically positioned, mission-critical and highly differentiated. Our ecosystem and our app exchange marketplace are unparalleled in the industry. And as Marc mentioned, as you saw at Dreamforce, our innovation engine is an overdrive, with Genie, Slack canvas, Net Zero Marketplace and more, building on our position as a leader in nearly every CRM category. Genie, in particular, makes every part of our Customer 360 platform more automated, intelligent and real-time, driving faster time to value for our customers. And the adoption of Genie by our customers, particularly this past Cyber week, has exceeded all of our expectations. The Genie Customer Data Cloud is already processing literally over 100 billion customer records on average every single day. During Cyber Week alone, Genie ingested an astonishing 1.1 trillion records and enabled 43 billion consumer engagements for our customers. Inter, a leading digital banking service company in Brazil, is a great example of Genie's power. Inter was able to consolidate six data systems into one, and they are converting 35 times more customers with Genie. Like Marc, I met with hundreds of CEOs across every industry over the last few months. In this buying environment, our customers are increasingly focused on three things. First is time to value. Our customers need to quickly get the benefits of their technology investments. Second is ensuring these digital transformation projects drive cost savings in addition to customer satisfaction and top line growth. And third, we know our customers need to consolidate their platforms and vendor relationships to reduce complexity and risk and to drive efficiency. We are delivering on all three at scale today for our customers. Our customers are seeing on average an estimated 25% in savings in their IT costs and 26% increase in employee productivity using Salesforce according to a recent survey of more than 3,500 of our customers. RBC Wealth Management is a great example. RBC is onboarding new customers in minutes instead of days, and they've consolidated over 26 technology systems into one using our Customer 360 platform, decreasing their maintenance costs by 50%. Despite the economic headwinds that Marc mentioned, we had record low revenue attrition again this quarter, which is a testament to just how mission-critical Salesforce is to our customers, especially in this environment. We also launched new product bundles for sales, service, marketing and analytics. These product bundles are enabling our customers to consolidate their tools on Salesforce, driving efficient growth. We're also closing transformational deals and multi-cloud expansions. This quarter, seven of our top 10 deals included five or more of our clouds. Now let's turn to the cloud performance. Sales Cloud, our flagship, continues to drive sales productivity for the world's most important brands. Sales Cloud grew 12% year-over-year, a healthy 17% in constant currency, including great customer wins at companies like Bolt, Snowflake and Thermo Fisher. Service Cloud continues to help our customers deliver exceptional customer service experiences and reduce their customer service costs. Service Cloud grew 12% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency, approaching $2 billion in revenue for the quarter, with wins at Carl Zeiss, Dell and Fujitsu. Our Marketing and Commerce Clouds power the digital customer experiences for the world's greatest retailers and browns around the world, and together grew 12% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency, thanks to wins at companies like Banco Bradesco, Hugo Boss and Slack. We just passed Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and I want to express my gratitude to our engineering teams. Our engineering teams again delivered unparalleled mission-critical reliability and scale to retailers around the world. Even lapping the pandemic, the sales process for our Commerce Cloud in Cyber Week increased 11% year-over-year. And our Marketing Cloud delivered nearly 49 billion messages in Cyber Week alone, up 21% year-over-year. We've now sent 1.4 trillion messages from our Marketing Cloud so far this year, just incredible. Our platform business, which includes Slack, grew 18% or 22% in constant currency, highlighted by wins at Japan Airlines, WorkSafe, Victoria and Zoom. Einstein Artificial Intelligence platform is now generating 194 billion predictions every single day across the Salesforce Customer 360 platform, up 57% year-over-year. And Slack, which now powers collaboration and workflows across the entire Customer 360, grew 46% year-over-year. Slack is now handling more than 2.6 billion actions every single day and had great wins this quarter with companies like Rivian and Verizon. Data, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau, continues to be core to every digital transformation at every single one of our customers. Data grew 13% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency. We're seeing strong demand from MuleSoft, which reaccelerated in the quarter to 19% year-over-year growth or 23% in constant currency, with wins at brands like Western Union, SmileDirectClub and Kona. Integration transactions on the MuleSoft platform grew to $6.7 billion per day, up 33% year-over-year. Tableau grew at 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency, with wins in the quarter at Inter and McLaren Racing. As a reminder, due to the way we recognize revenue in MuleSoft and Tableau, when the macro environment is difficult, we typically see the effects earlier and more pronounced in these businesses. We're confident in the opportunity ahead for Tableau, and we recently made changes to reaccelerate Tableau growth. This includes new leadership, and as importantly, new product integrations like revenue intelligence, a deep integration between Sales Cloud and Tableau that has become one of our fastest-growing add-on products. And finally, as we mentioned every quarter, our industry solutions continue to be a strength in our portfolio, with out-of-the-box processes that enable our customers to achieve faster time to value and lower implementation costs. Even with the many successes in the quarter, we expect this increasingly challenging buying environment to continue next year. I'm confident that, Salesforce has never been more mission critical to our customers in this environment. And to wrap, I'm so grateful for our employees, our 80 million Trailblazers, and all of our customers and partners for helping lead the way with innovation, agility and resilience to navigate in these times. And before I pass it to you, Amy, I just want to express my personal gratitude to you. As I became the first-time CEO and you became a first-time CFO navigating the company and navigating our customers through these crisis, I'm so grateful for our relationship and for everything this company has done for me. Amy Weaver : Great. Bret, thank you. And let me just start by saying you, it has truly been a joy to work with you for the last six years. I am going to miss you carefully, but I'm also equally excited for you on your next steps, and I know they will be incredible success again. So taking that left turn to our results here. I am pleased to report another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. Despite increasing macro pressure, revenue grew nearly 20% in constant currency. And as we discussed at our Investor Day in September, it's a new day for profitability. I'm very proud of our Salesforce team and all of our employees for generating record operating margin during Q3. Reiterating Marc's comments, profitable growth is a major focus as we lean in on best-in-class operational excellence across all aspects of our business. As customers focus on optimizing time to value, driving cost savings and consolidating platforms and vendor relationships, we remain well positioned to support them through the current economic environment. Now to our results for Q3 fiscal year 2023, I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the third quarter was $7.84 billion, up 14% year-over-year, or 19% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to be a headwind to our results, as the dollar further strengthened throughout the quarter. For Q3, the total FX impact was $300 million, approximately $50 million more than we had forecast. A few highlights from the quarter. Again, as we outlined at Investor Day, we have three balanced growth pillars : Customer 360 Advantage, industry solutions and geographical expansion. All of these continue to reflect the growing adoption of our portfolio across our customer base. First, multi-cloud adoption by our customer base continues. Customers with five or more clouds increased ARR by over 20%. Second, our industry solution continues to be a strong tailwind to our revenue growth. Seven of our 13 industry clouds grew ARR above 50% this quarter. In some of the highest performing industries, clouds in the quarter included energy and utilities, manufacturing and our recently announced Automotive Cloud. Finally, from a geographical perspective, Americas grew 16% year-over-year, EMEA grew 10%, 23% in constant currency, and APAC grew 14%, which is 30% in constant currency. And as you have heard, revenue attrition in Q3 was again below 7.5%, reflecting the value that our services are providing to the customer base in this tough operating environment. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was a strong 22.7%, driven by our ongoing focus on disciplined execution, our hiring slowdown and resource prioritization. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.21 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.40. Mark-to-market accounting of the company's strategic investments increased GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by $0.02. Operating cash flow was $313 million in Q3, down 23% year-over-year. CapEx $198 million, resulting in free cash flow of $115 million, down 52% year-over-year, both driven by lower billings. Turning to remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract. RPO ended Q3 at approximately $40 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, was approximately $20.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 15% in constant currency. This includes one point of incremental FX headwinds beyond our Q3 guidance. And finally, Q3 was a milestone corridor for Salesforce. After announcing our first ever share repurchase program on the last earnings call, I am pleased to share that we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders during Q3. Before moving to our guidance, I'd like to comment on the current economic environment. You recall that last quarter we noted measured customer buying behavior really beginning in July. This led to elongated sales cycles, additional deal approval layers and deal compression, particularly in enterprise. As Q3 progressed, we saw an even more challenging buying environment, driving intense customer scrutiny on every investment dollar to ensure the highest return possible. During Q3, this behavior was most pronounced in our US and major European markets, while Japan remains more resilient. From an industry perspective, the most impacted was retail, consumer goods and communications and media, while the more resilient for travel and hospitality, manufacturing, automotive and energy. And from a product perspective, we continue to see customer spending pressure in commerce and marketing. Now to our guidance. First, on revenue, we are pleased to maintain our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance of $30.9 billion to $31 billion representing 17% growth year-over-year or 20% in constant currency despite an incremental $100 million FX headwind since our last call. This raises the total year-over-year FX headwind to $900 million. In addition, our guidance includes flat at slightly above $1.5 billion. As you've already heard, we are deeply committed to expanding our profitability over the long term. I am proud that, we are raising our fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 20.7%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. And this guidance also includes approximately 75 basis points of headwind from Slack. As a reminder, because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same currencies, there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin. For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.35 to $1.37. For the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.55 to $0.57 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.92 to $4.94. CRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be approximately 7% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency. This guidance continues to incorporate the more challenging trends in our customer behavior, as previously discussed. We now expect our fiscal 2023 operating cash flow guidance to be approximately 16%, which is at the lower end of our previous guidance, driven by lower billings. This includes a three-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes, requiring the capitalization certain R&D costs. We now expect CapEx to be approximately 2.5% of revenue for the fiscal year. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 17% for the fiscal year. Before I close, I'd like to share a few thoughts on fiscal year 2024. As discussed, we are experiencing a very unpredictable macro environment as our customers are looking to ensure their businesses are also healthy for the long term. Compounding that dynamic is an unprecedented foreign currency market. Therefore, at this time, we believe it will be pretty sure to provide revenue guidance for the next fiscal year. Now in terms of operating margin, we are driving operating discipline and following our playbook that Marc discussed to ensure that we are consistently expanding our operating margin in the face of top line headwinds. And as the leadership team, we're continuing to take a hard look at our cost structure. This is all part of our playbook, and we will continue to take steps that drive profitable growth. Of note, we intend to provide full FY 2024 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. So to close, we are helping our customers navigate the current macro environment by bringing much needed efficiencies to their digital strategy with a compelling value case. Our commitment to disciplined decision-making is unwavering, and we are marching towards our fiscal 2026 target of at least 25% non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of any capital allocation decision. And as our business grows, we will continue to target returning on average 30% to 40% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders. Now, Mike, should we open up the call for questions. Mike Spencer : That's good. Thank you, Amy. Bo, we'll go to Q&A and we'll take the first question. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Spencer. [Operator Instructions] We take our first question this afternoon of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking my questions. Maybe one for Marc and one for Amy. Marc, on the leadership change or Bret leaving, we're also very sorry to see Bret leaving. He is a great addition to the team. I guess the good news is there's already a CEO and you set to go. But should we expect a replacement for Bret on a going-forward basis? Are you going to look to go back to that kind of co-CEO dynamic or replace kind of what he was doing on a day-to-day basis with some other executive on a go-forward basis? And then I guess for Amy, at the Analyst Day, you talked about a more back-end loaded operating margin trajectory towards that 25%. Any change in that dynamic given kind of what's going on in the macro environment and seeing kind of the degradation on the top line? Does that push operating margin? Does that sort of push operating margin expansion to the kind of the forefront in any way? Marc Benioff : Well, thanks, Keith. And I think it's a great question. And obviously, we're still in a little bit of shock and extremely sad and feeling a lot of loss for losing Bret. Again, I don't have to tell you, one of the best people ever to have worked with in my life and also just a great person. And I have to also tell you that we have a lot of fantastic people in the company, and Bret's management team, what we call the ELT here at Salesforce, includes some incredible people who have been with us in some cases for decades. And they're some of our most capable and incredible people, and I think you know a lot of them, Keith, very well on a personal level as well. And I couldn't -- I have to tell you, I couldn't be more proud of Bret and everything he has done in the last seven years. But while we have a huge light on Bret, I think it would be unfair to not also put a huge light on these other managers and leaders in the company who have done such a great job, whether it's our product leaders or operational leaders, geographic leaders, many of them who you know and have met over the years, whether it was at Dreamforce's or World Tours or at Investor Days, whether it is people who do our impact work or philanthropy work or human resources, our incredible marketing leaders, many of whom we have such deep personal relationships with because we've done such unbelievable marketing in the company now for so long. Folks who have joined us after acquiring their companies, and we have many of those folks as well, and which is also how we ended up with Bret when we bought this company, and people who are doing work in core work in our areas like the quality and sustainability, as well as operational leaders, where we've brought in some great new folks recently from organizations who are bringing us a new level of operational excellence. I don't have to tell you, I think we have the finest engineering team in the world, the leaders in engineering and some of them are what we call boomerangs, people left and didn't find greener pastures, and came back to reclaim their leadership positions and the company are probably the greatest. They don't have to call out my co-founder, who you know very well, Parker Harris, who happens to be in Tokyo today and not on the call because he's running a world tour with our phenomenal team there, delivered what I expect to be shortly the second largest software company in Japan, and on and on and on. But I do want to bring it back to Bret, because this is his moment, and I think it's very important that we really send him the appropriate gratitude and also a call out. And until he walks out the door, don't worry, I'm going to be keeping - trying to keep recruiting him back and I am a good salesman Keith, as you know me very well. And it's not -- the deal is not over until it's over, but we do have to tell you that he has decided to leave. But I tell people all the time, we lose deals all the time, Keith. And for me, I never lose. I keep going back until, I win, Brian, how long have you been in the company now? Brian Millham : 23 years. Marc Benioff : 23 years. Is that true, Brian? Brian Millham : Yes, it\u2019s true. Marc Benioff : And do you feel like I [Indiscernible]? Brian Milham : Yes, you will. Marc Benioff : Yes. And I'll break him down\u2013 - . So he's in trouble. All right. Amy? Amy Weaver : Okay, Keith, turning over to operating margin. As I mentioned, we are very committed to being 25% or above by FY \u201926. Now we're not giving a guide for FY\u201924 at this moment. So I'm not going to comment on the linearity. I will say that, this is just a huge focus for the entire company. I think we've really shown that with our current quarter at 22.7%, which is an all-time record high. And this is coming not just from one area or one silver bullet, but really from a commitment and a disciplined approach across all parts of the company, whether it is sale, G&A, marketing, finance, the list goes on, [Indiscernible] were contributing. One thing that we're particularly focused on are structural changes. So, we\u2019ve certainly driven down workforce costs by the much more measured approach to hiring that we have had this year. We also look to our cost of goods sold [Indiscernible] third-party cost efficiencies. We tightly prioritize T&A this year to prioritize customer-facing travel. And we are also benefiting from choices that we have made in the past and continue to review around our real estate footprint. So again, the commitment is here. I'm excited to see where we can go, and I think we're already putting the necessary tools in place. Operator : Thank you. We take our next question now from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Yes. Thank you very much. Bret, happy trails, and thanks for everything. Marc, I wanted to ask you if you think that this volatile environment is going to be fully conducive to remote work -- or do you see some of your employees may be gravitating back a little more to in-office, and Amy relatedly and since you just mentioned it, could you touch on the plans for the real estate footprint, including the Salesforce Tower and the other buildings? And just help us understand maybe how that could contribute to margin expansion? Marc Benioff : Yes, absolutely. And First, Mark, I hope that you see that the operating margin in this quarter, which has hit a record level at 22.7%, that we are fulfilling our commitment to you and to others that we are deeply focused on this. And you're 100% right, that there's a lot of things pre-pandemic that we had in our company that are expenses that we don't need post-pandemic. Now in regards to being in the office, well, all of us are in the office today. And there is no remote workers here. And it's an interesting metaphor, but there's companies that I work with very closely. And I have to tell you, someone who's influenced me greatly is the CEO of Honeywell, Darius, and [Indiscernible] and the Board member, Robin Washington. And he's made a plea for me for many years that he has factory workers and those factory workers still every single day during the pandemic were in the factory. And that it's a very critical part of how he runs this business. And when I have advocated for new kinds of work and folks having the flexibility in their working environment to remember is factory workers. And I think he's absolutely right and 100% correct. Well, I would also say we have factory workers. Now today, we are the factory workers. The work that we're doing is required here in our factory. And you know where that factory is very well, Mark. You know where we are. And we have different factories, around the world that we call our towers and our hubs and core offices. But I think we also realize and I think that even Darius would agree with me, that the percentage of folks who are working remotely is going to be higher. So before the pandemic the percentage of remote workers for Salesforce was approximately 20%. For other companies now, we're seeing that normalize at somewhere around 50% even with mandatory workdays. So I do think that we're going to have a rebalancing. I think even at Salesforce, we have what I would call factory jobs, folks that do are required to be here, whether they are doing maybe very core work or even new folks who don't have maybe the tribal knowledge yet or need the mentorship or folks coming in from college who benefit from being in the office. But we're never going back to how it was. We all know that. I'm sure a lot of you actually are at home right now. And before this, even maybe your companies, especially the banks, especially the New York banks and some of those New York bank leaders who have made impassioned pleas for return to work. But even though many of you who belong to some of those banks, I bet you're not at those offices right now. And I think we are in a new world, and we all realize that. But I think that we're finding a new way forward and there will be more in office, and there will be -- but we'll maintain the flexibility to be at home. And I will call out one more thing, which is probably one of the most successful things we've done is come up with new ways to work, and you've probably been down with the Salesforce Ranch, and we'll have about 10,000 of our employees go through that this year in training and collaboration sessions, and we'll find other new ways to work. And that's also one of the reasons why we acquired Slack. And I think why we've seen just great growth in Slack, why Slack channels are so important, why you saw the tremendous new multimedia environment in Slack? And we have got quite a few other surprises coming in regards to the integration between Slack and Customer 360 and line of business capabilities and other areas regarding systems of record involving Slack. And all of that's because we're in a new way to work, and we're going to need new tools. So that's how I look at it, Marc. I'm trying to be straight, honest with you, that you have to have a beginner's mind, and we're finding our way through this. And we're going to have more in work in the office, but we're never going to go back to how it was. Brian, do you want to talk about what you're doing with your organization? Brian Millham : Yes, Marc, I appreciate it, and certainly don't want to contradict anything that you said, but -- I just -- Marc Benioff : Go ahead, Brian. Why should today be any different?. Brian Millham : Yes, agreed, Mark, I really believe that being together drives more learning, better collaboration, better networking and better enablement. We have a broad portfolio of products and we saw through the pandemic that we -- there's a lot to learn around the way that we're positioning our products, new organic products coming out, acquisitions that we're positioning our Customer 360 -- to our customers. And so I really like people coming back in the office. I like that connection that we have to one another, I think, it\u2019s part of our culture and how we operate, I've asked my team recently to spend more time in the office. But importantly, I've also asked them to spend more time in front of our customers. It's a big differentiation for us, when we're out talking to our customers and driving the success that they expect from us. And so I want to drive higher productivity and the performance culture and one of the ways, I want to do that to ensure that we're spending more time together, whether that's in the office or out in front of our customers. Amy Weaver : Great. And so then Mark, turning to your question about how that may assess our real estate strategy and margin and savings going forward. So over the past two years, we have continued to re-imagine our real estate strategy. That is not only to optimize for scale, but also continue hybrid work environment and how people are working and how they're using their space? And this has included reducing our footprint fairly significant right now. Some of that you see when we do large write-offs over these times, but a lot of it has also been opportunistic. When leases come up, and we don't renew when we consolidate into areas. It's something that we are continuing to benefit from. It is also seeing that we are continuing to evaluate. We have a new head of real estate Relina Bulchandani, who is doing an incredible job along the deeper share and really looking at every aspect of our real estate and say how we use it the best and the most efficiently in this new world. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Mark. Bo, let's go to the next question. Operator : Certainly. We'll take our next question now from Raimo Lenschow at Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to -- a question for Brian. As you kind of started diluting already on the initiatives you're taking here, like how should we think about -- what are you seeing in terms of what -- in the field in terms of there's macro, but it's also relatively a decent penetration of Salesforce. Like how do you think this will play out? And how do you see your sales force position in terms of sales capacity, et cetera, which kind of sell its important? Thank you. Brian Millham : Thanks, Raimo, for the question and really appreciate it. Certainly, the buyer environment has changed out there in the market. It's become more measured. But our platform is still mission critical to every one of our customers out there, and we're seeing that play out in the demand environment. The pipeline that we're creating is very healthy in the market right now. The interest in our customers C360 platform remains very high. We've repositioned our products and our selling teams to sell not just to the CEO, but to the CFO, actually across the entire C-suite. We want to make sure that we're covering off everybody that could potentially say yes or no to a buying process. We're going to focus on what we can control. We have plenty of capacity in the market right now. We have lots of AEs that we've hired over the past couple of years. And we want to make sure that we're doing the things that we can to continue to grow market share across the entire portfolio. We continue to see multi-cloud expansion. You mentioned that. We think we have a huge opportunity to continue to sell to our existing customers, more of the products that are in our portfolio, both inorganic and the acquired companies that we have. And so we still see a big opportunity for us to spend a lot of time with our customers, selling the entire product portfolio. And the size of our selling base, the customers that we have still a very big opportunity for us to expand our TAM and execute on our growth strategies. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Raimo. Bo, let's go to next question. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. And Bret, best of luck to you. It's been a pleasure. My question is for Marc. Marc, you have a lot of pressure out there from all kinds of investors to drive profitability, including some activists. But paradoxically, it would seem an amazing time to put money to work with all the dislocation of the world creating opportunity. How do you do both at the same time? Marc Benioff : Yes. Thank you Brad for the question, because I think it's probably what's on my mind every day. And first, before I go to the question, I want to go back to Raimo, and Raimo, I want to tell you that our thoughts and prayers are with your CEO for a full recovery, and we're so sorry to hear about his diagnosis, and Barclays is such an important partner of ours, but your CEO is so fantastic and we're thinking of him every single moment right now. So Brad, you're right. We are in a moment here were one of our goals, strong goals, as you can see by these results is to increase our operating margin. And we're not going to do anything that's going to prevent that increased momentum. And as a shareholder myself, that's my thought every single day. We also realize we want to reduce dilution. That's also why we're doing our stock buyback. And we've talked about that extensively. It's been extremely important. I think that we bought back a considerable amount of stock during the quarter that we, I think, set a goal that we're going to buy back about $10 billion. And I think that we have bought back an extensive amount I think, over $1 billion in the quarter. Amy Weaver : Yes, about 11 million shares, $1.7 billion returned to shareholders this quarter. Marc Benioff : So I think that's extremely important as an action. So reducing dilution is very important to us, an increase in our operating margin is very important to us, increasing our profitability, but this is a massive opportunity. Every company is going through a digital transformation. You and I both know very well, it's all begins and ends with the customer, and that's why we're closing these incredible transactions globally. At the same time, you know that there's all kinds of opportunities out there, but it has to be balanced and we have to weigh those. And I think some of the transactions that we were able to do in the past, when we're a smaller company, a more tactical company or maybe some more from the hit from an acquisition perspective, and I think we've done, I don't know, Amy, would you say more than 60 transactions or more. Amy Weaver : Yes, 60-70 probably over the years. Marc Benioff : So as we do even the smallest transaction to the largest, it has a different frame and a different calculation. Look, it's one of the reasons why we recruited Mike to the company. He had the background, and you all know Mike from Microsoft, because we wanted that kind of financial discipline. Amy and I talked about it very closely. As she came in, we spent a lot of time thinking about who we would recruit and as we identified somebody who could guide us specifically in that area, we picked Mike, and this was important. And we've also made other major changes to Amy's team so that she had the best A-team possible. And now when we look at this going forward, we want to do it all. We want to continue to grow revenue, we want to continue to grow our operating margin and we want to look at strategic opportunities. But we're not going to do that at the expense of our operating margin. We're going to continue to grow it. And I think you know at Investor Day, we said that, we have the short-term goal of 25 points. But I think that the reality is, is that we like to feed our targets, and we're not going to get crazy with you on this call, but we're doing everything we can to make these numbers go up, and we will continue to do that in all these areas that you see and you know the company, as well as anybody who's been inside and outside this company, you know every single part of it. You know that we have lots of opportunities, lots of levers, lots of things that we can do. I think that you also watched us very closely through 2008 and 2009. And you can see how we acted then to increase operating margin, and we are going to continue to do everything we can to make this the best company possible, best numbers and also the highest values in the industry and be an example for others as well. Brad Zelnick : Thanks, Bret. Mike Spencer : Bo, let's go to the next question. Operator : Certainly. We'll take that now from Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much. I'll add my best wishes to Bret on his next endeavors. Maybe this one is for Brian. Brian, you mentioned that the pipeline bill levels still remain healthy. I was just kind of curious, if you could talk to us a little bit about industries that are seemingly more impacted for you all due to the macro backdrop and maybe products? And kind of what's your thought process on some of the sales elongation that you've been seeing? I assume that, you're not expecting it to change anytime in the near term. But I was just wondering, if you could just talk to us about industries and products in particular that might be getting hit a little bit harder or perhaps those that are hanging in there better than others? Thanks. Brian Millham : Yes. Thanks for the question. I think starting with the ones that are hanging in there better. Travel and hospitality was a strength for us in the quarter. Our manufacturing industry really bounced back this quarter and was very good. Automotive was very strong for us in the quarter, and energy was also quite strong. On the other side, we felt a little bit of pressure on our tech industry right now and great relationships and big customers there, but that's an industry that we did not see acceleration in the quarter. And some of the other industries were sort of flat. Financial Services as an example, was relatively flat in the quarter. And so one of the strengths that we did have, though, I will say, is our industry clouds. And the more investment we make in our industry cloud, we're seeing acceleration there, very good growth in the quarter as we invest in those products, we're seeing great penetration. We're seeing higher close rates. We're also seeing better retention rates, which is obviously very important to us as we think about the customer success of our base. we're able to get deals done faster speaking to customers' language and showing up with products that match up to their requirements very well. And I'm sorry I missed the other part of your question, if you wouldn't mind repeating it. Kirk Materne : Just any products that you'd call out, and we obviously see the revenue, but I was just kind of curious on a bookings basis. Brian Millham : Yes. And I think as Marc mentioned earlier in his commentary about some of the products that get cut early in a downturn, marketing spend would be one that we see impacted fairly early on marketing automation. CEOs make quick action, and that's a quick action, and that's a quick place to sort of pull back on marketing. We did see less expansion on sales and service in the quarter on incremental users as our customers started to maybe do a little less hiring. Maybe they paused hiring we saw less expansion on the Sales Cloud users and Service Cloud users. And certainly, Commerce has been one where we had a great run up over the past couple of years during the pandemic, and we've seen a bit of a slowdown on Commerce. And so those would be a couple of examples of some of the products that are seeing a bit of headwinds in these times. Brian Millham : There's been kind of interesting anecdote there around commerce. In our Commerce Cloud, obviously, we have blowout numbers in Cyber Week despite lapping the pandemic, but it was interesting, commerce page views were up 14%, but commerce orders were only up 2%. So you can see not only our customers' impact, but even the consumer behaviors becoming more measured, and we're obviously a B2B company, but all consumer companies are seeing this right now and sort of doing more or less and a lot of people browsing for products and buying a little bit less than they did last year, which I thought was very interesting. Kirk Materne : That's great. Mike Spencer : Great. Thanks, Kirk. Bo, let's take our last question now. Operator : Certainly. That last question will come from Sarah Hindlian-Bowler at Macquarie Capital. Sarah Hindlian-Bowler: Great. Thank you so much. I really appreciate you squeezing me in. And I'll add my congratulations and best wishes to you, Bret. Hopeful that you have an incredible opportunity in front of you. This was a question for Amy. I think one topic that we touched on, you mentioned briefly on the call where your retention rates, which continues to be a great way to add revenue that's really high margins. So maybe we could drill down into that a little bit, what you're doing to drive your retention rates higher? And maybe how some of the product bundling or suite strategy plays into that would be helpful as well? Thanks Amy. Amy Weaver : So Sarah, let me start by saying, it's great to have you back as a covering analyst for our stock and to hear your voice on this call. Yes, on attrition or retention rates, I'm really, really pleased to see where we were this quarter. Again, record lows. I think it says so much about our team to support that, but also our customers and their occasion to us and the size of sales force has become so mission-critical. I'm actually going to turn this over to Brian, because if there is an expert in the company on attrition and what we're doing for our customers, it's Brian. So Brian, do you want to add on thing? Brian Millham : Amy, thank you. I appreciate it. I'll quickly address it. Thank you, Sarah, for the question. First of all, I think it's part of our heritage, our DNA, as a customer success is the core value of ours, and we own it across the entire company. So it's not just the success teams with services teams that the entire organization from product to our financial teams. Everyone owns customer success. We've made some investments in the way that we go to market touching our customers more frequently from a success perspective, and the motions that we're running. As I mentioned earlier, customers from the industry cloud perspective, where we're seeing better adoption rates there and better usage. We've also made some strategic investments in our own services organization alongside a great ecosystem of partners as well that are driving better implementations upfront, faster time to value for our customers and better results from a customer success perspective. And some of the motions that we're running that are new, great leadership under a gentleman named Jim Roth, who's running our success organization; Lori Steele, who joined us to run our services organization; and now has turned over the reins to Mark Wakelin, doing great work with our customers, very oriented to speed to value and ensuring they're getting tremendous customer success on our platform. Mike Spencer : Great. Thanks, Sarah. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and we look forward to seeing everyone over the next few weeks. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Again, ladies and gentlemen, that will include Salesforce's Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Results Call. I'd like to thank you all so much for joining us, and wish you all a great evening. Goodbye.",

Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements.  And with that, let me hand the call to Marc. Marc Benioff : Thanks, Mike, and hey, thanks to all of you for joining the call. As you can see from our results, we had another strong quarter. Improving profitability is our highest priority, and that really showed up this quarter. Our goal is to make Salesforce the largest and most profitable software company in the world, and that is what we are doing.  Six months ago, in September at our Dreamforce Investor Day, we shared with you our comprehensive transformation plan, the new day for profitable growth. But things have changed. As we entered our fourth quarter, we recognized that we needed to radically accelerate the transformation plan timeframe. We needed to press the hyperspace button and bring the 2-year goals forward quickly and exceed them.  Now we immediately put into place an accelerated transformation plan in 4 areas : short-term and long-term restructuring of the company; improving profitability and productivity; prioritizing our core innovations; and a deeper and even stronger relationship with our shareholders, you. In fact, that's where we started.  The very first thing we did when I became sole CEO 3 months ago was Amy and I promoted Mike Spencer, our Head of IR, to our leadership team. So we're all in much more communication with all of you.  We're now moving aggressively across all 4 fronts of our transformation. First, we're reigniting our performance culture and doubling down on our accountable management of our sales organization, as you're about to hear from Brian. As you know, beginning in January, we also initiated a headcount reduction, and we're significantly consolidating our real estate footprint.  Second, we're more closely scrutinizing every dollar of investment and resource and very focused on driving operational excellence and automation across the business. Third, our amazing engineering team is focused on integrating our acquisitions and prioritizing our core innovations that are driving customer success.  And finally, as we set in motion, longer-term structural improvements, we're working with Bain on a comprehensive operating and go-to-market review. To ensure a high degree of accountability, our Board is forming a new business transformation committee, which I have joined, and we have fully disbanded our M&A committee as well to reflect our new focus.  We also dramatically stepped up our communication feedback loop with our investment community, and I hope you all are feeling that. For the past several months, all of us at Salesforce, including me, all of our Board members, including our Lead Independent Director, Robin Washington and our senior management team have spent a lot of time listening to and working with all of our investors. As I said, we've hit that hyperspace button since we last talked to you a quarter ago, and I'm thrilled with the progress we've made. Changes that used to take months are happening in weeks. Changes that used to take weeks are happening in days. And changes that used to take days are happening in hours.  Powered by this transformation, we delivered another strong quarter. Our team really delivered on both the top and bottom line, exceeding our expectations. As I said, improving our profitability is our highest priority. And in Q4, we accelerated operating margin to a new record high.  Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal '23 was 22.5%, significantly above our forecast, an improvement of almost 4 points year-over-year. Revenue was $8.38 billion, up 14% year-over-year or 17% in constant currency, which is above what we forecast to deliver for the quarter. And for the full year, we delivered $31.4 billion in revenue, up 18% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency. It's one of the best performances of any enterprise software company our size, and it's amazing that Salesforce is now over $30 billion in revenue.  We closed fiscal year '23 with operating cash flow reaching $7.1 billion, up 19% year-over-year, the highest cash flow in our company's history and one of the highest cash flows of any enterprise software company our size ever.  I also want to call out the great progress we have made with MuleSoft and Tableau. As you know, we've been focused over the past few quarters on reigniting MuleSoft sales growth, and this quarter was evidence that those efforts are paying off beautifully. MuleSoft was included in 7 of our top 10 deals in the quarter, and Tableau was included in every one of our top 10 deals.  These acquired products are integral to our Customer 360 and enabling our customers to use our data product line to achieve a new level of excellence in managing their customer relationships and its critical data. In short, our transformation has been radically accelerated. As you can see, our performance is significantly up already. Our productivity is also up. Our profitability is up, and we are not done.  Now we're putting into place the next phase of our transformation to profitable growth. We just rolled out our new business plan, which we call the V2MOM in partnership with our employees worldwide. Everyone in the company is now aligned around our highest priorities and our aspirations.  I'm excited to announce that looking forward to fiscal year '24, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%, an additional acceleration of 4.5 points year-over-year. And for fiscal year '24 revenue, we're guiding to $34.7 billion at the high end of the range, over 10% projected year-over-year growth. But that's not all, we're also looking at our overall share count.  And as we focus on reducing dilution, we've already returned $4 billion of the original $10 billion authorization in our share repurchase plan that we announced in August. And our Board has now approved a substantial increase in that share repurchase plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. This will allow us to fully offset dilution from stock-based compensation. We're also thrilled to welcome 3 new members to our Board, Mason Morfit, the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital; Arnold Donald, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation; and Sachin Mehra, the Chief Financial Officer of Mastercard, 3 amazing executives who have already made their mark on business, and I'm looking forward to them making their mark on Salesforce.  We're incredibly happy that these phenomenal executives are joining us to help guide our next level of profitable growth. That makes 5 new Board members we have brought on in just the past 16 months, another [import] (ph) of our accelerated transformation.  I also want to say how grateful we are to our 2 outgoing Board members, Sandy Robertson and Alan Hassenfeld, both of whom many of you know and who, for the last 2 decades, have given Salesforce and our industry incredible leadership, guidance and service. Thank you so much, Alan and Sandy. We know that we have the right team, the right strategy and the right products to compete and complete this transformation. And we're continuing to build our future. I've never been more inspired by our engineering teams, and it's no wonder that we're ranked #1 CRM by IDC for the ninth year in a row.  We're delivering tremendous customer success and continue to gain market share in CRM. Our customer revenue attrition is at its lowest level in our 24-year history. This is a critical metric of all of our customers' success. And we know every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. We have an incredible vision for the future of CRM, a fully integrated suite built on our new Genie Data Cloud and our next-generation platform powered by real-time hyperscale data, AI and automation.  Our new Data Cloud is the most exciting innovation that we've developed since the original Salesforce clouds and our metadata platform, which we viewed as our first horizon and our second horizon for our technology. Our third horizon is our data cloud. In this new AI world that we are all now entering, nothing is more important for our customers than our new data cloud, which is rapidly becoming the intelligent heart of their customer engagement.  Data cloud becomes our most important cloud, augmenting every Salesforce cloud and making every part of our Customer 360 more automated, more intelligent and more real time. We just launched Tableau plus Data Cloud natively integrating Tableau with Data Cloud. So every customer can easily visualize, automate, explore and act on their data in real time.  And during the quarter, I was inspired by partnering with Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford on Ford's deployment of Data Cloud. Jim and Ford, they're leveraging Data Cloud to unify their customer data and deliver personalized real-time customer engagement and dealer focus. Starting with their amazing new Mach-E electric Mustang, an amazing car Ford proactively updates customers about vehicle delivery through both e-mail and SMS with our marketing cloud. I loved getting my text actually, it was amazing. Ford delivers dealers now with leads and intelligent insights to drive faster sales with our Sales Cloud.  And their technicians, well, they're receiving the next best action and technical insights through our Service Cloud. All of this, all of it, it's driven by our data cloud, delivering intelligent, real-time and automated customer engagement from within the Salesforce platform.  I've also been very inspired by our work with Boston Scientific and their amazing CEO, Michael Mahoney. Our teams were able to use our Data Cloud to create a unified view of their customers. In just 5 months, they were able to bring data from the front office and back office and all of their systems together. Boston Scientific's ability to create customer segments using our Marketing Cloud went from 3 to 6 months to nearly real time, and they could deliver next best action insights to their sales teams in the flow of work in Sales Cloud and used our Marketing Cloud to deliver personalized product recommendations on their website in real time. And Boston Scientific as a regulated company, well, with Data Cloud, they're able to easily specify data retention policies for compliance.  Now as a longtime customer, I'll tell you, Boston Scientific and Michael, well, they've humbled me personally and really humbled all of us at Salesforce with their incredible innovations, their amazing leadership and especially their use of our Data Cloud.  This is only the beginning of what's possible. As we build more native automation, intelligence and real-time integration deeper into our Data Cloud and apps, and we're rebalancing our resources to be Data Cloud-first inside our company. And next week, at our TrailheadDX conference in San Francisco on March 7 and 8, you'll see how we're bringing even more innovation through our platform with our new EinsteinGPT technology, the world's first generative AI for CRM, a tremendous complement to our Data Cloud and core Einstein AI platform. EinsteinGPT will be integrated into all of our clouds as well as Tableau, MuleSoft and Slack.  And then there's another way we're opening the door to use AI for our future and for all of our customers', as we have begun working with the rapidly expanding AI ecosystem in our industry, I've been really impressed with how companies like Anthropic, a leading provider of generative AI, are using Slack as their user interface for generative AI assistance. The relevance of Slack as an incredible enterprise productivity platform, user interface and critical data set for these new AI systems, while it's inspiring all kinds of new use cases, I couldn't be more excited about the future.  To wrap it up, our transformation is happening now. We're making Salesforce one of the most profitable software companies in the world with one of the highest cash flows and one of the very largest as well. You can see it from our numbers by this quarter why I'm so motivated, so inspired and so confident that we can do even more faster than anyone realized.  Now I'm happy to hand this over to Brian, our Chief Operating Officer; and with Amy, our -- my closest partner in accelerating the transformation. Many of you know Brian and have worked closely with him, and as many global executive roles at Salesforce, Brian has now been with us for more than 23 years, and his employee number lucky 6 -- lucky 13, actually, it's lucky #13, Brian, that's you.  No one has had more customer success than you at Salesforce, and I couldn't be more thrilled to have you as our COO. I'm really grateful for your leadership and the success that you're having with your team, and wow, what a great quarter you delivered. Brian, thank you for everything.  In closing, I want to thank all of our Ohana, our employees, our customers, our partners and all of our shareholders for another strong quarter. And now, Brian, over to you. Brian Millham : Thank you, Marc. As Marc said, the accelerated transformation to profitable growth we have underway is already having a positive impact as reflected in our strong results in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased with how we're improving our execution, delivering customer success in the ongoing measured buying environment.  As part of our short-term and long-term restructuring, we've been re-architecting how we go to market in a more efficient, productive, and profitable way. We've reduced the size of the sales and success organization by 10% and are planning further improvements through the work we're doing with Bain.  We're also laser-focused on performance, productivity and accountability of all of our teams. We are better aligning incentives with margins, removing layers and increasing spans of control to unleash even higher performance. We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing and G&A.  We've learned that we needed to reboot our entire sales enablement process to ensure faster onboarding with reps able to better understand our entire product portfolio and speak the language of our customers in weeks, not months. During the pandemic, we saw productivity drop among our account executives who were working exclusively from home. I believe when our people are together, they're better learners, collaborators and networkers. It also reinforces our performance culture. That's why our sales, success and service teams or in front of our customers a minimum of 4 days a week. Getting together in person is accelerating enablement and driving our performance and productivity. I'm confident these changes will drive the outcomes that we are all looking for.  Now before I hand it off to Amy, I'll briefly share some customer highlights from the quarter. We had great customer wins across all products, industries, segments and geographies. We deepened our relationships with Walmart, State Farm, IBM, Siemens, the State of New York, Volkswagen Group, Hitachi and many more leading companies. I'm very proud of our teams that we recorded record low attrition once again this quarter, which is a testament to how our Customer 360 platform is providing the cost savings efficiency and productivity gains our customers need today.  As customers are looking to consolidate platforms and reduce complexity, we're seeing many multi-cloud expansions, a key growth strategy for us. Our top 10 wins in the quarter included 5 or more of our cloud. And our top 5 customer wins included 7 or more of our clouds. This is an example of our Customer 360 strategy working.  We also continue to see strong momentum from our vertical solutions, which deepened our customer relationships across industries and geographies while accelerating time to value. In the quarter, 8 of our 13 industry clouds grew above 50% ARR, just unbelievable results there. Verticals are a key driver of our growth strategy, and that's why we've amplified them aggressively in this year's V2MOM.  Tableau and MuleSoft and Slack continue to be highly relevant for our customers. And as Marc noted in his comments, they're part of our largest and most strategic deals in the quarter. And we're very proud of the progress we're seeing under the new leadership to more deeply integrate these acquired companies into our core sales and service motions.  Marc also mentioned Data Cloud. It's going to be an incredible driver of organic growth going forward as these new capabilities are built on the platform and seamlessly integrate into some of our largest clouds, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud. We're seeing many more companies use Data Cloud like Formula 1, American Family Insurance, PGA TOUR Superstore who are using this amazing technology to deliver intelligent, automated, and real-time customer engagement. It is a huge opportunity.  In closing, I'm immensely grateful to our customers, our employees and partners and our shareholders for their continued support. We are unwavering in our commitment to deliver customer success and in our transformation to profitable growth.  Now over to Amy. Amy Weaver : Thank you, Brian. It is great to be here today to talk about our financial results and the transformation underway. As we laid out at Investor Day in September, it is a new day for Salesforce. As Marc called out, we are focusing on 4 key areas : short- and long-term expense restructuring; employee productivity; product innovation; and of particular importance to me, continuing to build on our relationships with our shareholders.  Near our long-term restructuring is absolutely a necessary step to reach our goals. Over the past very intense 90 days since our last earnings call, Marc, Brian and I have spent countless hours together and with our leadership team to ensure our cost restructuring actions accelerate our profitable growth goals. We have already taken a difficult action on decreasing our workforce, and we are consolidating our real estate footprint.  I want to emphasize that these are just the first steps. As we drive longer-term structural improvements, I look forward to working closely across the company on a comprehensive operating and go-to-market review.  Since I took on the role of the CFO more than 2 years ago, I've truly enjoyed spending time with and hearing feedback from our shareholders. Just this past quarter, I was able to meet with shareholders extensively, both virtually and in person, in San Francisco, in New York and across Europe. Your feedback has been immensely valuable in helping us shape our transformation. And based on that feedback, I am more confident than ever in our profitable growth framework, disciplined capital allocation strategy, and opportunity to drive shareholder value.  Now turning to our results for Q4 fiscal year '23, beginning with top line commentary. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $8.38 billion, up 14% year-over-year or 17% in constant currency, with the beat primarily driven by a reignite MuleSoft and Tableau and slight improvement on foreign exchange rates.  For the full fiscal year, revenue was $31.4 billion, up 18% or 22% in constant currency. The total foreign exchange headwind for the year was approximately $860 million.  Geographically, we saw strong new business growth in the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland, while the United States sales environment remained measured. In Q4, the Americas revenue grew 15%; EMEA grew 13% or 20% in constant currency; and APAC grew 18% or 30% in constant currency. From an industry perspective, we saw strong growth in public sector and travel transportation and hospitality, while the financial services and high-tech sectors showed weakness.  And from a product perspective, as mentioned, MuleSoft and Tableau outperformed our expectations, while we continue to see customer spending pressure in both Commerce and Marketing. For revenue attrition, we remain at record lows, ending the quarter below 7.5%, reflecting the value that our services are providing our customers and their customer success.  Non-GAAP operating margin finished stronger than expected in Q4 at 29.2% and 22.5% for the full fiscal year. The higher-than-expected performance does include some onetime benefits I want to call out. First, there is a restructuring benefit of approximately 1.5 points for Q4. Additionally, in Q4, there were approximately 4.5 points of temporal benefits from license-based revenue performance, annual compensation rationalized for business performance, as well as other onetime efficiencies and savings. Even when normalizing for these benefits, this still represents our highest ever quarterly and annual non-GAAP margin performance.  Q4 operating cash flow was $2.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Q4 free cash flow was $2.6 billion, up 42% year-over-year. For fiscal year '23, operating cash flow was $7.1 billion, up 19% year-over-year. As a reminder, this includes a 4-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes that require the capitalization of certain R&D costs. Free cash flow finished at $6.3 billion, up 19% year-over-year, driven by strong collections during the final quarter of the year.  Turning to remaining performance obligation, or RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract. This ended Q4 at $48.6 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $24.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency. The outperformance was driven by strong go-to-market execution, particularly on early renewals and MuleSoft and some recovery in foreign exchange rates. Finally, we continue to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. We returned $2.3 billion during the quarter for a total of $4 billion since announcing our first ever share repurchase program in August. This represents more than 60% of free cash flow for fiscal year '23.  Before moving to our guidance, I want to briefly discuss the current macro environment. In Q4, we continued to see the measured environment we've called out over the past 2 quarters. This resulted again in elongated sales cycles, additional deal approval layers and deal compression. Our guidance assumes these trends persist with no material improvement or deterioration.  Now to our guidance. Let's start with fiscal year '24. As we've discussed over the last year, Salesforce is deeply committed to structural margin expansion, and we are accelerating on our new day for profitable growth framework. At Dreamforce, we guided to 25% plus margins by FY '26, and we emphasized our ambition to grow margins beyond that content.  Now for fiscal year '24, we are pleased to share that we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 27%, representing a 4.5 point improvement year-over-year and exceeding our goal by 2 years. And we are just getting started.  One item of note, our guidance includes slightly under one half points of benefit due to a depreciation change to the useful life of certain equipment by 1 year effective February 1. For our infrastructure-related equipment, this changed the useful life from approximately 4 to 5 years. And for IT employee equipment, this changed from approximately 3 to 4 years.  And as a general reminder, because our regional revenue and expenses are typically in the same currencies, there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin.  On revenue, we are expecting $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion, representing over 10% growth year-over-year and the same in constant currency. On attrition, starting in FY '24, we are including MuleSoft and Tableau in the metric. As a result, attrition is expected to be slightly above 7.5%. Next, we are planning for stock-based compensation as a percent of revenue to begin trending lower this year to below 9% in fiscal year '24. This is primarily a result of the decreasing impact from prior M&A as well as adjustments being made to our equity program.  We expect fiscal year '24 GAAP EPS of $2.59 to $2.61, including estimated charges for the January restructuring of $0.85. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $7.12 to $7.14. We expect our fiscal year '24 operating cash flow growth to be approximately 15% to 16%. Important to note, this includes an estimated 14-point headwind related to the restructuring. As a reminder, we will see an increase in our cash taxes in fiscal '24 as we draw down our remaining net operating losses.  CapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 16% to 17% for the fiscal year, inclusive of the restructuring charge mentioned above.  Now to guidance for Q1. On revenue, we expect $8.16 billion to $8.18 billion, growth of approximately 10% or 12% in constant currency. This reflects a $150 million FX headwinds. For Q1, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.60 to $1.61. CRPO growth for Q1 is expected to be approximately 11% year-over-year and the same in constant currency. Our guidance continues to incorporate the persistent measured customer buying behavior. On long-term targets, I'd like to provide a few updates. First, with the acceleration on our profitability framework in FY '24, I am very pleased to announce that we now expect to achieve non-GAAP operating margin of at least 30% in Q1 of fiscal year '25. And I want to emphasize that 30% represents a milestone, but not the destination. We are not putting a ceiling on our margin aspirations.  We are thrilled that we are exceeding our FY '26 profitability goals years in advance. Note that we are not reiterating our fiscal year '26 revenue target of $50 billion at this time due to the uncertain macro and currency environments that we have discussed. We anticipate having further updates to our long-term plans at our next Investor Day.  Next, as we continue to focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, I'd like to share a few additional updates. I'm pleased that the Board has approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization from $10 billion to $20 billion. As a result, we now expect to fully offset our stock-based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year '24. On M&A, we are confident in our current portfolio and are focused on continued integration of current assets. Reflective of this, you have already heard from Marc that the Board has decided to disband our M&A committee.  In closing, I would like to share a deep gratitude for our shareholders, our customers and especially our employees. Our relentless focus on execution and our proactive management in the current environment allowed us to close out a strong quarter and sets us up for a transformational fiscal year '24.  It is a new day at Salesforce. And as we look ahead, I'm excited for the opportunity in front of us as we continue to drive profitable growth and shareholder value.  Now Mike, should we open the call up for questions? . Michael Spencer : Yes, please, Amy. Operator, let's go to questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Congratulations on a really strong end to fiscal year. It might actually be a question for Brian because I wanted to begin on the growth side of the equation. Both in terms of, like, how you guys exceeded expectations so well in Q4, but -- so on a go-forward basis, it sounds like there's a lot of changes taking place within the Salesforce, a lot of restructuring in terms of how you guys are going to market.  How do you garner confidence that, that's not going to impact your ability to grow on a go-forward basis and you're not going to see, like, additional headwinds to growth as you go through this restructuring or you don't, like, cut too sharply?  And then maybe to bring Amy into the equation. When you guided for FY '24, did you assume any negative impact from this restructuring? Did you take down any of your expectations in terms of productivity to account for any execution challenges or sort of execution risk around these sales restructurings? Brian Millham : Well, Keith, first of all, thanks for the question. Really appreciate it. And I agree we had very strong performance in our Q4. Very happy with the quick pivot we made enabling our salespeople to talk differently about the values our customers get. Time to value is very critical to our customers, automation, digital transformation, efficiencies and cost reductions in their organizations. And we did a beautiful job in the fourth quarter to drive that message to our customers to see better-than-expected performance.  On your question about next year and some of the changes we're seeing in our organization, we feel very good about the work that we're doing. As we mentioned in the commentary, the organic innovation that's coming out of our product organization is phenomenal. We have an incredible portfolio to go sell them the Customer 360, new product that we can go sell in Data Cloud.  And as you know, the CRM market continues to grow very fast in double digit, and we think we should be taking market share in that market environment. I also would like to say, I think we have an opportunity to drive higher productivity amongst our salespeople. I think we have an opportunity to bundle products together and to show up differently in front of our customers, to consolidate organizations that have been stand-alone sales organizations in the past.  Bundling products together, driving higher ASP per salesperson is really what we want to go do next year. And we don't think that the impact of some of the changes that we're making, the architecture of the organization is going to have an impact on our growth next year. Amy, over to you. . Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks, Brian. Keith, so a couple of things. First, just going back to your question on growth and the beat for Q4. I did want to point out that, that was primarily from MuleSoft and Tableau. That license revenue came in very strong in Q4. And as you know, the way that we account for license revenue gives it more of a boost in quarter than our subscription. Also, we do see a slight improvement on foreign exchange beyond what we were expecting. So all of that led to a very strong Q4 on the revenue side. In terms of the FY '24 guide, we feel very good about the guide coming in, a little above 10% for this year. We've taken into account all of the factors that we're talking about, including macro. On macro, what we're assuming is really no near-term change when it comes to the selling environment. So not expecting to get an upside, nor expecting a material deterioration. And I think Brian really already hit on the restructuring. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne : Congrats on the quarter, and thank you for the very comprehensive outlook going into next year. Marc, the question is for you. I think this is obviously a new chapter for Salesforce. You're back as sole CEO. I think I get a lot of questions from folks asking how you're going to be prioritizing your time now, how you're going to be spending your time given these new parameters of execution you're setting out for the company. So I was wondering if you could just comment on that a little bit. Marc Benioff : Thanks so much for that question. I really appreciate it. I really appreciate everyone's support during the quarter. I don't think we could have had this quarter without everyone who's on the call. We really are very grateful to the support we had, especially from the analysts and the shareholders, because, really, through their guidance and enlightenment, we were able to execute a different plan.  I think when we look back, and I think we have to look backwards to go look forward. Obviously, the 2021 calendar year is like something that none of us have ever experienced in the technology business. It was incredible. You can see that throughout the whole industry.  Then as we entered 2022, it was not 2021, and I think we all understand that. Currencies, measured buying environment, macro conditions, inflation, the stock market. So when we planned 2022 out of 2021, I'm talking calendar years now, that's where I think we had a little incongruence, and then we had to adjust and shift and pivot, and that's really what happened right around Dreamforce. We really started to see it. We had that great Investor Day with you all. We put out there our profitability framework. We put together our fiscal year 2016 targets. And 90 days ago when everything happened, you know what happened. We don't have to go through it again. It doesn't matter. It's behind us. But you all said, hey, you guys can hit the hyperspace button, just like I said, and we did. We hit the hyperspace button, and we said, we can hit these targets now.  We don't have to wait 2 years, and that's where I'm putting my time, my energy, my effort. I'm very proud of the team for delivering this Q4 operating margin of 29.2% because that really has become like our North Star. As Amy just said, as we look to next year, even in Q1 and so forth, we're saying that this 30% plus world, this is we should be living in that.  We have onboarded the entire management team worldwide to that fact. It's a core part of our V2MOM. It's one of the name of our methods that we are guiding 30% plus. And that's our direction. And at the same time, we had a great quarter. Just like you just heard, Q4 revenue at $8.38 billion, exceed our expectations for many reasons, some currency, but really a lot was execution and execution in the corner from 2 great product lines with our Tableau and MuleSoft team, extremely impressive execution.  And I'll also just call out what an unbelievable performance for the year at $31.4 billion, this is just a huge incredible software company that has got great margins and great cash flow and a great position in the market. So that's where my head is at. There's basically 2 motions here. One is, just like we just heard, Brian has to continue to deliver the ACVs. That's why we're keeping a lot of stability in our sales organization right now, maintaining the productivity, deliver the year in ACV. This is really critical for us. That's motion number one. Motion number two is also, at the same time, profitability. Profitability is our -- truly our #1 strategy, and that's my #1 strategy. That's what I've been focused on with the management team. That is the #1 thing we talked about at the start of every meeting we have in this company. And that is why we were able to deliver that in 90 days. You all know that we've never had an efficiency focus in the company before because we've had 24 incredible years of where we've had to just grow, grow, grow. There have been moments where we've had to pull back. '01, '02, bad recession, we had to pull back. '08, '09, we had to pull back and reassess.  We're kind of looking at this moment as, hey, we can reassess. This is a incredible moment. We can deliver great results. You saw we're delivering more than 10% growth -- revenue growth, but we want to deliver this more than 27% margin growth for the year and -- not growth, but margin target. And we're going -- obviously, the growth rate is actually much higher.  I mean I think that, that is amazing that we've delivered more than 4 points last year, not basis points, 4 points, and 4.5 points this year, and that's my main focus. I've gotten a lot of great coaching. I'll just -- huge call out to my mentor, Larry Ellison, who has spent a lot of time with me, giving me the Oracle playbook. And I'm very grateful to him.  He was the first person who texted me after the earnings came out today. And as -- I'll tell you, it's good to have friends in the world when things happen, and he's been a great friend, and we're executing that playbook to increase our margins. They obviously have best-of-class margins. So it's great to have someone on your side like that and great to have all of you on our side as well because without all you, we would not be able to deliver this quarter. So thank you so much for everything. . Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with BofA Securities. Bradley Sills : Congratulations on a nice finish to the year and margin and outlook. I wanted to ask how important the concept of CDP and vertical solutions are. As you pivot towards this ongoing sales productivity and asking reps to sell more of the solution of all the great components in the Salesforce stack, how important are those solutions and really pulling in more of those components over time? Marc Benioff : Well, I just think that's such a great question, Brad. And thank you so much, and also thanks to you for the quarter, your support. I would like to say that, of course, we have a lot of great products, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, our platform, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud or verticals that you know. But there's been an evolution of our CDP.  I think it kind of started in Marketing, and it's become so much more. We're entering this new world of AI. And we've always been influenced by the world of AI and IoT and seeing our customers try to add in all of their intelligent devices onto our platform so they can have better relationships with their customers who are connected to them in these incredible new ways.  And you may remember, we're going to have Thunder, the IoT cloud. That was kind of a version 1 idea of the CDP, and it didn't exactly work out. The main reason why is customers really wanted an integrated deeply inside Salesforce with our metadata platform. And they wanted it to be a data lake inside Salesforce, and we had built it outside. So we realized, let's build it back inside the platform, which is what we've done.  And this data cloud, you can see it now deployed in customers, and I'll give you a couple of great examples. One is Ford, amazing what they have done with the Data Cloud. Of course, they're using Sales Cloud and Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud, but it's all integrated with the Data Cloud, and they deployed their first product this quarter, which is the Mach-E. So if you have a Mach-E -- I have one, they're amazing -- and you're getting text messages from Ford or e-mail messages, you're getting them from our Data Cloud, and that is incredible to see that.  Boston Scientific, another amazing story that I mentioned, this idea that they were able to use Data Cloud to unify their front office and back office systems together in this really incredible integrated way.  Formula 1, I just reviewed last night, how they -- only 1% of Formula 1 fans -- F1 fans that they're the only -- they come to the races. The other 99% they have to connect with electronically, but they need an intelligent AI-based system. And with Data Cloud, you can bring your own AI model. We ingest it. And then our system automatically is connecting with your customer. And as they're interfacing in all of our different clouds, the AI-based Data Cloud is doing this incredible heavy lifting. So it's going to be an amazing organic driver for us. I mean it's probably our fastest-growing cloud in the quarter. And I can't be more excited to show more of what we're doing there. You've seen some of it at Dreamforce. You saw some of it where -- we've now deeply integrated Tableau into it. So Tableau has a server now finally, but Tableau also is an incredible window onto all of the Salesforce data through the data cloud, really neat work. And our engineering team, a huge call out to them for this great success. . Brian Millham : And Brad, just another comment quickly on the industry play. A big part of our success in the quarter and a big bet for us in the coming years as we invest heavily in our industry cloud. I think you heard in the commentary, 8 of 13 of our industry clouds grew above 50% in ARR in the quarter. Really a great payoff in the investment we've made in the technology there and really having our sales team show up and speaking the customer -- the language of our customers to drive the growth of this business, couple that with the strategies around driving international growth, international expansion of all of our products, along with multi-cloud selling, a great opportunity for us going forward. So the industry is a big part of our strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Congrats on the tough decisions this quarter and the great quarter. So I think you all be praised for that and the hard work you've done. A question for me, more for Brian. Obviously, there were comments out from you guys around sales, sales productivity as we kind of went through the January. If you think about the actions you're taking now, where do you see that sales productivity that you're seeing at the moment? And where do you think [indiscernible] Salesforce and the setup that you have here? Brian Millham : Raimo, I'm not exactly sure -- you're cutting out a little bit there. So I'll try to deduce what your question was around productivity. Productivity is a big component of our growth strategy going forward. How do we get our account executives to sell more each and every month, each and every quarter to our customers? We've got some great strategy around that. Enablement is a big component of that. . You heard in my commentary earlier that we're very focused on ensuring that we're enabling our entire sales teams around our entire product portfolio and bringing people back to the office to drive that productivity, that learning that is so important for us as we think about the growth going forward. I also mentioned an opportunity we have to bring our products together around a buyer, how do we put some bundles together to drive higher ASPs for all of our sellers and solve more problems for our customers with a single selling motion versus today, maybe several selling motions to go win those deals. And so productivity, a big driver of our growth strategy going forward, an effort, frankly, that we've always kept productivity flat and hired more AEs to drive our growth. We're going to inverse that equation going forward and think about productivity as our driver going forward. So really appreciate the question and hope I got it because your line was breaking up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. . Kasthuri Rangan : What an amazing end of fiscal year. Congratulations to the team. Much much much better than expected, brighter days ahead. Question for Marc. And maybe, Brian, you can chime in here. So Marc, we went through the 2008, 2009 recession, 2010 rebound, back then, the company was a smaller company, but you still were able to get profitability up. We went through a bit of a downturn, and we came out of it.  So are there pyramids to be drawn in this cycle? Because there's certainly uncertainty about recession, whatnot, that's damping spending. If we take that as a fact, the growth rate that you guided to, should that be the aspirational long-term growth rate of the company? Or do you think if and when the recession clears that there should be a rebound in spending? And we understand that all the go-to-market rationalization that you and Brian and Amy you're all working on should allow you to gain share. So help us think about the recovery curve of Salesforce in the next economic cycle. Marc Benioff : To understand what we're going through, I really did go back and looked at all the numbers in '01, '02 and '08, '09. And what you said, Kash, is quite enlightened in that. Of course, we saw in '08, '09 ACV fall off dramatically. And of course, we hit the break on spending, and we accelerated margin, I think, 6 points during that time. I don't know the exact numbers, but it was a moment where you see sales and marketing companies, marketing spend -- when these things happen, CEOs, they stop hiring salespeople. They stop spending on marketing, right? Everybody knows the methodology of what, how CEOs behave in a recession. As soon as the stock market implodes CEOs, they hit the brakes.  So I think that, that's what we saw in '08, '09. I think we really started to see that in the middle of '22, maybe August, September, October, November. Certainly, as we've exited Dreamforce, we were like, I think that we can execute our playbook. We have a recession playbook. We know how to transform the company. Well, you just saw it in the last 90 days where the things we're doing are launching on our -- really launched a profitable growth strategy. This is a key part of what we're doing, really making sure that every executive in this company knows that profitability is our highest priority and making sure that we keep in the very forefront of our mind that Salesforce is not just one of the largest and fastest growing. You can see that I think that we gained -- we probably added or created more ACV than all the other SaaS companies combine. Like our ACV numbers are massive, but also the most profitable software company in the world, the most -- the highest cash flow. That's what's on our mind.  And to do that, we are really focusing on making sure we have the expertise in the company. And I'll tell you, Dreamforce, you are all sitting in the audience. You know Mason Morfit was there, sitting next to his founder, Jeff Ubben. And we had been working with Mason, and he started bringing us these incredible ideas on distribution, on pricing, on efficiency. It was these incredible strategic decks. I have never seen the level of quality of work from anyone outside the company before. I was just so inspired with what Mason came up with that, and I'm like, you know what, we should put him on the board and he has added just incredible value. I mean probably a lot from the Microsoft experience, obviously, being on the Microsoft Board was awesome for him. And the expertise that we're getting as a Board member is incredible. I think he starts today, but he has really been working with us now and has been really cool. And a huge call out to Jeff, too, because Jeff has been a friend for many years and great thoughts.  I'll tell you -- and all of these guys, I'll tell you -- there's a lot of them. We all know that. I've learned from everybody. I really appreciate all of their feedback. It's been fantastic. And we're also adding 2 more great Board members today, I mentioned already. But you might now know, Sachin, the CFO of Mastercard, incredible financial expertise. And also Arnold Donald, who I've known for so many years, is probably one of the greatest Fortune 100 CEOs of our time, incredible executive. Looking forward to everyone getting to know him.  And again, a huge thank you to Sandy and Alan, all of you -- I know many of you work for Sandy in your careers. And it's hard to see Sandy leave the Board because we love him, but it's been 20 years so it's probably the right moment. We're having dinner next week, and it's going to be a lot of gratitude there.  And I think that those points, combined with -- by the way, we're going to repurchase so much stock, $20 billion, I think it's real right time. We've already did $4 billion and that's obviously critical for us, and we even created this new Business Transformation Committee. So the Board can really keep their eye on these KPIs that we're talking about.  But yes, performance, productivity, the fundamental profitability of the company, the prioritization of our products, leading with growth like with our new Data Cloud, with our verticals that was very enlightened that question and our services organization as well. We have a lot of growth things. So when you look at -- the buying environment gets back online in some huge way, and it doesn't become measured, I think we are very well positioned for the future, and we have these great customer relationships. And I don't think there's any other evidence of that than the -- that we just hit a record low on customer attrition. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Amy, given Marc's #1 profit -- goal of profitability, can you outline where this big jump is coming from? Can you give us just a sense of the big areas that you feel that you can really cut?  And I guess, back to Marc, it seems like you can keep growing at a pretty good rate even with higher margins. So this doesn't really feel like it's really sacrificing growth when you're guiding to still a double-digit number. Amy Weaver : Brent, thanks for the question. So we've got great plans for this year. As you know, we guided to 27% for fiscal year '24, and we plan to hit 30% early in the following year. Very excited about what we're doing. This is a journey that we've been on for quite some time. Just in the last 2 years, we have increased our operating margin almost 500 basis points, and this was while fully absorbing Slack. We announced at Investor Day, we were going to keep going and set out a goal of 25% or more by FY '26. We really hit the gas pedal on that over the last 90 days, accelerating to the 27 and the 30 that I mentioned to you. And again, as I said, even at 30, I don't view as a ceiling. That's really just getting us started on this front.  Now in terms of how this is going on, there has been a lot we've been doing leading up to this with discipline across the company, looking for savings. We took 2 major steps in January. One was the real estate. We announced that we are going to be shrinking our global real estate considerably over the upcoming years. The other was the headcount.  And on the job eliminations, I just do want to pause for a moment on that. On the call like this, it's easy to talk about that very clinically as the headcount just represents dollars and not real human beings, we all fully realize that there's employees whose lives and careers and families were deeply impacted by these decisions. And I just want to assure our employees that we never lose sight of that.  But these actions weren't our first steps, and there are going to be plenty more actions that we take to increase our operating margin going forward. We have a number of initiatives underway. Brian talked about quite a few in the sales and marketing area. Sales and G&A are really 2 of our greatest opportunities, although we have started a comprehensive operating and go-to-market review that is going across all of our business. This has led -- Bain is coming in to do this and to work with us and to go through with this. I think that we've got a great initiatives underway. The other thing I would say, finally, in terms of my confidence, it really comes back to the passion and the skills of our employees. When we focus on sales, we became the fastest-growing enterprise software company ever. When we focus on product, we created an unmatched Customer 360. And now we are asking all of these incredibly talented and passionate employees to bring that same focus to productivity and efficiency. And with all of them behind us, I have no doubt that we're going to be world class for profitability. . Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Karl Keirstead : Amy, just continuing on the margin conversation, you hinted in your comments about a desire to close the gap between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what key levers you're using to do that. You hinted that adjustments to the equity program. It might be interesting to hear a little bit more. And over what time frame do you think that bridge might close? Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks for the question, Karl. There is certainly an increasing focus on GAAP margins, and in particular, on adding back stock-based compensation into our non-GAAP operating margin. I spent quite a bit of time in Europe meeting with investors in January. And in Europe, that is the first thing that everyone does. So very much top of mind.  Our stock-based compensation for last year was just over 10%. We plan to drive that below 9% this year. And we're getting -- there are 2 of key levers there. One is that we're actually burning through a lot of the stuff that came with some of the M&A we've done in recent years. So that is rolling through our system in the way that's going to help drive the numbers down.  The others are changes at our Compensation Committee has been making very thoughtfully to how we grant equity and the form of equity that we grant. So we'll have more coming up on that as we get into proxy season, but I see this going well over the next few years. . Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian-Bowler with Macquarie Capital. Sarah Hindlian-Bowler: Congratulations to the entire team on an Oscar-worthy quarter. Karl really did a great job of asking the stock-based compensation question I was going to ask. So I'd like to pivot a little bit back towards maybe getting your understanding of the macro environment that helped you build your outward guidance. Brian, maybe this is a question for you in terms of getting a sense for where you saw points of stickiness or points of disruption or otherwise within your various vertical categories. Brian Millham : Yes. Thank you, Sarah. Appreciate the question. And yes, we are in a measured buying environment. There's no doubt about it. And the impact of that are things like elongated sales cycles and multiple layers of approvals that we're facing and maybe even some shrinking deal sizes. One of the nice things we've done, though, is to make sure we're training our people to navigate those headwinds that we've got in the market to go execute better. We saw that happen in Q4, and we'll see that happen in fiscal year '24.  On the industry side, and maybe even the segment side, in our SMB market, economic headwinds tend to hit that a little bit harder. And so we saw some headwinds in our SMB market. Some of the self-serve strategies and motions that we have for Slack were impacted by the economic headwinds.  And then from an industry perspective, we actually saw a lot of strength in industries around public sector, manufacturing, engineering -- excuse me, energy and travel hospitality was a strength for us in the quarter. Some areas that we continue to see headwinds in technology is probably not a surprise to anybody, and also financial services were a bit of a headwind for us in the quarter but have a lot of belief that we can turn that around in FY '24. So Sarah, thank you so much for the question. Appreciate it. Michael Spencer : Okay. Thanks, Sarah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate everyone taking the time and look forward to seeing everyone over the coming several weeks. Thanks. Brian Millham : Thanks, all. Marc Benioff : Aloha. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would like to hand over the conference to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Mike Spencer : Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today on our fiscal 2024 first quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, President and Chief Finance Officer; and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, which could change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and any other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. And with that, let me hand the call to Marc. Marc Benioff : Thanks, Mike, and thank you all for being on the call. On our last call in March, we told you about how Salesforce had radically accelerated our transformation to profitable growth. We share with you how we hit the hyperspace button across the key areas of our transformation, restructuring for the short and long-term, reigniting our performance culture by focusing on productivity, operational excellence, and profitability, prioritizing our core innovations that drive customer success, building even stronger relationships with you, our investors. Our Q1 results show that we continue to make great progress. As I said in March, we're just getting started with this incredible transformation. We continue to scrutinize every dollar investment, every resource, and every spend and we're transforming every corner of our company. Our progress over the last 5 months, while it's very impressive and I cannot be more grateful to our entire team for their leadership. In fact, you may hear me say that several times on this call. Our transformation drove our Q1 financial results. As I said, on our last call, well improving profitability is our highest priority. As a result, we significantly exceeded our margin target for the quarter, delivering a non-GAAP operating margin of 27.6%, up 1,000 basis points year-over-year, incredible. And there's no greater point of evidence to our transformation than this amazing result following the tremendous operating margin Q4. In Q1, we delivered 8.2 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency. We had some amazing wins in the quarter with Northwell Health, Paramount, Siemens, Spotify, NASA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, among others. We delivered 4.5 billion in operating cash flow up 22% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligation ended the quarter at 46.7 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. And through Q1, we've now returned more than $6 billion in share repurchases. As a result for the third quarter in a row, we ended the quarter with fewer shares year-over-year another amazing point of evidence on this incredible transformation. Now, turning to our financial guidance, while the economy is not in our control, our margins are, which is why we're raising our margin target for the full fiscal year. For FY 2024, we're raising our non-GAAP operating margin to 28%, an improvement of 550 basis points year-over-year and we remain confident that we'll hit 30% non-GAAP operating margins in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. We could not be more excited about our progress. We're maintaining our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance of approximately 34.5 billion to 34.7 billion over 10% projected growth year-over-year. I couldn't be more proud of how our team has come together, stepped up, and delivered these results. I've also been asked numerous times this quarter by our investors and our customers, how we're able to make so much progress so fast and deliver these incredible numbers? It's very simple. It's our Ohana culture. It's our superpower. And again, I'd like to thank our amazing team for this incredible accomplishment. Last quarter, I told you of how our AI team is getting ready to launch Einstein GPT, the world's first genitive AI for CRM. At TrailheadDX in March in front of thousands of trailblazers here in San Francisco, that's exactly what we did. At its foundation, Einstein GPT is open and extensible. Customers can connect to multiple large language models, including from partners like OpenAI and Tropic and others. This is a whole new way to work for our customers, users, and trailblazers. Users on Salesforce are seeing new AI generative features across all of their most common workflows. And while many of these will be created by Salesforce developers, far more will be created by our incredible trailblazer ecosystem. For low code of trailblazers, Einstein GPT will provide a toolset to design generative AI apps built on [reusable props] [ph]. For pro code trailblazers, Einstein GPT will offer an extensible ecosystem of LLM providers with configurable grounding. And Einstein GPT is the combination of tremendous research and engineering by our world-class AI team, and I'd like to congratulate them on this amazing result. And one more amazing result, this week, Einstein, Salesforce Einstein that we've been talking about for so many years on these calls, will generate an incredible 1 trillion predictions for our customers, an incredible milestone on our AI journey. We saw more of the incredible work of our AI team at our New York City world tour this month when we demonstrated Slack GPT. Slack is a secure treasure trove of company data that generative AI can use to give every company and every employee their own powerful AI assistant helping every employee be more productive and transforming the future work. Slack GPT can leverage the power of generative AI to deliver instant conversation summaries, research tools, and writing assistance directly in Slack, and you may never need to leave Slack to get a question answered. Slack is the perfect conversational interface for working with LLMs, which is why so many AI companies are Slack first and why OpenAI, ChatGPT, and Anthropic Squad can now use Slack as a native interface. Slack is also delivering integrated sales and service experiences powered by native GPT to be the best interface for all of our Salesforce customers and there's a lot more magic to come with Slack and generative AI. In this month, we also announced Tableau GPT. At our Tableau conference, we had over 8,000 in-person attendees. Tableau GPT simplifies data analysis for all of our users enabling anyone to inquire about their data using Einstein GPT and obtain AI driven insights at scale. The intelligence and automation that Tableau GPT provides is tremendously important in this area of hyperscale data that we're all entering. The coming wave of generative AI will be more revolutionary than any technology innovation that's come before in our lifetime or maybe any lifetime. Like Netscape Navigator, which opened the door, to a greater Internet, a new door has opened with generative AI and it is reshaping our world in ways that we've never imagined. Every CEO realizes they're going to have to invest in AI aggressively to remain competitive and Salesforce is going to be their trusted partner to get them to do just that. Every CEO I've spoken with sees AI as a revolution beginning and ending with the customer, and every CIO I've spoken with wants more productivity, more automation, and more intelligence through using AI. A great example [of deploying] [ph] this technology is Gucci.  We're working with them to augment their client advisors by building AI chat technology that creates a Guccified [indiscernible] service, well, incredible new voice, amplifying brands, storytelling and incremental sales as well. It's an incredibly exciting vision for generative AI to transform which was customer service into now customer service, marketing, and sales, all through augmenting Gucci employee capabilities using this amazing generative AI, but we can only do all of this with trust. Our customers need to understand where their data is going and they must be able to maintain data integrity and access and privacy controls. Large customers must maintain data compliance as a critical part of their governance, while using generative AI and LLMs. This is not true in the consumer environment, but it is true for our customers, our enterprise customers who demand the highest levels of this capability. Where customers who for years have used relational databases as the secure mechanism of their trusted data, they already have that high level of security to the row and sell level. We all understand that. And that is why we have built our GPT trust layer into Einstein GPT. The GPT trust layer gives connected LLM secure real time access to data without the need to move all of your data into the LLM itself. It's an incredible breakthrough for our customers and working with LLMs in a secure and trusted way. While they're using the LLMs, the data itself is not moving and being stored in the LLM. That is what our customers want. They can be sure that the customer data is where they know it is, where they can be assured that it is for their compliance and for their governance. And I cannot be more excited about our AI CRM and delivering on this future of trusted AI through our new Salesforce GPT trust layer. Finally, I can't talk about AI without talking about the success of our data cloud. Data Cloud is the heart of customer 360 and now our fastest growing cloud ever. Data Cloud created a real-time Intelligent Data Lake that brings together and harmonizes all of our customers' data in one place. In Q1, we closed one of our largest healthcare industry deals ever with Northwell Health, New York's largest private employer. They have 21 hospitals, 900 patient \u2013 900 outpatient facility or ambulatory facilities, and their own medical school all in New York. By integrating DataCloud with Health Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, while our entire customer 360, Northwell is improving patient care by bringing together its vast data resources to create a single source of truth and using AI to govern data, use, and maintain regulatory compliance. This is the future of our customers and our industry. It's AI, plus data, plus CRM. And of course, this AI revolution is just getting started, which is why we've invested 250 million in our new AI venture fund to fuel startups developing our trusted generative AI vision. We'll be talking more about this at our AI Day event on June 12th in New York City, and I hope that you'll join me there. To wrap up, we\u2019re transforming every corner of our company. We're laser focused on our short-term and long term restructuring, improving productivity and performance, prioritizing our core innovations and delivering for our shareholders. As a result, productivity is up, profitability is up, revenue is up, cash flow is up, and we dramatically increased our margin guidance. And just like the cloud, mobile and social well, AI, this revolution is a new innovation cycle. It's going to be a new spending cycle as well, which is going spark a massive new tech buying cycle. And we've led the industry through each of these cycles and I couldn't be more excited for our future as we continue on a path to our long-term goal to make Salesforce the largest most profitable enterprise software company in the world, and the number 1, safest and most trusted AI CRM. With that, Brian, I'll turn it over to you. Brian Millham : Thanks, Marc. As Marc said, we're continuing our transformation across every part of our company. Our focus on performance culture and operational excellence contributed to our strong first quarter results. Since our last call, we've removed layers to get closer to our customers and to complexity out of our business to help us accelerate through the rest of the year. We clearly defined our return and remote office guidelines for our employees, and it's been great to get together even more in our offices and with our customers around the globe. I had the chance to visit [many of our office] [ph] this quarter and the energy is incredible. As you heard from Marc, our transformation plan continues to deliver top and bottom line growth as we help our customers increase productivity, drive efficiency, and become AI First Companies. But we're still operating in an uncertain macro environment. Customers continue to scrutinize every deal, and we see elongated deal cycles and deal compression, particularly in our more transactional revenue streams like SMB, create and close, and self-serve. Also in Q1, our professional service business started to see less demand for multi-year transformations, and in some cases delayed projects as customers focused on quick wins and fast time to value. But for this reason, we saw strong performance from some of our fast time to value efficiency focused products with sales performance management, sales productivity, and digital service all growing annual recurring revenue above 40% in the quarter. As customers look to reduce complexity and achieve faster time to value, they're expanding their adoption of Salesforce clouds, a key growth strategy for us. The world's most recognized companies are relying on Salesforce more than 90% of the Fortune 100 used Salesforce and they average more than five of our clouds. This is why we're so excited about our AI plus data plus CRM strategy. As Marc explained, we're building Einstein GPT and Data Cloud into every cloud and our Customer 360 and we're perfectly positioned to help our customers harness the phenomenal power of AI. Our core offerings remain resilient. In Q1, 9 of our top 10 deals included sales, service, and platform. Industry clouds continue to be a tailwind to our growth, and we saw momentum with great customers like Northwell, USDA Rural Development, and NASA who we showcased at World Tour DC in April. Once again, eight of our industry clouds grew ARR above 50%. I met with hundreds of customers in the quarter and we hosted 700 meetings in our innovation centers with our top customers and prospects. Generative AI is top of mind for all of them. As they look to benefit from the intelligence automation and cost savings that Salesforce is uniquely positioned to deliver. We're seeing tremendous appetite for our new generative AI products starting with Einstein GPT, Slack GPT, and Data Cloud. Our generative AI products will be a catalyst for our future growth. As Marc mentioned, Data Cloud continues to be one of our fastest growing products and we had great wins in the quarter with companies like Major League Soccer and Giorgio Armani. Armani uses Data Cloud to deliver hyper personalized online and in-store experiences, real time engagement, and curated shopping recommendations. We can see how Data Cloud and Einstein GPT are going to create experiences that weren't possible before and really drive growth. In an environment where customers are optimizing their current [tech stacks] [ph], integration and automation continue to be efficiency drivers. MuleSoft again delivered strong results with wins at Siemens, [Cinnova] [ph], and Vodafone. For the first time, Salesforce was ranked number 1 in integration by market share in the latest IDC software tracker, a great testament to our MuleSoft team. Tableau is unleashing the power of our Data Cloud, unlocking customer data and delivering actionable real time insights. In the quarter, we had great wins at customers like Union Bank of the Philippines, Discovery Financial Service, Moderna, ADT Solar, and Alaska Air. We've made great investments to reaccelerate Tableau, including new leadership along with product innovations like Tableau GPT, and revenue intelligence, now one of our fastest growing add-ons. I\u2019m really encouraged by the Slack team who has created an ambitious product roadmap with generative AI at the center. In Q1, we saw amazing momentum with customers like the California Office of Systems Integration, Paramount Global, Breville, and OpenAI, and rolled out an AI ready platform, Slack Canvas, and app integrations with ChatGPT in Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Overall, I could not be more thrilled with our offerings and the market position, especially as it relates to delivering on the promise of AI. We're looking forward to continuing the energy and momentum at our AI day in just a couple of weeks. I'm very proud of the teams and of our partners. Their focus on customer success continues to be outstanding. As Marc said, our productivity is up, profitability is up, revenue is up, cash flow is up. We're increasing our margin guidance and sales forces leading the way as the number one AI CRM. Now, over to you Amy. Amy Weaver : Thank you, Brian. As Marc said, a key part of our transformation to profitable growth is short and long-term restructuring of the company. We have now largely completed the restructuring announced in January, and we're completing our comprehensive operating and go to market review. As we shift to the implementation phase, we're executing against three key pillars, optimization of resources and organization structure, product investment prioritization, and operational rigor. We continue to view sales and marketing and G&A as the primary drivers of leverage. While R&D remains an important investment area. Our profitable growth framework, disciplined capital allocation strategy, and opportunity to drive shareholder value are represented in our actions and in our results. Now, turning to our results for Q1's fiscal year 2024, beginning with top line commentary. For the first quarter, revenue was 8.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency with the beat primarily driven by strong momentum in MuleSoft, and more resilient core performance. Geographically, we saw strong new business growth in parts of EMEA and LatAm, specifically Switzerland, Italy, and Brazil, while we experienced continued pressure in the United States. In Q1, the Americas revenue grew 10%, EMEA grew 12% or 17% in constant currency. And APAC grew 16% or 24% in constant currency. From an industry perspective, manufacturing, automotive, and energy all performed well, while high-tech and financial services remained under pressure. Q1 revenue attrition ended the quarter at approximately 8%. As expected, we saw a modest increase in Q1. Partially attributed to the inclusion of Tableau in the metric. We also noted some incremental weakness in our marketing and commerce attrition. As Marc said, non-GAAP operating margin finished strong in Q1 at 27.6%, driven by our disciplined investment strategy and accelerating our restructuring efforts. Q1 operating cash flow is 4.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year. This includes a 910 basis points headwind from restructuring. Q1 free cash flow was 4.2 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Turning to remaining performance obligation or RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract. This ended Q1 at 46.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO, ended at 24.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by strong core performance, partially offset by continue, create, and close softness. And finally, we continued to deliver on our capital return commitment. In Q1, we returned 2.1 billion in the form of share repurchases bringing the total returned to more than 6 billion since the program was initiated last August, representing more than 38 million shares. Before moving to guidance, I wanted to briefly touch on the current macro environment that Brian discussed. The more measured buying behavior persisted in Q1. And as Brian noted, in Q1, we started to see weakness in our professional services business. We expect these factors to persist, which is incorporated in our guidance. Let's start with fiscal year 2024. On revenue, we are holding our guidance of 34.5 billion to 34.7 billion, representing over 10% growth year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency. The strength in our Q1 performance is offset by the pressure in our professional services business previously discussed. For fiscal year 2024, we are raising non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 28%, representing a 550 basis points improvement year-over-year. This guidance increase is driven by the acceleration of our restructuring efforts and also includes reinvestment in targeted areas, namely in R&D. I'm proud of our progress and remain confident in our trajectory as we progress towards our 30% non-GAAP operating margin target in Q1 2025. We also remain focused on stock based compensation and continue to expect it to improve this year to below 9% as a percent of revenue. Before moving to EPS, on restructuring, we now expect the charges in FY 2024 to come in towards the higher end of the range previously provided in our last earnings release. As a result of these updates, we now expect fiscal year 2024 GAAP EPS of $2.67 to $2.69, including estimated charges for the restructuring of a $1.11. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $7.41 to $7.43. And we are raising our fiscal year 2024 operating cash flow growth to be approximately 16% to 17%, which now includes a 14 point to 16 point headwind from restructuring. As a reminder, we will see an increase in our cash taxes in fiscal 2024 as we draw down our remaining net operating losses. CapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 17% to 18% for the fiscal year. Now to guidance for Q2. On revenue, we expect $8.51 billion to $8.53 billion, growth of approximately 10% in both nominal and constant currency. CRPO growth for Q2 is expected to be approximately 10% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency. Our guidance incorporates the momentum of our execution in Q1, offset by the persistent measured buying behavior and a decline in professional services fixed fees contribution. The professional services impact represents approximately a 1 point headwind to growth. For Q2, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.79 to $0.80 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.89 to $1.90. And as we focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, we continue to expect to fully offset our stock based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year 2024. In closing, we continue to transform every corner of the company. We are hyper focused on delivering the next wave of innovation led by Data Cloud and Einstein GPT. And Salesforce is well-positioned to remain the market leader in this new AI first world. We are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value, and I personally want to thank our shareholders for their continued support. Now, Mike, let's open up the call for questions. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Amy. Operator, we'll move to questions now. I ask that everyone only ask one question in respect for others on the call. In addition, I'd like to introduce Srini Tallapragada, our Head of Engineering, who will be joining us for Q&A today. With that Emma, let's move to the questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Hi, yes. Thanks very much and congrats on a good start to the year. Marc, you've been through a number of cycles from a technology perspective. I was just kind of curious where you think we are in terms of people investigating AI versus when the spending cycle around it might kick-in? Can you just give us an idea of, you know, sort of your thoughts on that and really just the opportunity for you all to monetize AI with your product base? Thanks. Marc Benioff : Well, I think this is the absolute question of the day, which is we are about to enter an unbelievable super cycle for tech and everyone can see that. This is an incredible opportunity for not only Salesforce, but our entire industry. I mean, perhaps only a year ago or less than a year ago, no one on this call even knew what GPT was. Today, ChatGPT is the fastest growing consumer product of all time, and has transformed many, many lives. It's definitely not just the technology of this lifetime, but maybe any lifetime. It's an incredible technology. And every company is going to have to transform because every company is going to have to become more productive or automated more intelligent through this technology to be competitive with other companies. And just yesterday, I'm in a room here at the top of Salesforce Tower on the 60th floor, and we have the CEO of a very large bank here. And like every other sales call I've made in the last quarter, there's only one thing that customers want to talk about, and that's artificial intelligence and specifically, generative AI. Of course, we have been a leader in this area with Einstein, more than 1 trillion transactions delivered this week, but these are primarily predictive transactions built on machine intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. But in 2018, deep learning evolved and became much more sophisticated and became generative as these neural networks expanded their capabilities and also the hardware went to another level as well. So, now we have this incredible new capability. It's a new platform for growth, and I couldn't be more excited. But yesterday, there were many questions from my friend who I'm not going to give you his name because he's one of the \u2013 the CEO of one of the largest and most important banks in the world. And I'll just say that, of course, his primary focus is on productivity. He knows that he wants to make his bankers a lot more successful. He wants every banker to be able to rewrite a mortgage, but not every banker can, because writing the mortgage takes a lot of technical expertise. But as we showed him in the meeting through a combination of Tableau, which we demonstrated and Slack, which we demonstrated, and Salesforce's Financial Services Cloud, which he has tens of thousands of users on, that banker understood that this would be incredible. But I also emphasize to him that LLMs, or large language models, they have a voracious appetite for data. They want every piece of data that they can consume, but through his regulatory standards, he cannot deliver all that data into the LLM because it becomes amalgamated. Today, he runs on Salesforce, and his data is secure down to the row and cell level. He knows that readers don't block [riders] [ph] that there's all types of security provisions and regarding who can see what data about what account or what customer. And when you put it into an LLM, those permissions are not understood. So, that is a very powerful moment to realize that the way that LLMs operate is in a way state where they're kind of consuming all this data and then giving us that information back out, well, that Salesforce's opportunity. That's why we built this GPT trust layer. And through the GPT trust layer and rebuilding all of our apps, including Slack and Tableau, but as we demonstrated him yesterday, a new Sales Cloud, a new Service Cloud, a new marketing cloud, and what we'll show on June 12 in New York City, a complete reconceptualization of our product line. What that means for this customer and for every customer is that they have an opportunity to transform their business. And for Salesforce, that also means an opportunity to transform ourselves and for our industry, a new super cycle where every company will have to transform to be AI first. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Elizabeth Porter : Great. This is Elizabeth Porter on for Keith Weiss. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the potential disruption from rebooting the sales enablement process. Are we past the point of seeing disruption or could that be a future risk? And if so, how is it included in guidance. The CRPO guidance for 10% looks like a bit of a slowdown despite the easier comp. And Amy, you called out pro services a one-point headwind. But just any other factors we should keep in mind that may create a challenge over the next couple of months? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, I'll tell you that. I think that as you know, in Q1, we went through tremendous disruption with human resources in our company, and it was very disruptive to all of our Ohana. And I'm so grateful to them for how they supported the whole company, all the customers and themselves during what was probably one of the most disruptive quarters that I've seen and yet we delivered these incredible numbers and this incredible technology vision going forward. In terms of enablement of the sales organization, its ability to kind of move forward, that is not, I would say, a material part of what happened in the quarter or what's going to happen for the year. Our sales organization remains with a very high level of productivity, but let me turn it over to Brian to speak directly to his strategy on delivering the year. Brian Millham : Yes, Marc, thank you. I appreciate it. And Elizabeth, thank you for the question. I think you're referencing some comments we made on previous calls about enablement being an important strategy for us as we saw during the pandemic, not as many of our AEs and SEs and leaders were as enabled as we would like. We've made those changes, and we've really invested in the time to make sure our AEs understand our product portfolio, the entire customer 360, and we're on sort of the next generation of enablement. As Marc just talked about, this new AI wave is going to create a huge opportunity for us. And we need to make sure that we're investing in the enablement to bring our teams along. It's been a very short window around this innovation, and we've got some work to do on this, but we're very, very excited with our path forward, our position in the market. All that we're doing with our customers, the demand we're feeling from our customers. Marc mentioned it, and I had the same experience, every CEO in the world is talking to us about generative AI right now, and we are investing heavily to make sure our account executives, our sales teams, in fact, the entire company is able to articulate our value proposition to our customers. So, Amy, I don't know if you have any further comments there? Amy Weaver : Sure. Elizabeth, you mentioned CRPO in professional services, so let me jump in on that. For our guide for this next quarter, we are seeing some pressures from the macro situation and then also specifically from professional services. And there's a bit of a nuance with ProServ that I want to make sure people understand. So, if you back up, our customers can contract for professional services in two ways, either on a time and materials basis, which is typically used for smaller projects or on a fixed fee, kind of milestone basis. For purposes of CRPO, we only include projected revenue from fixed fee deals. One of the things that we are seeing right now is not only a professional services as a whole same pressure, but more customers are choosing to contract on a time and materials basis, which is not included in our CRPO. So, as a result, we're seeing, kind of a double pressure there. And I'm expecting a full one-point headwind to CRPO for the quarter from professional services. Mike Spencer : Thanks Elizabeth. Emma, let\u2019s move to the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Oh, wonderful. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question to Brian, I think, here on the efforts here to improve productivity. You mentioned removing some layers here. My question is, we think of all these actions that you're taking as drivers of margin expansion, but are you starting to see some early traction here on the sales productivity front, such that perhaps that's driving some upside here across the business, perhaps larger deals now that you're seeing coming out of the field and pipeline and some of the deal closure? Thank you so much. Brian Millham : Thanks, Brad, for the question. I really appreciate it. As you know, we're operating in a constrained environment right now. And so, we are really focused on this productivity measure and metric for our organization right now, investing heavily, as I mentioned earlier, and the enablement part of our organization. Also looking at other ways to drive productivity. And one of the things that we're talking quite a bit about right now is pricing and packaging, bringing together logical products that we can be selling in a single motion versus our go-to-market, which is largely aligned by product., how do we focus on a larger average deal size for every transaction, and so big investments on that front, really a strong focus on productivity as it relates to moving people up market as well. We're thinking about self-serve in the bottom end of our market. How do we drive a self-serve motion, automated motion at the low end of our market to bring our account executives upmarket to drive higher productivity in the sales organization? So clearly, a big motion for us right now. Feel very good about our big deal motion. Actually in Q4, we saw some \u2013 sorry, in Q1, we saw some very good big deal execution from the team. That is not really an area that has held us back. We feel very good about our ability to transform companies and transact these large businesses. It really is the velocity business that has held us back a bit on our create and close some of the SMB transactions. So, we have a clear focus in this area to drive the productivity with our plans going into Q2 and beyond into Q4. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Brad. Emma, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Amy, regarding Americas, that was a pretty large decel, one of your slowest growth quarters, I think, ever in Americas. The rest of the world did decel, but maybe not quite as the magnitude of the Americas. Can you just speak to what happened there in that region? Amy Weaver : Sure. So thanks, Brad, for the question. The Americans did see a deceleration, a 10% year-on-year revenue growth, compared to 17% in EMEA and about 24% in nominal APAC. We are continuing to see most of the pressure in North America. There were some real pockets of acceleration in EMEA and in LatAm, particularly in Switzerland, I think Brazil, Italy. So, we are seeing some good things, but North America has taken the brunt of the deceleration. Brian, do you want to come in and see if you can address that in more detail? Brian Millham : Sure. Yes. I think when we think about our business from an industry perspective, we have a very nice footprint of our great technology companies and financial services company, both of which were a bit slower than we would have liked in the Americas in Q1. And so, as we think about the all-in size of our Americas business, those industries felt a little bit more of the economic headwinds in the quarter in Q1. And so, I think a bit of a slowdown from that perspective is a result you're seeing in the Americas business. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Brent. Emma, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. And I'll add my congrats. So Marc, it feels like the tech and software industry has had a recession without the broader economy being in a recession quite yet, and that's very unusual. Do you think with all the purging and optimizing of IT budgets, which is already taking place, plus Salesforce's headcount optimization already being underway that perhaps the next recession might actually be more manageable or easier to navigate than what you had seen in some of the prior cycles? Marc Benioff : Well, I think that this is a great question. And I tried to address it on the last call. I just really think you have to look at 2020, 2021 was just this massive super cycle called the pandemic. I don't know if you remember, but we had a pandemic a couple of years ago. And during that, we saw tech buying like we never saw. It was incredible and everybody surged on tech buying. So, you're really looking at comparisons against that huge mega cycle. And that is what I think is extremely important to understand, the relative comparisons. And that is where my head is at, which is I am constantly comparing against what happened in 2021, but also looking at 2020 and 2019. That's a little bit different than 2008 and that's a little bit different than 2001. We didn't exactly have these huge mega cycles that kind of we were exiting. And I \u2013 that's also what gives me tremendous confidence going forward and what we're really seeing is that customers are absorbing the huge amounts of technology that they bought. And that is about to come, I believe, to a close. I can't give you the exact date, and it's going to be accelerated by this AI super cycle. Mark Murphy : Thank you. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Mark. Emma, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Brent Bracelin : Good afternoon. I wanted to circle back to the generative AI discussion, if we could. I totally understand how large enterprises are turning to Microsoft, given the productivity tools and suite that they have, but as you start to engage with customers, what's resonating relative to the Salesforce Gen AI journey? Is it the data layer and Customer 360 messages resonating? Is it the app layer around sales automation functionality that you're going to offer? Just double quick on what customers are coming to Salesforce and engaging the you around some of the new things that we'll hear about it sounds like in June. Marc Benioff : Well, I think that when you look at our artificial intelligence strategy, which we're talking to the largest, most important companies and governments in the world, it has to be architected around security. It has to be architected around compliance, around trust. It has to be architected around governance. And this is very important. And of course, we're also architecting it around being open. That is, we're working with many AI companies to provide the best solutions for our company. Of course, we have a tremendous relationship with OpenAI. We also just invested in Anthropic [indiscernible] many of these companies. But I think ultimately, this is going to be a solution that enterprise customers are going to come in and make sure that their data is protected. And it's also protected down at the user level. And Srini, do you want to come in and talk about exactly what we're doing to make sure that we're delivering the best possible solutions for our customers for AI? Srini Tallapragada : Yes, Marc. So, I think I met about 70 customers in the last quarter. And like Marc was saying, the only conversation everybody is interested is on \u2013 and while everybody understands the used cases, they're really worried about trust. And what they are looking for us is guidance on how to solve that. For example, so we are doing a lot of things as the basic security level, like we are really doing tenant level isolation coupled with zero retention architecture, the LLM level. So the LLM doesn't remember any of the data. Along with that, they \u2013 for them to use these used cases, they want to have \u2013 they have a lot of these compliances like GDPR, ISO, SOC, [Quadrant] [ph], they want to ensure that those compliances are still valid, and we're going to solve it for that. In addition, the big worry everybody has is, people have heard about hallucinations, toxicity, bias, this is what we call [model trust] [ph]. We have a lot of innovation around how to ground the data on 360 data, which is a huge advantage we have. And we are able to do a lot of things at that level. And then the thing which I think Marc hinted at, which is LLMs are not like a database. These intra-enterprise trust, even once you have an LLM, you can't open the data to everybody in the company. So, you need ability to do this \u2013 who can access this data, how is it doing both before the query and after the query, we have to build that. And then we have to be not only open, but also optimized. We are running an open \u2013 the way we'll run is, we'll run like a model [indiscernible] because one of the things everybody has to watch out is it's great, but what about the cost to serve, not all models are equal. So, we are going to run this and pick very \u2013 we are going to pick a very cost-optimized curve, so the value is very high. And our Salesforce AI research has a lot of sales for state-of-the-art models and industry cases, which we are optimizing to run at very low cost and high value. Add to that, we've got the Trailblazers platform, which allows low code, high code, and many other things, and we're going to optimize sort of jobs to be done for each industry and jobs. That's really what they're looking for because they have been using our AI platform. Like Marc mentioned, we already do 1 trillion transactions per day. And by the way, the data cloud, just in a month, we are importing more than 7 trillion records into the data layer, so which is a very powerful asset we have. So, coupled with all of this is what they are looking for guidance and how we think we can deliver significant value to our customers. Marc Benioff : Srini, I want to ask you a question. In January, you published a paper in nature from your research team, which was called large language models, generating functional protein sequences across diverse families, and you really showed something amazing, which was that deep learning language models have shown this incredible promise that you just articulated in various biotechnological applications, including protein design, engineering, and you also described very well one of our models that we've created internally, ProGen, which was a language model that can generate protein sequences with predictable function across large protein families. I was very impressed with that. And the entire research team deserves a huge amount of congratulations. So, when you look at that, especially dramatically and semantically correct natural language sentences for diverse topics or how you're going to use that inside our platform against other models that you're seeing like Llama, OpenAI's model, Anthropic and others, when will Salesforce use our own models like [CoGen] [ph], ProGen, T-code, our lit model, when will we use an outside commercial model like an OpenAI or an Anthropic? And when will we go to an open source model like we've seen emerge so many of those, including like Llama. Srini Tallapragada : Yes. I think you hinted something very important. I think, as you know, Marc, we have \u2013 our I research team is one of the best-in-class model \u2013 state-of-the-art models from different areas. The way we are thinking of it is like anything else, where the world is going to go, which we strongly believe is going to be multiple models. And depending on the used case, you will pick the right models, which will provide you the value at the lowest cost. Where we have to run with highly regulated industries, where the data cannot leave the trust boundary or where we have significant advantage, where we can train on industry-specific data or Salesforce-specific \u2013 360-specific data, like, for example, our FX model are helping our customers implement or our flow, we will use our internal model. Where we need more generated image models or something where it needs public image databases, we may use a coherent or an OpenAI. It depends on the use case and which is why, at a given request, a secure trusted gateway will decide smartly which is the best used case, which is the model, and we always keep running the [indiscernible], which is what I mean. So today, one particular model may be good. Tomorrow, something else will come, and we'll behind the team flip it, but our customers don't need to know that. We will handle all of it. We'll handle the model trust. We'll handle all the compliances and all behind the scenes. And this is always what we promise to our customers, we'll always future-proof. That's the Salesforce promise to our customers so that they can focus on the business used cases. Marc Benioff : So just one last follow-up question. You've described very well the GPT trust layer, which I think is going to be a significant amount of value added that we're going to provide to our customers that's going to be quite amazing. And then you develop these specific grounding techniques, which are going to allow us to keep our customers' data safe and not be consumed by these voracious large language models, which are so hungry for all of our customers' data. What is going to be the key to actually delivering this now across regulated industries? Srini Tallapragada : I think the key is innovations we are doing, which people will see starting next month is around what we call [from generation] [ph] and grounding. These are techniques, which we'll have to do, but it will work only because we have \u2013 all of this as based on underlying data. We have the Data Cloud, where we have all the 360 data, which is there. So, we're able to ground these models and do it. So, there are a lot of other techniques, which are very technical, which we put it on our block. But that's the innovation that we're doing. And you have to remember that Salesforce also is a metadata model. So, we have a semantic understanding of what our customers are trying to do. We're going to leverage the Metadata platform and do this grounding automatically for our customers, of course, while keeping the trust. That's the base line. Marc Benioff : Absolutely. Thank you so much, Srini. Mike Spencer : Emma, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hi, thank you. Question for Amy or Brian maybe more. The improvement in profitability or the raised guidance for profitability and cash is that all timing? Can you talk a little bit about that? Is it just timing or are there other factors we should consider in here? Thank you. Amy Weaver : So Raimo, well I\u2019ll start and then I can turn it over to Brian for a little bit more color. So, in terms of the great Q1 that we just saw, really pleased to see us coming in at 27.6% and also really pleased about the 28% \u2013 [the raise] to 28% for the full-year. What really drove the 27.6 was two things. It were the actions that we took that we announced in January with the restructuring. Executing on that, as well as having a very disciplined reinvestment strategy, and that led to that. And that's also where we're going to see this going through the rest of the year, driving the expansion 28% and then also putting us on track for the 30% margin in Q1 of next year. As I look through overall at transformation, I would really divide it into two stages benefits that we're getting from that initial transformation. And again, that's what you're seeing in Q1 and this year. And then the second stage, which is really as we've been going through this comprehensive operating and go-to-market review, that review is going to enable the second phase of our transformation, and that's something that's going to be ongoing and long-term over the next few years. You'll see benefits to our margin in outer years beyond FY 2024. Brian, anything you would add? Brian Millham : Yes, thanks for the question. When we think about longer-term structures, we obviously took the action in Q1. But longer term, we're looking at things like how do we leverage comp plan redesign to drive better efficiencies in our organization going forward. How do we continue to look at self-serve at the low end of the market to drive better efficiencies in our organization. So, resellers as a potential investment that we'll make in emerging markets is long-term leverage on the efficiency gains. So lots of things that we're doing that will be in sort of the Phase 2 oriented around process improvement and systems improvement. And again, as I mentioned, top plan design that will drive better efficiencies in the organization. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Raimo. Emma, let\u2019s go to next question please. Operator : Your next question will come \u2013 is from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is open. Karl Keirstead : Okay. Great. I'll direct this to Amy as well. Amy, congrats on that margin improvement. I've got a two-parter both related to margins. First, what is the timing of the receipt of that Bain operational review that might ostensibly kick off the second phase of cost cutting? And then secondly, you and Brian talked about this reinvestment in R&D and investing heavily around AI. I'm wondering if those planned investments are greater than you anticipated when you initially set the guidance three months ago, such that you need to run a little bit harder on OpEx management to offset it and keep delivering on your stated margin targets? Thanks so much. Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks, Karl. So first on the timing. As I mentioned, we've been doing this end-to-end comprehensive operating and go-to-market review. The entire company has been involved in that. There's really no stone unturned. We're getting close to the end of that process, and then we will be moving into the implementation. You'll be hearing more about that in future quarters. Turning to reinvestment. We are keeping a very close eye on reinvestment, very excited particularly about artificial intelligence. So, much of what Srini has been talking to you about, I don't view this as a greater investment from what we were looking at earlier. We're really going along with our current plans. We are looking at operating expenses management, and we're looking at it seriously every day, but that's not something that has changed. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Karl. Operator, we'll move to our last question now, please. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much team. Congratulations on putting up terrific operational results, and a good cash flow, good margins, et cetera. Marc, you talked about a super cycle of buying and technology in the years ahead. Can you just parse for us, if you don't mind, what is new about generative AI as far as Salesforce as opportunities are concerned, netting out against what Einstein has been able to accomplish for you \u2013 for the company? And how does it show up in the product in terms of productivity? What are the scenarios by which customers can experience this amazing productivity? And how can you charge more for delivering that, kind of value? Thank you so much. Marc Benioff : Well, thanks, Kash, for giving me the opportunity to talk about our AI vision, and I'm also going to ask Srini again to fill in some of the details. But I think it started to occur to me \u2013 I think folks know, I have \u2013 my neighbor is Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, and I went over to his house for dinner, and it was a great conversation as it always is with him. And he had \u2013 he said, Oh, just hold on one second, Marc, I want to get my laptop. And he brought his laptop out and give me some demonstrations of advanced technologies that are not appropriate for the call. But I did notice that there was only one application that he was using on his laptop and that was Slack. And the powerful part about that was I realized that everything from day 1 at OpenAI have been in Slack. And as we kind of brainstormed and talked about \u2013 of course, he was paying a Slack user fee and on and on, and he's a great Slack customer. We've done a video about them, it's on YouTube. But I realize that taking an LLM and embedding it inside Slack, well, maybe Slack will wake up. I mean there is so much data in Slack, I wonder if it could tell him what are the opportunities in OpenAI? What are the conflicts, what are the conversations? What should be his prioritization? What is the big product that got repressed that he never knew about? And I realized in my own version of Slack at Salesforce, I have over 95 million Slack messages, and these are all open messages. I'm not talking about closed messaging or direct messaging or secure messaging between employees. I'm talking about the open framework that's going on inside Salesforce and with so many of our customers. And then I realized, wow, I think Slack could wake up, and it could become a tremendous asset with an LLM consuming all that data and driving it. And then, of course, the idea is that is a new version of Slack. Not only do you have the free version of Slack, not only do you have the per user version of Slack, but then you have the additional LLM version of Slack. And for each one of our products in every single one of our categories, there's that opportunity to upsell and cross-sell into the next version of generative AI, not just with Slack, but you can also imagine, for example, even with Salesforce, the ability as we're going to see in June, that many of our trailblazers are amazing low-code, no-code trailblazers, but soon they'll have the ability to tap in to our LLMs like ProGen and Cogen that have the ability to code for them automatically. They aren't coders. They didn't graduate computer science degrees. And if they need to write a sophisticated Apex code or other code, it can be a challenge for them, but because you know what is there only 8 million or 10 million coders in the whole world \u2013 but now with LLMs, everybody can start to code. That's an amazing productivity and augmentation of everybody's skill set. And that's a great way to look at what could happen, for example, with our core products, but even with Tableau, which has tremendous programmatic engine as well or even MuleSoft, which is a highly programmatic product that then coupled with an LLM can have the ability to go forward. But of course, those LLMs are highly trained models for those specific types of code, and then that is something that we would add on either through partnership or through our own LLM, as Srini described, it's another layer of value that we can provide to our customers. In all cases, customers are going to be more productive. They're going to be more automated, and they're going to be more intelligent. And as we look at some of the examples that we've given like at the New York World Tour, you saw our Marketing Cloud do something very cool that it couldn't do even just 6 months ago. It segmented the database on its own. It wrote an e-mail on its own. Of course, it required editing, and it also built a landing page on its own. That was amazing. Or as we saw at the Tableau conference, we saw Tableau being able to create its own visits or visualizations that was incredible. And what we saw at our Trailhead DX, we saw Einstein GPT which started to do these amazing next-generation things. And I think in each of these areas, we can offer more value, but we must do it in the auspices of trust, data integrity and governance. And that is what we have been working on now for a considerable amount of time. Of course, we've led \u2013 we have always wanted to be the Number 1 AI CRM. And we are, if you look at Einstein's transaction level, I think that that's enough evidence right there. But I think this idea of generative AI, this starts to reconceptualize every product and we will start to build and develop not only extensions to all of our current products, but entirely new products as well. And we have a lot of exciting ideas of things that we can do to help our customers connect with their customers in a new way using generative AI. Srini, do you want to come in and talk about that? Srini Tallapragada : Thanks, Marc. So, I think the way I see it is this AI technologies are a continuum that is predictive then they generate, and the real long-term goal is autonomous. The initial version of the generative AI will be more in terms of assistance. And like Marc was saying, we are seeing like the most common used case everybody understands implicitly is self-service bots or in the call center or agent-assistant assistance, which I think really helps productivity. But the other used cases, which we are going to see, and in fact, I have rolled out our own code LLMs in our engineering organ, we are already seeing minimum 20% productivity. And in those cases... Marc Benioff : Well, that's a very key point. Isn\u2019t it? That you're seeing a 30% productivity increase in your own engineers using our own LLM. Srini Tallapragada : 20%, we are seeing minimum. In some cases, up to 30%. Now, a lot of our customers are asking the same. We are going to roll Einstein GPT for our developers in the ecosystem, which will not only help not only the local developers to bridge the gap, where there's a talent gap, but also reduce the cost of implementations for a lot of people. So there's a lot of value. This assistant model is where we'll see a lot of uptick. And then I think the fully autonomous cases, for example, in our own internal used cases with our models, we are able to detect 60% of instance and auto remediate. That requires a little bit more fine-tuning and we'll have to work with specific customers to get to that level of model performance. So, I see this is just the start of this [cut] [ph]. The resistant model is the initial thing to build trust and a human in the loop and validate it. And then as the models get better and better, we'll keep taking used cases where we can fully automate it. Marc Benioff : And address this one issue that a lot of customers come in like they did yesterday, and they tell us they think they're just going to take all of their data, all their customer data, all of their information and put it into an LLM and create a corporate knowledge base, and it's going to be one amalgamated database. Why is that a false prophecy? Srini Tallapragada : Because even today, any example you see, even though we have hundreds of Slack channels, there are a lot of specific Slack channels, which only you want access to. You don't want that. LLM doesn't know. There is no concept of \u2013 it combines all this information. So, unless you put the layer both before who can access the data and then when it generates response, what he can do, you don't want one wealth manager to generally generate a report, an account report where you're mixing customers' balances. So there are a lot of trust issues we have to solve. So, LLMs are good for a lot of very creative generative used cases, initially, where it's public data that everybody can use it. Those are used cases. I think there is enough of low-hanging fruit in the initial phases with assistant model, which we'll solve. The really complex automated cases, the role level, record level sharing, we have a lot of techniques, which we are developing, which we will do. It's also a research area, too. That one, I think we should be tempered with expectations, but there's enough of, like I said, the develop, for example, I gave product example there's enough of productivity which we will get. Marc Benioff : Well, we're really excited to show all of this technology at our AI Day on June 12 in New York City. And then also when we get to [Dreamforce GPT] [ph], we're going to have an incredible demonstration of this technology. Mike Spencer : So with that, we want to thank everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks. Have a great one.

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would like to hand over the conference to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Mike Spencer : Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today on our fiscal 2024 second quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings materials and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which could change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. And with that, let me hand the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : All right. Thanks so much, Mike, and really appreciate everyone being here today. We're obviously very excited about these results and getting out there with all of you, and thanks for being on this call. So, listen, as we've shared with you over the last couple of earnings calls, Salesforce has really accelerated our transformation to profitable growth. I think that's super clear from the numbers and I couldn't be more excited, especially on this huge top line beat and what our margin is looking like today. As you all know, over last year, we've been executing against these four key areas of our transformation. First, our restructuring for the short and long-term. We've been talking about that since the fourth quarter call and we're going to update you on that today. Second, we're reigniting our performance culture by focusing on productivity, operational excellence and profitability and Brian is going to talk about that today. And third, we're prioritizing the core innovations to drive customer success, and I can't wait to share with you at Dreamforce, how we're taking our core platform to a whole new level, showing you some incredible new enhancements to our data cloud as well as new versions of Einstein and also fundamental extensions to our core platform, really showing how our core platform has been rebuilt so that we can take so many of these amazing acquisitions that we've made over the last decade and run them right inside the core. Our fourth priority is building even stronger relationships with our investors. That's all of you. You know how important that is to us. We probably spent more time in the last six or nine months with our investors, and we have maybe in the entire history of the company. And we've received just great feedback from all of you and we're really making great progress there and I want to especially thank Mike for everything that he's doing with all of you. And we're adding a fifth priority. And last quarter, we told you we're now driving our AI transformation. We're pioneering AI for both our customers and ourselves leading the industry through this incredible new innovation cycle and I couldn't be happier with Srini and David and the entire product and technology team for the incredible velocity of AI products that were released to customers this quarter and the huge impact that they're making in the market and showing how Salesforce is transforming from being not only the number one CRM, but to the number one AI CRM, and I just express my sincere gratitude to our entire T&P team. I couldn't be happy with the performance of our team delivered in the second quarter, and the numbers basically speak for themselves. Our AI data, CRM plus Trust platform, well, it's propelled us to become the third largest enterprise software company by revenue in the world. And I think in Japan, we just became the second largest company. So congratulations to everyone at Salesforce and especially to our Japanese team. And with our industry-leading cloud and sales service marketing commerce, our industry clouds powered by Data Cloud, Einstein Flow, Tableau, Slack, MuleSoft. Really, all of these are integrated into one trusted metadata-driven platform. We're providing more capabilities to more customers than any other CRM vendor, and I can't wait to show all that, as I said, at Dreamforce. That's why Salesforce is the number one CRM by market share based on the largest latest IDC Software Tracker. And now we are working hard to be the number one, as I said, AI CRM. Our transformation drove our second quarter results, especially when it comes to our highest priority, as you can see, profitability. And look, we couldn't be happier to see these numbers. It's incredible to see the margin acceleration in such a short period of time. We've exceeded our own expectations. I hope you've exceeded yours. In our second quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin rose to 31.6%. That's up over 1,000 basis points year-over-year. And this is the second quarter in a row, our operating margin is up 1,000 or more points year-over-year. And as you're about to hear from Amy, we've maintained our disciplined approach to cost management while also investing in growth initiatives across our entire platform of offering and we're positioning Salesforce for the future and will continue to drive our margins and also while we're continuing to drive customer growth. Revenue in the second quarter was $8.6 billion. It adds up a 11% year-over-year and the same in constant currency. And during the quarter, we had great wins with JPMorgan, Bayer, FedEx, Maersk, as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs. And so many more you're going to hear about from Brian. Operating cash flow for Q2 was $808 million, pretty incredible. That's up 142% year-over-year, really, very strong. And our remaining performance obligation ended the second quarter at $46.6 billion, that's an increase of 12% year-over-year, really amazing. Current remaining performance obligation or what we call CRPO, ended at $24.1 billion. That's up 12% year-over-year and 11% and in constant currency. Now through the second quarter, we have returned and this is amazing, $8 billion in share repurchases since we started the buyback program a year ago. So we've bought $8 billion of stock over the last 12 months that is really awesome. Amy is going to talk more about that. And I think I know you realize we have a lot more to do there. Based on our performance and what we saw in the back half of the year, we're raising our fiscal '24 revenue guidance to $34.7 billion to $34.8 billion or about 11% projected growth year-over-year. Last quarter, we raised our fiscal year '24 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 28% and we said that we expected to eclipse 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '25. Well, as you've all seen these numbers and now I'm happy to officially share, we are accelerating that target again, raising our fiscal year '24 non-GAAP operating margin, 30%, an improvement of 750 basis points year-over-year. It's kind of amazing, but, yes, we are saying that we're going to deliver 30% margin for this year. And that's an incredible goal. So while we thought we were going to do it next year, we're really going to do it this year. And it's an amazing achievement of our whole team. It certainly has been a lot of work. It's been difficult. In a lot of cases, it has been a struggle. But our teams are incredible. And what they have done has been nothing more miraculous and down to see, not only to the delivery of the 31% plus growth for this quarter, but 30% for the year. It's just awesome. It's just incredible. And I'm really excited to welcome back to Salesforce so many boomerang employees. Boomerang employees are employees who are employees, but for one reason or another, left the company, got recruited away or went off to start their own companies or ever. Well, a lot of these results have to do with not only our incredible employees that we've had in place. But a lot of folks have really felt the desire to come back and help us. And I just want to say thank you to all of them. It's been incredible to welcome them back. And the line is long out the door of people who have left Salesforce and want to come back to Salesforce and we're welcoming all of them with open arms, especially across our sales, engineering, technology organization, proven winners, incredible leaders who got taken out of Salesforce because they were doing incredible things. To watch them come back because they want to help us and achieve this next level of growth and capability and revenue and margin and in technology and leadership. Well, I just want to especially start to thank some of those, including Miguel Milano who's our new Chief Revenue Officer. He's just returned to us from Celonis and of course Ariel Kelman, our Chief Marketing Officer, who was most recently at Oracle and Kendall Collins, our Chief Business Officer, and he's been my -- now my Chief of Staff and was, of course, had so many executive positions at Salesforce. But this is a long list and I can't even continue it of how many people are coming back. And what I love about this is that they're hitting the ground running and they make an immediate impact. They know the culture, they understand the products, they're able to execute incredible agility. And so I've got the siren sound out there for all of them to come back and to join us. Now earlier this month, we welcomed Sabastian Niles to Salesforce, he's our Chief Legal Officer. He's sitting here at the table right now, making funny faces with me, and I wouldn't be happier. And I couldn't be happier to have Sabastian. As part of my executive leadership team, we met Sabastian this year. We did a lot of work with Wachtell, as lot of you know, we will go through the details. It's not necessarily to go through that right now. The past is the past. But I'll tell you one of the greatest things that happened during this amazing period of Salesforce was meeting Sabastian and now to have him on the leadership team. I couldn't be more excited and I'm thrilled to have him with us. So welcome Sabastian. Sabastian Niles : Thank you. Marc Benioff : Okay. Thank you. Those are his opening comments. AI, Data, CRM, Trust, let me tell you, we are at the dawn of an AI revolution. And as I've said, it's a new innovation cycle that is sparking amounts of tech buying cycle over the coming years. It's also a new tech investment cycle. We've been involved in the earliest rounds many of the top AI start-ups. Many of you have seen that, we are in there very early. But I'll tell you, this company has pioneered AI, and not just in predictive, a lot of you have followed up the development and growth of Einstein. But also, you've seen that we've published some of the first papers on prompt engineering and the beginnings of generative AI, and we took our deep learning routes, and we really demonstrated the potential for regenerative AI and now to see so many of these companies become so successful. I just saw OpenAI delivering $1 billion revenue run rate. It's just awesome to see this growth and especially proud that they're right here in our hometown of San Francisco, which is becoming the number one AI city in the world. Very excited for our city. Now through our $500 million generative AI Fund, we're seeing the development of ethical AI with amazing companies like Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face and some others, and I just heard one of them just subleased our entire Slack building, but I'm not allowed to say who it is, but I couldn't be more excited about that because we're really seeing downtown San Francisco become AI Central. So every CEO I've met with this year across every industry believes that AI is essential to improving both their top and bottom line, but especially their productivity AI is just augmenting what we can do every single day, just thinking about myself. I have spent so much time on Bard over the last week, it's incredible. I was just buying some flashlights and I couldn't figure out what flashlight I wanted to buy, and I was on Amazon trying to figure out what's the flashlight. And so I took a picture of the Amazon picture of what was happening on the app, and I gave it to Bard because Bard has this multimodal capability to ingest the photo. And then ingested the photo, and it told me not to buy the flashlight, that it was poor quality and then recommended one that was better for me, and it was incredible to see that I was once again working with a next generation of artificial intelligence. And that is inspiring me and I think many of our customers and ultimately, all of them believe they can grow their businesses by becoming more connected to their customers than ever before through AI and at the same time, reduce cost, increase productivity, drive efficiency and exceed customer expectations through AI. And I'll tell you, every single management team that we have here at Salesforce every week, we're using our Einstein AI to do exactly the same thing. We go back, we're trying to augment ourselves using Einstein. So what we'll say is, and we've been doing this now and super impressive, we'll say, okay, Brian, what do you think our number is and we'll say, okay, that's very nice, Brian. But Einstein, what do you really think the number is? And then Einstein will say, I think Brian is sandbagging and then the meeting continues. The reality is every company will undergo an AI transformation with the customer at the center, because every AI transformation begins and ends with the customer, and that's why Salesforce is really well positioned with the future. And with this incredible technology, Einstein that we've invested so much and grown and integrated into our core technology base. We're democratizing generative AI, making it very easy for our customers to implement every job, every business in every industry. And I will just say that in the last few months, we've injected a new layer of generative AI assistance across all of the Customer 360. And you can see it with our salespeople who are now using our Sales Cloud GPT, which has been incredible, what we've released this quarter to all of our customers and here inside Salesforce. And then when we see that, they all say to themselves, you know what, in this new world, everyone can now be in Einstein. But democratizing generative AI at scale for the biggest brands in the world requires more than -- that's just these large language models and deep learning algorithms, and we all know that because a lot of our customers kind of think and they have tried and they go and they pull something off a Hugging Face, it is an amazing company. We just invested in their new round and grab a model and put some data in it and nothing happens. And then they don't understand and they call us and say, hey, what's happening here? I thought that this AI was so amazing and it's like, well, it takes a lot to actually get this intelligence to occur. And that's what I think that's the value that Salesforce is bringing is that we're really able to help our customers achieve this kind of technological superiority right out of the box just using our products in a low code, no code way. It's really just democratization of generative AI at scale. And that is really what we're trying to achieve that at the heart of every one of these AI transformations becomes our intelligent, integrated and incredible Salesforce platform, and we're going to show all of that at Dreamforce. Our platform starts and ends now with our Data Cloud, and I just would like to call out the incredible Data Cloud team for what they've delivered. A lot of you have seen the release of the Data Cloud, this incredible Genie technology that we started really showing off last Dreamforce, but what you can see with Data Cloud is that customers must get their data together if they want to achieve success with AI. This is the critical first step for every single customer. And we're going to see that this AI revolution is really a data revolution. And you're going to see at Dreamforce that we're going to get this data cloud turned on as fast as we can and as easiest as we can for every single one of our customers. This Data Cloud is incredible, what it's doing for our customers. It not only has AI built in, but it's real time, it's automated, it's integrated with the core platform. It's not some separate Data Cloud. It's an integrated part of our platform in our metadata, in our core code, like our Sales Cloud, like our Service Cloud and, as you're about to assume seeing our new Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud and of course, our core application development capabilities all inside our Data Cloud. No CRM platform on the planet is better positioned than Salesforce to use this amazing Salesforce and business data to fuel AI-powered applications because of this architecture. It's very easy for our customers to set up and just go. And our data cloud is so deeply integrated as part of this core metadata architecture. It's allowing our customers to quickly action all of their data from any source without the costly integration project necessary with stand-alone data warehouses and data lakes, they've been forced to buy and create more islands of information and all of these independent systems and independent teams versus having one integrated data architecture. We're moving our customers from having islands of data to having a single source of truth for all of their data. This is our greatest dream. With Data Cloud and powerful technologies like Einstein Flow, Lightning, Tableau, MuleSoft, Slack. Our customers, they can easily supercharge every application and customer experience with AI, automation and analytics at scale. Data Cloud continues to be our fastest-growing organic product. You're going to see the new version. At Dreamforce, it's fully integrated with our Sales Cloud and Service Cloud and of course, already our Marketing Cloud and other key things in this kind of new second version of Data Cloud that's coming will be fully released to the customers. And as I said, our goal is for every customer just to be able to easily turn it on. Just in the second quarter, Data Cloud ingested, and this is amazing. Over six trillion records, it ingested six trillion records and triggered more than one trillion activations to drive customer engagement. And we've always put trust at the center of everything that's going on in our platform and that has never been important. More important, I would say, especially now, with not only with data cloud, but in this AI revolution because this AI revolution is a trust revolution. Everything Einstein does has also delivered with trust and especially ethics at the center and I especially want to call out the incredible work of our office of ethical and humane use, pioneering the use of ethics and technology. If you didn't read their incredible article in HBR this quarter. It was awesome. And they are doing incredible work really saying that it's not just about AI, it's not just about data, but it's also about trust and ethics. And that's why we developed this Einstein trust layer. This is completely unique in the industry. It enables our customers to maintain their data privacy, security, residency and compliance goals. And I can tell you, we're already at this early stage seen momentum with these amazing Einstein innovations. Companies like Heathrow Airport and PenFed Credit Union really adopted Einstein and took their Salesforce implementations to another level in the quarter. Heathrow is a great example of transformative power of AI, Data, CRM and Trust and the power of a single source of truth. They have 70 million passengers who pass through their terminal annually, I'm sure many of you have been one of those passengers I have as well, Heathrow is operating in a tremendous scale, managing the entire airport experience with the Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, but now Heathrow, they've added Data Cloud also giving them a single source of truth for every customer interaction and setting them up to pioneer the AI revolution. And with Einstein, Heathrow's service agents now have this AI-assisted generator applies to service inquiries, case deflection, writing case summaries, all the relevant data and business context coming from Data Cloud, we're doing so much incredible and exciting innovative work in service with Data Cloud and with our Service Cloud and AI is going to show us a whole new vision for the future of service and what our Service Cloud can do for customers not only with delivering high-quality customer service, but delivering incredible new levels of productivity. This is saving their agents huge amounts of time and effort. This is the power of Salesforce. I've never been more excited about the future of our industry, the power and future of our company, the potential to help all of our customers and also especially our team, the quality of our team, especially fueled by all these amazing new boomerangs and you're going to see it all at Dreamforce. Dreamforce is right around the corner, September 12 through 14 right here in San Francisco. I'm looking forward to welcoming each and every one of you to Dreamforce. I'm right now at the top of Salesforce Tower in San Francisco. We're going to bring you up here. We'll bring you through Moscone. We'll show you our incredible downtown. And I'll tell you this isn't just the largest enterprise tech conference this year. It's going to be the world's largest AI conference and the largest gathering of AI experts. We'll have many of the world's top AI thinkers, including Sam Altman and his amazing OpenAI company, incredible what he's doing. Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei, who's one of his alumni who left OpenAI to start Anthropic, amazing company. Stanford's Fei-Fei Li, amazing researcher and visionary leader of AI and presenting some of the -- into some of the 1,500 Dreamforce Conference sessions, it's really awesome what we're going to see here with AI and Dreamforce. And we're going to take everyone's skills to a whole another level. And we'll also share our vision for the future of CRM, the next generation of Data Cloud and Einstein. And we're also going to have the Foo Fighters, they are going to play our Dreamforce Benefit Concert. Dave Matthews is going to play my dinner the night before. Hopefully, we're going to see him at the conference, some incredible ways. And we can't wait to get you all here and to show you what's happening at Salesforce, what's happening in AI, what's happening in San Francisco. And it's going to be an amazing event, and we're just a few days away. And now let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Millham : Thanks, Marc, particularly for the sandbagging comment. I really appreciate it. Our focus on -- Marc Benioff : It wasn't me. It was Einstein. So just you know it is what it is, Brian. Brian Millham : Got it. Our focus on operational -- Marc Benioff : That's the AI revolution coming at you, baby. So get ready. Brian Millham : Okay. Our focus on operational excellence, high performance and growth initiatives drove another strong quarter. We continued our disciplined approach to cost management and efficiencies, removing complexity from our business to drive top and bottom line improvements. Every customer I met within the quarter made it clear they are laser-focused on driving greater productivity, quick time to value and business growth. We see AI CRM as the answer, they all see AI CRM as the answer to those priorities, and we're making it easier and faster for our customers to unleash the power of trusted generative AI safely and at scale. We're innovating faster than ever with AI plus data plus CRM plus the Trust platform. We also have the most complete product portfolio with Customer 360 delivering mission-critical outcomes for our customers. And you've heard from Marc, Data Cloud is supercharging our product portfolio, servicing real-time customer data in the flow of work around sales, service, marketing and commerce. That's why more than 90% of the Fortune 100 rely on Salesforce and average more than five of our clouds. Amid the ongoing measured buying environment, compression of larger transformational deals continued in the quarter, affecting our professional services growth. Despite that, we exceeded top and bottom line expectations in Q2. This is a reflection of our proven go-to-market strategy and focus on customer success. Our high-performance culture continues to drive results and I'm proud of how well the team executed in the quarter. Our growth initiatives across core products, data, AI, services, industries and international are driving our success. In the quarter, we saw consistent demand in our core business, and we continue to benefit from customers consolidating their technology platforms to reduce complexity, drive efficiency and growth. Six of our top 10 wins in the quarter included five or more clouds. And as you'll hear from Amy or deepening our relationships with multi-cloud customers who are running their businesses on Salesforce and realizing tremendous value from having one integrated AI-powered CRM platform. Schneider Electric has been using Customer 360 for over a decade, enhancing customer engagement, service and efficiency. With Einstein, Schneider has refined demand generation, reduced close times by 30%. Through Salesforce Flow, they've automated order fulfillment. And with Service Cloud, they're handling over 8 million support interactions annually, much of it done on our self-service offering. In Q2, Schneider selected Marketing Cloud to further personalize the customer experience. In the quarter, we saw add-on products like sales performance management, digital service, self-service and marketing engagement grow 40%. And to help our smaller business customers achieve faster time to value, we introduced a new product called Salesforce Starter in Q2, bringing sales, service and marketing into one integrated offering for our small business customers. As Marc said, Data Cloud is one of our fastest-growing organic innovations ever, and it lets customers unlock the power of their data to supercharge every application and customer experience with AI, automation and analytics. This is driving our strong momentum. Data Cloud was in five of our top 10 deals in the quarter, and we saw great wins at companies like SiriusXM and KPMG. In the quarter, FedEx made a significant investment in Salesforce by adding Data Cloud, FedEx has long relied on multiple clouds from Salesforce, including sales, service, marketing and Einstein. Now with Data Cloud turned on, every part of Salesforce is deeply integrated to drive growth and deliver more targeted customer engagement and personalized experiences. We're also seeing strong customer momentum on Einstein generative AI. PenFed is a great example of how AI plus Data plus CRM plus Trust is driving growth for our customers. PenFed is one of the largest credit unions in the US, growing at a rate of the next nine credit unions combined. They're already using Financial Services Cloud, Experience Cloud and MuleSoft, and our Einstein-powered Chatbots handling 40,000 customer service sessions per month. In fact, today, PenFed resolves 20% of their cases on first contact with Einstein-powered Chatbots resulting in a 223% increase in Chatbot activity in the past year with incredible ROI. In Q2, PenFed expanded with Data Cloud to unify all the customer data from its nearly 3 million members and increase their use of Einstein to roll out generative AI assistant for every single one of their service agents. In the quarter, we also had great wins in Tableau, Slack and MuleSoft. With Tableau continuing to be a tailwind to our revenue growth. In Q2, nearly half of our greater than $1 million deals included MuleSoft. And as customers bring together data from all sources to fuel efficiency, growth and insights, MuleSoft has become mission-critical for them and was included in half of our top 10 deals. We've seen excellent usage growth in our automation products, including Slack, which now which has now launched nearly 8 million workflows weekly, 71% increase year-over-year. Our industry verticals continue to be a growth lever for us. And for the third consecutive quarter, eight of our industry clouds grew at ARR above 50%. We also saw -- we saw strong growth internationally with wins like Hargreaves Lansdown in EMEA, Department of Education in Victoria and APAC, Banco Carrefour and LatAm. And I'm excited to reiterate Marc said earlier about Japan now being the second largest software business in the country, just incredible growth. As we head into the second half of the year, we are leading the way as the number one AI CRM with a path, sorry, with the pace of innovation at an all-time high. Our focus on customer success drives our own success, accelerating revenue and profitability. The full power of Salesforce and our incredible community of Trailblazer's experts and partners will be on display at Dreamforce next month. I hope to see you all there. Amy, over to you. Amy Weaver : Thank you, Brian. Our Q2 results show that we continue to make great progress in our four, now five, key areas of transformation, delivering another quarter of top and bottom line expansion. As you can see in our results, we're delivering against our transformation, driving profitable growth and shareholder value, and we are well positioned for the future with the number one AI CRM. Our execution against our profitable growth framework drove our Q2 results. So let's start with the top line commentary. For the second quarter, revenue was $8.6 billion, up 11% year-over-year and the same in constant currency. The growth was primarily driven by continued MuleSoft momentum, solid sales and service performance and a modest FX tailwind. This was partially offset by some continued weakness in professional services. The durability of our business model and our continued multi-cloud expansion strategy reflects the mission-critical nature of our unified platform. This is evidenced by the more than 450 customers who invest more than $10 million annually and average seven clouds. And in the last five years, the number of $10 million plus customers has tripled and their average number of clouds has nearly doubled. From a geographic perspective, the Americas revenue grew 10%. EMEA grew 13% or 11% in constant currency, and APAC grew 20% or 24% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth internationally, highlighted by Canada, France and India. While the United States continues to be constrained. From an industry perspective, manufacturing, automotive and energy saw greater resilience, while high tech and retail and consumer goods were more measured. Q2 revenue attrition ended the quarter at approximately 8%. In Q2, our non-GAAP operating margin rose to 31.6%, up 1,000 basis points or more for the second quarter in a row. The margin improvement was driven by savings from our restructuring actions, strength in revenue and investment timing. I am very proud of our progress. Our disciplined approach to cost management has allowed us to exceed our 30% non-GAAP margin target three quarters early. Q2 operating cash flow was $808 million, up 142% year-over-year. Q2 free cash flow was $628 million, up 379% year-over-year. The upside in cash flow was driven by stronger collections than expected and lower cash outflows tied to the Q2 margin benefits we just discussed. Now turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract ended Q2 at $46.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $24.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 11% in constant currency. This was ahead of expectations, notably due to the momentum in MuleSoft. As we called out last quarter, CRPO growth did include a one point headwind from professional services. And finally, we continue to deliver on our capital return commitment. In Q2, we returned $1.9 billion in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total return to more than $8 billion, representing more than 48 million shares since the program was initiated just last August. Before turning to guidance, I wanted to briefly touch on the current macro environment. As you heard from Brian, the measured macro environment continues to impact customer decision-making. And we are still seeing elongated sales cycles, additional deal approval layers and deal compression in our subscription and support and professional services businesses. These factors are incorporated in our guidance. Let's start with fiscal year '24. On revenue, we are raising our guidance to 34.7% to 34.8%, representing 11% growth year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency. The increase is driven by strength in our subscription and support revenue, particularly in MuleSoft. We are accelerating our transformation to profitable growth. For fiscal year '24, we are pleased to raise non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 30%, representing a 750 basis point improvement year-over-year. As Marc highlighted, we're in a new AI era, a new innovation cycle that we will continue to invest into as we have over the last decade. As a result, we expect nonlinear quarterly margins in the back half of this year, driven by investment timing, specifically in AI-focused R&D. We also remain focused on stock-based compensation and expected to improve this year to slightly above 8% as a percent of revenue. As a result of these updates, we now expect fiscal year '24 GAAP diluted EPS of $3.50 to $3.52, including estimated charges for the restructuring of $1.11. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be $8.04 to $8.06. We are raising our fiscal year '24 operating cash flow growth guidance to approximately 22% to 23%. This continues to include a 14 to 16 point headwind from restructuring. As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in our cash taxes in fiscal year '24 as we draw down our remaining net operating losses. We expect an even greater cash tax headwind next fiscal year as we draw down our remaining tax credit carryforward. CapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 24% to 25% for the fiscal year. Now to guidance for Q3. On revenue, we expect $8.7 billion to $8.72 billion growth of approximately 11% or 10% in constant currency. CRPO growth for Q3 is expected to be slightly above 11% year-over-year in nominal and slightly above 10% in constant currency. We continue to expect professional services headwinds of approximately one point to CRPO growth. As a reminder, Q3 is the first full quarter we lapped the measured buying environment that we first began to see in July of last year. While we expect bookings growth to begin to normalize, CRPO will continue to be materially impacted by the cumulative effect of the previous five quarters of measured sales performance. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.02 to $1.03. And non-GAAP EPS of $2.05 to $2.06. And as we focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, we continue to expect to fully offset our stock-based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year '24. In closing, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support. As we laid out for you two quarters ago, we have radically accelerated our transformation to profitable growth. We've maintained our disciplined approach to cost management while continuing to make strategic investments, notably in our new data and AI capabilities. And finally, I hope you're able to attend Dreamforce whether in person or virtually, to hear the latest on the incredible AI innovation our team is delivering. As Marc said, it's going to be the AI event of the year. Now, Mike, let's open up the call for questions. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Amy. Emma we'll go to move to Q&A portion of our call now. Out of respect for others on the call, we ask everyone to ask only one question. Emma, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. The team has done a spectacular job doing a soft landing, not to use an overused term with respect to the economy. It's cost controls, operating discipline, et cetera. So really congratulations on that. And I hope that Dreamforce continues to stay in San Francisco, Marc. A question for you is we got all this tremendous new product excitement. We've got generative AI capabilities. The spending environment seems to be sort of stabilizing the economy does have a soft landing. Do you think Salesforce has maximized its customer wallet share or do you think there's more share to gain and therefore, there are better days ahead, because we've seen the margin story play out very, very impressively. Is there -- is -- can Salesforce get back to the days of growth, not hyper growth, but is there enough room in the market, enough customer wallet share and seemingly there's enough product excitement with generative AI. So if you net it all out, can we still do a nice job with margins while still having a shot at growing even faster when economic conditions are no longer a constraint. Thank you so much and congratulations. Marc Benioff : Kash, thanks so much, and we're looking forward to seeing you at Dreamforce. We're really excited, and I think you're going to be super excited when you see these new AI products. And when we talk about growth, I think it's going to start with AI. I think that AI is about to really ignite a buying revolution. I think we've already started to see that with our customers and even some of these new companies like OpenAI. And we certainly see that in our customers' base as well. I think you also know we've definitely seen in the last several quarters a measured buying environment, that's also been true, not just at Salesforce, but I think for the vast majority of our peers that you follow. And I think that you've also called that out a number of times. And I certainly expect that to abate, especially as customers begin to adopt these new AI technologies and understand they need to invest and grow to be able to achieve this kind of next level of productivity. Now all that said, we've also seen this amazing growth in a number of our core technologies and our products, and I would especially like to call out the incredible success of MuleSoft over the last several quarters because that is a product that is far exceeded our expectations, especially and including several of our geographies as well. So this is not something that is quite permeated everywhere, but there are some isolated areas. And I really think that Dreamforce is going to become a catalyst for our customers to see this opportunity to grow with us to see these new products, these new technologies. Data Cloud is just one example of many new areas that Salesforce investments can happen with customers. And I'm sure that as they start to reignite their IT buying budgets in this kind of post-pandemic hangover that's kind of occurred. I think as we kind of get to this next level, we're going to see it driven by artificial intelligence. Brian, what's your perspective? Brian Millham : Yes, Kash, thanks for the question. I think we've outlined in previous calls a growth strategy, it's three-pronged, one around expanding our multi-cloud customers and with new technology like AI and Data Cloud, there's a huge opportunity for us to go back to our customers and expand the number of clouds that they're using a big growth opportunity to drive more value for our customers and certainly more success for us as well. International acceleration continues a big opportunity for us, and we think there's plenty of room to run in the international markets. We're going to continue to focus our efforts there and make investments as we see appropriate. Obviously, we'd love to see the economy turn a bit. And then finally, on industries. You heard me say eight of our industry clouds grew greater than 50% in the quarter. It's remarkable the impact we're having with our industry products. So deeper investments in industries as well will continue to propel the growth of this business. Marc Benioff : And I think I would be remiss if I didn't call on an Ariel Kelman who's sitting here at the table with us to talk about Dreamforce and also talk about a number of the incredible new technologies that are turning to -- Ariel, can you give us a little bit of an insight to what we're going to see in some of these catalysts remains the next level of growth for Salesforce that are going to occur. Ariel Kelman : Yeah, we're very excited about next week's Dreamforce conference. Hopefully, all of you can join us. As Marc said, it's going to be the biggest AI event of the year. We have a tremendous lineup of speakers, both some of the most technical companies and the technical speakers of those companies and people to help the broader business community understand what they can do with AI all across our Customer 360 range of products. We're going to have sessions for salespeople, for marketing people, for customer service people, to really teach them and inspire them on how they can use AI to really advance their capabilities with the technology we've built directly in our product in the flow of work. So they can take advantage of it immediately. Marc Benioff : Ariel, you've been back now for what has been, a couple of months now, one month? How long has it been? Ariel Kelman : It has been since the beginning of June, it's about three months. Marc Benioff : Three months. So tell us what's been your biggest surprise being back at Salesforce? Ariel Kelman : My biggest surprise is that the energy of all the people here is, in some ways, just as inspiring and energizing as it was when I was here 12 years ago that this passion about the mission we're on and the high standards for the technology that we build is really has been very, very refreshing from having been in some other companies. Marc Benioff : Well, we were sorry to lose you to Amazon and then to Oracle, but we're happy to have you back here. So welcome back. Kash Rangan : Thank you. Marc Benioff : Okay, Michael. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Kash. Emma we'll take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : I just want to thank you guys for taking the question and I echo Kash's, congratulations on a solid quarter, particularly on the margin side of the equation, where you guys really outperformed expectations. And my question is around kind of margins on a go-forward basis. You achieved your targets well ahead of plan, 3/4 ahead of the plan, as you guys stated. But there's also a big opportunity ahead. And Marc, you talked a lot about this transformational opportunity ahead with generative AI. So how should we be thinking about the balance between investing for that generative AI opportunity versus further kind of margin gains on a go-forward basis into the back half of this year and potentially into next year as you guys balance these two opportunities and goals. Marc Benioff : Well, I really would like to just directly address that, which is what you're really speaking to is this incredible opportunity ahead, and generative AI is really that opportunity, but also many other opportunities, including data. I really think that there are some unbelievable opportunities ahead. It's going to be incredible to see what we're going to be able to do. And I think that the question is, exactly as you said it, how much are we going to really unleash -- the fundamental growth of the company against commitments that we have made to our investors to continue to deliver profitable growth. I think that at the very fundamental level, starting with our Investor Day last Dreamforce, we told you that we are committed to profitable growth. And now you can see that we were serious. It wasn't a joke. We did a number of things. We curtailed things. We made changes structurally to the company, short-term and long-term issues. And we're still doing things, by the way, to do that. At the same time, we see this incredible opportunity that's out in the industry, new companies that are emerging as well as, of course, all kinds of unusual public company dislocation. So we're watching all of those things. But number one is going to be our commitment to you. Nothing is more important than the trust that we have with our investors. Number two is, we are very thirsty to make sure that Salesforce is the number one AI CRM, and we have done a lot organically to do that in the last six months. Of course, there's things out there that we could do to help us with inorganic as well. We're looking at those things. We're looking at everything, but nothing is going to ever trump the trust that we have with all of you. Amy Weaver : Keith, I would just add, when we did the restructuring, it was never just for the bottom line. We also made changes so that we were -- we have the resources to invest in the areas that we believe are going to drive the highest growth for the company. And we've been very disciplined in our approach to spending this quarter, but we want to lean into these opportunities, especially around AI, around data and around their core. And as a result, you will see that our increase in guidance to 30% does imply slightly nonlinear progression this year. And in terms of the future, as we look forward, underscore everything Marc said about our commitments. And as I said last time, I really believe 30% annually is a floor, not a ceiling. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Keith. Emma, we'll take the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yeah, thanks very much. I guess, Amy, I've had a lot of questions just on the impact of the pricing actions that you all announced earlier this -- over the summer. How that -- if that had any impact on the quarter? And then how are you thinking about that in terms of the guidance for the back half of this year? Thanks. Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks for the question. So on guidance for this year, I have taken into account the pricing uplift as well as any changes from our new or opportunities around AI. I will say that neither has a significant influence on our guidance for this year. I think that those opportunities really take a while to roll through our customer base, particularly on pricing as we look to renewal. Brian, anything else you would like to add? Brian Millham : Exactly. We're going to see the impact of our price increase really hit the customer base over the next one to two to three years. So no big material change in this fiscal year. Appreciate the question, Kirk. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Kirk. Emma, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is open. Karl Keirstead : Thanks. Maybe to Marc and/or Amy, with head count down 11% now, and as you talked about, Marc, welcoming back from our employees, do you feel like you've right-sized the head count now at the 70,000 level? Has it sort of bottomed? And if you feel like there's an opportunity for it to stabilize or start growing again, is that a signal, Marc, that you feel like your growth rate here at 11% this year is at or near a bottom? Thanks so much. Marc Benioff : Well, I think it's such a great question. It's something the management team is talking about every single day because we are continuing to grow and invest in our headcount, especially in AI. Also, I think I mentioned we are doing so much incredible innovation work on our core, and we've commanded our engineering teams to accelerate their work in moving all of our acquisitions into our core, especially our marketing products and commerce products and Data Cloud, all of which we plan to show you at Dreamforce and to accelerate that work, and that's extremely important to us. And also Brian has a number of products and geographies that are growing and we've also committed him to invest in his growth. So we are continuing to grow our headcount, but we are also facing normalized attrition, of course, with headcount, that's also part of it. And so as those -- both of those things get rebalanced, you'll continue to see our head count adjust and move forward. I don't know if we can call this as a bottom exactly yet or if it's -- but we're not planning any other major restructuring efforts in the company today, like what we saw earlier this year, we hope that, that is one and done and behind us. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Karl. Emma, we'll take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Wonderful. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask another question here on AI. The opportunities here are just so exciting across the stack. With Sales GPT, you've highlighted content automation, call summary, sales assistance, Service GPT, auto replies, summaries and scheduling. Just when you look across the Salesforce stack, where do you see the most opportunity here across sales, service, marketing, commerce in the core based on the activity that you're seeing today from customers with the early release of the product? Marc Benioff : Well, thank you so much for that. And let me just say, we're at the beginning of quite a ballgame here and we're really looking at the evolution of artificial intelligence in a broad way, and you're really going to see it take place over four major zones. And the first major zone is what's played out in the last decade, which has been predictive. That's been amazing. That's why Salesforce will deliver about a trillion transactions on Einstein this week. It's incredible. These are mostly predictive transactions, but we're moving rapidly into the second zone that we all know is generative AI and these GPT products, which we've now released to our customers. We're very excited about the speed of our engineering organization and technology organization, our product organization and their ability to deliver customer value with generative AI. We have tremendous AI expertise led by an incredible AI research team. And this idea that we're kind of now in a generative zone means that's zone number two. But as you're going to see at Dreamforce, zone number three is opening up with autonomous and with agent-based systems as well. This will be another level of growth and another level of innovation that we haven't really seen unfold yet from a lot of companies, and that's an area that we are excited to do a lot of innovation and growth and to help our customers in all those areas. And then we're eventually going to move into AGI and that will be the fourth area. And I think as we move through these four zones, CRM will become more important to our customers than ever before. Because you're going to be able to get more automation, more intelligence, more productivity, more capabilities, more augmentation of your employees, as I mentioned. And you're right, we're going to see a wide variety of capability is exactly like you said, whether it's the call summaries and account overviews and deal insights and inside summaries and in-product assistance or mobile work briefings. I mean, when I look at things like service, when we see the amount of case deflection we can do and productivity enhancements with our service teams not just in replies and answers, but also in summaries and summarization. We've seen how that works with generative and how important that is in knowledge generation and auto-responding conversations and then we're going to have the ability for our customers to -- with our product. We have an open system. We're not we're not dictating that they have to use any one of these AI systems. We have an ecosystem. Of course, we have our own models and our own technology that we have given to our customers, but we're also investing in all of these companies, and we plan to be able to offer them as opportunities for those customers as well, and they'll be able to deliver all kinds of things. And you'll see that whether it's going to end up being contract digitization and cost generation or survey generators or all kinds of campaign assistance. And the most recently in our world tour in London, we showed how our Data Cloud did automatic marketing segmentation that was incredible. And you're going to see a lot more that's going to happen in all of these things. A lot of it, you can see happening in Slack. Slack has become incredible for these AI companies, every AI company that we've met with is a Slack company. All of them make their agents available for Slack first. We saw that, for example, with Anthropic, where Cloud really appeared first and Cloud 2, first in Slack. And Anthropic, as a company uses Slack internally and they have a -- they take their technology and develop news digest every day and newsletters and they do incredible things with Slack -- Slack is just a treasure trove of information for artificial intelligence, and you'll see us deliver all kinds of new capabilities in Slack along these lines. And we're working, as I've mentioned, get Slack to wake up and become more aware and also for Slack to be able to do all of the things that I just mentioned. One of the most exciting things I think you're going to see at Dreamforce is Slack very much as a vision for the front end of all of our core products. We're going to show you an incredible new capability that we call Slack Sales Elevate, which is promoting our core Sales Cloud system running right inside Slack. That's going to be amazing, and we're going to also see how we're going to release and deliver all of our core services in sales force through Slack. This is very important for our company to deliver Slack very much as a tremendous easy-to-use interface on the core Salesforce, but also all these AI systems. So all of that is that next generation of artificial intelligence capability, and I'm really excited to show all of that to you at Dreamforce as well as Data Cloud as well. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Brad. Emma, we'll take the next question now please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills -- Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks very much and congrats in particular to Amy and the whole team on overachieving on profitability. My question, Marc, is for you. I wanted to drill down at the Data Cloud because the things we keep hearing from partners suggest that the interest level just keeps building and building, can you talk about the pipeline and scope of these projects and how this generative AI moment is impacting the opportunity? And why Salesforce is well positioned as the partner of choice, especially in the context of trust? Marc Benioff : Well, especially as we said on the call as well, which is that we've said this is about AI, this is about data, this is about CRM and this is about trust. Those 4 things have to come together as one thing. And that's what we call Salesforce. That's a modern version of Salesforce. It's AI plus Data plus CRM plus Trust. And I think that is really a moment that we have to like really get clear and show that to customers. We've tried to really book the last six months. Obviously, we're going through a huge transformation with all of you. But you can see we've also gone through an incredible technology transformation around artificial intelligence to the point where we got these products out was awesome and let our customers really get into it and see what they can and cannot do and what they're excited about and how they want to move these products forward and what we think is going to be the future of AI. And it's these 4 things together that are going to fundamentally help us. And I think Data Cloud, you're 100% right, is going to be the heart of it. Well, certainly, it's a huge revenue opportunity for us because as you heard from Brian, customers who have Sales Cloud and they've got Service Cloud and they've got Marketing Cloud, and they're using our platform. Maybe they have Commerce Cloud as well, and now they're adding Data Cloud. And as these clouds get stacked with these customers', attrition falls, customers become more successful, they develop a single source of truth. And our job is to get all of these things running on our core and getting all of these things ignited with artificial intelligence. So I was very excited to recruit back as my Chief of Staff and as my Chief Business Officer, Kendall Collins. So Kemble, can you just give us a little insight on the vision of Dreamforce and what we're going to see for Data Cloud and some of these amazing clouds and why everyone should get excited about what's about to happen over the next couple of weeks when everyone gets here into San Francisco on September 12? Kendall Collins : Yes, Marc, it's great to be back. It's been about four months and just amazing to see the energy of Salesforce, a company with the right values and I think the right people and really at the right time to generative. What you said about AI is so compelling because it's not just about one cloud. It's about making every cloud better. We're seeing that Sales GPT, Marketing GPT, Commerce GPT went live last week. And Dreamforce is going to be exciting. Marc Benioff : Well, I'm really excited as well. And I'll tell you, you're sitting next to Sabastian Niles, our new Chief Legal Officer, just joined us from Wachtell. Sabastian, we're happy to have you here live for the first earnings call and welcome to Salesforce. And I know this is going to be your first Dreamforce and give us a vision of what you're excited about for the future. Sabastian Niles : I'd say whether it's Dreamforce or sort of looking ahead, what I've been most excited about is how our values, trust, customer success, innovation, equality, sustainability are truly infused within our culture. And that these values, they're powering our customer journeys, they're powering our commitment to our investors, they're powering our commitment to all stakeholders. I think certainly, as we look ahead, whether it's in the next several months, the next several years, the next 10 years and beyond, it's these values that are going to underlie how AI evolves. And how at least for sophisticated enterprises, and I think for all enterprises and even individual human beings, they will choose to partner with the companies and organizations who are putting trust first and are deploying and incorporating trust throughout the technology life cycle, whether that's design of technology, deployment of technology, development, service and monitoring, and I could not be more excited by what I see ahead. Marc Benioff : Well I couldn't be more excited to have you on our new management team and kind of the evolution of our team here at Salesforce. And thank you for all the help that you've given us also in the last six months, especially with all of our investors. Michael? Mike Spencer : Okay. Thanks, Brad. Emma we'll take our last question now please. Operator : Your question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Marc, 12% CRPO growth the last two quarters. With AI building into the model, do you believe long-term you can reaccelerate this to a 15% to 20% growth business? Marc Benioff : Well, I'll tell you that's certainly on my mind every single day. And you're right, I'm a growth CEO. So that's what I like to do. I like to grow. I mean that's been about growing margins for the last six months, so that's a reframe for me. But we've grown this business to these incredible revenue numbers this year, third largest software company in the world. And as we kind of head into these incredible next levels of capability, I'm very excited about the future. And there's lots and lots of ways to move the top line forward. But I'll tell you, now I am quite addicted to the bottom line as well. And also, as I said earlier, there's nothing more important than the trust that I have with all of our stakeholders, including our investors. So I want to make sure that we fulfill our commitments and promises to all of you, just as we have in the last three earnings calls, we've delivered exactly as we've told you we are going to do, and we're going to continue to do that. At the same time, you know that I am thinking about how are we going to move this ball forward and down the field with these incredible opportunities in front of us. So it's very much has to be a balanced equation to make this right, to make it right for us and to make it right for you, and I'd love to have that conversation in more depth in the next couple of weeks. As we all come to Dreamforce, I hope you'll seek me out and find me and let's have that conversation one-on-one, just as we have been having in the last six months. I want to do what I've been doing for the last couple of quarters, which is to express my sincere gratitude to all of you and our investors have been a critical part you've had key insights, many of which we did not have ourselves on things that we could do to make us an even stronger company. And we've done that, I'm sure you can see that in the numbers. There's never been a software company quite like this at this level even now as we start to cross into these incredible numbers in the mid-$30 billion numbers, the strength of the company has never been higher, and now we have this incredible opportunity with AI ahead. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Brent, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone hopefully at Dreamforce in a few weeks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Michael Spencer : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today on fiscal 2024 third quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings materials and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which could change.

Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. And with that, let me hand the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : All right. Hey, Mike. Thanks so much, and thanks for all your hard work this year. It's been an incredible year. And also, I just really appreciate everyone being here on the call today. And hope you all had a great Thanksgiving, and I hope you're all preparing a fantastic holiday for yourself coming up. I know it's been an incredible year for so many of the folks on this call, and I'd just encourage all of my folks to try to take a couple of days off and do a little digital detox. And I hope you get a chance to do that as well as we come into the season. We're obviously super excited about these results. We've delivered in this unbelievable quarter and in this unbelievable year. And this double-digit revenue growth, delivering non-GAAP margin exceeding 30%, this is really exciting for us. And when we look at these numbers, when we think about having an $8.7 billion quarter, 31.2% margin in the quarter, and then talking about this year at 34.8% fiscal year '24, amazing with 30.5% margin growth, whether it's 800%, 900%, 1,000% increase from year-over-year, these numbers all exceed what we thought we were able to do. And I'll tell you, okay, we really did this in partnership with all of you. I'm just going to come back to that a couple of times to give you the gratitude and thanks that you deserve for everything you've been doing to help us have an unbelievably great year. But I'll tell you, it's more than just a great year. It's also a huge year of transformation. I think everyone on the call knows that. It's exactly a year ago, as you remember, or maybe I'd like to forget, exactly how crazy that year got, and it was a really unusual year. But we knew we had to change. We knew there had to be transformation. We knew there were things that had to get done. And we look that we were going to have to restructure our business for the short and long term. We talked about that in each of the last several calls. We knew we had to focus on increasing profitability, productivity, operational excellence across the board. We knew that. We knew that we had to really double down on our core, deliver some strong relationships with you, our investors. And then I'll just keep coming back to that, that you've been just such great partners in making all of this happen. And I'll tell you that we have to stay focused on continuing to be this number one AI CRM, which we've been doing. You're going to hear about that today and really finding these incredible growth factors for the company. You know what, people have been asking me why am I so excited about this quarter? And Brian is going to hit on this as well, and Amy is going to hit on this as well. The three things that keep coming back to me are, number one, that we have 80% growth in deals more than $1 million. That is far exceeding our expectations, that we were able to pull together all of these different clouds into this kind of what we call a cocktail. The customers were wanting to buy Tableau, Slack, MuleSoft, the Data Cloud, Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, all that we're able to build these big transactions. And there's no question that, that kind of fell off last year, now to see that come back. That is just really exciting. Brian's going to talk about that. Number two, we have a great new product. And everyone knows here at Dreamforce, Data Cloud. You can see in the quarter 1,000 new Data Cloud customers. That is number two thing. I am really excited about that. I literally just got off the plane from Tokyo. You probably all saw me yesterday at Salesforce World Tour. Tokyo was incredible. Everyone is very excited about Salesforce in Japan, now the second largest software company in Japan. Incredible what has happened over there in the market. I met with hundreds of customers while I was there. I spoke to some of the CEOs of the largest companies in Japan. It was an incredible week. It was the Momiji season, which is the fall season with incredible fall leaves, beautiful over there. And I'll tell you, everyone wants to talk about Data Cloud. And that is really exciting to have an incredible driver for future growth. And the third thing is, these Einstein GPT Copilots that we've delivered. These Einstein GPT Copilots, this is a product we didn't really even have an imagination around a year ago. Of course, we had Einstein. Of course, we could see the incredible growth of Einstein. I mean now, Einstein with predictive and generative combined, is doing 1 trillion transactions a week, that's amazing. But more amazing is that 17% of the Fortune 100 are now Einstein GPT Copilot customers. And this is a product that is just coming to market. Everyone is so excited about buying this product. So when you see these larger deals, when you see Data Cloud, when you see these Einstein GPT Copilots going into place, that is why we are excited about our growth and why we're excited about this quarter. And then you look at the financial metrics. The $1.5 billion in cash flow, up about 1,000%. That is another reason why we're excited about the quarter. So let me get into the script a little bit, and let me talk to kind of give you the structured messages and then turn this over to Brian. So number one, we are the number one AI CRM. If that isn't clear already, we're leading the industry through the unprecedented AI innovation cycle. It's unlike anything I've seen and most of the people that I talk to all over the world feel the same way. We're the only platform that are bringing CRM and data and AI and trust together for our customers in a way that enables them across every industry to be more successful, faster, be more productive, more efficient. We're the number one by market share for the tenth year in a row based on latest IDC software tracker. We're the number one enterprise apps company now. That's amazing. And Data Cloud, this hyperscale, this real-time customer data platform that is performing incredibly well for us, it's the foundation of every AI transaction, but it's the foundation of every large deal that we did this quarter. That is what is so exciting. And in just our third quarter, Data Cloud has ingested an astonishing 6.4 trillion records, 6.4 trillion records. That's 140% year-over-year increase. It triggered 1.4 trillion activations, a 220% increase year-over-year. This is a monster product. I could not be more excited. And it's the perfect time, we didn't really understand that it was going to line up so well with this generative AI revolution. It's a product we've been working on for a couple of years. Just the timing of it has been incredible because listen, if you don't have your data together, in a company, you're not going to deliver AI. It's not like companies are going to run their AI off of Reddit or off of some kind of big public data set. They have to have their data set together to make AI work for them, and that is why the Data Cloud is so powerful for them. Now as I've said before, this AI revolution is going to be a trust revolution. It's not just about CRM, data or AI. It's also about trust. And I think the trust layer and the way that we've architected our platform so that our customers are not basically taking -- getting taken advantage of these next-generation large language models, these foundation models, they are so hungry for all of this data, and they want our customers' data so that they can grow. We're not going to let them have it. We're going to separate ourselves from those models through a trust layer so customers can be protected. This is going to be so important for the future of how Salesforce architects itself with artificial intelligence. Now revenue in the quarter was $8.7 billion. Not too many software executives get to say it so I think I'll say it twice, actually. Revenue for the quarter was $8.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year, incredible. Third largest enterprise software company now by revenue, also incredible. And companies standardizing on Salesforce as their core technology platform, doing these multi-cloud deals with us. Getting that growth, as I said, that incredible stat that Brian is going to come back to, the 80% growth in deals of more than $1 million, so exciting. Nine of the top 10 deals included six or more clouds. Think about that. Nine out of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds. So that we have amazing clouds, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Platform, our Commerce Cloud, Slack, Tableau, MuleSoft, but think about it, how they're bringing all of those things together, Data Cloud, they're bringing it all together into a cocktail. That's amazing. And by the way, those cocktails are going to be a Christmas cocktail soon. And in Q3, we once again showed our commitment to increasing our margins. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 31.2%, up 850 basis points year-over-year, following an increase of 1,000 basis points in the previous two quarters. It kind of is a sentence that you don't really expect ever read as a CEO, so that was kind of amazing. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $1.5 billion, up 389% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 1,088% year-over-year. Percentages and absolute numbers are just mind blowing. And our remaining performance obligation ended the third quarter at $48.3 billion, which is an increase of, yes, 21% year-over-year. Pretty good. Okay. Now let's move on to guidance. Based on our performance, we're raising our fiscal year '24 revenue guidance in constant currency to 34.8% at the high end of the range, 11% projected growth year-over-year. Last quarter was raised our fiscal year '24 non-GAAP operating margin of 30% and now we're accelerating again. And we think that we're going to move this thing to 30.5% for the year. And Amy, I think you better beat that, okay? So I mean, the acceleration on the margin this year has been pretty incredible as we all know. So if you go back and look at the last five quarters, you wouldn't believe it. I don't believe it. We delivered an improvement of 850 basis points year-over-year this quarter. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team, how well they are doing. We just got our employee surveys back. The team, the morale is super high, so cohesive, brought back so many boomerangs, really reinforced our culture during this year as well. That's been one of the major things that we have been doing. We've really been focused on building this number one AI CRM, rebuilding our product strategy. Really focused on, number two, is getting these sales executives be able to tell these stories of AI success. And it's incredible to be able to exactly explain to a customer what they can do to be successful. Through the third thing we're really focused on is this idea of delivering new products and new technologies, and this UE+ product that we've now introduced in the market to see so many customers adopt that in the quarter, to see so much of it in our pipeline, UE+ and the incredible work of David Schmaier and his team has been just amazing there. And also our professional services team, delivering these great implementations and making sure our customers are successful. And the fifth thing I would say we're focused on is this Ohana 2.0 culture, which is really takes shape in the middle of this year and really now evidence in this -- you probably saw we just became a Great Place to Work again. We're on the top 10. We're now number seven. And it's amazing to see that recognition for this company is so well deserved. So where are we? Well, you're seeing this high level of interest in Data Cloud and Einstein. It's incredible what's happened. I've been on the road pretty much nonstop especially over the last month. I've been in -- throughout Europe. I've been now in Asia. I've been throughout the United States. And I just continue to see these same trends, which is customers are investing for the future and they're investing and inspired by AI to give them more productivity. Look, they realize unemployment is just so low. Where are they going to hire more people? It's so hard for them to hire, they're going to have to get more productivity from their employees. They're going to do that through this great new technology, and we're going to help them make that happen. Data Cloud was part of six of our top 10 deals in the quarter. We had more than 1,000 net new customers for Data Cloud. I've talked a little bit about the number of deals, the number of wins over $1 million in Data Cloud doubled, and the average ARR per win more than tripled compared to last quarter, pretty awesome. And we've now traded a self-service switch so that every EE and UE customer can just flip it on. And engineering has just done a great job getting every customer become a Data Cloud customer. Closed a lot of amazing deals in the quarter. Really excited about AWS. I know everyone has been talking about that, especially down at the conference this week at ReInvent and we couldn't be more thrilled for our partnership with Andy Jassy, really excited. Really excited about our relationship with American Cancer Society. They've been a customer for a long time. Doing incredible work now seeing them use the Data Cloud, even becoming even more productive, more efficient. Group Global, 30 million users now using Data Cloud, SiriusXM. Joe Inzerillo, great executive. We worked so closely with him at Disney. And one of the reasons that Disney has become wall-to-wall Salesforce. And nowadays at SiriusXM, he's deployed a great, incredible deployment of Data Cloud, but our -- actually our whole product line or so. Excited to work with Joe. And this is really, I think, going to continue on as we start to talk more about customers who are using Data Cloud. I was just in Houston and had a great dinner down there with all of our customers. We had some phenomenal local country music performance at the dinner as well. The Ortega family did a great job cooking for us. Their restaurants are probably our favorite when we get on the road. But I'll tell you, Waste Management and Jim Fish, who I saw when I was in Houston, great executive, love working with Jim. Here is a great company, North America's leading environmental sustaining solutions provider. Now most of the folks on the call are probably customers. And wow, they just have done an incredible implementation and now doing a great job implementing all the AI solutions as well. Well, there's a lot more to talk about there. We've got so much going on and March 8 is going to be a big day for Salesforce. We're going to turn 25 years old. It's hard to believe. At the same time, we've completely rebuilt the company and so well positioned for the AI revolution. And we're lucky to have a great management team, and we've got them sitting here at the table. Of course, we've got Mike Spencer here who is doing a great job running FP&A and IR. We have Sabastian, our new Chief Legal Officer; Amy, our new CFO. But Brian, why don't you take it from here and tell us what happened during the quarter? Brian Millham : Yeah, I really appreciate it, Marc. Thank you so much. I'm very pleased with the quarter, and it's really a testament to our laser focus on operational excellence, high performance and profitable growth initiatives. We're seeing the results of our full-scale transformation of our company. In Q3, our non-GAAP operating margin is up an amazing 850 basis points year-over-year. And we reduced GAAP sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue by 6 full points. And we've matured our pricing and packaging to drive growth and simplify the buying experience. As Marc said, we're well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth as we head into the largest quarter, our largest quarter and into next fiscal year. Despite the continued measured buying environment, we grew revenues in Q3, driven primarily by the strength of our product portfolio and multi-cloud transformational deals. In fact, the average size of our deals greater than $1 million, as Marc said, was up 80% year-over-year, doubling our net new business in this segment. And for the third consecutive quarter, we saw add-on products like sales performance management, digital service and sales productivity grow ARR nearly 40%. As customers look for quick time-to-value solutions and productivity gains, we saw traction with our new Salesforce Starter offering with nearly 1,000 new logos added this quarter. As the number one AI CRM, companies in every industry and geography like Fujitsu, Southwest Airlines, NZ Bank are turning to us as their trusted adviser to help them transform their business for the AI future. We're seeing amazing energy across our ecosystem with our partners, GSIs and ISVs who are looking to do -- build more opportunities with us around our AI offerings. And we've established new partnerships with global management consulting companies like Bain & McKinsey. And as Marc mentioned, we're expanding our existing relationship with AWS. It marks a significant milestone in the evolution of our global partnership with Amazon, deepening the integrations between AWS and Salesforce products. We're bringing together the number one AI CRM and a leading public cloud provider to deliver an open integrated data and AI platform to make it easy to find, buy and manage Salesforce products to the AWS Marketplace. Before I get into the product momentum, I want to share some operational highlights. We continue to effectively manage our expenses, as you've seen, and is reflected in our improved non-GAAP operating margin, which exceeded 31%. Today, our execution, inspection and understanding of our customers buying and approval process is better than ever. Our focus on high performance is a driver of growth is paying huge dividends in Q3. We saw more than a 30% increase in AE productivity year-over-year. We're also refining and scaling our big deal motion and further bundling products to drive higher sales and simplify the buying experience for our customers. And we're doing all this while becoming more effective and efficient. I've been impressed with how quickly we deployed our own trusted generative AI tools and applications internally. We've launched Sales, GPT and Slack Sales, Elevate internally, and our global support team is live with Service GPT, and we're seeing incredible results. We've streamlined our quoting process with automation, eliminating over 200,000 manual approvals so far this year. And since the introduction in September, our AI-driven chatbot has autonomously resolved thousands of employee-related queries without the need for human involvement. We're seeing great success with our products and so our customers, which is clearly reflected in the high-level engagement and participation we're seeing in our events. In addition to Dreamforce, we hosted 80% of our top customers for the quarter. We also held an amazing 450 customer events in our offices with nearly $2 billion in pipeline. And as we close out the year, we have a New York City world tour coming up in December 14. I hope you all can join us in person. And if you can't, we hope you join us on Salesforce+. We continue to hire selectively across key growth areas, especially in data cloud and AI, and we've seen the highest demand to join Salesforce in our history with the largest volume of applications in any quarter ever. Our growth initiatives across our core products, data, AI, industries and international drove our strong performance in the quarter. And as Marc outlined, we're seeing strong momentum in Data Cloud and Einstein. Importantly, we're already seeing high demand for our new premium UE+ bundle as customers recognize the value of our integrated solutions with Einstein AI functionality and Data Cloud built in. And our existing customers increased their spend with us by more than 70% when they upgraded to UE+. Industry clouds continue to be a tailwind to our growth, chosen by customers like Humana and U.S. Agency for internal development and RBC Wealth Management U.S. For the first time this quarter, nine of 13 Industry Clouds grew ARR above 50%. We're seeing continued MuleSoft growth, which was in eight of our top 10 deals this quarter and delivered an amazing 140 billion automated flows, up 142% year-over-year. And Tableau, which is fully integrated to the Data Cloud, continues to help customers like Rubrik, Canara Bank and U.S. Navy see and understand their data and make data-driven decisions. In the quarter, we did continue to see the macro trends affect our business, in particular, our professional services business, our create and close sales motion and our Slack self-service business. Despite those headwinds, Slack was included in seven of our top 10 deals. Every day this quarter, there were 700 million Slack messages sent and 2.75 million workflows ran on the Slack platform. We recently announced Denise Dresser as the new CEO of Slack, and I've had the chance to work with Denise for a dozen years and could not be more thrilled for her, and importantly, for the Slack business. Before I hand it off to Amy, I want to share some key number and highlights on how we deliver for our customers during Cyber Week. Commerce Cloud powered nearly 50 million orders on digital storefronts across Cyber Week with 100% uptime. Einstein powered more than 49 billion product recommendations, and over 53 billion marketing messages were sent via the Marketing Cloud. In addition, Service Cloud helped our customers field and resolve 3.7 billion cases. This clearly demonstrates the scale and reliability of our number one AI CRM platform. So in closing, we're heading into Q4 with a ton of energy and ambition, guiding our customers through a new innovation cycle with an unwavering commitment to their success. I, like Marc, am extremely proud of the team with the changes that we've made not just in Q3 but over the last year. And as I said earlier, we're well positioned for Q4 and as we head into fiscal year '25. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Amy. Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks, Brian. Q3 represents another strong quarter of strong execution and discipline. As you heard from both Marc and Brian, we've transformed the company over the past 12 months to drive consistent, profitable growth. And we are pioneering the next wave of innovation with data, AI, CRM and trust. Now let's get right to the results. For the third quarter, revenue was $8.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 10% in constant currency. This represents a $40 million beat in constant currency. The growth was primarily driven by continued MuleSoft momentum and resilient sales and service performance. From a geographic perspective, the Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA grew 14% or 10% in constant currency, and APAC grew 18% or 21% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth in India, Brazil and Japan, while parts of EMEA were more constrained. From an industry perspective, public sector performed very well while high tech and general continues to be more measured. And as Brian mentioned, our multi-cloud momentum continues. In Q3, nine of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds. Q3 revenue attrition remained strong and ended the quarter again at approximately 8%. In Q3, our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.2%, up 850 basis points year-over-year. Our strong margin outperformance was driven by our continued disciplined investment strategy. Q3 operating cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 389% year-over-year. Q3 free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 1,088% year-over-year. This upside in cash flow was driven primarily by strong collections as well as lower cash outflow that results to higher margins just discussed. Now turning to remaining performance obligations, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q3 at $48.3 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency. This was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by strong early renewal performance as well as a large customer win in the quarter. This was partially offset by a 1 point headwind from professional services that we had cautioned about last quarter. Finally, we continue to deliver on our capital return commitment. In Q3, we returned another $1.9 billion in the form of share repurchases. And to date, we have exceeded our initial authorization of $10 billion in just over five quarters. Before moving to guidance, I want to reiterate that we continue to assume a consistent measured customer buying environment. Let's start with full year fiscal year '24. On revenue, we are narrowing our guidance range to $34.75 billion to $34.8 billion, representing 11% growth year-over-year in nominal. We are now expecting a $50 million FX headwind, which implies a modest raise in constant currency. On margins, we have made incredible progress on profitability and productivity this year. For fiscal year '24, we are very pleased to raise non-GAAP operating margin guidance again to 30.5%, representing an 800 basis point improvement year-over-year. We also remain focused on stock-based compensation, which is now expected to be approximately 8% as a percent of revenue. As a result of these updates, we now expect fiscal year '24 GAAP diluted EPS of $3.99 to $4, including estimated charges for the restructuring of $0.91. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be $8.18 to $8.19. We are raising our fiscal year '24 operating cash flow growth guidance to approximately 30% to 33%, and this continues to include a 14- to 16-point headwind from restructuring. The upside in our cash flow guidance is driven by strong collections to date and our continued expense discipline. CapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 33% to 36% for the fiscal year. And as we focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, we continue to expect to fully offset our stock-based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year '24. In fact, as a result of our ongoing share repurchases, for the first time in company history, we expect the full year's ending share count to decrease year-over-year. Now to guidance for Q4. On revenue, we expect $9.18 billion to $9.23 billion, growth of 10% in both nominal and constant currency. CRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be 10% year-over-year in nominal and 11% in constant currency. Similar to this past quarter, we expect professional services headwinds of 1 point to CRPO growth. For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.27 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.26. As we look forward to our largest quarter of the year, we remain focused on strong execution and our disciplined investment strategy. In closing, I want to echo both Marc and Brian. This was a great quarter, but even more than that, this has been an extraordinary year of transformation. I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and I particularly want to thank our employees for their incredible work throughout the past year. Now Mike, let's open up the call for questions. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Amy. Operator, we'll move to questions now. Out of courtesy for others on the call, we ask that each person participating only ask one question. And with that, operator, we'll take the first question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much and congrats on a nice quarter in a tough market environment. This -- I don't know if Marc or Brian wants to take this one, but MuleSoft growth against a pretty tough comp really does stand out a little bit in this quarter. And I was just wondering, if you could talk about if we should view that as a harbinger of more interest in the broader Data Cloud offering? And whether the interest in MuleSoft is also sort of a harbinger of just more interest in AI as people try to get their data estates in order to get ready for this coming AI wave? Thanks. Marc Benioff : I'm going to have Brian really give you the detail, but what I'll tell you is, you're seeing something that we have been seeing and calling out for the last few quarters, but we probably have not been able to illuminate it to the level that you see now in the numbers, which is that every customer and every customer transformation and every customer AI transformation is going to begin and end with data. And for us to achieve that goal, those customers are going to have to get to another level of excellence with their data. And at the heart and soul of that for many of these customers is becoming MuleSoft. So in addition to Einstein, in addition to Data Cloud, in addition to our Copilot technology that we called out, it's been a lot about MuleSoft this year. And we think that, that trend is going to continue and it's very exciting, and that we're very well positioned with this completely unique product that is helping our customers bring all their data together for their AI transformations. Brian? Brian Millham : Kirk, thanks for the question. I think you nailed it. It's exactly what's happening out there. The data is becoming such an important asset for our customers that they want to bring it all together and they want to leverage our MuleSoft technology to do it. And so, it's really an exciting opportunity. As we stated, it was eight of our 10 top deals in the quarter. And you can see the amount of data flowing through MuleSoft as an indicator for how important the data is 142% up year-over-year on automated flows on the platform. I'd be remiss if I also didn't call out the leader there and Eric Eyken-Sluyters, who's done an incredible job in leading the sales organization as well. And so, I think you nailed it in your question. This is a really important critical product for us and for our customers as we think about scaling to the future. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Kirk. Operator, we will take next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo, your line might be unmute. Raimo Lenschow : Sorry. Never learn that. Congrats from me as well. The -- Brian, you talked about the sales productivity, and that was a big theme this year and the 30% increase is very impressive. Where are we on that journey in terms of like, first of all, how did you achieve that? Because that's a very big number in the software industry, but like where are we on that journey in terms of going forward? Thank you. Brian Millham : Thanks for the question and obviously, a big focus for us. We've talked about it on previous calls with all of you. It's a never ending journey, obviously, and we want to continue to drive productivity for our account executives. We talked about a very large deal in the quarter that helped drive that productivity. But all-in, we saw a very nice increase in our productivity, really focused on a couple of things. One, we leaned in enablement for all of our sellers out there to ensure that they really understand this broad portfolio of products and are able to go out and talk to our customers about it. Deeply understanding our buying process. This was some of an area early in maybe last year where we stumbled a bit, not understanding the buying process of our customers, deep inspection of our business, both pipelines and cycles that we're in and driving. Really being oriented to value as we talk to our customers about the solutions that we can provide to them. What is the ROI our customers going to see from the investments they're making in Salesforce, ensuring that we really understand that before we put proposals in front of them. And finally, I think there's -- I couldn't be prouder of the inspection that we're getting across the board. We have a new sales leader in Miguel Milano, who's brought a new discipline to the way that we're looking at the pipelines, not only in the existing quarters but in future quarters going forward. And so the discipline that we\u2019ve driven across the board is driving these great results from a productivity perspective at the front. Thank you for the question. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Raimo. Operator, we will take next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to ask about the 17% of the Fortune 500 that are the Einstein GPT Copilot customers. Really impressive figure. Really early in a technology cycle, because a lot of what we're hearing is a lot of exploration out there, a lot of people trying to figure out what to do with these tools, not a lot of buying. So can you give us a little bit of color on kind of what's driving that adoption and what's enabled you guys to get such good adoption so quickly? And maybe if I could sneak one in for Amy as well. Great margin expansion this year, but there's a lot of stuff you guys need to be investing against with this technology cycle. Should we expect to see further margin expansion as we head into FY '25? Thank you, guys. Amy Weaver : Great. Do you want me to take this first? Marc Benioff : Yes. Amy Weaver : Okay, Keith. Always looking for that margin expansion, always looking for a little bit more guidance, but really happy to address this. We've had fantastic margin expansion this year, I mean, up 800 basis points for the end of the year. If I look back over the last three years, we have gone from 17.7% three years ago to we'll be ending this year over 30% on operating margin, which I am just thrilled about. I think that we do have some room here. As I've said before, we view this as a floor, not a ceiling on our success, and we intend to continue our focus on operating margin. In terms of investments, it's all a matter of priorities. We cut deeply earlier this year, and we've really been using that to invest into the areas of the business that we see as most strategic going forward. And we've been very disciplined, especially around headcount as we've been doing that. Right now, I really see areas of investment in AI and Data Cloud. In distribution, we're looking at those success stories like MuleSoft and doubling down. But we're also being very careful on how we do that. We are questioning levels. We are questioning locations. We're making sure that we're maximizing really high-scale, lower-cost locations as well. So I feel like we've got the room to do this, and we have the opportunities to invest into our future as well as to manage our margin very efficiently. Brian Millham : Yeah. I'll just add a little bit there, too, Amy. I think we have really a team focused on the margin expansion. We want to continue to simplify our go-to-market strategies, how we optimize our pricing and packaging going forward as well. We talked about some of the things that we're doing there. New channels to market. We're really excited about the AWS Marketplace as a new channel to market for us. Amy mentioned location strategies, how do we continue to look at our real estate portfolio as an opportunity, how do we leverage our own technology, sales force on Salesforce and using our own products to drive more efficiency and automation in our business. So lots of opportunity to continue to do this. I\u2019m excited about the culture and structural change in the way that we\u2019re thinking about margin expansion of the company, and I think you\u2019ll continue to see that. So thank you, Keith. And then on the Fortune 500 that are using it, you\u2019re right, it is early days. And as we said in the script, a lot of our customers are starting to trial and use this technology to see the benefits around productivity and cost takeout, leveraging the technology. But as we\u2019ve also said, the data is an important aspect of this. And how do they clean up and harmonize their data first before they start to roll out these AI technologies broadly? How do you trust the output that you\u2019re getting from your AI investments? And so what we found in conversations with our customers is an energy around and excitement around AI, but in a need to clean up the data first before they can really take advantage of this. And we\u2019ll continue to see the expansion. The 17% is great. We want to continue to go faster there, and we\u2019re going to work with our customers to go drive those outcomes. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Keith. Operator, we will take next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Thank you and congrats on an amazing performance. Marc, part of the story of 2023 has been optimizations weighing on hyperscaler spend and then greater scrutiny on seat-based SaaS licenses. We are now starting to hear from hyperscalers that the optimizations are attenuating. Do you sense that a shift in mentality spilling over a little into the thought process, for example, for Sales Cloud seats or perhaps some excitement sparked by Sales GPT and freeing up some budget there on gen AI that maybe wasn't there six months ago? Marc Benioff : I think your number one thing that you're going to see is customers trying to achieve more productivity. This AI revolution is a productivity revolution, and it means that every customer is just a lot more augmented. When I was in Tokyo, obviously, the yen is very depressed. And of course, we see that in our financial results as well. They'd be so much higher if the yen was higher. But I had an opportunity to walk into a couple of our customers' retail stores, and one of them that I was extremely impressed with was Louis Vuitton. And when I walked into Louis Vuitton, they know exactly who I am. They have -- even in Tokyo, and I test this wherever I go in the world, lots of different customers, I had an incredible experience. They use this amazing app that they've built with our platform called ICON. They've done an incredible job. They have my full customer data and buying history. The sales executives are guided on how to work with me and what kind of products I'm interested in and what I want to buy. And it's a productivity revolution for them. They are able to get a lot more success with our technology. And I walked into another store which is not one of our customers, and I have to follow up still with the CEO because, wow, the customer experience was just Oracle. It was the exact opposite. They didn't know anything about me. They couldn't work with me at all. It took probably the salesperson 3 or 4 or 5 times as long to complete the transaction because they did not have the automation. The product revolution had not come to this company. So when I look at the companies that have had that great success, obviously, the entire Louis Vuitton group, obviously, the entire Kering Group, when I look at so many of the organizations that I had the opportunity to kind of touch, it's amazing. I guess I was also very inspired in Japan talking to Goto-san as the CEO of Seibu. He has an incredible hotel chain called Prince Hotels. And they're building a whole next-generation loyalty system based on Salesforce. They've had great success in using our product for marketing their hotels and having much higher levels of customer touch, both in B2B and B2C. But now they can take it to another level with the Data Cloud and provide a high-level loyalty management point system, something that's so important for their future growth. I had another opportunity to talk to Amazon is the Head of Technology at Toyota. His point was very simple, that we've fully automated all of the Toyota dealers in Japan. It's been an incredible success story. We have done that with Toyota Media Services as our partner, a company that we have an incredible relationship with. But now with Toyota, we have the ability to take our vision to a whole another level, making this connected car experience really go one step higher, connecting all the Toyota cars directly to our Data Cloud and the Data Cloud then having the ability to proactively deliver the customer information and interactivity as it hits different thresholds. These are the opportunities that I see going forward. It's about productivity. It's about automation. It's about doing it on a global basis for these companies. And ultimately, for them, it's about taking advantage of incredible new artificial intelligence technology that before was not possible. Amy Weaver : Marc, if I could weigh on there as well. I think Marc stated it well. Companies are still really focused right now in this environment, on productivity, on automation, on time to value. You certainly see it from the CFO as my counterparts around the world. Real focus on every dollar that's being spent. We're now entering our sixth quarter of measured customer buying behavior and we're saying that this has been continuing recently. And that does reflect, particularly in areas like SMB, self-serve, create and close, you see this in professional services. But I'm also really excited about what we're seeing in terms of how we can step in and really help our customers get to their goals. Brian, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add. A \u2013 Brian Millham : No, that\u2019s great, Amy. Exactly what I was going to say, a lot of demand at the top of the funnel for us for new technologies like Data Cloud and like AI, but also seeing some headwinds, no doubt, from our more transactional business, as you stated. So Mark, thank you for the question. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we will take next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Marc, really nice improvement in deals over $1 million, up 80% year-over-year. You've all alluded to this larger contract you landed. I'm just curious, do you feel like this is a new environment? Do you feel this is Miguel and the team having better gel in the field. What do you -- any more color there, if you could talk to you on the bigger deal front would be helpful. Marc Benioff : There's a lot of debate on the management team and putting together this call on how we're going to answer that question. We don't want to, in any way, give you indications that we see this environment going behind us. That said, we see a lot of green shoots. There's just a lot of opportunities. Customers are excited about -- and I think Japan, I would say, is very much a metaphor for me. When I was there about a year ago, for them, it was still the pandemic. Everyone, when I had lunch with my employees, they had to wear masks a year ago. So this was the first time when I felt like, kind of back to normal and the pandemic hangover is kind of ingested by the customers. I think that we're cautious about saying, oh, it's all green shoots, everything is going, we're back to normal. But at the same level, we are honest with you that we have a lot of green shoots and in products, in geographies. And you can see in this growth rate in large deals. So we're excited. I don't think we're willing to say to you on the call, hey, we've turned the corner. We want to but we're not sure because for a lot of customers, they still are measured in their buying environments. You know that. You talk to these customers. You talk to the channel partners. They're somewhat measured in their buying environments. But I would say people are a lot less measured than they were is one way to put it. There's definitely a reduction in the measured environment. And on a global basis, and like I said, in some of these customers in the last 30 days, I was in -- I can give you my direct experience. I was in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Stuttgart, Germany, I was in Nice, Monaco. I visited with our customers throughout that area. And also, I went up to Amsterdam, to France. I had a large customer dinner in the U.K. in London. I went to the U.K. Safety Summit. I then came back and went to Japan. I think I see something very consistently, which is customers are extremely excited about AI everywhere we go. It could be government, it could be commercial organizations. It could be technologists. Everyone is excited about AI. At the same time, there is a lot of confusion about what AI can and cannot do. And I think that's a huge opportunity for us to tell stories to our customers of what the success opportunities are in the enterprise with AI and also what the reality is for a lot of these customers. When I mentioned I was in Vegas. When I showed up in Vegas at the Wynn Hotel, the customers are -- they have our product in their hands, welcoming me. The whole team comes out because they're so excited because they used Salesforce, it's very flattering. When I got to Disneyland in Anaheim, which is something I have done 4 times this year, and obviously, they've become also one of our very largest customers in the world. Every Disney guy and they use Disney guys, which is a product. I highly recommend it to all the Disneylands, Disney Tokyo on Monday and in Disney Anaheim. Been talking to the Disney guys and they use Salesforce and Slack to make those tours happen. They use Salesforce call center now for Disney+. On the Disney store is Commerce Cloud. It's an incredible success story, but it's a huge opportunity for them to take another level of Disney where I certainly can see how all that information can get translated into AI. And that when I walk in the park, I'm expecting the Mandalorian to come up to me and say, \"Hey, what did you think of the episode last night? It hasn't happened yet. I think we're all kind of on the cusp of delivering that full customer 360 for Disney.\" I think Bob Iger has been doing an incredible job in his vision for the future of the company with AI Assist extraordinary. And I can kind of go customer by customer, story by story. And this excitement, this energy, these ideas of innovation of AI were not in place a year ago. Because don't forget, a year ago, I don't think any of us have used ChatGPT or Bard or Anthropic or Cohere or Adapt or any of the new AI companies. None of us had really had our hands on or envisioned what it really meant to us or that we would have Copilots, and that those Copilots would give us the ability to do all kinds of next-generation capabilities. But a year later, it's a technology revolution. And we just want to make sure it's a trust revolution. We want to make sure it's about an AI and CRM and data revolution. I think we hit it right with the Data Cloud. We have -- we still have a lot of work, as everyone does in our industry, on AI and making it safe for our customers. This is going to be incredibly important. I think for a lot of customers, they realize that they'd like to just let this AI unleashed autonomously but it still hallucinates a huge amount and it also is quite toxic. So we're not quite ready for that revolution. But every day, it's getting a little better. And when I -- going through the streets of Tokyo, it's not quite the minority report, which is a movie that was partly written by our futurist, Peter Schwartz, but it's getting closer to that idea. And when I walked into some of these stores, there's definitely a lot more automation based on my customer record but not quite the level of automation that Tom Cruise felt when he walked into that Gap store, if you remember that scene, which was so amazing, which is very much front of mind for a lot of our customers because they want to have that capability and they want us to deliver that for them. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Brent. Operator, we will take next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead. Karl Keirstead : Okay. Great. Maybe I'll direct this to Amy and Brian. Salesforce obviously made a fairly significant pricing change early in the fourth quarter. And maybe, Brian, I'd love to get some color on the receptivity. And Amy in particular, is there a way you might frame the extent to which the price change may have impacted the guidance for 11% constant currency in the fourth quarter? And also, was that perhaps one of the drivers for the early renewals that you saw in 3Q as some customers maybe wanted to get in front of it? Thanks so much. Brian Millham : Hey, Karl. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Price increases landed as well as the price increase can, I guess, with our customers out there. I think when we're delivering value to our customers and they're seeing benefits from our technology, we feel good about our ability to go execute against this. It's still early, honestly. We just introduced this a few months ago. And so we have seen certainly some benefits from it. But we'll see these benefits roll in over the next, really, three years as these contracts come up for renewal. And so yes, there's been receptivity to it but the big impact will be seen over the next three years. We're not going to see it in the near term, honestly, in our numbers. Amy, any comments? Amy Weaver : Thanks, Brian. Karl, Brian pretty much summed it up. As we mentioned last quarter, we do not anticipate a material impact from pricing in the guide this year. That said, I have been very pleased by the execution and the discipline that we're showing around rolling this out. And an uplift really needs to roll for the full renewal installed base, which is going to take some time. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Karl. Operator, we will take next question, please. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Brad Sills : Wonderful. Thank so much. Great to see all the success here with Data Cloud. I'm not surprised we're hearing that in the channel. My question is really around the organization, the team that's responsible for executing on this and how they plug into the different product groups. Data scientists in this day and age are a rare commodity and you clearly are attracting that. So would love to get a sense for that organization, how it's evolved and how well integrated they are across the different product groups. Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, I think that, that is very much a primary focus of the company, which is that when we started this Data Cloud, we thought we were just building a CDP. And a CDP looked like an exciting market opportunity. We're number one in enterprise marketing automation. That seems like a great opportunity. But the more we started working on this product, we realized, oh, every one of our clouds needs this Data Cloud. And so Sales Cloud needs a Data Cloud, Service Cloud needs a Data Cloud. Yes, Marketing Cloud needs a Data Cloud, called that CDP. And Slack needs a Data Cloud. Tableau also needs a Data Cloud. If you've seen any of my recent demonstrations and with these great Tableau customers in Japan, they all need Data Cloud on the back end of Tableau. And this idea that the Data Cloud will become the heart and soul of the product, be the engine of all of Salesforce's apps and say you can use our models, our AI models or you can bring your own models into the Data Cloud, which is a very cool feature. This idea that it also has this incredible level of capability. But the amount of data that it's already managing and the amount of data that it's already ingested, that is what is shocking to us. And I think that you're going to see as we get deeper and deeper into this so you can really see the level of data that we're handling, the trillions and trillions of transactions. This is going to be the key to the AI working for enterprises. Enterprises are going to want to deploy AI for productivity. I think I've made that case already on the call, but they're going to get frustrated when the Copilot that they are given from other companies don't have any data. They just have data grounded to maybe the application that's sitting in front of them, but it doesn't have a normalized data framework on -- integrated into the Copilot. So while I think Copilots on productivity applications are exciting because you can tap into these kind of broad consumer databases that we've been using. So as an example, the Copilot is I'm writing an e-mail. So now my -- I'm saying to the copilot, hey, now can you rewrite this email for me or some -- make this 50% shorter or put it into the words of William Shakespeare. That's all possible and sometimes it's a cool party trick. It's a whole different situation when we say, I want to write an e-mail to this customer about their contract renewal. And I want to write this e-mail, really references the huge value that they receive from our product and their log-in rates. And I also want to emphasize how the success of all the agreements that we have signed with them have impacted them, and that we're able to provide this rich data to the Copilot and through the prompt and the prompt engineering that is able to deliver tremendous value back to the customer. And this date, this customer value will only be provided by companies who have the data. And we are just very fortunate to be a company with a lot of data. And we're getting a lot more data than we've ever had. And a lot of that is coming from the Data Cloud because it's amplifying the capabilities of all the other data we have. So it's a very interesting moment for Salesforce. I think the demonstrations at Dreamforce were outstanding. The demonstrations that we'll deliver in our February release will be mind-boggling for our customers of what they will be able to get done. And I think that by the time we get to Dreamforce '25 or '24 in September '24, what we'll see is nothing that we could have possibly imagined just 24 months earlier before these breakthroughs in generative AI have really taken hold through the whole industry. No one company has a hold on this. I think it's pretty clear at this point that because of the way AI is built through open source, that these models are very much commodity models, and these responses are very much commodity responses. So we've always felt that way about AI for more than a decade. We said that its growth has really been amplified by open source development. Because these open source models now are as strong as commercial models are or proprietary models, I think that what we really can see is that, that is going to accelerate this through every customer. There's not going to be any kind of restrictions because of the proprietariness or the cost structures of these models. We're going to see this go much faster than any other technology. The reference point, as I've been using as I travel around, is really mobile operating systems. Mobile operating systems are very important, and we all have one on our desk or in our pocket right now. But really, the development of mobile operating systems has been quite constrained because they're really held mostly by two companies and two sets of engineering teams. That's not how this technology is being built. This technology is highly federated across thousands of companies and thousands of engineering teams who are sharing this technology. And because of that, you're ending up with a rate of innovation unlike anything we've seen in the history of our industry and is moving us into areas very quickly that could become uncomfortable. So this is an exciting moment. Michael Spencer : Great. Thanks, Brad. With that, we'll conclude the call. We appreciate everyone joining the call and wish everyone a happy holiday season. Thank you. Brian Millham : Happy holidays, everyone. Thanks, everybody. Amy Weaver : Bye, everyone. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Thanks so much, Mike. And hey, thanks everyone for being on the call. Look, as you can see from these numbers, we've had just an incredible quarter, well, actually we've just had an incredible year here at Salesforce with strong performance across all of our key metrics, revenue, margin, EPS, cash flow and of course our CRPO. Look, it's been an extraordinary year of transformation for Salesforce, you'll know that you've all been there with us. You've been the support that we have needed during this year. Thank you to all of our shareholders, and thank you to all of our stakeholders. It\u2019s been a year of incredible transformation for our industry with the emergence of this next generation of artificial intelligence as well. It's been really two unbelievable things happening at once. The total transformation of Salesforce and the total transformation of our industry. All right. Let's start with the transformation of Salesforce, okay? Look it was over a year ago, we said, Salesforce had to transform and you, many of you came to me, came to our whole team and you said, look, we're going to transform the whole company. We did it together. We could not have done it without you. We said we will restructure our business for the short and long term, we did that. We said we would place a laser focus on increasing productivity and operational excellence from across the board, we've done that. We said we were going to double down on innovation to make our core products even better, we've done that. And when you see what's coming in Trailhead DX next week, you're not going to believe it. Not just our next generation artificial intelligence, not just -- that was not just our prompt builder, not just our copilot, but this data cloud which I'm going to get to in a second are fastest, most exciting new product ever, fastest growing, most customer traction that I have ever seen. That has been incredible. So let's talk about all of this and let's talk also about how we have also strengthened our relationships with our investors. Thank you, Mike, for everything you've done. And Amy, together with the management team, with our Board, we've really focused on you, the investor community. We've accomplished all of that together. We've completely transformed this company together and we're very grateful to each and every one of you. And that transformation, well, it has driven incredible results. You're seeing productivity is up, profitability is up, margins up, revenues up and you're going to see it again in our results for our quarter. You're going to be looking at these full year numbers with phenomenal cash flow, with incredible margin growth, well, margin growth that I've never seen in any software company over the last 12 months -- 18 months. It's completely unprecedented. And you can see the incredible speed and success of the transformation that we've undertaken. Now we believe that Salesforce not only needs to be a great software company for our customers, our employees, our communities, but also a great company for our shareholders as well. We've certainly seen that with the exceptional performance of our equity over the last few months. Now I'm thrilled that we're opening the door to another incredible part of our ongoing transformation today with the introduction of our first ever dividend. And that's amazing to say that word for the first time in 25 years in Salesforce history, our first ever dividend, which you're going to hear more about from Amy in a moment. And if this year has shown anything, if it's shown anything at all, it really shows that we've committed to serving all of our stakeholders. We closed out fiscal year '24 with $9.29 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter. That's up 11% year-over-year, 10% in constant currency. Pretty awesome at our size and scale, incredible. Eight of our top 10 deals in the quarter included six or more of our clouds, really showing the depth and breadth of our product line and our portfolio. And all of our top 10 wins included sales, service and platform, and we're really focused on delivering that full cocktail of all of our clouds to all of our customers. And our deals greater than $10 million, well, they grew nearly 80% year-over-year in fiscal year '24. That was also amazing. Our customers just get so much more value and they can do so much more when they take the full advantage of our Einstein 1 platform. And I want to explain that to you because we have such a rich set of applications that when we're working with all of these employees through the whole company, and also the customers as well, we're filling our platform with the data and the metadata that our customers need to be successful. And there is no other time in the history of our industry that that rich data and metadata together in one place is so important, because that is what you're going to need to drive this artificial intelligence. And you're going to see that next week at Trailhead DX as we show you our copilot for our first time and prompt builder for the first time, and data cloud for the first time, and how it works together so that you can get the insights that you need. Now, this is all possible because we're delivering this Einstein 1 platform. But before I get to that, I just want to make this one last point. For the full year, we delivered $34.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, one of the best performances of any enterprise software companies ever. With our continued disciplined approach to margin expansion, non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal '24 was also 30.5%, up 800 basis points year-over-year. We closed fiscal year '24 with operating cash flow reaching $10.2 billion, operating cash flow up 44% year-over-year. Major goal for the company this year, well risked, well done, highest cash flow in our company's history. CRPO, our current remaining performance obligation was $27.6 billion, up 12% and 13% in constant currency year-over-year, fantastic display on CRPO. And total remaining performance obligation ended the fourth quarter at $56.9 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Now let me just say this again, $57 billion in RPO amazing. For fiscal year '25, we expect free cash flow to grow between 23% to 26% for fiscal year '25, that is for fiscal year '25 we expect free cash flow to grow between 23% to 26%. And we're guiding revenue to $38 billion at the high end of our range 9% year-over-year, expecting to deliver fiscal year '25 in subscription and support revenue growth of above 10% year-over-year. In constant currency, we're going to get to that detail in a second. We're committed to delivering non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5%. All told, an unbelievable year, a transformation. From the financial metrics, we're going to get to the technology now. And before I move on, let me just say I've never seen anything like it over the last 25 years as CEO of Salesforce. The pace of change, the focus on productivity, profitability, the speed of innovation, the quality of the management team, people coming back to help us get it done, our boomerangs, our Ohana, thank you to everyone who's made this possible. Just look at where we are now. Salesforce is the world's number one AI CRM. Number one in sales, number one in service, number one in marketing, number one in data cloud. Incredible. And since the start of the pandemic in 2020, we've doubled the size of the company. That's amazing. We doubled the size of the company in scale since the pandemic started, which was about four years ago. That's incredible at our scale. We're the largest enterprise applications company in the world. We passed SAP. That was amazing. That was a huge accomplishment this year. But now we're the third largest enterprise software company in the world and the second largest in Japan. And to all of my Japan, Ohana, [indiscernible] for what you have done with the Japanese market is incredible. We're not stopping. Our management team and our extraordinary employees are focused every day to make our business as strong as it can be. Personally, I've never been more excited about the future of Salesforce. You're about to hear why. It's not just the incredible financial results, not just the unrivaled success of our customers, but it is the incredible door that has opened through artificial intelligence once again and the evolution of our entire technology platform. It's what our engineering and product teams have done in the last 12 months is nothing short of amazing. I am so grateful to their leadership and to David and Srini and to all of your employees. Thank you for what you have done for Salesforce. Your leadership, your vision, your insights, your creativity in rebuilding the platform so quickly, and data cloud for artificial intelligence, for Steve, what you have done for Jujhar, for my whole team, it's incredible. As I said, it's not only a remarkable year of transformation for Salesforce, it's been an amazing year of transformation for entire industry. As I talk to CEOs around the world, they tell me they want three things. You may have heard me say this already, but I'll say it again. One, they want more productivity and they're going to get that productivity through the fundamental augmentation of their employees through artificial intelligence. It's happening and it's empirical. Number two is they want higher value customer relationships, which is also going to happen through this AI and they want higher margins, which we are seeing empirically as well when they use this artificial intelligence and these next generation products. As we look at productivity, as we look at higher value customer relationships, as we look at higher margins, how do our customers get these things? How are they achieving these goals? It is AI. It is why every CEO and company knows they need to make major investments in AI right now. And I believe this is the single most important moment in the history of the technology industry. It's giving companies an unprecedented level of intelligence that will allow them to connect with their customers in a whole new way. And with our Einstein 1 platform, we're helping out our customers transform for the AI future. Now, many of our customers have been inspired by OpenAI's GPT-4 I have, and cohere I have, and anthropic I have, and inflection I have. And also all the amazing models on hugging face and other AI models. All these things, amazing. And everyone has been wowed by what these AIs can do incredible things and a lot of party tricks, a lot of magical things. And then we also realize there's some other things too. Let's talk about the truth. The truth is that these AI models are all trained on amalgamated public data. You all understand that. You've all seen the New York Times lawsuit of OpenAI or others who are really going to tasks saying, this is all this amalgamated stolen public data, but all these publication (ph) used without permission and unlicensed, but amalgamated into these single consolidated data stores. Now, some of my people even say this is just stolen data, but all this public data has been amalgamated into what they call training sets. And these training sets then get turned into what we call inference, which is how the AI then is able to start to deliver its insights, but there's other things that it's providing besides insights. These AI models, well, they could be considered very confident liars, producing misinformation, hallucinations. Hallucinations are not a feature, okay? And I'm going to get to that point in a second, and I think you all understand it that already because at this point, we all have a high level of experience with AI, don't we? Everyone has had that experience. And there's a danger though, for companies, for enterprises, for our customers, that these are not trusted solutions. And let me point out why that is, especially for companies who are in regulated markets, why this is a big, big deal. These models don't know anything about the company's customer relationships, and in some cases are just making it up. Enterprises need to have the same capabilities that are captivating consumers those amazing things, but they need to have it with trust and they need to have it with security, and it's not easy. Look, we all read the story. Now, it just happened last week. An airline chat-bot. An airline chat Bot prompts by a passenger to book a flight with a 90 day refund window. It turns out the chat bot running on one of these big models, we won't have to use any brand names here. We all know who it was hallucinated the option, it did not exist. We all know what that's like. We've all had the experience. So here's the chat-bot, it hallucinates the option, it's working with the customers, it didn't exist. It did not exist. The airline said, oh, listen, that was just the chat-bot, it gets that way sometime. We're so sorry. You know what? That's just a separate technical entity, a separate legal entity, and the airline, we're not going to be hold liability for that. Well, guess what? That defense did not work in a court of law. The court of law said that that AI chatbot, that made up that incredible new policy for that company, well, that company was going to be held responsible, liable for that policy, that they were going to be held liable for the work of that chatbot, just as they would for a human employee. They were being held liable for a digital employee. The reality for every enterprise is that to deliver trusted AI experiences, you need these three essential components now. You need that compelling user interface. There's no question a natural and effortless experience. And at Salesforce, we have some of the most intuitive user interfaces that deliver insights and intelligence across sales and service and marketing and commerce and industries, many of you are on Slack right now, many of you are on Tableau, many of you are on Mulesoft or one of our other products. Okay. And what else do you need? Number two, you need a world-class AI model. And now we know there's many, many models available. Just go to Hugging Face, which is a company that we're investor in, or look at all the other models. And by the way, not only are there thousands of models right now, but there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of models coming. And all the models that are available today will be obsolete 12 months from now. So we have to have an open, extensible and trusted framework inside Salesforce to be receptacles for these models. That's why Einstein 1 is so important. Then you have to be able to use these AI models, the ones that Salesforce is developing or these public models on Hugging Face or other things or even bring your own model. Customers are even making their own models. Fantastic. Of course, we have great partnerships with OpenAI, with Anthropic, with Cohere, with many other AI models. This is the second key component. One is the UI, the second is the model. All right. Now for those of you who put like for example, Copilot on our phone, any one of the Copilots on the App Store, we have a compelling UI and we know underneath there, there is a compelling model. But third, we also know there's a huge data set there. But here we go. Now we're in the enterprise. In the enterprise, you need deep integration of data and metadata for the AI to understand and deliver the critical insights and intelligence that customers need across their business, across sales, service, marketing, commerce, whatever it is, that deep integration of the data and metadata, that's not so easy. That's not just some amalgamated stolen public data set in the enterprise, that deep integration of data and metadata, oh, that's what Salesforce does. We are a deep integration of data and metadata. That is why it's very, very exciting. Yeah, I like to say, and I love NVIDIA, by the way. And what Jensen has done is amazing. And they are delivering very much in the era of the gold rush, the Levis jeans to the gold miners. But we all know where the gold is, the data. The gold is the data. And that's why we're so excited about Salesforce because we are one of the very largest repositories of enterprise data and metadata in the world for our customers. And customers are just starting to realize this right now and they try to stitch together a variety of AI tools and Copilots, and this and that, and whatever. I've had so many funny conversations with so many customers who come to me that they're experts in AI and they're this, and then I just say to them, but how are you going to deliver this experience? And then finally realize, oh, I need the deep integration with the data and the metadata. The reason why the metadata is so important is because it describes the data. That's why so many companies are turning to Salesforce for their AI transformation. Only Salesforce offers these critical layers of AI for our customers. The UI, the model and the deep integration of the data and the metadata and make the AI smart and intelligent and insightful and without the hallucinations and without all these -- all the other problems. For more than two decades, we've been trusted with our customers' data and metadata and we have a lot of it and a lot of you are our customers, so you'll understand what I'm saying. But many of our customers also have islands and thousands of systems of trap data. Now what I'm going to say is very simple. Trap data is all over the enterprise. Now what trap data can be is you might be using a great company like Snowflake, and I love Snowflake or Databricks or Microsoft or you might be using Amazon system or even something like Google. What these things -- BigQuery, all these various databases. But put your hand up if you're using Snowflake every day. Put your hand up if you're using one of these other systems. Put your hand up if you're using Salesforce sales cloud, service cloud, Tableau, Slack. We need to be able to, through our zero copy, automatically integrate into our Data Cloud, all of those systems and then seamlessly provide that data back into these amazing tools. And that is what we are doing because so many of our customers have islands of trapped data in all of these systems. But this AI is not going to work because it needs to have this seamless amalgamated data experience of data and metadata. And that's why our Data Cloud is like a rocket ship. The entire AI revolution is built on this foundation of data and it's why we're so excited about this incredible Data cloud. It's now deeply integrated into all of our apps, into our entire platform. It's self-service for all of our customers to turn on. It is our fastest-growing product ever. It's our total focus for fiscal year '25 with Salesforce Data Cloud. Salesforce can unlock this trap data and bring together all of their business and customer data into one place for AI all while keeping their data safe and secure and it's all running inside our Einstein Trust Layer and we've deployed it to all of our customers. We unleashed now the Copilot as well to all of our customers deeply built on our pilot, on our data and metadata. And while other copilots just sit and spin because they can't figure out what the data means and if you haven't seen the demonstrations, you just see these Copilots spin. But when they use Salesforce, it all of a sudden becomes intelligent. And that is the core of the Einstein 1 platform. It's all of our apps, all of our AI capabilities, all of the customer data in one deeply integrated trusted metadata platform. And that's why we're seeing incredible demand for Data Cloud. Data Cloud brings it all together and we are so blessed to have Data Cloud in our company. And it's also why in Q4 25% of our deals already over $1 million have included Data Cloud. And we've recently added over 1,000 new customers to Data Cloud. We've never seen traction like this of a new product because you can just easily turn on the Data Cloud and it adds huge value to Sales Cloud, it adds huge value to Service Cloud, to Marketing Cloud, to the CDP. You've all seen the Gartner Magic quadrant that got published last week about the Data Cloud. Or if you haven't go to my Twitter feed and you'll see how amazing that MQ is. And it's the fastest-growing organic product in the history of Salesforce. This last quarter, more than 7 trillion records, 7 trillion records were ingested into Data Cloud, unbelievable. 7 trillion records ingested in Data Cloud with over 1 trillion activations driving customer engagement, lighting up all of those sales service marketing cloud users, all the platform, Tableau, it's all integrated into Data Cloud. And because Data Cloud and all of Einstein 1 is built on our metadata framework, as I just described, every customer app can securely access and understand the data and use any model, use any UI workflow, integrate with the platform. That means less complexity, more flexibility, faster innovation. But also we want to say goodbye to these hallucinations. We want to say goodbye to all of these crazy experiences that you're having with these bots that don't know what they're doing because they have no data or metadata, okay? Or the data that they have metadata is like productivity data, or like the highest level data that's not deeply integrated data. So only Salesforce can do this. Only Salesforce has this vision of this kind of platform and only has -- we've been working on this for 25 years and we are not done. We are just starting because let me tell you now a story of how we're delivering a high-quality trusted AI for our customers. We all know the HR and payroll leader ADP and their incredible new CEO, Maria Black, amazing. ADP has been a great Sales Cloud customer for two decades. They've used Einstein for years. They were one of the first customers we ever have. We're so grateful to ADP, amazing. And work with so many of their great CEOs over the decades. And the company wanted to transform now customer service with AI to give their agents real time insights next best actions, auto generated case summaries, well, I have to say to you, it was a little bit embarrassing, Salesforce was not number one on their list. And I said to them, how can that be? We're the number one Service Cloud. We're number one in the MQ, we're number one in this. We're number one merchant. No, we're going to go evaluate this. We're going to look at all the different solutions. We're going to look at all the new AI models. We think we're just going to hook this model up to this and we're going to do that. And it sounded like a big Rube Goldberg invention. What was going to happen there? And so we had to go in and we just wanted to partner with them and say, all right, show us what you want to do. We're going to work with you. We're going to be trusted partners, let's go. But like a lot of our customers moving to AI, ADP realized it didn't have a comprehensive deeply integrated platform of data and metadata that could bring together all of this into a single source of truth. And then you get the incredible customer service, then you get the results that you're looking for. And it's deeply integrated with their sales systems, with marketing and custom applications. And ADP discovered only Salesforce can do this. We were able to show ADP how we could unlock trap data with Data Cloud, zero copy, drive intelligence, productivity, efficiency for their sales team with Einstein to levels unimagined just a year ago. We're now incredibly excited to work with all of our customers to take their AI to the next level with Einstein Copilot, which is going live tomorrow. Einstein Copilot, which if you haven't seen it, and if you haven't, please come to Trailhead DX next week. This is the first conversational AI assistant for the enterprise that's truly trusted. It's amazing. It can answer questions. It can summarize. It can create new content, dynamically automate tasks behalf of the user from this single consistent user experience embedded directly within our platform. But let me tell you the one thing that it can do that's more important than all of that. It is able to read across all the data and metadata in our platform to get that insight instantly. And you're going to see that. So the sales rep might ask the Einstein Copilot what lead I should focus on or what is the most important thing I need to do with this opportunity? And it may say, you need to resolve this customer's -- customer case because this escalation has been around for a week. Or you better go and answer that lead that came in on the marketing cloud before if you want to move this opportunity forward. Because it's reading across the entire data set, that is something that individual users cannot do but the copilot can do with access to customer data and the metadata in Salesforce, including all this real time data and website engagement and the ability to read through the data set. That's why Einstein Copilot has all the context to understand the question and surface believe that has the highest value and likelihood to convert. And it can also instantly generate the action plan with the best steps to close the deal, such as suggesting optimal meeting times on the lead contacts, known preferences, even drafting the email. If you haven't seen the video that I put on my Twitter feed last night, there's a five minute video that goes through all of these incredible things that it's able to do. There's never been an enterprise AI capability quite like it. It's amazing. All of us can understand the tasks that the Copilot is performing. And I bet a lot of people, even on this call, that a lot of other companies might say they can do this. But I assure you, without the deep integration of the data and the metadata across the entire platform, with the Copilot's deep integration of that data, they cannot do it. They cannot do it. I assure you they cannot because they don't have the data and the metadata, which is so critical to making an AI assistant so successful. And I encourage you to try the demos yourself to put our Copilot up against any other copilot. Because I'll tell you that I've seen enterprise Copilots from these other companies in actions and they just spin and spin and spin. And some have a different copilot for every app, some with different capabilities, restrictions grounding this Wizzywig builders on whatever. It's very cute. Very nice. Exciting. It's really cool for the first minute and then you realize, wait a minute, what data is available in this Copilot? Only a conversational UI can start to understand all these things if it has this access. Only after a conversational UI for canned queries or don't understand the customers to customize the Copilot, those are -- none of these things are going to work. I've used those Copilots from the competitors. I have not seen them work yet. Okay, the thinking icon, the spinning, it goes on and on and on and on. Einstein Copilot, you're going to see. You're going to have your hands on it. Now it's been released into the wild to our customers, to all of you, this is fundamentally different kind of AI. Just like Einstein was a different AI, which became the democratization of AI, which is why Einstein does a trillion transactions a week. Einstein's the only Copilot with the ability to truly understand what's going on with your customer relationships. It's one conversational AI assistant deeply connected to trusted customer data and metadata. It's one integrated system for all of our customers across any role or industry. And it's why we call it Einstein 1. It's one platform, one integrated system. That is what you need to get AI to work. Next week, at our Trailhead DX conference in San Francisco, I hope you're all coming, it's going to be amazing. On March 6 and 7, you're going to see how we're bringing even more AI innovation to our customers. So be prepared to be amazed by Einstein Copilot builder, prompt builder, model builder, and so much more that we're doing to help our customers, make every employee more productive and transform every customer experience. And I hope you're going to join us in person or you can join us online at Salesforce Plus. And with closing, I just want to thank all of you once again for everything that you've done for us for the last year. We're so grateful to each and every one of you and to our entire management team, all our Ohana and all of our customers as well. We're so grateful as we look forward now to our 25th anniversary in March 8, I've never been more excited. You can hear why? Not just the fundamental transformation of the company, but also the fundamental transformation of the product line and the product vision as we move into this incredible new, intelligent world that we're all seeing with AI. So thank you. I'm now turning over to Brian, who was employee number 13, our Chief Operating Officer. He's done a phenomenal job this year. Without him and without Amy, without our whole management team, it would not be possible. I just want to thank again everyone who's been a huge part of everything. And I'll turn it over to you. Brian, here we go. Brian Millham : Well, thank you Marc. I really appreciate it. I couldn't be more proud to be part of Salesforce the past 25 years, especially this past year as we took on a pivotal business transformation while delivering incredible innovation for our customers and returns for our shareholders. Our continued focus on operational excellence, high performance and new growth initiatives helped deliver strong results in the fiscal year and remains our focus going forward. At FY \u201824, we've laid the foundation for success through strategic restructuring, streamlining our go-to-market approach, deeper inspection and continued operational excellence. As part of our transformation, we also refined and scaled our big deal motion and introduced new product bundles to give our customers comprehensive solutions on a unified, trusted platform. And we're unlocking customer spend with new channels like AWS Marketplace and driving sea level relevance through strategic collaboration with McKinsey. The adjustments we made are paying off. As Marc mentioned, our deals greater than $10 million in FY \u201824 grew substantially 78% year-over-year and we closed 86,000 multi-cloud deals. Our pricing and packaging strategy is driving higher sales and delivering more value for companies of all sizes in the industries. Since launching in April, we've added 3,000 new logos through self-service with Salesforce starter, a solution for our small businesses that include sales, service and marketing. With AI and Data Cloud built in. We're excited by the momentum we're seeing in UE plus bundle, which is now called Einstein 1 edition. It's providing substantial returns for our customers and for Salesforce. In fact, we continue to see significant average sales price uplift from existing customers who upgrade to Einstein 1 edition. It's also attracting new customers to Salesforce. 15% of the companies that purchased our Einstein 1 edition and FY 24 were net new logos. As you heard from Mark, with our Einstein one platform including Data Cloud and Einstein Copilot, we're rapidly infusing conversational AI across our entire product portfolio. Einstein is a huge differentiator for us as the industry transforms -- excuse me, in this AI revolution. It's the fastest and safest way to unlock an organization's data to create better customer experiences, augment employees with AI, and drive productivity and improve margins and profitability. Every AI strategy starts with data. As Marc said, Data Cloud has strong momentum. Data Cloud is approaching $400 million in ARR, growing at nearly 90% year-over-year. And in Q4, 25% of our deals greater than $1 million, included Data Cloud. Customers like Xerox and London Stock Exchange and Dyken turned to Data Cloud in Q4 to build their trusted data foundations and unlock their trap data within Salesforce. And we're excited about our future, we just were named, as Mark mentioned, the leader in the inaugural February 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for customer data platforms. I met with dozen a CEOs and business leaders over the past few months, and they're all focused on fueling growth and strengthening customer relationships within their current budgets and workforce, and they see AI as the tool to augment their people and drive more productivity. Companies like ADP and Intel, McLaren and Sonos are investing in Einstein 1 to become AI first organizations. In FY24, we closed 1,300 Einstein deals as more customers are leveraging our generative and predictive AI capabilities. Take Schneider and Electric. They wanted to standardize and simplify customer care across their 3000 support agents speaking 15 different languages around the world instead of talking to customers, service agents were spending way too much time searching for answers across different systems and summarizing cases. Dealing with 7 million cases per year leads to time-consuming interactions for their support agents. Now, Einstein will automatically create email replies that agents can use to respond and summarize their cases with the power of Einstein lunch Center electric support teams are already seeing a 15% increase in case efficiencies. And it's not just their service agents, their sales teams are also seeing incredible benefits from our AI capabilities. We're just at the beginning of a new innovation cycle that will spark a massive software buying cycle over the coming years, and Salesforce is leading the way. We continue to see strong demand for our data products as customers lay the foundation for AI. Specifically, Mulesoft is helping companies such as Rosignal and TK Elevator in North America bring together their data from any source, a critical step to prepare for AI. Mulesoft was in eight of our top ten deals in the quarter and executed a record 319 billion workflows, automated workflows every month, up 100% year over-year. Tableau was in 20 of our top 25 deals in the quarter and is fully integrated to Data Cloud. Wins in the quarter include customers like IHG, Heathrow Airport and Brazilian fintech stone. Tableau Pulse, a phenomenal new product that's just been released, generally available last week, actually already has 2,000 customers. Powered by Data Cloud and Einstein, Tableau Pulse automatically delivers personalized AI powered insights in both a natural language and visual format. We're also excited about the innovation coming from Slack, which was included in nearly half of our top 50 deals in the quarter. We just launched Slack AI with features like AI search channel recaps and thread summaries to meet the enormous demand for embedded AI in the flow of work from customers like Australian Post and OpenAI. It's amazing to see what Slack has accomplished in a decade and frankly it's just the beginning. We have a great vision for the future of Slack as a conversational interface for any application. Our specialized industry products continue to fuel our growth, chosen in the quarter by customers like Japan Post Insurance, TPG Telecom and USDA. Collectively, our industry businesses finished the year at $4.8 billion ARR, up more than 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth internationally with wins at Volvo and Genpac, Hitachi and Bochikario. India continues to be a bright spot for us, growing new business at 35% year-over year and we continue to invest in the region to meet the needs of customers including Bajaj finance. I had the great opportunity to meet with their CEO Rajiv Jane in January and a top priority for him was using Einstein to deliver predictive and generative AI across their entire lending business which they run on Salesforce. In Q4, Bajaj became the second largest Data Cloud customer globally, building their AI foundation on the Einstein 1 platform. I want to close by acknowledging that our success is only possible because our phenomenal employees, incredible partners, trailblazers, shareholders and amazing customers who have trusted us for 25 years. As we proved in FY 24, when we focus on something as a company we deliver results. And FY25 that focus is on profitable growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to you Amy Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks, Brian. Let me join Marc and Brian on saying what a year it has been for Salesforce. At this time last year we laid out our accelerated transformation plan and I am incredibly proud of the significant progress we made this year against that plan. Throughout fiscal 2024 we delivered, we've on increasing profitability, revenue, productivity and operational excellence. Q4 represents another quarter of strong execution and continued discipline across the business. Now let's turn to the results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was 9.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 10% in constant currency. The growth was primarily driven by resilient sales and service performance as well as strength in Yolsoft and Tableau. And for the full year revenue was 34.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency. From a geographic perspective, in Q4, the Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA grew 14% or 11% in constant currency, and APAC grew 14% or 19% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth in LatAm, India and Canada, while parts of EMEA remained constrained. From an industry perspective, in Q4, public sector and travel transportation and hospitality both performed well, while retail and consumer goods and high tech were generally more measured. Our multicloud momentum also continued. In Q4, eight of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds, and more than half of our top 100 wins included six or more clouds. As you've already heard, AI starts with data and we are seeing strong momentum in Data Cloud. In Q4, more than half of our top 25 wins included Data Cloud. Q4 revenue attrition ended the quarter at slightly above 8%, generally in line with recent quarters. In Q4, our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.4%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. And for the full year, in line with our guidance, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 30.5%, up 800 basis points year-over-year and GAAP operating margin ended the year at 14.4%, up 1110 basis points year-over-year. Q4 operating cash flow was $3.4 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Q4 free cash flow was $3.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year. And for the full year, operating cash flow was a record $10.2 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Full year free cash flow was $9.5 billion, up 50% year-over-year. Now turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q4 at an incredible $56 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $27.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency, particularly driven by strong execution on early renewals. We also benefited from new business performance and timing of license revenue from Mulesoft and Tableau. As expected, this was partially offset by a 1 point headwind from professional services, which we had noted last quarter. Now let's turn to guidance. Starting with full fiscal year '25. On revenue, we expect $37.7 billion to $38 billion, growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. A few items to note on our revenue guide. Our expectations incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year-over-year or a 30 basis points impact. We also expect our professional services business to remain under pressure in FY25 and expect it will be a headwind to revenue. Within our revenue guidance, subscription and support revenue growth is expected to be slightly above 10% year-over-year in constant currency. Now, as a reminder, our top line expectations include the impact from the measured buying environment that began back in fiscal year '23. This takes time to flow through our subscription revenue stream due to the like effect of bookings to revenue recognition. That said, we continue to execute well in the measured buying environment. Over the past two quarters, I'm happy to say that we've seen improved bookings growth. And as you heard from Marc, we're incredibly well-positioned to build on our success and bring our customers into this new AI era. Now, turning to attrition. Starting in fiscal '25, we are including Slack invoice in the metric. Despite expecting a modest headwind, we expect attrition to remain consistent at slightly above 8%. On margins, we continue to drive operational excellence, productivity and efficiency. And for fiscal year '25, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5% representing a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year, while still making key investments in growth opportunities, notably AI, data and our core businesses. Stock-based compensation is expected to be below 8% as a percent of revenue as we continue to take a disciplined approach to our equity-based programs. As a result, for the fiscal year '25, I am pleased that our GAAP operating margin guidance for the first time is expected to surpass 20% at 20.4%, representing a 600 basis point improvement year-over-year. We expect fiscal year '25 GAAP diluted EPS $6.07 to $6.15. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $9.68 to $9.76. As a result of our focus on profitable growth and continued transformation, we are seeing a market improvement in our cash flow outcomes. We expect fiscal year '25 operating cash flow growth of approximately 21% to 24%, which includes a 10 point year-over-year headwind from cash taxes. CapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 23% to 26% for the fiscal year. Now to guidance for Q1. On revenue, we expect $9.12 billion to $9.17 billion, up 11% year-over-year in nominal and 12% in constant currency. This includes a tailwind from the timing of license revenue in Mulesoft and Tableau. Additionally, Q1 has a one point benefit from an extra day of revenue recognition given the leap year, which has no impact on our full year revenue or CRPO. CRPO growth for Q1 is expected to be 11% year-over-year in nominal and 12% in constant currency. For Q1, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.42 to $1.44 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.37 to $2.39. Now to capital return. We are deeply committed to driving free cash flow and return to our shareholders while investing in new organic growth initiatives. In Q4, we returned $1.7 billion in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total returns in FY24 to $7.7 billion, or more than 80% of fiscal year free cash flow, which more than fully offset dilution from our stock-based compensation. Since the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion. Based on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion. In closing, I want to echo Marc and Brian, and this has been an extraordinary year. I'm very proud of the progress we have made throughout the company. We are executing with discipline while also investing for our future. I want to personally thank our employees who have worked so hard this past year and thank our shareholders for their continued support over this past transformational year. Now, Mike, I think we better open up the call for questions. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Amy. Brandon (ph), we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Marc, last quarter you had said that you're starting to see some green shoots, and we're not ready to say you completely turned the corner. But I'm just curious if you could give everyone an update in terms of just what you're seeing from customer behavior and ultimately how you think that plays out through the year. Thank you. Marc Benioff : It's a great question. And I think Amy will go back and say it was really this kind of moment in the middle of fiscal year, whatever, it was '23, where we started to see this kind of weird behavior. And then I would say starting last quarter, like you said, we saw these green shoots, and now I would really say it was kind of a 180, that -- it's really that AI, every customer realizes, number one, they've got to start a major investment cycle if they're going to remain competitive. Every customer is trying to achieve more productivity. I think we all know what that means. We certainly do. We've had to achieve more productivity ourselves over the last year, and they -- that is really about, in many cases, augmenting your employees. A lot of you've heard my Gucci story, there's so many stories, there's going to be so many more stories where these tools all of a sudden will really start to deliver much more productivity, better customer relationships and higher margins. CEOs get that. I think that is driving the 180. Obviously, we're also in the third phase of the pandemic. The first phase, we all went through together, it was horrible. It was my first pandemic. I had never been through anything like it. And then all of a sudden we were in the post-pandemic where we were in this crazy interest rate and inflation burn. Now we're in the third phase post, post-pandemic. And in post, post-pandemic, things are just better. Not just because we're going through this technology surge, but because all this other stuff is behind us and we're in a new normal and people know, hey, we need to invest to grow. We need to invest in technology to grow. And that, I think, is really driving the 180 for our customers, for ourselves. I think for a lot of you, we can all see it in the equity markets that it's not the equity markets that we had in 2021. So we are in a new place and we are ready to deliver. You're going to have -- you could be the judge yourself. When we get to Trailhead DX, I hope that you're all going to -- most of you have my text and email, text and email me and tell me what you think. Because if you see anyone else being able to deliver on the promise of enterprise AI at the level of quality and scale and capability of Salesforce, I'll be very surprised. And this is driving through different geographies, through different product portfolios. Green shoots. Brian, I want you to come in here and talk about these green sheets. But really, the 180 that we're seeing. Brian Millham : Yeah, I really appreciate it. And we are seeing tremendous demand for Data Cloud and for AI. I do think, Brent, that we are still operating in a measured environment and we are still having to ensure that we're doing the deep inspection and managing the business very tightly in the way that we have over the past six quarters, seven quarters in this environment. The green shoots around Data Cloud, around Mulesoft, regional performance that we've seen have been really outstanding in Canada and LatAm and Spain. I mentioned the India performance on the call. Our focus on industries is really paying big dividends. So we are seeing parts of our business really accelerate, but there certainly are some -- still some measured environments out there that we have to continue to take into account the way that we manage this business. Marc Benioff : Amy, I think you should come in here and also talk about how you've seen the transformation of the business and the green shoots that you see happening or kind of the 180s that I\u2019m talking about. Amy Weaver : Sure. It's been an incredible couple of years. Yeah, Marc. As you mentioned, going back to really beginning of July in fiscal year '23, where we suddenly saw this measured buying environment, the elongated sales cycles, the additional approvals, the compressed deals. And over the last few years, what I've really seen is not so much a shift in the buying behavior, but a shift in our ability to execute in it. And I think we've seen that over the last couple of quarters in particular, that we are just executing much better in this. I do think that there is a lot of excitement to come on AI and data, and we'll see how that plays out this year. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Brent. Brandon, we'll take the next question now. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And congratulations on another really nice quarter. A question just on sort of buying cycles and sort of the timing for this AI goodness to kind of come into the numbers. And maybe it's a question for Brian. How should we think about how customers are ingesting this? Right, how are they purchasing the Einstein platform? Does it start with Data Cloud and then they move into more of the application functionality? And then importantly, how should investors think about when this could potentially impact numbers? And then when this will become material enough to see the inflection in kind of revenue growth? And then maybe one for Amy, another 200 basis points of operating margin expansion in the guide. Super impressive. Can you give us some indications of where that's coming from, where there are the additional areas of leverage that you're seeing in the business? Brian Millham : First of all, Keith, thank you. I really appreciate the question. You kind of nailed it in your question. We're seeing our customers with tremendous desire to take advantage of AI capabilities to drive the efficiencies in their business, to drive higher margins and productivity. But it all starts with data. And so you saw some of the numbers that we put out in my comments. Data Cloud approaching $400 billion and growing 90% year-over-year. This should be an indicator of the demand that we're seeing for people to get ready for the AI transformation they want to put their company through. And so we're really excited about the opportunity ahead, but every customer I talk to says I've got trap data. I don't have a great data strategy. My architecture is off. And that's why we're seeing such great performance on our Data Cloud products. On the AI front, I think we're going to start to see that show up further out in this fiscal year. We don't have a lot of it factored into our guide right now, to be candid, just because there's so much work that needs to happen now, the demand is heavy. And as we just launched this Copilot product this -- yesterday, just announced it and launch it tomorrow, as you'll see next week at TDX, enormous demand for it. And we think we have a massive opportunity to go faster here. So big upside, but not a lot factored in here. And I'm going to flip it over to Amy to talk a little bit about some of that. Amy Weaver : Sure. So just following up, Brian, on the comments, in terms of the new products, in Data Cloud, we're already seeing this great traction, which is certainly factored in. Some of the GenAI, it's still early, and given that the adoption curve at really our size and scale as a $38 billion company, we're not factoring in material contribution from these new products into our FY25 revenue guidance at this time. Turning on OP margin. Yes. Really happy to see another 200 basis points this year as a commitment. This year, we are just seeing amazing leverage from many of the hard decisions we made last year. They're continuing to flow through and really benefiting the business. A few things I would call out a lot of discipline around headcount over the past year. We are starting to grow in some areas at this point, but it's really investing into our most productive areas, AI, data. And we're doing that in cost effective ways, really trying to leverage areas that have high, high talent pools and low costs. We're also looking at things like top line, how are we doing with our product and pricing? What are we doing in terms of go to market efficiencies? Brian has been great this past year in making changes and driving productivity. I think you'll see additional changes coming, additional benefits coming from all of those areas. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Keith. Brandon, we'll take our next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. Marc, as you talked -- you talk to a lot of CEOs across all the breadth of industries. What are they saying about the -- their business and their propensity to spend real dollars in Data Cloud with Salesforce? And if that comes true, could the company re accelerate top line? One for you, Amy. You seem to sound confident that leading indicators are rebounding. What are those leading indicators? We can't quantify, at least qualitatively, can you talk about the leading indicators? And how much of a lag is there between those indicators and how they show up in revenue? Thank you so much and congrats. Marc Benioff : Well, Kash, this is basically what every software company wants. You want a new killer app. Sometimes you can get it through organic innovation. Sometimes you get it through inorganic innovation. We got lucky. We've done it with organic innovation, with Data Cloud. I think Data Cloud is everything that we want at this moment for a few different reasons. First of all, yes, it's an incredible new cloud and we've seen what that kind of can do for Salesforce when we had Sales Cloud to Service Cloud to Marketing Cloud to platform. And of course, we also had these other clouds that we picked up inorganically, commerce, Tableau, Slack, etc. But this incredible new organic cloud, the difference with this cloud and the difference between what's ever happened with Salesforce before, this cloud makes every other cloud better. So the hot new, exciting version of Sales Cloud, the hottest new feature in Sales Cloud, what's going to transform the tens of thousands of Sales Cloud customers that we have out there that we've been working on building for the last two and a half decades is Data Cloud. And Service Cloud -- the new version of Service Cloud is the Service Cloud plus Data Cloud. And Marketing Cloud read the gartner MQ. We vanquished all of the other competitors completely with this product because it's so deeply integrated with what we're doing already and everything else in marketing. And the platform is extended with Data Cloud. And if you have this other data infrastructure in your company, any of the big queries and the redshifts and the snowflakes, I went through all this. It's made better with Data Cloud because it unleashes that trap data to your users. This is a compelling reason to use Data Cloud all by itself. But that would be if we were not in the greatest transformation of our industry with artificial intelligence, where we so badly need this data. We -- yes, we always love to have another data lake. We would have loved to have a data lake integrated with sales cloud many years ago. Okay, we have that. But why is it more important right now? Yes, we have the data lake, we have the repository, we have the warehouse, but now it has deeply also integrated into the AI. That is why every customer must buy this product if they are going to achieve the nirvana that we can see for businesses, the trinity that we talked about, productivity, customer relationships, margins when you get data and AI working together. We can do it. This is our message to our salespeople, to our partners, to all of you. This is an incredible moment. That is why we have to execute like hell this year. Fiscal year '25 needs to be one thing, the year of Data Cloud. Amy Weaver : Okay. Great. And Kash, thanks for the question about leading indicators. I think first you obviously heard the excitement about Data Cloud. And if you didn't... Marc Benioff : I can go through it again. I'll do it one more time. Amy Weaver : [Multiple Speakers] Let's just start with that, I'm looking at a leading indicator. So specifically there are a number of things that we look at that tend to be leading indicators that things may not be as good. Now that would be something like create and close SMB, self-served. I've talked a lot about those over the past few years, but I do feel very good about some things I'm seeing right now. It is the execution from our team and we've really seen this over the past two quarters and that's really led to improved bookings growth. We've seen AE productivity that is up. Brian talked a lot about that last quarter. It was fantastic. We look at our pipeline for indications of going forward. That said, as we've talked about, our top line expectations do include the lagging impact from the measured buying environment that began a couple of years ago. It's just going to take time for that to work through our system, but I am seeing some nice indicators that give me a lot of hope. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Kash. Brandon, we'll take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead. Karl Keirstead : Okay. Great. Maybe a two-parter for Brian. Two elements of the business that I think you have responsibility for. One is around pricing and bundling, and you mentioned Einstein 1. Just curious, when will that be a needle mover for revenues? How much of that uplift are you baking into the guide this year? And then also on the pro services side, typically not a focus area for anybody on this call, but down 9% in the quarter was obviously an inflection down. What's happening with that? Is that tight discretionary spend or is that Salesforce consciously pushing more work to your SI partners? Thanks on both. Marc Benioff : So before you hit that, I want you to hit the service. But before you do that, when you think AI and you think obviously we all know what ACV is, I think it's basically a term that we created. Now it's industry wide, AOV, CSM. Brian, you created that. ACV this year, we obviously have huge goals internally. Okay? A material part of this ACV needs to be Data Cloud. This is important. This is the AI number. This is everything that AI, Einstein 1, the artificial intelligence, Data Cloud, we have to bring this all together. That's why we call it Einstein 1. Look at the Einstein 1 SKU. Look at what we call UE plus. That is where you're going to see the material ACV traction. That is our focus intention. Of course, we don't know what's going to really happen, but when we got all of our -- we did a huge kickoff last week in Vegas. We brought 5,000 of our top executives, most 80% for sales. We had 70,000 online. We had one message to them, Data Cloud. Number one, Data Cloud. Number one, AI become a great storyteller about these stories. Number two. Number three, sell UE Plus, sell Einstein 1. Number four, deliver the customer success. Number five, our incredible new Ohana 2.0 culture. These are the five things we're doing this year. So it's deeply integrated with that, and this absolutely must be part of everything we're doing. But when you think AI, think Data Cloud. Brian? Brian Millham : Thanks, Marc. Karl, back to your question, on pricing and bundling, we're excited about the progress we've made here. UE plus is a good example of what we're seeing, good acceleration. It's not the only thing we're doing in pricing and packaging. Obviously we did a price increase last year and seeing some benefits to that. Certainly, we're simplifying the way that we are putting quotes in the market, fewer SKUs, making it easier for our sellers to get out there. In terms of materiality in the short term, you're not going to really see it show up. We did it in the second half of last year. And so while we've seen great progress and there's a lot of promise for it in terms of this year's revenue guide, not a huge factor in our growth numbers this year, you will see it start to show up in year two and three as we roll through the renewals, the uplift, etc., and some of the incremental pricing changes that we're going to do. On ProServe, a good question. I think the big issue, and it's really been felt across the entire professional services industry, a bit of headwinds on customers willingness to do massive transformation. We really felt that during the pandemic that customers were coming to us and saying, I want to make a multiyear commitment to your services and spend significant amount of money, these very large transactions and services. Now our customers are saying, hey, let me take a smaller bite at the apple. Let me start smaller, get to time to value faster, let me get the benefits of the technology sooner. And so while the demand remains high, it's just smaller transactions that are getting done vis-a-vis last year and the year before that. So the tough compares on large deals, smaller transactions. For us, in a lot of ways, very good. Let's get our customers proving out the technology, let's go faster, but having an impact on our professional services business right now. Michael Spencer : Great. Thanks, Karl. Brandon, let's go to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. For Amy and Brian, the gross margin and sales efficiency metrics are quite strong this quarter. And so I'm curious, just from a standpoint of eating your own dog food or drinking your own champagne, have you been able to realize any benefit from deploying either service GPT or sales GPT internally to save time for your own customer support agents or your own sales teams? I'm just wondering, if you -- are they suddenly becoming more productive or able to do more with less already? Brian Millham : Yeah, Mark. Thank you. We are a big believer on sales on Salesforce. We are deploying our own AI technology internally. Our sales teams are using it. Absolutely, we are seeing benefits right now. But the biggest benefit we've seen actually has been in our support operation with case summaries. Our ability to get -- to tap into knowledge bases faster to get knowledge surfaced within the flow of work. And so it absolutely is part of our margin expansion strategy going forward, which is how do we leverage our own AI to drive more efficiencies in our business to augment the work that's being done in sales and in service and in marketing and even into our commerce efforts as well. So we're excited about the future there as well is leveraging our own technology to drive those efficiencies. Amy, I don't know if you have anything else to add to that. Amy Weaver : No, I think that was great, Brian. We have to be customer number one and use it. And I'm excited that we are. Lots of opportunities for us. Michael Spencer : Thanks, Mark. Brandon, we'll take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Yeah. Thanks very much. I'll echo the congrats on a great fiscal year. I don't know if Brian or Marc wants to take this one, but we realize AI is applicable to every industry. But I was just kind of curious, are there any industries that you believe are farther along in terms of taking advantage of AI where there frankly could be a domino effect due to the competitive advantage one customer could get over another if they don't start down this path? Marc Benioff : A very good question, and an unknown. I mean, this is the future. Look, does anybody really know what is going to happen? I mean, we saw Minority Report war games, it was written by our futurist Peter Schwartz at Salesforce. Many decades ago, we've seen the movies, her terminator. Is this our future? Do we really know what's going to happen? Look, at the end of the day, we all know that everything is underway with AI. The future is unfolding between our eyes. And we all remember the Minority Report scene when Tom Cruise walks into the gap store and the hall store turns into a highly personalized experience. And the digital sales agents and the human sales agents all start talking. We got this Jeans last time, you need to buy the new jeans this time. Listen, if I go into the gap store right now, and I love the gap, amazing new CEO, San Francisco company, fantastic, incredible, worked with him at Mattel. But the store has not yet transformed into the Tom cruise scene. We know that, okay? But great products, great brand, great company, great lineage, great founders. Okay? We are on the verge of something huge happening for all of our customers. We have to be driving that. We think we have the solution. This is going to happen. We also need to be guiding it with the right values. We all know that. We have to have the right core values. I went to this AI safety summit. Not enough focus on values. The values -- not just the woke values that we're seeing in these filters, which are horrible, but the values of trust. And that story I told you on the script, when I saw that last week, I'm like, I'm putting this in the script that this company, which is a great company and a customer of ours, but did not use our technology, went out there and used some kind of rogue AI that they picked off the Internet. Some engineer just hobbled it, hooked it up, and then it started just spewing these hallucinations and falsehoods around their loyalty program, and the courts are holding them liable. Good. Let every CEO wake up and realize, we are on the verge of one of the greatest transformations in the history of technology. But trust must be our highest value. And that is why at Salesforce, we are going to lead this not just with great technology like you see, but also and I just put on my Twitter feed, I hope you see at the top of my Twitter feed the results for the quarter. But please watch the five minute video that's on the Twitter feed so you can understand coming into Trailhead DX. What we are delivering with AI? A trust based AI for enterprises built on our data and metadata. This is what's truly important. Michael Spencer : Great. Thanks. Brandon, we'll take our last question now. Operator : Your final question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Listen, great to see the data cloud traction, the recognition of Gartner's magic quadrant. And Marc, I appreciate you taking us into why the architecture is different from general purpose data platforms and that it brings together the data and the metadata. But my question is a two-parter. A, it's clear Data Cloud is optimized for customer data and customer related apps. Can you take it beyond that? And then, B, how much of the customer base today is really viable to take Einstein 1 on and UE plus at a 50% higher list price point? And how far penetrated are we into that? Thank you. Marc Benioff : Well, I'm going to do the first part, and then I'm going to turn it over to Mike Spencer to do the second, because he not only runs IR, but he also runs FPNA. And he's been doing that analysis. So I know he was going to come in on this. Look, number one, this is a huge upsell opportunity for us. You probably know, I think not even 50% of our Sales Cloud users use Service Cloud. Not even 50% of our Service Cloud users use Sales Cloud. Maya Copa, that is on us. Okay. I wish I could say that all of our sales users are service users, our service users are sales users. But even ADP that I talked about in the script, who we've worked with for more than two decades, and I remember the first time I made a sales call there to extract Siebel from their infrastructure was not yet using us for service. So we have a lot of work to do to sell our existing clouds into our customers and also to upsell our existing customers and cross sell them with Data Cloud, with Einstein 1, with the full platform. We're rewriting our whole platform to be deeply integrated. We will no longer have all these separate acquired platforms. When we're done, we have one integrated platform, Einstein 1. One unified data and metadata platform. This is something I have deeply focused on in the last year to make sure it's clear to all of our engineers and are also financed that this must be funded, which it is. And then we will deliver this capability and then we will light up and give you these great success stories. Look, some companies operate at the highest level, the user and the productivity level. That's not where we are. Okay. Some companies, okay, they operate maybe at the model level. That's also not where we are. We are a data company. We operate at the data level. Yes. We're about customer success made possible by data. This is AI revolution, it's a data revolution. There's no question. You cannot have the AI without the data. That's why those AI companies stole all that consumer data, so they could have some semblance of those party tricks. For the enterprise, it's not going to fly. You've got to have these comprehensive data sets that are informed by the metadata. And Mike's now going to answer the second part and we'll wrap it up. Mike, go ahead. Michael Spencer : Yeah. Brad. Thanks for the question. I think the way to think about the price uplift, moving to Einstein 1 edition used to be a limited edition plus. It's really about the value that we're providing to our customers. Because at the end of the day, our ability to get increased price is about the value that we're going to provide. And so as customers start to ramp up their abilities on AI, ramp up their learnings, and understand what it means for them economically, our ability to get price will be dictated by that. Early signs of that are pretty strong. We feel good about the progress we've seen. It's only been in market for four plus months now in FY24, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing. But at the end of the day, it's -- we're trying to make it as simple as we can for our customers to buy it. But it's going to be predicated on the value. Brian Millham : I agree. And just one last comment, Brad. It's Brian. We want to be able to deliver data cloud and AI at all levels, in all segments. And you see that in our offering around Salesforce starter where we're building an AI and data cloud capabilities as part of that. So every segment of our customer base should be able to enjoy the power of AI and data cloud. Michael Spencer : So thanks for the question, Brad. And we thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks. Brian Millham : Thanks all. Operator : This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which could change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and any other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. And with that, let me hand the call over to Marc. Marc Benioff : Thanks so much, Mike. I'm really excited for the call today, because there's two things that I'm really been looking forward to talking about. First is our incredible financial transformation as you can see from the numbers today and the second is the incredible work that's happening with artificial intelligence. Look, first of all, in Q1, we delivered $9.13 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency. Subscription and support revenue grew at 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency. And for the 11th year in a row, Salesforce is still ranked the number one provider worldwide by market share based on the latest IDC software tracker. I mean, that really gets to a core part of our technology transformation that I'm going to get to, which is the transformation to AI. And because we are the number one CRM provider, we're now managing more than 250 petabytes of data for our customers. This is going to be absolutely critical as they move into artificial intelligence. And now also let's turn to our financial guidance. For fiscal year '25, we're maintaining our revenue guidance of $37.7 billion to $38 billion, growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. And we now expect fiscal year '25 subscription and support revenue growth to be approximately 10% year-over-year in constant currency. As you can see from our results, we remain committed to profitable growth at scale, and I would also say incredible cash flow. And then continue to expect fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5%, a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. I'm extremely proud of our team's focus and determination to deliver this world class financial result, including this cash flow and profitability in the quarter. And Brian and Amy will discuss Q1 performance in much greater detail. As I said, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity ahead for Salesforce, not only with these incredible financial results but in the incredible transformations that we are leading with our customers in artificial intelligence. Every company in the world across every industry is being transformed by AI in the next few years. And when you look at the power of AI, you realize the models and the UI are not the critical success factors, it's not critical where the enterprise will transform. There are thousands of these models, some open source and some closed source models, some built with billions, some with just a few dollars, most of these will not survive. They are just commodities now and it's not where the intelligence lies. And they don't know anything about a company's customer relationships. Each day, hundreds of petabytes of data are created that AI models can use for training and generating output. But the one thing that every enterprise needs to make AI work is their customer data, as well as the metadata that describes the data, which provides the attributes and context the AI models need to generate accurate, relevant output. And customer data and metadata are the new gold for these enterprises, and Salesforce now manages, as I mentioned, 250 petabytes of this precious material. We have one of the most and largest repositories of front office enterprise data and metadata in the world. And every day more companies are adopting Salesforce as their front office, bringing all their structured and unstructured data into our platform. Nearly half of our top 50 wins in the quarter included six or more of our clouds. That really speaks to the comprehensive nature of our strategy. It's incredible. And many of these customers have essential business and customer data that exists outside of Salesforce that's trapped in thousands of apps and silos and it's disconnected. That's why we're seeing this incredible momentum with our Data Cloud, our fastest growing organic and our next $1 billion cloud. It's the first step to becoming an AI enterprise. Data Cloud gives every company a single source of truth and you can securely power AI insights and actions across the entire Customer 360. Now let me tell you why I'm excited about Data Cloud and why it's transforming our customers and how it's preparing them for this next generation of artificial intelligence. Data Cloud was included in 25% of our $1 million plus deals in the quarter. We added more than 1,000 data cloud customers for the second quarter in a row. 8 trillion records were ingested in the Data Cloud in the quarter, up 42% year-over-year and we processed 2 quadrillion records, that's a 217% increase compared to last year. Over 1 trillion activations drove customer engagement, which is a 33% increase year-over-year. This incredible growth of data in our system and the level of transactions that we're able to deliver, not just in the core system but especially in data cloud is preparing our customers for this next generation of AI. And last month, we created a Zero Copy Partner Network with partners, including Amazon, Databricks, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Snowflake, so customers can access this live data from anywhere in data cloud without copying or moving it. It's the engine of our future growth and this is the engine of our future artificial intelligence growth as well. As you know, for years, we've delivered predictive AI across all our clouds with Einstein. Einstein is generating hundreds of billions of predictions per day, trillions per week. Now, we are working with thousands of customers to power generative AI use cases with our Einstein Copilot, our Prompt Builder, our Einstein Studio, all of which went live in the first quarter. And we've closed hundreds of Copilot deals since this incredible technology has gone GA. And in just the last few months, we're seeing Einstein Copilot develop higher levels of capability. We are absolutely delighted and could not be more excited about the success that we're seeing with our customers with this great new capability. Saks, a leader in the luxury fashion market, part of Hudson\u2019s Bay, went all in on Salesforce in the quarter. CEO, Marc Metrick, is using AI to create more personal experiences for every customer touchpoint across their company. And with our Einstein 1 platform and Data Cloud, Saks can unify and activate all its customer data to power trusted AI. Another great story is FedEx, a company that we all know, bringing together previously siloed information. It's the leader in getting packages delivered quickly. And of course, how are we going to now deliver a more productive, more efficient and more profitable FedEx. The SF -- the Salesforce data and app and AI capabilities generate expense savings. This is the core efficiency while growing and accelerating top line revenue. This is the effectiveness that we're delivering for FedEx. This efficiency includes next best action for sellers, automated lead nurturing, Slack for workflow management, opportunity scoring, a virtual assistant, AI and unstructured data for delivering content to sales and customer service. And when we think about effectiveness, we see our Journey Builder delivering hyper personalization, integrating customer experiences across service, sales, marketing, the ability to tailor and deliver customer experiences based on a Customer 360 view. When we look at this incredible next generation of capability we've delivered at FedEx, gone now are these days of static business rules that leave customers dissatisfied asking, do they not know that I am a valued customer of FedEx? Now FedEx has not only the power of the Customer 360, but the power of AI to unlock so much more commercial potential by conducting an orchestra of commercial functions that never played well together before. You have a significant opportunity now with Salesforce and this incredible platform that sellers can convince companies to transform all of their incredible capabilities to deliver another level of profitability. I think stories like that are driving our company forward and it's all driven by the power of artificial intelligence. Another story I'm really excited about in the quarter is Air India, transformed with data and AI. If you don't know about Air India, they are an incredible airline who's acquired multiple airlines to create this amazing platform for India's growth. And with Data Cloud, Air India is unifying Data Cloud across loyalty, reservations, flight systems and data warehouses. They have a single source of truth to handle more than 550,000 service cases each month. And now with Einstein, we are automatically classifying and summarizing cases and sending that to the right agent with recommended next steps and upgrading in high value passenger experiences. Even when things happen like a flight delay, our system is able to immediately intervene and provide the right capability to the right customer at the right time. All of that frees up agents to deliver more personal service and create more personal relationships, a more profitable, a more productive, a more efficient Air India, a company that's using AI to completely transform their capability. Well, we're looking forward to talking to you more in this call about these incredible transformations, the financial transformation that we've gone through with these incredible cash flow and margin numbers, and this incredible artificial intelligence transformation. And now over to Brian. Brian Millham : Thanks, Marc, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I also want to thank the team for their hard work this quarter. As Marc said, we're incredibly well positioned for this AI transformation. We're the number one AI CRM innovating at a pace I've not seen in my entire career. I could not be more excited about the opportunity ahead. We're seeing good demand as AI technology rapidly evolves and customers recognize the value of transforming into AI enterprises. CEOs and CIOs are excited about the opportunity with data and AI and how it can impact their front office operations. We continue to focus on our growth levers of multi-cloud deals, international expansion, industry solutions, the Salesforce ecosystem and of course, the data and AI innovations across all of our clouds. Now let me briefly address the buying environment. We continue to see the measured buying behavior similar to what we experienced over the past two years and with the exception of Q4 where we saw stronger bookings. The momentum we saw in Q4 moderated in Q1 and we saw elongated deal cycles, deal compression and high levels of budget scrutiny. In addition, in Q1, as part of our ongoing transformation, we made some intentional changes in our go-to-market organization to drive long term productivity and create better customer experiences, which also played a role in the softer bookings performance. At the same time, we are seeing strong momentum in various parts of our business, particularly Data Cloud and industries. And we continue to drive our core growth levers, multi-cloud deals, again, were a highlight for us in the quarter with six of our top 10 deals, including six or more clouds, showing the depth and relevance of our portfolio. Let me give you just one example of a company that is using Salesforce across the entire front office. CrowdStrike, a leading cybersecurity company and a longtime customer of Salesforce added Data Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Revenue Cloud and MuleSoft in the quarter. CrowdStike already relied on Einstein 1 sales and service and Slack, and now they'll use Data Cloud to pull together new and trap data from data lakes to build a 360 degree view of their customers, helping them align sales and marketing efforts to drive growth. They're also leveraging MuleSoft with incredible results. MuleSoft has helped CrowdStrike accelerate project delivery by 30% and decreased maintenance costs by 20%. Salesforce is now the backbone of CrowdStrike driving every aspect of CrowdStrike's operation and limiting the reliance on complex siloed third party applications. As Marc said, we're seeing impressive growth in our Data Cloud business. In the quarter, 25% of our deals over $1 million included Data Cloud. It's obviously an important growth lever for us as it brings all of our clouds to life and make them all better. And we continue to see momentum in Einstein AI with wins at Turtle Bay Resort, Autodesk and Langley Federal Credit Union as companies transform into AI enterprises. One example is Siemens. Siemens lacked a centralized destination for customers to easily choose the right products and buy on demand. To simplify the buying experience for customers, Siemens worked with Salesforce to develop and launch its Xcelerator marketplace, an AI-powered digital marketplace built on Einstein 1 commerce, providing AI-generated product pages, smart recommendations and self service ordering, and they did it all in just six months. And obviously, AI is not just for our customers, as part of our own transformation, we continue to adopt AI inside Salesforce. Under the leadership of our Chief People Officer, Natalie Scardino and our Chief Information Officer, Juan Perez, we've integrated Einstein right into Slack, helping our employees schedule, plan and summarize meetings and answer employee questions. Einstein has already answered nearly 370,000 employee queries in a single quarter. And in our engineering organization, our developers now save more than 20,000 hours of coding each month through the use of our AI tools. These innovations are helping us drive continued efficiencies across the business and accelerate our product road maps. We have great momentum with Slack, which again was included in nearly half of our top 50 deals in the quarter. We also launched Slack AI in February, an amazing innovation that provides recap, summaries and personalized search right within Slack. I personally have been using it every day to get caught up on the conversations happening in every channel, and we've seen great traction with our customers with this product, that our customers have summarized over 28 million Slack messages since its launch in February. Rocket Mortgage added Slack AI in the quarter to help its employees save time and close loans faster. They've also leveraged external Slack channels to collaborate with partners more effectively and efficiently. And they've experienced a 60% faster turnaround speed from working with their customers and partners in Slack. On the international front, we had a solid quarter. In LATAM, we had great wins at [Celio] and Grupo DPSP; and EMEA, great wins at IHG Hotels and Resorts and John Lewis partnership; and in APAC, Atlassian and Bank of Philippines Islands were wins in the quarter. We saw particular strength in our Japan business with wins at Seibu Prince Hotels worldwide and Hitachi. Industries was another growth lever for us in the quarter, half of our top 10 deals included one of our industry clouds. A great example in the quarter was Paychex, a digital HR leader. By leveraging Financial Service Cloud and Data Cloud, Paychex is able to unify their data, building better insights and creating a single view of each customer. And using Einstein 1 sales and service, Paychex will be able to proactively manage insurance renewals, which means agents can proactively reach out and surface renewal opportunities during any touchpoint with the customer, 30, 60 or 90 days in advance driving an increased rate of renewals. And in the public sector, the City of Los Angeles chose Salesforce to modernize how the city's 4 million residents request city services using its MyLA311 system. The city will use government cloud and other Salesforce solutions to integrate AI assistance into MyLA311 and modernize its own constituent facing services, giving residents more self service options and improving service reliability and responsiveness. Our partner ecosystem also continues to be a growth lever for us. I'm especially excited about our deep partnership with Amazon as a growth driver for -- as we move forward into Q2 and beyond with Salesforce products now available on the AWS marketplace. Joint customers are able to expedite their deployments through faster buying and billing experiences and flexible budgeting options. In closing, I want to echo Marc in acknowledging the hard work of the team, our continued success has been made possible by our amazing employees, customers, partners and trailblazers. And with that, I will now pass it off to Amy. Amy Weaver : Great. Thanks, Brian. Q1 represents another quarter of continued discipline and transformation across the business. I am very proud of all of our employees for their continued dedication and hard work. Now let's go straight to the results. For the first quarter, revenue was $9.13 billion, up 11% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency. The result was at the lower end of our guided range due to continuing pressures on professional services, some license revenue volatility and the continued measured buying environment. Subscription and support revenue grew 12% year-over-year in nominal and 13% in constant currency. As mentioned on our last call, this included a tailwind from the timing of license revenue in MuleSoft and Tableau related to Q4 deals and a 1 point benefit from the leap year. From a geographic perspective, in Q1, Americas revenue grew 11%, EMEA grew 10% or 9% in constant currency and APAC grew 14% or 21% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth in Japan, India and Canada, while the US, parts of LATAM and EMEA, were constrained. From an industry perspective, in Q1, public sector and financial services both performed well, while high tech and retail and consumer goods were more constrained. Our new offerings for small and medium businesses, Starter and Pro Suite, which are ready to use simplified solutions with AI built in, are building momentum. In Q1, we added another 2,300 new logos to these products. Since Starter's launched last year, we've seen customers upgrade to our recently launched Pro Suite and even to our Enterprise and Unlimited additions. Q1 revenue attrition ended the quarter at around 8%, in line with recent quarters. I'm also very pleased that our non-GAAP operating margin again finished strong at 32.1%, up 450 basis points year-over-year. And our profitable growth trajectory continues to drive strong cash flow generation. Q1 operating cash flow was $6.25 billion, up 39% year-over-year. Q1 free cash flow was $6.1 billion, up 43% year-over-year. Cash flow did benefit modestly from the timing of cash tax payments. Now to put this cash flow performance in context, we have more than tripled the cash we generated just four years ago. Turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract. We ended Q1 at $53.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $26.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year in nominal. Now this includes a $200 million FX headwind, which results in more than 10% year-over-year growth in constant currency. CRPO growth was primarily driven by resilience in our core products. However, as Brian mentioned, we did continue to experience measured buying behavior, which is reflected in the moderated Q1 bookings. On capital return, we were incredibly proud to pay out our first ever quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share for a total of $388 million. And altogether in Q1, we returned more than $2.5 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. This brings our total cash return since the inception of our capital return programs to more than $14 billion. We remain committed to continued capital return and anticipate declaring our quarterly dividend next month subject to Board approval. Now let's turn to guidance, starting with full fiscal year '25. A few items to note. First, on the buying environment, we are assuming that the conditions we saw in Q1 continue throughout our fiscal year. On FX, our revenue guidance continues to incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year-over-year or about a 30 basis points impact. We also continue to expect our professional services business to be a headwind to revenue with deal compression and customers delaying or slowing projects. However, we also continue to see strong demand for Data Cloud and multi-cloud adoption. We're seeing benefits from recent pricing and packaging changes and we're seeing strong industries adoption. These factors are also included in our guide. As a result, on revenue, we are maintaining our guidance range of between $37.7 billion to $38 billion, growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. We now expect subscription and support revenue growth to be approximately 10% year-over-year in constant currency. And we expect attrition to remain generally consistent at slightly above 8% for the full year. As a reminder, starting in fiscal '25, we include Slack invoice in the metric, which we expect to create a modest headwind. Now turning to profitability and cash flow. On margins, we continue to expect fiscal year '25 non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5%, representing a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year, following the significant increase last year. This incorporates intentional investments in targeted growth opportunities, notably AI, data and our core businesses. Stock based compensation is now expected to be just above 8% as a percent of revenue. The modest increase from our prior guidance is primarily a result of lower voluntary employee attrition in Q1 than in recent years. As a result, for fiscal year '25, GAAP operating margin guidance is expected to be approximately 20%, representing 550 basis points of improvement year-over-year. We expect fiscal year '25 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.04 to $6.12. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $9.86 to $9.94. As a result of our continued margin expansion, we are delivering world class cash flow. And we continue to expect fiscal year '25 operating cash flow growth to be approximately 21% to 24% inclusive of cash tax payment headwinds. We also continue to expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be slightly below 2% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 23% to 26% for the fiscal year. Now to guidance for Q2. On revenue, we expect $9.2 billion to $9.25 billion, up 7% to 8% year-over-year in nominal and approximately 8% in constant currency. CRPO growth for Q2 is expected to be 9% year-over-year in nominal, including a $200 million FX headwind, resulting in 10% constant currency growth. This includes ongoing headwinds from professional services. For Q2, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.31 to $1.33 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.34 to $2.36. In closing, I want to emphasize that, I am incredibly proud of the company's commitment to disciplined strategic investments and continued productivity gains to drive strong margin expansion and cash flow growth at scale. And of course, I want to thank our employees and our shareholders for their continued support. Now Mike, let's open up the call for questions. Mike Spencer : Thanks, Amy. And thanks, everyone, for joining. When we go to Q&A, we ask that each participant limit themselves to one question. And with that, Rob, we\u2019ll take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : I appreciate all the detail on sort of the growth drivers and what you guys are excited about in the business. But the quarter did come in below your expectations for CRPO growth, and we all look at that as a forward indicator. But you're not taking down the full year revenue guidance. So I was hoping you could help us get comfortable on why that's not leaving risk on the table and why you guys feel comfortable that original fiscal year '25 guide is still appropriate? Like why not take it down and make it more conservative and ensure that we can get back to beat and raise quarters on a go-forward basis? Amy Weaver : I'll take that one. Let me start by saying that there are many factors we have to consider within our guidance. And all in, based on what we're seeing at this time, we continue to believe that we will be within the range we guided. Now any guide is a balancing act, and as Brian called out, we are continuing to see this measured buying behavior. It's really been very consistent for the last two full years at this point with a possible exception of Q4 where we did see stronger bookings. And you can see the impact of that environment on our Q1 numbers, there's no question about that. PROserve also continues to see more and more pressure as customers are really just looking for shorter duration projects. However, this is really balanced by the demand that we are seeing in our products, and that remains strong. We tend -- we continue to see good demand on multi-cloud adoption. We're seeing benefits from pricing and packaging changes that we have rolled out over the past year. We're seeing very healthy adoption around our industry projects. I also should point out that our attrition rate remains very healthy. Customers are continuing to rely on Salesforce to run their businesses and they'll continue to do that. So when I step back and really take a holistic view of the full year, we do feel confident that we will be within our guidance range. Marc Benioff : I'd like to add. I really continue to focus on exactly like Amy says, this incredible transformation that we've seen with the financials. And obviously, we're delivering some quarter -- some numbers this quarter that were beyond our imagination just a few quarters ago. Another point of optimism is, not just what Amy said, but also we see this incredible transformation happening with our customers. And we all know the AI transformation as many transformations. It's a transformation of how we're interacting with software. It's also a transformation of these algorithms, what we call these models, that the AI is built on. And it's a transformation of the data that's used by whether it's consumers or enterprises to deliver this incredible next level of intelligence. But for enterprises, we know that this customer data and this metadata is really the new gold for these enterprises, and it's a huge driver of growth for our business. We all saw the report from McKinsey. 75% of the value of Gen AI use cases is in the front office. And everybody knows Salesforce is the leader in front office software, that's our fundamental premise for our growth going forward. That we're already managing 250 petabytes of data and metadata that's going to be used to generate this incredible level of intelligence and artificial and capability to deliver for our customers a level of productivity and profitability they've just never been able to see before. And at the heart of that is going to be our Data Cloud. And we've seen this Data Cloud -- well, we've seen this deliver for our customers an incredible level of capability in just the short period that we've made it available. It's already included in 25% of our million dollar-plus deals, as I mentioned, and more than 1,000 Data Cloud customers in the second quarter again, that's our second quarter row. When we look at a quarter where we see huge growth of a new product, it really sets us up for continued delivery of growth of that incredible technology. But what's the cool thing about Data Cloud is it's connected to every single one of our clouds. So it's making our Sales Cloud better, our Service Cloud better, our Marketing Cloud or Commerce Cloud, every aspect of Salesforce is better now with this incredible new technology. Another key part of it is, as I mentioned, 8 trillion records were ingested into Data Cloud in the first quarter, that was up 42% year-over-year and 2 quadrillion records were processed, that's up 217% year-over-year, and over 1 trillion activations driving customer engagement, up 33% year-over-year. All of that means that we're preparing our customers for a level of data capability that's going to give them this next capable -- capability of artificial intelligence. And last month, we created the Zero Copy Partner Network with Amazon, Databricks, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Snowflake that federates our Data Cloud with all these amazing data sources. Look, we really are focused on two things in our company. One is this incredible financial transformation that we've all gone through with you in the last year. The second one is this incredible transformation to artificial intelligence, which is going to be based on data. I don't think any company is more well positioned for the future of artificial intelligence and also delivering the kind of metrics that our stakeholders are going to want in Salesforce. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America. Brad Sills : I appreciate the commentary on the impact from the tough macro. We're certainly seeing that across the group. Brian, you mentioned also perhaps some impact here from go-to-market changes, which is, I guess, shouldn't be a big surprise given all that's going on at Salesforce right now. I wonder if you could just articulate a little bit on that. What are those changes? Is this the kind of situation where it's just some short term impact that could benefit the sales productivity over the longer term? Brian Millham : And you're exactly right. These are changes that we typically make in the first quarter. It's the most obvious time to make those changes when you start out a new year. These changes are actually intended to be productivity drivers for the future, absolutely right. We want to get a line behind our go-to-market strategy around buyer to make sure that we're aligned to support our customer scale that we can really support our multi-cloud strategy going forward to ensure our customers know exactly what we can do to support them across our entire product portfolio. And some of the changes that we made were exactly for that reason, how do we ensure that we are aligned behind that strategy to ensure we can go faster in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So you're absolutely right. The changes, while impactful in Q1, are short term and we expect to see productivity gains from them going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : Just from a geographic perspective, Europe looked like it was a little weaker. I'm curious if that's where you saw the pronounced weakness in EMEA or was this pretty consistent across most of the geographic regions? Brian Millham : Yes, EMEA was weaker in the quarter, frankly, feeling some of the measured buying environment most pronouncedly actually felt it also in the Americas. But there are other pockets around the world that were very strong. Canada was a strong region for us in the quarter. I mentioned our Japan business really accelerated in the quarter, really outstanding performance from our Japan business. So the big businesses are going to feel the impact, obviously, of the measured buying environment. In the Americas, more exposure to technology, which I think we all know has been a tough industry over the last several quarters. On SMB and other areas, the transactional business, these are the areas where you're going to feel some of those headwinds in the business. So spot on EMEA and America sort of feeling the impacts of the measured environments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Maybe for Marc or Brian. But I was just kind of curious, when we think about this measured buying environment, is there any sort of crowding effect around AI that's impacting software in your view, meaning when you think about all these companies starting to gear up for this next platform shift. Is just the uncertainty of what they're going to spend on over the next six to 12 months holding them back perhaps on what their normal sort of pace of spending might be with you all or other enterprise software companies? I know it's sort of an ongoing question, wondering if you all could weigh in. Marc Benioff : Well, let me give you my swing at exactly where we are, and then I'm going to turn it over to Brian to fill in the detail. I think when you look back over the last four years, Salesforce entered the pandemic in 2020, as four years ago, almost exactly, about half the size that we're at now. We've doubled our company at scale from $20 billion to approximately $40 billion, that's how I look at it in my mind. You can fill in the exact numbers. And over that period of time, we saw an incredible surge in the demand and buying environment and in the sales environment, especially during the pandemic. As we entered the post pandemic reality, we saw companies who had acquired so much software in that time look to actually rationalize it, ingest it, integrate it, install it, update it. I mean, it's just a massive amount of software that was put in, and so for every enterprise software company kind of has adjusted during end of this post pandemic environment. So when you look at all of these companies, especially as you saw the report in the last 30 days, they're all basically saying that same thing in different ways. When you take AI, that has to be our growth driver for future capabilities for these companies. AI, when we look at these companies and the stories that we told on the call, whether it's FedEx or Air India, or CrowdStrike, or Paychex, or any of the huge deals that we did in the quarter, what we're seeing is not only the installation and integration and implementation, of the platforms that we've sold in the last four years, but the layering in of this new capability, which is delivering for these companies a kind of a capability that we weren't able to forecast four years ago. And when we saw, like I told you the story of FedEx, like when we talk to their top executives about what they've delivered or you take an incredible company like State Farms is kind of automated 60 million policyholders, thousands of agents, they're just able to deliver at a level of capability. And I said it before, but profitability, employee augmentation, better customer relationships, much higher margins, these are financial metrics that we're able to deliver into these implementations, that's on top of where we were four years ago. So I think that as -- and the point I was trying to make here earlier, and I'll keep making, which is, the most important thing Salesforce is doing is not just continuing to automate every customer touchpoint. This is obviously critical and why we've been able to consume this 250 petabytes of information. But the second key point is we've rebuilt the way that we are delivering a foundation of data for our customers. Why is that so important? Because as we have now rearchitected all of our apps and all of our capabilities to fuel and fund this Data Cloud, it means that for our customers going forward, they're going to be able to take this Data Cloud and leverage that into their future capability and growth and especially profitability and productivity. And that is where our whole company, and I think our whole industry, is eventually going to go. Not every company is as well positioned as you know for this artificial intelligence capability of Salesforce is because they just don't have the data. They may say they have this capability or that capability, this user interface, that model, that, whatever, all of these things are quite fungible and are expiring quickly as the technology rapidly moves forward. But the piece that will not expire is the data. The data is the permanent key aspect that -- as we've said in our -- even in our core marketing, it's the gold for our customers and their ability to deliver our next capability in their own enterprises. And Brian, I'll turn it over to you. Brian Millham : And I -- all those things absolutely true. Marc said earlier, 75% of Gen AI will benefits will come from the front office, and we're really feeling that right now in our demand we're seeing from our customers and the pipelines that we're creating out there, solid performance on pipe gen. I do think customers are getting their data estate in order as a precursor to leveraging AI capabilities, and we're seeing that with the growth of Data Cloud right now. Customers really wanting to bring together many data [Technical Difficulty] our capabilities. So I think it's actually a step process for many of our customers. Let's get our data in order and then let's layer in the AI to really drive the productivity gains that we expect. And so that's really what we're seeing in the market right now, Kirk. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from UBS. Karl Keirstead : Maybe I'll switch subjects. So Marc and Amy, there was some concern in your shareholder base in March and April around media reports related to M&A. I know you can't comment on those reports, not expecting that, but wondering if you could comment on your M&A framework, whether there has been any change to it at all, I think might be helpful. Marc Benioff : No, I'd love to talk about that, and I think it's extremely important. I mean, Salesforce has a long history of innovation. Organic innovation like we've seen today with Data Cloud, everyone, I'm sure, is extremely impressed with the growth of that product. But also inorganic innovation and a lot of our customer touchpoints, whether it's our commerce platform or our marketing platform and our integration platform our inorganic innovation, products that we acquired, many of them at a multi-hundred million dollar revenue level that are at the multibillion-dollar revenue level. Some of the largest, most important software companies in the market today are actually companies that we acquired at much smaller levels. And all of you know Salesforce's story and how we put all of that together. And of course, I've mentioned we're rearchitecting almost every single one of those products and quite successfully and redeploying them to our customers into a single integrated data fabric to provide the power of future artificial intelligence. Now when we look at all of that combined, we always are looking at what is the next level of innovation. And so we're going to be looking at products organically. But yes, we will continue to look at products and organically. But as we've committed to you, if we're looking at a large scale acquisition, we're going to make sure that it is not dilutive to our customers that it's accretive, that it is -- has the right metrics. And we're also going to be quick to walk away from things that we are not totally confident in or that we don't have the trust with whatever company that we're looking at. So we have operated inside that framework. We continue to acquire companies. We just acquired amazing new company called Spiff, which is part of our Salesforce automation platform. It's an amazing capability. I mean Salesforce, as you know, is the number one SFA platform in the world. That SFA platform got a lot better this quarter with the capabilities now that it's deeply integrated into Data Cloud, which gives SFA customers the next step of growth with our SFA platform, but also it has an incredible new level of artificial intelligence and Generative AI capabilities now built into the Sales Cloud. And in addition, it also has compensation capabilities through Spiff, and that's through inorganic and that was acquired through our new M&A framework, for example. And as we go forward, we're going to continue to look at those opportunities. And look, we're not going to shy away from M&A for any one particular reason if it's within our framework. But if it's outside of our framework, we're going to be extremely cautious. And let me have Amy reiterate what the attributes of that framework are and how we look at M&A, because I don't think any company has been more successful with M&A than Salesforce has been. I mean that's how we've built our Customer 360 and have this incredible, incredible platform that we're able to automate these amazing companies with what we've gone through. But as we go forward, we know that we need to slightly adjust that so that we can continue to deliver to you these amazing financial metrics that you see, like you see this amazing cash flow number and margin number that we've seen rarely before in the software industry, maybe only a couple of companies have ever delivered cash flow at this level. And I think it's higher than most of the great consumer companies like Coke and Starbucks and all of that, like it's pretty -- these numbers are pretty epic in that area. But we know to deliver -- continue to deliver cash flow and margin numbers at this level. We're also going to have to continue to keep our eye on the M&A framework. So Amy, let's talk about that. Amy Weaver : Let me back it up a little bit to talk about our capital allocation strategy overall. And it's really very simple. We are going to continue to expand our free cash flow margin as we scale. We are going to invest in innovation. As Marc said, that is organic and it can be inorganic, if it matches our principles and our goals. And we're going to return cash to shareholders and we're doing that now both through our share repurchase program and our dividend program. Now on the inorganic perspective, as you brought up, we're always going to be opportunistic. M&A has been an incredible part of our past. I'm sure at the right time will be part of our future. But it's got to fit into the framework that we have been outlining for the last few days. We're going to have to have a time line to value accretion. We're going to need to prioritize our use of the balance sheet and it's got to be a best-in-class asset. And when all that comes together, that's what we'll be focused on. In the meantime, I really want to talk about our goal, we are trying to optimize shareholder value. At the end of the day, that's the single most important element. And we're doing that by focusing on delivering very strong free cash flow per share. We're doing this by our focus on profitable growth and by very carefully managing our dilution. And when you bring that together, I am very confident in our long term free cash flow per share opportunity and very confident about our capital allocation strategy overall. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Obviously, this quarter was impacted on the booking side. Maybe a question for Brian and Amy here. If you think about the two factors you pointed out, one is the economy, one is the -- on the sales changes at the beginning of the year. On the economy side, like we've been talking about a tough selling environment for a while now. Has it gotten worse from what you've seen or is it -- are the issues this quarter more coming from the sales reorg? Brian Millham : Hard to parse apart what the two impacts were in our first quarter, no doubt about it. We did have some changes that I outlined in the quarter as we set ourselves up for productivity in FY25. The economy question, I think, is one that we feel like it's similar to what we felt in the first half of last year, the same measured buying environment that we experienced in the first half is sort of what felt like the same in Q1. We came off a Q4 that was very solid, very, very strong performance. In retrospect and hindsight, we may have been in a similar environment, but executed very well as the sales team in that fourth quarter. So hard to really parse apart these things. But when you look at some of the transactions that we saw in Q1, we saw a compression on many deals that we ultimately ended up getting done, but they got smaller when we ultimately closed them. We saw a couple of deals push out of the quarter as people delayed decisions that were -- that we thought would actually happen in our first quarter. And there's no decision issue, it\u2019s coming up more frequently than we anticipated. So hard to really parse those two things apart. But when you combine them both in a particular quarter, it can have an impact of lower bookings, and that's what we felt in our first quarter. Marc Benioff : I think I'd also like to add, and I'll just give you a little color on the narrative inside our company. When we look at operating inside this environment, which we've been now going through for a couple of years and we look at, hey, how do we continue to deliver these strong ACV numbers, but also how do we continue to deliver the overall strong financial metrics. At the same time, it's important that we're delivering this high level of customer success to prepare for our future growth. It's really along three lines. And those three lines, first of all, is we are just having to start every quarter with much higher pipelines. We look at these pipeline multiples as much higher than we've traditionally had to start with. And this is really critical in managing our distribution organization and overall success in the quarter. And where traditionally, we might have to start our pipelines at 2 times, now our message to our distribution leaders is, hey, if you're going to start out your pipeline in the quarter, you better start out at 3 times. And this is also our message to our peers as well to evaluate the pipeline much more aggressively than ever before, that means a much deeper inspection of the pipeline but holding it at a much higher level. That is evidence of this environment. And if you would ask any leader in this company, how many times they've heard from me or from Brian that they better started at a 3 times pipeline, because that is the world that we're in today. The second attribute that's incredibly important for all of our leaders in our company or throughout our industry is you might need a much higher level of enablement. What that means is so many people have come into our industry in the last five or even 10 years, a lot of them just need the level of training, capability, especially as we move into this new area of artificial intelligence, Generative AI, data, the kind of capabilities that we're talking about when we explain to people how models work, how UIs work, how data frameworks work and how it works in regards to our software and our platforms and our architectures, that is requiring a level of training that is incredibly important. And when we're talking about companies at scale like Salesforce who have very significant numbers of sales people, I\u2019m not going to go into all of the details of how it's organized and how many we have. But just know that, that requires a very high level of enablement and that's the second key attribute managing this framework -- in this environment. And the third is a level of stability. Now when you enter the first quarter of any fiscal year, there always is going to be a desire of every sales organization to slightly shift, slightly adjust their strategy and their organization to reflect the demand for the fiscal year, you start the fiscal year writing your business plan, thinking about how you're going to execute. And then you have to look at, how much disruption are you able to tolerate in the quarter? Because if you over shift, if you do too much, you will end up with more volatility in the quarter in the ACV than you like. Now it may result in a better fourth quarter. A good example is last year, where we saw, okay, in the first quarter, we might not have achieved exactly everything we wanted because we had too much disruption, but by the fourth quarter, we overdelivered. So there is a level of balance that has to be achieved in regards to stability and disruption. And those four attributes having 3 times pipelines, having much higher levels of enablement and having much level -- higher levels of stability, that is the key to managing in this environment in this part of the industry right now. And when I talk to my peers and other major enterprise software companies, that is what I'm really emphasizing to them. And for all of them, of course, it's good if they're using our products because our products are really the key to making all of that happen because we're able to deliver for these companies all of those things that they need to have that level of success as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Marc and team, actually looking at the Salesforce Tower from my office here. And I'm thinking about the past. Marc, you've been through all these cycles before. Maybe it's just cyclical, maybe high interest rates causing economic uncertainty, maybe it's as simple as that, or maybe it's structural. And if it's structural, maybe there's an architectural change going on. And Marc, you drove the last big architectural change from distributed computing to internet computing. And how confident you are that this generative AI, which is causing an upheaval in that whole tech stack is not something to take lightly? And what are the things that the company is preparing if it's not just cyclical or maybe there\u2019s structural change that's going on, what are the things that you are doing to the company to bulletproof, because typically, people incumbents miss big transitions, right? You and I have seen that, we've all seen that. And one of the things you're doing to ensure that, you're bulletproof in that regard that you're absolutely ready architecturally for the next cycle. Marc Benioff : Well, I will just say -- I'd like to make a couple of comments on that. I think that, number one, it's been pretty magical to use OpenAI over the last year, especially in the last release where I'm really talking to it. And when I think about the incredible engineering effort that OpenAI has done, it's pretty awesome. They've built a great UI. I love talking to the software. They have really strong algorithms or what we call models, especially their new one, which is their 40 model. And then they source data from lots of companies like Time, Dow Jones, New York Times, Reddit. Now they're all making good, doing agreements with all of us saying, we're sorry and paying for it. And they took that data, they normalized it, they delivered a comprehensive data set that they train their model on. And all of us understand that that's what they did, right? They have the great UI, they have this amazing model and then they have the data. And then we've seen a lot of fast followers with the models, it could be open source models like Lama 3. It could be some proprietary models like Gemini from Google and others. Now there's thousands and thousands of these models. And if you look on Hugging Face, everybody is a fast follower and six months later, everybody is where everybody else was six months ago. And the data, well, a lot of these companies are all thinking they can rip off all this data to and they're all having to pay that price. Okay, that's the consumer world. The enterprise world is a little different, right? We have great user interfaces, great apps, all kinds of great technology that our users are using, the millions and millions of users, than we have the same models in many cases or maybe we've written some of our own models with our engineers. But then the third piece is the data. And that data is a little bit different. Because in the enterprise, how do you put together these large, fully normalized data sets to deliver this incredible capability, and that is where the magic is going to be. Because for all companies, including ours and others who want to deploy generative AI internally, it's not going to be Times Magazine that's going to give you the intelligence, it's going to be our customer data and your transaction history and how you're -- how your company operates in your workflow and your metadata. And that idea that we can deliver another level of productivity for companies using that architecture is absolutely in front of us. But that idea that we have to do it with the right architecture that also is in front of us. And I think that while we can say it's a different kind of architecture, it's still the same idea that we need a great UI, we need models, but we're going to need very highly normalized and federated data. And that data needs to be stored somewhere and it needs to come from somewhere. And it's going to -- that is going to be something that's going to continue in perpetuity over time as these models and UIs are quite fungible. And we'll be using different models and different UIs over the years, but we'll be using the same data sources. And I think that is why when I look at what Salesforce is doing, this is going to be critical for our customers. Now you may see great new UIs like agents and you may see great new UIs like you see what we've deployed with Slack. Brian was talking about how he's changed how we use Slack with our new Slack AI or what we've done with SFA this quarter or service this quarter with the incredible new generative capabilities. But this idea that the data is going to be more important for companies than ever, having deeply normalized federated data sources. And when I look at the success we've had with so many of these companies, I mentioned State Farm, briefly, we've become their fundamental data architecture, that is not where we were with that company even four years ago. Now they look at us as the fundamental framework for their future. And as they want to deploy agents or as they want to deploy new user interfaces or achieve more productivity, the data that they have in Salesforce and the ability to manage and share, keep that data reliable, available and scalable, the way that we do updates that we don't bring down our system, do an upgrade and an update like a lot of vendors still do, those kind of capabilities, that will be more important than ever. And I think that, that is going to be a huge driver for our growth going forward and provide the foundation for this future and what the future of the enterprise is going to look like. And I think it's a little bit different than in the consumer model. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Marc, you mentioned that there's a transformation of how we interact with software that's happening. And I'm curious, if you sense any temporary pause as customers may be trying to digest the new innovations, the new pricing mechanisms, it includes consumption pricing. And that perhaps there's going to be a pause that refreshes down the road as they'll ultimately gain comfort and start to move forward with the Einstein Copilots and all the other innovations that require a little bit of a different architecture, a different thought process? Marc Benioff : Well, I think it's a very key question, which is Salesforce is managing many different kinds of pricing models, obviously, like our Data Cloud is a consumption product. We've seen a clear path now to over $1 billion in revenue with that product, it uses consumption pricing. We look at our core SFA product, which is a product doing, I don't know, approximately $8 billion a year or Service Cloud doing approximately $8 billion a year. These are per user prices. But when you buy Salesforce now and you're buying our products, you might be buying a new product that we have called UE+. And that's a product that we just introduced a few months ago. Now why is that exciting? Because UE+ is a hybrid pricing model that includes per user pricing and consumption pricing. It delivers for our customers the ability to deploy all the architectures that I articulated on the call today, but to do it in an incredibly competitive price point. And when we look at the very large customers that are deploying Salesforce, standardizing on our platform to deliver this kind of capability for the future as we retrain our sales people to be able to have the narrative that I have on the call today, this idea that we can deliver basically not only the number one AI CRM, not only deliver -- we see these incredible growth in our pipelines, as I mentioned, not only the kind of the next generation price points and products like with UE+, but we have to deliver it with a level of customer success through our partners and the implementations at scale and also with the culture that Salesforce is known for. Those are really the five elements that we are really taking into consideration as we're moving forward. We think that we have the right mix and we're spending a lot of time talking to our customers very, very closely, look at -- don't think that there aren't a lot of people walking into these companies saying, hey, you can do this, you can do that, you can do these other things. We've seen a lot of that in the last six to 12 months, and then it turns out that you can't. Hey, I can make this happen, I can make that happen. I can pull a rabbit out of the hat in the enterprise for you by doing this, that and the other thing and then it doesn't actually happen. And then what it turns out is, you got to do a lot of the hard work to make this AI happen, and that starts with building highly normalized, large scale, federated, highly available data sources. And then building on top of that the kind of capabilities to deliver it to our customers. I think a common story is, hey, oh, yes, I am a provider of a data lake or a data capability. And just by going to that, I'm going to be able to provide all your AI. But then it turns out that no one in the enterprise actually uses that product. There is no UI that's commonly access. That's why I'm so excited that Salesforce is Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, and Tableau, and Slack, and all of our amazing products that have these huge numbers of users that use these products every single day in a trusted, scalable way and then connecting that in to this new capability, that's where the magic is going to happen. By the time we get to Dreamforce, and for those of you who maybe were at our Connections Conference or our last World Tour in New York or even in Trailhead DX, we haven't heard gasps in the audience when we demoed the products, I think maybe ever, like some of the new technology is incredible we're able to deliver for our customers. And I think that it's going to be extremely exciting going forward, and it will be delivered with a variety of new business models and pricing models. But at the end of the day, we're going to have to be a trusted partner to these customers delivering this AI at scale. Mike Spencer : Great. We want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and we look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
